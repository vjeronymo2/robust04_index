			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several of the uses suggested by the comments are related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general category of patient preoperative skin preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was discussed by the Panel. (See the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33103 and 33114.) One example is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use ``patient skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency believes that this use can more simply be described by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication ``for preparation of the skin prior to surgery,'' which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is being proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(i) of this tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph. Other uses are catheter care, ostomy hygiene, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intravenous site preparation. Some uses mentioned by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments involve postoperative situations (surgical site cleansing after stitching) or do not even involve a surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure (treatment of skin prior to covering a fracture with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cast or use as a whirlpool concentrate). The agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that instead of trying to identify in the product's labeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every possible situation where use of the product would reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk of skin infection, this use of the product can best be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described by the general indication ``Helps to reduce bacteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that potentially can cause skin infection,'' which is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in &sect;333.460(b)(1)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has considered the term ``for hospital and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional use only'' suggested by one comment and finds it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable for professional labeling. (See section I.D., comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.) Likewise, the agency has no objection to terms such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``germicide,'' ``germicidal,'' and ``microbicidal'' being used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional labeling because health professionals understand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of these terms. However, the agency does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a need to include in the monograph every one of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms that might be used in the professional labeling of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. These terms will be evaluated by the agency on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product-by-product basis, under the provision of section 502 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Comments on Quaternary Ammonium Compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 20. One comment requested that benzalkonium chloride be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in Category I as a skin antiseptic, a patient preoperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin preparation, and a skin wound protectant, in addition to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present Category I classification as a skin wound cleanser. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support of its request, the comment cited several surgery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> textbooks and other references that recommend use of benzalkonium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloride at concentrations ranging from 1:750 to 1:5,000 as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparation, surgical scrub, skin antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for venipuncture, and in urinary tract procedures, especially in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catheterized patients (Ref. 1). The comment also submitted two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies on a product containing benzalkonium chloride at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of 1:1,000: (1) An in vitro study to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this product formulation acts as a physical chemical barrier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against contamination by micro-organisms, and (2) a study on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> induced wounds on the arms of 10 healthy subjects to present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that this product is nonirritating and neither delays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> healing nor favors the growth of micro-organisms (Ref. 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency determined in the tentative final monograph for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that the safe and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective concentration range for using benzalkonium chloride as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a first aid antiseptic has been established as 0.1 percent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.13 percent. (See 56 FR 33644 and 33663.) Data submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Antimicrobial I Panel and by the comment were sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish safety for products intended for short-term use, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a first aid antiseptic drug product. The data submitted also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support safety for use as a patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, based on the short-term use of the drug for this purpose. However, the data reviewed by the Panel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemented by the comments to establish the efficacy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzalkonium chloride for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in patient preoperative skin preparations are not sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Antimicrobial I Panel placed this ingredient in Category III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this use. (See 39 FR 33103 and 33115.) The agency finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surgery textbooks and other references cited by the comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 1) do not contain sufficient information about quantitative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and qualitative changes in the microbial flora of the treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin areas. Before benzalkonium chloride may be generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarded as effective for use as a patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, additional in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are needed. The data should include results obtained from both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See section I.N.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 28.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, benzalkonium chloride remains classified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category III as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient preoperative skin preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Comment No. C116, Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Review of Scientific Literature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Safety and Effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zephiran Chloride&eacute; as a ``Skin Antiseptic'' and ``Patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preoperative Skin Preparation''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the Preoperative Cleansing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Degerming Before Surgery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Use of Medical Devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Unpublished Clinical Wound Healing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Studies on Medi-Quik&eacute;, Comment No. SUP13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Statistical Analysis of Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Efficacy Study of Medi-Quik as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Skin Wound Protectant in Humans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Studies on Medi-Quik as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a Wound Protectant.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign minister denies that there has been any  protest from the Iranian Government concerning Thailand's arrest  of Iranian nationals charged with preparing to sabotage the  Israeli Embassy. Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri said that the Thai ambassador to Iran was invited to a  meeting at which Iran asked Thailand to facilitate a visit with  the arrested suspects by Iranian Embassy officials. Iran also  asked that inquiries into the case be accelerated. The foreign  minister thinks there should be no affect on bilateral relations:    [Begin Prasong recording] There is no problem; they can  visit  the suspects if they want to see them. Those people were  arrested by our authorities because they committed offenses in  Thailand. They have to undergo the process of investigation by  our authorities. If they have relatives or lawyers, they can  visit them. The suspects are not protected by diplomatic  immunity and must be prosecuted. [end recording]    Police General Phong-amat Amatayakun, acting police director  general, said that officials from the Iranian Embassy are  entitled to seek information on the arrests. They can visit the  suspects on the condition that such a move would not distort the  case. It is the privilege of diplomats to take care of their  own people.</p>

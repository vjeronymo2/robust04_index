			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> SURGEONS REMOVE BISHOP'S TUMOR  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher, who drew widespread attention when he  banned a pro-choice political candidate from receiving Communion last year, was  in serious condition after surgery to remove a brain tumor. Maher, 74, was  alert and able to talk soon after the 2 1/2-hour operation at Scripps Clinic.  </P> <P> Doctors said they were optimistic he would recover, but expressed concern about  the possible recurrence of the life-threatening tumor. Maher, who oversees the  462,000-member diocese encompassing San Diego and Imperial counties, may be  released from the hospital in four to seven days, a Scripps spokeswoman said.  Dr. Thomas Waltz, who led the operating team, said doctors removed 75% to 80%  of the tumor, which was about 3 inches in diameter. "It's a tumor that you  really can't classify as either malignant or benign," Waltz said. "It doesn't  spread to other parts of the body. But it can recur."  </P></p>

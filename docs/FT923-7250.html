			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Experience in greater demand Sir, We agree with Mr Kevin Goldstein-Jackson's comments (Diary of a Private Investor, August 8) that current practices in relation to the selection and appointment of non-executive directors are not entirely satisfactory. The IoD's experience is that there has been a change in the specifications for non-executive directors drawn up by more enlightened chairmen. The demand now is for experienced, competent executives who know the tough action that has to be taken when a business begins to decline. Since Mr Goldstein-Jackson joined the IoD's non-executive director register in November, it has almost doubled. It now has many people of considerable ability, including a growing number of women, all of whom are seeking independent directorships. In a market where only 27 per cent of these appointments are placed with outside agencies, the competition is considerable. Having said that, we are happy to have someone of Mr Goldstein-Jackson's calibre on our register and will not hesitate to recommend him when the opportunity arises. Peter Morgan, Institute of Directors</p>

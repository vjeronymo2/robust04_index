			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Engineer Muhammad al-Ghamrawi, </F> minister of state for war production, by Jamal Kamal; place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] Kamal: Why is there interest in  developing and enhancing the war industry when Egypt, the  region, and the world are embarking on a new stage of peace in  which certain restrictions are being imposed to control  armaments and producing countries that monopolize on weapons  production are calling for restrictions on the transfer of arms  production technology?    Al-Ghamrawi: I have been asked these questions  many times, even by people working in war production. I always  answered with another question: Why should the Armed Forces be  maintained and why should there be a constant call for  developing and upgrading these forces?    If peace is the goal a state seeks to achieve and maintain  to  curb political and military tension and therefore provide more  favorable conditions for best use of its resources to enhance  the state's strength and enable it to continue its march toward  progress, there must be a power to protect that peace. A  general rule in the military, though, says that if you want  peace you should be ready for war. Whoever advocates peace and  tries to protect it through his own weakness would be signing  his own death warrant. It is wrong to think that peace means  doing away with or reducing the numbers of the armed forces  because they are no longer needed for pursuing the state's  national interests. The truth is that the lack of power makes  the state a prey for ambitious persons and vulnerable to various  risks at all times. This creates domestic instability and  directly affects development plans. [passage omitted]    Kamal: But there are international calls to  control armaments and curb the expansion of war production.  Steps have actually been taken to prevent the export of arms  production technology.    Al-Ghamrawi: What is being said about controlling  armaments or curbing expansion in military production is meant  to make the various forms of war production exclusive to a group  of states that monopolize it and control its prices.    The best evidence of this can be found in the fact that the  major states' arms exports to the Third World in two years alone  exceeded arms exports for 10 years. Besides, what does armament  control have to do with developing your military industry, if  your goal is to satisfy the needs of your Armed Forces and  develop the equipment they already have? Developing the  military industry does not mean exporting it or trading in it in  a way that undermines stability. [passage omitted]    Kamal: What is the major goal behind the  development of the Egyptian military industry?    Al-Ghamrawi: The goal is to enhance the ties  between the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of  Defense, which is the main user of military products. In other  words, we want to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and  to link our plan for production to the Armed Forces' armament  plan. [passage omitted]    Kamal: How can Egyptian military production be  developed while there are restrictions on the transfer of arms  production technology?    Al-Ghamrawi: This is an important issue that forms  a large part of the new development strategy. This strategy is  based on a new reading of the actual situation and on developing  a new vision to cope with that situation.    Egypt's moderate policy and its belief in mutual interests  and interrelation has helped it acquire many technologies  without fear of abusing them. Egypt succeeded in acquiring the  latest technologies from the United States, France, and some  East European states. Our moderation provides us with the  needed grounds to obtain what we want.    As for our vision, it is based on two main factors:    1. To utilize what we already have.    2. To develop and update what we already have and conduct  further research. [passage omitted]  Kamal: What are the markets for Egyptian weapons  under the current international competition?    Al-Ghamrawi: The Arab and African states. I think  that with some political effort we can find the best marketing  formula so that the revenue can be spent on developing the  weapons.    Kamal: Do you think it is possible in the current  situation in the Arab world to establish an Arab military  industry?    Al-Ghamrawi: I still believe that Arab states have  many capabilities to cooperate in military industry without  fear. We are capable of entering the sphere of military  production with products that meet international levels.    Kamal: Why do foreign papers attack the M-1 tank  factory every now and then?    Al-Ghamrawi: The Egyptian factory for the  production and repair of armored vehicles-which began with the  production of the U.S. M-1 tank--was a considerable addition to  the power of Egyptian military production. It is one of the  most modern military factories built in the world recently.  Military industries are always questioned and are subjected to  attacks every now and then. It seems that Egypt's and its  workers' success in building the factory and absorbing the tank  manufacturing technology, the peak of military technologies,  frightens some people. But we will go on with the project  according to plan.    Kamal: But the project will be completed in 1997.  Does this mean that the production license will be withdrawn  and the factory closed?    Al-Ghamrawi: There is no such thing as withdrawing  a production license. The hypothetical shelf life of the tank  is 20 to 25 years. Tanks in general need overhauls,  maintenance, and development. The M-1 tank we are manufacturing  is only a developed version of the M-60-A-3. There is also the  M-1-A-2. Moreover, can anyone take back from you the technology  you have learned?    We started the overhauling of the M-60-A-3 in the factory  and  we will start the overhauling of the M-1. We are studying how  to meet new demands. A joint study is under way with the Armed  Forces to select an armored combat vehicle to be manufactured in  the factory.    Kamal: Since the 122-mm and 130-mm guns were  manufactured, the Egyptian artillery factory has not produced  new pieces of artillery. Why?    Al-Ghamrawi: We obtained a license to manufacture  the 120-mm barrel of the M-1 tank in the artillery factory.  This is one of the latest technologies in the world and it is  different from that of ordinary artillery. There is also a  project to produce the strategic steel needed for the artillery  industry in the factory.    Kamal: Some foreign newspapers once in a while  report that Egypt is producing chemical weapons.    Al-Ghamrawi: We have an established and unchanging  principle: We do not manufacture any type of chemical weapons.  We only manufacture the equipment needed to protect ourselves  against these weapons.    Kamal: Some people talk about the need to  privatize military production.    Al-Ghamrawi: Privatizing the war industry is out  of the question. Like the Armed Forces, war production is one  of the elements of Egyptian power and national security. If it  is not possible to buy security from any state, then war  production cannot be sold. Privatization is unsuitable for war  production. [passage omitted]</p>

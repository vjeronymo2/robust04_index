			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: FKI improves 19% to Pounds 16m FKI, the electrical engineering group, reversed its profits decline with a 19 per cent interim increase from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 16m before tax. Four of its five divisions made progress and interest costs were cut. The share price gained 6p to close at 88p, the highest level since early 1990. A year ago FKI announced the halving of its interim pre-tax profit and dividend and the resignation of its chief executive. The board has since been strengthened by the recruitment as managing director of Mr Bob Beeston from BTR. Turnover in the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 371.1m to Pounds 332.2m, while operating profit reached Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 18.5m). The previous year's figures included Pounds 20.1m sales and Pounds 800,000 profit arising from different rates of exchange; 53 per cent of sales lie in North America. Ongoing businesses raised their operating profit contribution from Pounds 16.7m to Pounds 18.8m at constant exchange rates. Interest costs fell from Pounds 5m to Pounds 2.8m. Debt was cut from Pounds 60m in March to Pounds 50m in September. Mr Beeston has set a target of getting a 10 per cent return on sales across the group. He said that an average of 9.6 per cent had been achieved at subsidiaries accounting for nearly two thirds of sales. 'We have to get the rest right.' Process control was the only division to go backwards with operating profit falling from Pounds 5.87m to Pounds 3.7m on sales of Pounds 82.5m (Pounds 95.6m). It included two loss-makers in computer peripherals and cutting tools. Material handling improved profit from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 4.54m on sales of Pounds 82m (Pounds 85.8m). Two North American loss-makers had been brought back to profit. One area of concern was British Coal's pit closure plan which could cost Pounds 8m sales next year. Hardware, virtually all in North America, improved operating profit by 10 per cent to Pounds 7.1m in spite of adverse exchange rates on same-again sales of Pounds 62.5m. The automotive division was returned to a Pounds 218,000 profit from a Pounds 614,000 loss on Pounds 62.8m (Pounds 66.7m) sales. It had suffered some disruption after factory closures but should experience a better second half, Mr Beeston said. Engineering, UK-based and mainly supplying niche markets, raised profit by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m with the help of export growth. Earnings per share rose to 2.65p (2.2p) and the interim dividend goes up to 1.2p (1p). COMMENT Results at the top end of expectations and a welcome revival of the dividend confirmed the view that the revamped management has taken the group by the scruff of the neck. It still has its work cut out to increase operating margins from less than 6 to 10 per cent, and further refining of the group through disposals is part of the plan. The itch to acquire is also there, although the paint is still a bit wet on the new-found credibility to allow it to do anything big just yet. Signs of recovery in the US should help progress to continue. Pre-tax profit is forecast to recover from Pounds 30.5m to Pounds 37m-Pounds 38m for the full year, giving a prospective p/e of just over 14 which looks about right after a substantial re-rating this year.</p>

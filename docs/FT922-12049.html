			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Russia leads world in road death figures RUSSIA, a late starter in the age of the car, has roared to a leading place in the world's statistics for road deaths, Reuters reports from Moscow. Authorities said yesterday that Russia's traffic carnage matches its size as the world's biggest country. Sixteen out of every 100 people injured in car crashes die, Mr Vladimir Fyodorov, head of the Interior Ministry Traffic Police Department, told a news conference. The figure is several times higher than the 2 to 7 per cent average for the rest of the world. But Mr Fyodorov said a lower proportion of Russians were injured in non-fatal car accidents. 'Accident reports in the west usually show large numbers of crashes with very few people killed. With us, it's the other way round,' he said. 'We are falling far behind the civilised world in traffic security.' Traffic police analysis shows that 0.14 per cent of the Russian population were injured in car crashes last year. Comparative figures for west European countries show a higher 0.5 per cent. But 0.025 per cent of Russians are killed in the accidents, compared with only 0.016 in western Europe. Mr Fyodorov blamed the extremely high death rate on poor road conditions, an inadequate ambulance service and lack of modern communications. 'We sometimes get news of a traffic accident from passing drivers hours after it happened,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 23 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  will step up its campaign on the use of palm oil among the  people of China, which is the second largest importer and  consumer of Malaysian palm oil, Malaysian Palm Oil Promotion  Council chief executive Dr. Yusof Hashim said Thursday.    He said China, which imports 769,454 tonnes of palm, had  potential to overtake Pakistan as the biggest consumer of palm  oil in the world in view of its large population.    He (?told) a press conference that a three-week mission  would  be sent to Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong next month to explain  the uses and advantages of palm oil.    He believed the mission would be successful because the use  of palm oil in China was currently confined to making noodles  and soap.    Palm oil is not sold as cooking oil in China. The campaign  will concentrate on the housewives and if it is successful, the  use of palm oil will increase manifold, he said.    Dr. Yusof also said that Indonesia was expected to rival  Malaysia as the biggest palm oil producer in world by the year  2010 when its production caught up with Malaysia's at 10 million  tonnes. Malaysia produced 7.4 million tonnes last year and 7.5  million tonnes this year.    However, this would not affect Malaysia's exports as most of  the Indonesian production was for local consumption and the  world demand for palm oil was increasing yearly, he said.    On the anti-palm oil campaign in the United States, he said  the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) had extended by three  months to Aug 28 the deadline to remove the no palm oil lable on  cans and foodstuff.    He said consumers in the U.S. had now changed their attitude  and were beginning to try out palm oil while some big fast-food  chains like Burger King in Florida had asked for samples for  trial tests.</p>

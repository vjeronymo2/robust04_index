			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Murders set to bring passions to the boil: Stefan Wagstyl and Mervyn de Silva report from Colombo IN HIS last speech before being killed by a terrorist bomb at the weekend, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa of Sri Lanka issued a grim challenge to his political enemies: 'Assassinate me by whatever means but please do not assassinate my character.' Such is the violent nature of Sri Lankan politics that the president's fatal wish was fulfilled during a May Day parade last Saturday. A tough street-fighting populist, who preferred village life to mixing with the elite of Colombo, Mr Premadasa died, as he had lived, milling with a crowd. The president was assassinated by a suicide bomber just over a week after one of his main political rivals, Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, was shot dead at an election rally. The prime suspects for both killings are the Tamil Tigers, the common name for the LTTE separatist movement which has been fighting for more than a decade for a homeland in northern Sri Lanka for the minority Tamil community, in defiance of the majority Singhalese. Although the LTTE has denied responsibility, police say the evidence seems to point to the Tigers. Whether or not the Tigers were responsible, the assassinations raise serious questions about Sri Lanka's future political stability. If violence spreads it could undermine the hard-won economic success that has made Sri Lanka's living standards the envy of other developing nations. A crucial test will be how Sri Lankans behave on Thursday at the president's public funeral in Colombo and at provincial assembly elections due later this month. As Mr Gamini Dissanayake, a close associate of Mr Athulathmudali, says: 'The assassination of both the president and Mr Athulathmudali add up to a national crisis. It sends entirely the wrong signals to the world.' Much will depend on how Sri Lanka's politicians react. Mr Premadasa was an authoritarian ruler whose departure leaves a vacuum at the top of the ruling UNP party. He came from a poor background and was regarded as an outsider by the political elite, such as Mr Athulathmudali, a former president of the Oxford Union. But the UNP could not afford to do without Mr Premadasa's rapport with the island's rural masses. Mr Premadasa became president in 1988 at a low point in the UNP's fortunes, just after the signing of an unpopular agreement with India which let India put 60,000 troops into Sri Lanka to try to tame the Tamil Tigers. Many Singhalese showed their resentment by supporting an armed nationalist insurgency. Mr Premadasa was judged by UNP chiefs to be the only man to win back the disaffected Singhalese. He largely succeeded, primarily by securing departure of the Indian troops, though also with some tough repressive measures against the insurgents. He also gave strong impetus to a long-running economic reform programme. He pushed ahead with privatisation, cut import tariffs and overhauled the financial markets in a bold effort to open Sri Lanka to domestic competition and foreign investment. The economy grew at an average annual rate of 5 per cent in the three years to 1992 - a creditable achievement given the cost of the war against the LTTE. Foreign investment soared from under Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) a year in the mid-1980s to around Dollars 200m last year. However, the price of success was a revolt in the UNP, led by Mr Athulathmudali, who led a breakaway group which tried to impeach Mr Premadasa. They failed last year, resigned their seats to create a new party, the DUNF, which claimed to be the true inheritor of UNP ideals. The split left the way open for a revival in the fortunes of an alliance of socialist opposition parties headed by the SLFP, led by the veteran former prime minister, Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, matriarch of a leading political family whose own husband had also been murdered when prime minister (in 1959). A month ago, Mrs Bandaranaike was poised to do well in the forthcoming provincial election. Then, Mr Athulathmudali's death created sympathy for the DUNF. Now, the ruling UNP hopes for a boost. In Colombo yesterday, white flags, signs of mourning for the president, fluttered around many buildings; but earlier, fire-crackers had been set off in some districts to celebrate his departure. A senior government official said yesterday the UNP had rallied around Mr D B Wijetunga, the acting president. He said Mr Wijetunga would now have little difficulty securing a parliamentary majority allowing him to stay in office until the end of Mr Premadasa's term in December, 1994. Whether or not they carried out the killings, the LTTE could profit from the confusion. A caretaker government is unlikely to give as strong leadership to the fight against the Tamils as Mr Premadasa. Also, Mr Premadasa advocated a two-prong policy of armed action coupled with tentative efforts at political dialogue. The senior official said the new government may now face a backlash from Singhalese demanding revenge against the Tigers. Such demand could play into the LTTE's hands by reviving international concern about the Tamils - not least from India.</p>

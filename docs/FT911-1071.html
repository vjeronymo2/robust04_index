			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Observer: Outbreak One of the nastiest words being bandied about in the recession is the Americanism 'outplacement', denoting counselling services supposed to improve sacked people's chances of getting new jobs. And disliking it, London headhunter John Courtis has been seeking suggestions for a better term. Instead of producing a substitute, however, his contacts have come up with a rash of variations on the outplacement theme, including: Outboard - services for fired directors. Outhouse - counselling firm's office. Outpatient - someone sacked but stoical. Ausgang - redundancy victims in Germany.</p>

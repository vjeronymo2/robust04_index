			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Brussels in push to boost recovery of packaging EUROPEAN industry would get 10 years to increase the proportion of waste packaging it recovers from around 18 per cent now to 90 per cent, under a plan proposed by the Brussels Commission yesterday. The EC produces some 50m tonnes of waste packaging a year. Yesterday's draft directive, which must win approval from EC governments, aims to cut the large share of this which gets pushed untreated into landfills, and the growing number of purely national curbs on packaging that threaten to create barriers to trade in the single EC market. Unveiling the long-awaited plan, Mr Karel Van Miert, recently made responsible for the environment in the EC Commission, said that, if the draft directive were adopted, most change would be needed in the south of Europe where public sensitivity to the environment is less. In the north, Denmark would have to drop its ban on aluminium drink cans and let them be recycled. The Commission was still examining last year's German law making manufacturers and retailers responsible for getting rid of waste packaging, Mr Van Miert said. But he believed that Germany might drop restrictions on the burning of packaging, which would be partially permitted under the EC proposal. 'We don't want to put spokes in the wheels of those countries such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands which are in the vanguard of dealing with waste packaging.' Sensitive at possible charges of Brussels' interference, particularly while the Maastricht union treaty remains unratified, Mr Van Miert stressed member states would be left free on how to meet the targets that would only become legally binding after a decade. The European Recovery and Recycling Association (ERRA), a grouping of 31 major companies involved in packaging materials, consumer products and retailing, yesterday welcomed the draft directive 'as a first step to avoid packaging restrictions being used by countries, or even regions, to wreak havoc with the single market'. As at present drafted, the EC plan would require that 90 per cent of total packaging waste, half of which is produced by households and the rest by business and industry, would have to be disposed of by recycling, composting or burning. At least 60 per cent of the total would have to be recycled into fresh packaging or other materials. ERRA warned that the plastics industry would find it hard to meet this latter target. Plastic wrapping and film had now been reduced to very fine proportions, helping reduce packaging weight. Collecting and cleaning this up for recycling would be difficult and costly. One element in the plan would be to harmonise the labelling of packaging for the benefit of consumers, waste collectors and recyclers throughout the Community.</p>

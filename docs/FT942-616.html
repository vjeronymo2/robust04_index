			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Del Monte Foods changes hands in Dollars 1bn transaction Del Monte Foods, one of the world's largest food processors, is to be acquired by Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, the Mexican chairman of Del Monte Fresh Produce, the tropical-fruit trading company, and a group of investors in a transaction worth about Dollars 1bn. Mr Cabal and his partners will pay Dollars 277m in cash for Del Monte Foods, and re-finance about Dollars 700m of debt. The transaction is set to be finalised by mid-September, with most of the financing expected to be obtained from a syndicate of international banks. Del Monte Fresh Produce and Del Monte Foods, which is owned by a group of investors including Citibank and Merrill Lynch, used to be part of the Del Monte company, which was broken up in to four parts and sold off in 1989 by RJR Nabisco of the US. Mr Cabal plans to re-merge the two companies, according to an official familiar with his plans. Del Monte Foods is based in San Francisco, although it has operations in Mexico, Central America and the Philippines. It processes vegetables, fruits, tomatoes and snack foods, and last year had revenues of Dollars 1.6bn. Del Monte Fresh Produce, which markets and sells tropical fruit and vegetables, had revenues of more than Dollars 300m in the first quarter this year. A previous attempt by Mr Cabal to buy Del Monte Foods fell through earlier this year. Mr Cabal decided to buy Del Monte Foods both to obtain synergies from merging it with Fresh Produce, and also to give him more control of the Del Monte brand, according to a spokesman. 'Del Monte has a terrific brand,' said the spokesman 'and he intends to build on it.'</p>

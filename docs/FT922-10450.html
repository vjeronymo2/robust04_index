			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (14): Important principles - Thailand: Other sectors ALTHOUGH the most urgent and spectacular infrastructure projects in Thailand are the proposed mass transit systems and expressways aimed at alleviating Bangkok's traffic problems, many billions of dollars are likely to be spent on other sectors of this rapidly growing economy before the end of the century. The Thai planning authorities have expressed two important principles in infrastructural development: decentralis ation, to bring economic benefits to the countryside and reduce the pressure on the capital; and commercialisation, or the involvement of the private sector in services which were once the preserve of the state. 'For state enterprises we want to be more commercialised, and then privatised if we can,' said Mr Sansern Wongcha-um, director of the infrastructure projects division at the National Economic and Social Development Board. The commercialisation process, pushed forward by the reforming government of Mr Anand Panyarachun, is already under way. Among the most important projects are: The new airport of Nong Ngu Hao. The existing Don Muang airport suffers from a shortage of aircraft parking space at peak times and is linked to the city centre by one of the most congested roads in Thailand. A consortium of six companies has been chosen by the Airports Authority of Thailand to do consultancy work on the new airport, which will cost an estimated Bt70bn. Total investment could reach Bt200bn if related infrastructure projects are included. Expansion of the telephone network. The state-controlled telephone system is notoriously bureaucratic and has failed to keep pace with Thailand's economic growth. There is a waiting list of about 1m in Bangkok and 700,000 in the provinces. In an attempt to meet demand, the Telephone Organisation of Thailand signed a contract this year for 2m new lines in the Bangkok area with Telecomasia, a company dominated by the Charoen Pokphand (CP) group, in partnership with Nynex of the US. A contract for a further 1m lines in the provinces had yet to be awarded at the time of writing. At the moment there are only three telephones per 100 people in Thailand (but 15 per 100 in Bangkok). Even if the CP project is finished in five years, said Mr Sansern, Thailand would only reach a level of 8.5 per 100, or the equivalent of Malaysia today. A proposed 'land bridge' across the southern isthmus of Kra; part of the plan to develop the southern seaboard. The idea is to link the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand with a pipeline, a railway, a four- to six-lane highway and large ports on either side, saving ships the long journey round peninsular Malaysia. The State Railway of Thailand, meanwhile, is also examining other plans for new lines and improvements. Waste water treatment. Only 2 per cent of Bangkok's residents are connected to sewage treatment facilities. 'It's a new thing in Thailand,' says Mr Sansern. There are plans valued at some Bt30bn under which private companies will build large plants in Bangkok to be operated under management contracts. The potential for new plants throughout the country is very large. Electricity generation. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is generally regarded as one of the more efficient state enterprises but there are plans to start privatising it in order to release funds for further capacity expansion.</p>

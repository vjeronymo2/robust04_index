			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Politics, economics raise Hong Kong to new peaks / Analysis of a resurgent equity boom This week, Hong Kong has consolidated the irresistible rise which, since the beginning of 1992, has made it the best performing major stock market in the world. Yesterday's marginal fall in the blue chip Hang Seng index of 19.54, or 0.3 per cent, to 6,488.46 left it 23 points off the day's peak, but this followed three record highs for the market in four trading days. Brokers have dusted off year-end forecasts which, because of the political woes then besetting the colony, had been in abeyance since the beginning of 1993. They are now looking at a year-end level of 7,500 to 8,000 for the Hang Seng index. What a difference a few months can make. At the start of December, the overwhelming mood was to sell Hong Kong. China had threatened the safety of business contracts which span Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997; on December 3 the market plunged 8 per cent. The Hang Seng index now stands 30 per cent higher. Short memories are part of the lore of the Hong Kong market. But, paradoxically, the most accurate assessment during those dark days came from the unlikeliest of quarters: Governor Chris Patten, the man whose 'democracy' proposals so upset China, and the man financial markets like to hate most. The governor said that few made money selling Hong Kong short. So what has changed? Has the market's recent performance been a reassertion of economics over politics? Or has the recent thaw in Anglo-Chinese relations been the motive force behind the market's relentless upward move? As with most things in life, it is a bit of both. Even to the most unreconstructed bull it seems unlikely that the Hong Kong market could have risen so strongly had China not decided to come back to the negotiating table about the colony's political development. The market senses an Anglo-Chinese deal in the making and, although it could yet be disappointed, it has decided that the element of political risk has lessened considerably. And it has put its money where its judgment lies. Four months ago, the market was trading on a prospective p/e of just above 8 times 1993 earnings; the multiple is now more than 11 - close to the upper end of its traditional prospective p/e range of 8 to 13. There is also evidence in plenty for the economic approach. China's economy expanded by nearly 13 per cent in real terms last year, and the region closest to Hong Kong, namely Guangdong province, by much more than that. The growth rate may slow this year but that is being taken as a reassuring sign by the market, which fears a re-run of 1988/89 when China's government screwed down the economy too hard. As for Hong Kong, it grew by 5 per cent last year. The government thinks that growth will accelerate to 5.5 per cent this year, while many private forecasters plump for 6 per cent. Corporate earnings reports have also been encouraging. The initial clutch of results have underlined the profitability of banking. The banks - and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking is still to come - have reported earnings growth of 30 to 40 per cent. Analysts also note other positive factors. There is a growing recognition that the US yield curve is likely to remain flat this year. As Hong Kong's interest rates are tied to US rates, by virtue of the colony's currency link with America, domestic rates are expected to remain at their currently low level of 6.5 per cent. With the results season only half way spent, the possibility for upsets remains. The conglomerates - Jardine, Swire and Hutchison - are still to come, as are the property developers. The outlook for these sectors is mixed. And then there is politics. In November, as the market rose in defiance of China's attacks on Mr Patten, there was a lot of talk about the decoupling of politics from economic fundamentals. December gave the lie to that when China decided it wanted the market lower. When Anglo-Chinese negotiations about Hong Kong's politics finally get going, China may decide again that it is in its interests for the market to fall.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta coffee market closed with substantial gains but below the day's highs as the New York market, after first slipping back, continued Friday's rally. Traders said the support in the US was due to roaster and commission house buying between 69.50 and 70.50 cents a lb in near May. There was no fresh news from Brazil after last week's vote by Brazilian producers to open talks on a return to an international coffee agreement. London cocoa drifted to fresh 6 1/2 -month lows; the market is awaiting indications on the size of the Ivorian mid-crop, which could be higher than previous estimates of about 100,000 tonnes. On the LME copper prices rallied back above support levels in the afternoon, aided by gains in New York. Most other metals finished a routine day lower. Three-month zinc dropped below the psychological Dollars 1,200 level, extending earlier declines, with sell-stops pushing the market to the day's lows. Three-month aluminium fell below support at Dollars 1,300 to trade last at Dollars 1,291 a tonne. New York cotton futures were at contract lows at midday on bearish fundamentals. Analysts cited market talk that China had increased its crop output to about 26m bales, 2.6m bales more than the USDA projected. Compiled from Reuters</p>

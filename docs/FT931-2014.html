			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (2): Opinions differ on costs - New generation server-workstations LIKE ageing characters in a long-running soap opera, mainframe computers have been written off and written out of the IT buyers' script. Today's buyers, weaned on media stars such as PCs and local area networks, are clamouring for the new generation server-workstation architectures, architectures that combine the two. But the server-workstation architecture is nothing new. It's nothing more than distributed data processing in the Emperor's new clothes. So why all the excitement? There are three key reasons why the rush to server-workstation architectures has accelerated in the past year: First, it gives users greater control over data. Instead of massive databases, traditionally untouchable by end-users, data is instantly accessible at the departmental level, and in real-time. Users can now have their executive information where and when they need it, and they can get at it through an easy-to-use front-end, often their own desktop PC. Secondly, today's users are more computer literate, more sophisticated in what they want from computing and more demanding of IT staff. Now, it's not unusual for the financial director to be intimately involved with the search for and selection of IT systems. And finally there is cost: cost of ownership, as you might expect, but also cost-savings in use. Opinions differ widely, though, on server-workstation costs and some users prefer to retain and maintain existing mainframe systems, rather than ditch them in favour of distributed systems. THOSE companies that have ditched mainframes in favour of clusters of workstations have mixed stories to tell. Some have been forced to revive the mainframe link before it was severed completely because the new systems couldn't cope. Others, however, such as EBC Amro, have successfully replaced clusters of minis or mainframes with networks of PCs hooked up to file servers. Up to a point, it is fairly straightforward to mirror the physical storage and processing characteristics of a mainframe with networked PCs and file servers. In this way, users can see 'downsizing,' the marketing executives' latest jargon, as a form of systems integration. Here the traditional DP department exchanges centralised control for centralised systems management. Benefits for the user should include more effective support, frequent upgrades and lower system costs. And those cost savings can be remarkable, says the National Computing Centre. One member-company reports a saving of around Pounds 200,000 a year in maintenance costs alone, as a direct result of downsizing. There seems to be no apparent loss of capacity or functionality, it claims. Nick Evans, chairman of the British Computer Society's Client Server Group claims that cost savings can be phenomenal - 'we surveyed one leisure services company that could cut its costs by 75 per cent overall,' he says. There were even larger savings to be made for companies that could stop leasing their mainframe systems to switch into server workstation architectures. But cost-savings should be questioned closely by users intending to tread the client-server route. 'Anyone who buys client-server systems to save money is in for a shock,' says Peter Stuart, marketing strategy manager for ICL's midrange systems. Combining hardware, software and integration costs can sometimes exceed the value of a small mainframe system, he suggests. Though he is quick to point ou t that the switch does save money in the medium to long-term, by offering better performance. 'What is good about client-server is that users can invest incrementally, a step at a time,' he adds, 'so there can be a cost-saving in that sense.' Henry Brysh, a senior communications consultant at the National Computing Centre, believes that users should question vendors closely on costs. 'What they don't tell you is there are hidden costs, mainly to do with integrating the whole system.' In the past, users bought mainframes from IBM, ICL or Unisys, for example, and operations managers were comfortable with the technology. In addition, they had a stable relationship with their suppliers. 'Now,' says Mr Brysh, 'users are buying the systems, specifying the commodities, and they're responsible for driving the whole thing.' IN SHORT, the focus has shifted away from the performance of key hardware or software, and towards the overall performance of the entire network. 'When you find the three distributed databases you've got linked together don't work,' he asks, 'who do you turn to?' But cost is a complex issue. It hardly seems fair to compare a Unix box at Pounds 30,000 with a mainframe at Pounds 500,000, but Mr Brysh believes these hidden costs must be measured if users are to make a fair comparison between the systems. Fortunately for users, a survey by KPMG, a management consultant, has gone some way towards measuring these costs. The survey - of workstation users at companies such as Ford, National Westminster Bank and Refuge Assurance - has revealed that the annual cost of running workstations is almost Pounds 6,000 per machine. Of this, over 90 per cent represents hidden support costs, claims the report. 'I was asked to speak on a lecture tour by one systems and software vendor,' says Geoff Jarvis, a principal consultant at KPMG. 'The vendor was obviously trying to migrate its 10-12,000 customers on to Unix boxes, claiming it would be a tenth of the cost. I had to say 'Hold on a minute' and was nearly booed off the tour.' It is no surprise that vendors are so excited about client-server - even IBM has pitched in to the market, and it is looking for a sizeable portion of the business. 'Compared with the traditional mainframe business, this is a much broader opportunity,' says Nicholas Donofrio, IBM Enterprise Systems general manager. 'It's a Dollars 150bn market, which will grow at about 7 per cent over the next five years.' There are three main barriers for users wishing to adopt server-workstation architectures, according to market research company Ovum: A shortage of skills. The immaturity and unreliability of the LAN environment. And the lack of support and development tools. Today's users are demanding application development tools to run in the client-server environment, but they also need management tools, tools to support the mainframe, as well as multi-vendor platforms. In particular, users need tools for systems and network management. Perhaps the over-riding concern for users is for better service and support from hardware and software vendors. In a client-server environment, problems are much tougher to identify and isolate. Allocating them to one vendor over another could prove impossible. So users need a one-stop shop for their IT systems, a shop that can support multi-vendor systems from desktop PCs to backroom mainframes. Thus, servers and workstations clearly have their place as the distributed databases of tomorrow, although the questions of cost and effective support cannot be ignored by the concerned user. 'I'm not firing the flare on client-server,' says Henry Brysh of the National Computing Centre. 'It is effective when people decide it can help their business. But it shouldn't be undertaken just because the chief executive or the finance director has been playing golf with the wrong person.'</p>

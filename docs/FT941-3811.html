			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Long snakes and short ladders in Africa: A formula for development failure Unseen hands play Snakes and Ladders across sub-Saharan Africa. Democracy fitfully emerges in South Africa, is denied in Nigeria. Civil war revives in Angola, Zaire slides towards anarchy, a fragile peace pact holds in Mozambique. News is as unpredictable as the throw of the dice. Snakes marked Drought, Corruption or Civil War writhe across the board; ladders appear as Debt Rescheduled or World Bank Loan. Short ladders, long snakes. . . and loaded dice. As the latest World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa report published at the weekend makes clear, the destination labelled Recovery remains out of reach. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn (Pounds 113bn), has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warns the Bank. Whoever is to blame, the policy at the heart of relations between Africa and the west is failing. 'Good governance', the concept which links aid to Africa with economic reform, human rights and democracy has not got to the heart of the continent's predicament. Admirable in principle, complex in practice, today the policy appears confused. Increasingly the west is placing responsibility for Africa on the World Bank, but providing neither adequate mandate nor clear guidance. Once enslaved, later colonised, and marginalised in the 1980s, the continent faces a continuing crisis in the 1990s - but with a new dimension. Africa is not only in danger of losing the battle; the world is losing interest. The countries that led the scramble for Africa's resources some 100 years ago are now disengaging. 'If only the west cared enough to want to recolonise us,' an African diplomat ruefully observes. 'But we're hardly an attractive proposition.' At one level, the west continues to respond positively. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. But the critical link between economic and political reform is being neglected, and aid is ineffective. Under the auspices of the World Bank's economic recovery programme, Africa's governments were expected to cut budget deficits, curb inflation and monetary growth, introduce competitive exchange rates, reform tariffs and revive agriculture. The good news, says Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank's vice-president for Africa, is that the formula works: 'The six countries that improved their policies the most (over the period 1987-91) saw their GDP growth per capita jump about 2 percentage points per annum between 1981-86 and 1987-91.' The bad news is that this is not nearly enough. The Bank's claim in a 1989 report that African economies could grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent has proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Part of the reason for Africa's failure is made clear in the report. Implementation of the World Bank structural adjustment reforms has been poor, political will lacking, and management resources scarce. But essential to the success of economic reforms, donors have argued, is a matching programme of political reform. Transparency, accountability and democracy are vital to sustain development, they maintain. The World Bank report agrees, but it does not address how it can be achieved in practice, or assess the part political problems have played in Africa's failure to reach economic targets. The only reference is to 'a strong social consensus on the need to improve governance'. Corruption is not mentioned, nor military spending, nor is there any discussion of a central issue: how to reward reformers, punish laggards. Yet the experience of Bank representatives across Africa is that this is precisely the area which needs attention. 'Structural adjustment means reducing state patronage,' explains a Bank official in west Africa. 'Reducing patronage undermines the ruling party. Unless the president is prepared to risk political suicide, there is not enough I can do to force him down a path of reform, whether it's the big stick or the big carrot.' The reason for the report's reticence on 'good governance' issues is not hard to find. The Bank, officials privately point out, is constrained by a mandate which precludes it from a political role; and its mandate is determined by the directors - 'none of whom wants to rock the boat'. The board's third world appointees tend to reflect the views of their leaders, who would be the last to support tougher measures, say their domestic critics. Developed country directors, may be reluctant to jeopardise commercial or security interests. But the misgivings of directors representing the biggest donors about applying tougher pressure on reluctant African reformers stem from a further, more understandable concern: the generally poor performance of Africa's opposition parties. After the high hopes of the 'new wind of change', the wave of democratisation that swept through Africa in the late 1980s, opposition parties have turned out to have most of the weaknesses of the regimes they oppose: ethnically based, few carefully worked out policy alternatives and likely to be as corrupt if ever they won office. 'Who can blame us for our reluctance to follow through a policy that could destabilise Nigeria, with its 80m people and huge problems, and where the opposition seems as incompetent as the army?' asks an irritated European diplomat. The report leaves further questions unanswered. If democracy is essential to sustained growth - the assumption that underpins the concept of good governance - how can the position of Ghana, under military government until 1992 but the leading reformer, be explained? As long ago as 1981 the Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'. World Bank officials and aid workers argue that Africa's need for such a compact is overwhelming. But until the west renews its interest in Africa, resolves the anomalies in its policies, and gives the Bank and other donors a clearer mandate, the compact will remain a pipe dream.</p>

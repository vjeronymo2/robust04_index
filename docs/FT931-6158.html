			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / NBC chief resigns over GM film NBC News yesterday announced the resignation of its president, Mr Michael Gartner, in an attempt to limit damage to the news division of America's third-ranking television network from the rigging of a broadcast test of a General Motors truck last year. Mr Gartner, president of the division since 1988, said he told NBC late last year of his plans to leave in August. He said he had hastened his departure announcement because of recent controversies. In November, NBC's Dateline current affairs programme aired pictures of a blazing GM truck without telling its 11m viewers that it had attached small incendiary devices to the truck to make it burst into flames during a collision. In February, NBC issued an on-air apology to GM, America's biggest carmaker, after it launched a suit for defamation against the network. GM is struggling against bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks built between 1973 and 1987, which have been the subject of lawsuits and government investigations. An internal investigation of the GM affair is expected to be completed this week. Mr Don Browne, NBC News executive vice-president, will assume Mr Gartner's responsibilities while the network searches for a successor. This is not the only search going on at NBC. The network's parent, General Electric, is believed to be interested in selling NBC if it can get the right price.</p>

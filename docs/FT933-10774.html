			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: An investment with the lure of gold - The flotation of a Kazakhstan mining venture LONDON investors are being asked to provide Pounds 9m, and possibly Pounds 84m, for a gold mining venture in the newly-independent republic of Kazakhstan, formerly part of the Soviet Union. Stockbrokers Williams de Broe are to float Bakyrchik Gold on the London Stock Exchange by placing 7.5m shares at 120p each, which values the new company at about Pounds 18m. The promoters suggest that this will be the only substantial 'pure gold' company to be listed in London and that the flotation will provide 'an early opportunity to invest in Kazakhstan.' Bakyrchik Gold (BK Gold) is jointly owned by Minproc, the Australian natural resources and engineering group, and Chilewich, a private company based in White Plains, New York, which claims to have 50 years' experience of trading with the former Soviet Union. BK Gold last October signed a joint venture agreement with the Kazakhstan government to develop the Bakyrchik mine, on one of the world's biggest gold deposits - it has total resources of 28.1m tonnes of ore containing 9.11 grams of gold a tonne - a total of 8m troy ounces. The estimated cash cost of production is Dollars 120 an ounce, which would put it among the western world's lowest-cost mines. Bakyrchik, located in an arid region of the north-eastern steppes of Kazakhstan, about 1,000km north of the capital, Almaty, was first opened in 1965. More than 6,000 people in the local town of Auezov are supported by the mine including 1,000 directly employed at a cost equivalent to Dollars 3,000 a year for staff and Dollars 2,000 a year for manual workers. BK Gold holds 40 per cent of the joint venture and has management control. It says the infrastructure, shaft and mine development for a large-scale operation are essentially in place, and the directors estimate it would cost Dollars 150m in today's money to duplicate this structure. But they suggest western capital and technical help is needed to bring the mine to its full potential. The Bakyrchik mine geology and ore characteristics are complex, and this could lead to difficult conditions in parts of the mine and problems with ore treatment. BK Gold has opted to use Minproc's Redox (nitric acid oxidation process), which has never before been used on a commercial scale, to treat some of the ore. The joint venturers intend to further develop the mine in two stages, which they insist will each be viable in its own right. The first, to be funded by the Pounds 8.2m net proceeds of the London placing, will involve a heap leach and a sulphide plant being built, each to process 100,000 tonnes of ore a year, to produce a total of between 35,000 and 40,000 ounces of gold. Development at this stage will also include a gold refinery. Gold, refined to be deliverable to the London bullion market, will be sold to Kazakhstan's central bank for US dollars. The government wants to establish a Kazakhstan currency and to increase national annual gold output from the present estimated 12 tonnes to support it. If the bank fails to pay, the mine can export gold. BK Gold says the second stage of mine development would go ahead only when the directors were satisfied 'as to the adequacy of the operational procedures, mining methods and metallurgical processes, the availability of funding and the status of the political situation'. If the go-ahead is given, probably not before the autumn of 1994, BK Gold would raise another Pounds 75m to increase output at the mine to 1m tonnes of ore and 230,000 ounces of gold a year. The company will be entitled to 75 per cent of net operating income until all the funds invested have been repaid, falling then to 40 per cent. The joint venture will pay no tax on the first five years of profits and then half the applicable rate (currently 25 per cent) for the following five years. BK Gold's chief executive is Mr Kevin Foo, a metallurgical engineer who heads Minproc's office in Colorado, US. The operations director is Mr Bill Hussey, a mining engineer and formerly general manager of the Ashanti gold mine in Ghana. He has already moved to Kazakhstan. See Observer</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: American Airlines posts Dollars 195.6m loss AMERICAN Airlines, one of the two biggest US carriers, yesterday kicked off a dismal quarterly reporting season for the US airline industry by announcing that it lost Dollars 195.6m in the first three months of the year. The figures bear the full brunt of the traffic slump, which resulted from the Gulf War and the deepening domestic recession. In addition, Mr Bob Crandall, American's forthright chairman, pointed to the uncertainty created by difficult labour negotiations. The airline also suffered from the loss of around 450 pilots called up to serve in Operation Desert Storm. 'The net effect was to make our first quarter uniquely unhappy,' he said. Wall Street, however, was braced for red ink, and American itself had already warned of a significant first-quarter loss. Analysts were predicting a loss per share of around Dollars 3, with the actual figure of Dollars 2.96 falling closely in line with expectations. Shares in AMR, the parent company, gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 61 1/8 at midday. American's hefty first-quarter loss compares with a Dollars 19.3m deficit in the first three months of 1990, and a Dollars 215.1m deficit in the October-December quarter. The first quarter of any year is traditionally a weak period for the airline industry, although in 1989 and 1988 American did make significant profits during the first three months. AMR's revenues during the first quarter of 1991 rose marginally, from Dollars 2.69bn to Dollars 2.77bn, but there was a significantly sharper increase in operating costs, up by 11.6 per cent at Dollars 3.01bn. Labour costs rose by 12.3 per cent, while fuel expenses were 11.1 per cent higher than in the previous year, at Dollars 476.4m. Capacity, in terms of available seat miles, increased by 2.5 per cent year-on-year, but the passenger load factor fell from 59.9 per cent to 56.5 per cent. American said that the break-even load factor for the first quarter was 63.5 per cent, up from 60.6 per cent a year earlier. However, Mr Crandall struck a brighter note over future prospects. 'Fuel prices have declined,' he said, 'and we anticipate lower costs for the remainder of the year.' Sales, he added, had been picking up recently and he suggested that there was 'some evidence' that the economy is strengthening.</p>

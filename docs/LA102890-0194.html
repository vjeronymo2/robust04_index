			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NADIR HASN'T HIT BOTTOM, BUT THE FINANCIER MAY YET PROVE APTLY NAMED;  </P> <P> FINANCE: IN LONDON, THE CITY BUZZES OVER THE COLLAPSE OF HIS SPRAWLING POLLY  PECK EMPIRE. ITS GUIDING SPIRIT COULD FALL FURTHER YET.  </P> <P> The summer's preoccupation in Britain's financial community was the trial and  conviction of four top executives in the long-running Guinness stock  manipulation scandal.  </P> <P> This fall, the leading concern of Britain's brokers, bankers and analysts is a  much wider ranging imbroglio: the collapse of the Polly Peck International  food, electronics and leisure conglomerate and the stunning decline of its  chairman, Asil Nadir.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a British judge placed the company into a form of reorganization  similar to Chapter 11, effectively taking Polly Peck out of Nadir's hands and  ending the Cypriot financier's weeks-long effort to put together a financial  rescue package for the firm.  </P> <P> The court intervention, requested by Polly Peck's board when Nadir came up $60  million short in his campaign to satisfy creditors owed nearly $2 billion,  followed more than a month of turmoil.  </P> <P> Trading in the London-based company's shares was suspended Sept. 20 after panic  selling that day reduced the value of Polly Peck stock by more than $1 billion.  In the course of an afternoon, company shares dropped to 1.08 pounds from 2.43  pounds.  </P> <P> The frenzy was touched off when word leaked out that Britain's Serious Fraud  Office had raided the offices of South Audley Management, an investment company  with ties to Nadir. Rumors of an insider trading scandal whipped across the  City, London's financial district. The SFO interviewed Nadir for several hours  that afternoon.  </P> <P> Although the SFO has refused to reveal the purpose of its investigation, Nadir  later said the inquiries were "substantially related to the alleged impropriety  in dealing in Polly Peck shares." He added that the investigation was  "unrelated to matters within my knowledge."  </P> <P> Within a week, Polly Peck suspended payments on its debt, $400 million of which  is believed due before the end of this year.  </P> <P> The company's 70 or so creditor banks had given PPI until Nov. 9 to find the  money and devise a business plan to guide it through the debacle. As part of  the agreement with the banks, Nadir had pledged to step down as chairman,  although it was thought he would remain chief executive.  </P> <P> But with the court intervention, that plan has now been discarded. A  court-appointed administrator will run the company and attempt to repay  creditors.  </P> <P> The British financial community's vast interest in the case is attributable to  more than the fantastic sums, the whiff of scandal and the strong possibility  that one of Britain's premier companies will be sold off piecemeal.  </P> <P> There also is intense scrutiny because this is Polly Peck, one of the most  unusual companies in Great Britain. The story of Polly Peck and its autocratic  leader is almost literally rags to riches.  </P> <P> "Polly Peck is very much the creation of one person," says a London-based  merchant banker familiar with Nadir's career. "That one person is the company.  It's a very unusual situation for a publicly traded company in Britain."  </P> <P> Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot who came to Britain in 1964, built up his father's  garment business through the 1970s. In 1980, he bought a stake in the failing  textile company Polly Peck. Although the company's journey through the 1980s  was more akin to a roller coaster ride than a rocket, it ended the decade with  a reputation as the world's best performing stock over the previous 10 years.  </P> <P> Along the way, Nadir became one of the wealthiest men in Britain. Climbing from  a meager 5 pence a share in 1983, Polly Peck was valued at nearly 4 a share in  1989. The company bought Del Monte's fresh fruit operation for $875 million  last year. It even purchased a controlling interest in the Japanese electronics  company Sansui.  </P> <P> Polly Peck and its financial machinations grew against the backdrop of  international politics.  </P> <P> Nadir is a close friend and political ally of Turkish President Turgut Ozal and  has extensive holdings in that country and his native Cyprus. Among his Turkish  holdings are an empire of news publications that have provided unwavering  support for Ozal.  </P> <P> As soon as the Serious Fraud Office investigation became known last month, the  Turkish government complained to the British government that a campaign was  being waged against Nadir by Greek Cypriots. A week later, during a meeting in  New York between Ozal and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Turkish  leader reportedly demanded to know if there were any proven instances of  wrongdoing involving either Nadir or Polly Peck. Thatcher is said to have told  him that the case would stay in the hands of criminal investigators.  </P> <P> Nadir's links to Turkish northern Cyprus are intricately related to his  political muscle in Turkey. But those links also have caused him political and  business problems elsewhere.  </P> <P> In the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, an entity borne of Turkey's 1974  invasion of Cyprus and recognized only by Turkey, Polly Peck is the biggest  taxpayer and the second largest employer, after the state. Besides operating  companies involved in manufacturing and citrus exports, Nadir has been building  a string of luxury hotels.  </P> <P> The creation of a thriving tourist trade is viewed as the best way to boost the  sluggish economy in the northern sector of the partitioned island. Turkey hopes  to wean its 16-year-old offspring from the massive subsidies that the tiny  republic now requires.  </P> <P> But Polly Peck's investments in northern Cyprus have outraged the Greek  Cypriots in the much larger and prosperous southern region of the island. In  1983, Polly Peck shares plunged when the Greek Cypriot government claimed that  the company was involved in the seizure of Greek property in northern Cyprus.  </P> <P> Nadir was able to steer the company through that crisis, which saw the greatest  drop in the company's value -- until last month's free-fall. Even through the  recent problems, Nadir had steadfastly sought to protect his Mediterranean  holdings.  </P> <P> With 28% of Polly Peck already in hand, Nadir surprised London's financial  community last August by announcing that he was taking the company private. But  he left the City completely baffled -- and caused the firm's shares to dip --  when he announced five days later that he was abandoning the plan.  </P> <P> Then came the events of Sept. 20. Polly Peck suspended payments on its massive  debt. Reports began to emerge about an enigmatic web of Swiss and offshore  companies and their connection to Polly Peck, Nadir and the questionable  trading of Polly Peck shares. Large blocks of company shares appear to have  been traded just before important company announcements.  </P> <P> No charges have been filed in the case, which is still under investigation.  Nadir acknowledged that the company was having "liquidity problems," but denied  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> He also revealed that creditor banks had sold 10 million Polly Peck shares in  which he had an interest during the frenzied trading of Sept. 20. The shares  had been held by the banks as collateral on loans. His bankers' sale of those  shares and other blocks reduced Nadir's stake in Polly Peck to just over 24%.  </P> <P> But Nadir's statement did not clarify the extent of the company's financial  problems, nor did it identify their cause.  </P> <P> Until the decision to seek court protection, Nadir had been jetting around the  globe looking for sources of cash. He repeatedly said he would be able to  secure huge amounts in Turkey and northern Cyprus, but in fact produced little.  A much-discussed bailout from the Turkish government fell through. Polly Peck  did sell one hotel in northern Cyprus to the government, however, for $12  million.  </P> <P> Now the court-appointed administrators -- accountants from the firms of Coopers  &amp; Lybrand and Deloitte &amp; Touche -- will have to make what they can of  Polly Peck's assets.  </P> <P> It will be an arduous task. Little is known about Polly Peck operations in  Turkey. And because of the ongoing nationalist struggle on Cyprus, the chances  of selling any businesses in northern Cyprus to foreigners are considered nil.  Indeed, the Turkish enclave's finance minister said last week that he would  aggressively fight any such deals.  </P> <P> Much attention is being focused on the fate of Del Monte, which is considered  the jewel in the Polly Peck crown. The parent company had said it was  contemplating the sale of a minority stake in the fresh fruit operation on the  New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The administrator could attempt to sell Del Monte outright. Complicating that  scenario, however, is the fact that rival Dole Food Co. is already for sale.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gambling with a cool hand - ICI's foray into the Japanese chemical market When Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of Imperial Chemical Industries, opens a new plant this morning in Mihara, near Hiroshima, he will be gambling that his company can take on the Japanese on their own turf. The gamble is all the more audacious because ICI is commissioning a plant in Japan at a time when almost all indigenous chemicals manufacturers have stopped adding domestic capacity. Japan's chemical industry has been ravaged by a particularly long domestic recession, high domestic operating costs and an ever-appreciating yen. In addition, its main customers - the automotive, electronics and textiles industries - are migrating to other Asian locations. Most Japanese chemical companies have responded to the crisis by investing outside their traditional domestic manufacturing bases and building plants in south-east Asia. The question remains why a British company believes it can succeed where indigenous manufacturers are finding it hard to make money? Mr Hampel is gambling that ICI can triumph with a product called HFC 134a. This is designed as a substitute for ozone-depleting CFCs, production of which is scheduled to be halted at the end of 1995. HFC 134a, which is marketed under the brand name Klea, is used mainly for refrigeration and air conditioning. The Pounds 50m factory, a 50-50 joint-venture with Teijin of Japan, will have initial annual capacity of 6,000 tonnes. ICI is nothing less than ambitious. It intends to grab 20 per cent of the Japanese HFC 134a market and a higher proportion elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region. The company hopes to repeat the success already achieved in the US, where market share is as high as 40 per cent - the highest ever achieved by an ICI product, according to Mr Hampel. That ICI is investing in Asia is not surprising. Says Mr Hampel: 'Asia will get a higher proportion of our investment over the next few years because of its superb growth potential.' Last year 25 per cent of turnover was in the Asia-Pacific region - including Australia. That compares with 22 per cent in the UK, a similar proportion on the Continent, and 30 per cent in the US. ICI's commitment to the Asia-Pacific area is demonstrated by its capital investment there over the last three years. At a time when capital spending has been severely rationed, the bulk has been invested in the region. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, has opened numerous Asian facilities. These include a titanium dioxide plant in Malaysia, and pure terephthalic acid and methyl methacrylate complexes in Taiwan. In three weeks' time, he is to open a paints facility in China. Mr Hampel is adamant that the decision to invest in Japan was the right one. 'The Mihara HFC plant puts our CFC-replacement business on a global footing. It's the third piece in the global jigsaw.' The group is the only CFC substitute manufacturer in Europe, the US and Japan, he adds. Although the Japanese economy is in recession, the market remains extremely important, says Mr Geoff Tudhope, managing director of ICI Fluorocarbons. The initial targets will be the automotive and domestic refrigeration industries. 'Once you have the blessing of the Japanese parent company, you can sell the product to their subsidiaries anywhere in the world,' says Mr Tudhope. The product has already been qualified by significant Japanese automotive and electronics groups, although ICI declines to identify them. ICI believes its technology will give it a sustainable competitive advantage. The company has considerable expertise in the sophisticated lubricants required for each different HFC application. It has set up a technical centre at Tsukuba science city which can provide a complete service for Japanese clients rather than just a product. Other advantages accrue from having a technological base. 'It's tough to manufacture in Japan. But our proprietary catalyst technology will enable us to continue to run a low-cost plant, even though it's producing in Japan,' says Mr Tudhope. ICI is the only manufacturer of CFC alternatives to also make its own catalysts. It believes its catalyst technology is far beyond that of its competitors and will allow it to increase both product quality and plant yield. It expects that the catalysts should eventually allow global HFC 134a capacity to be increased from 20,000 tonnes a year to 50,000 tonnes without significant capital investment. 'The technology involved means this will not be a multi-producer commodity chemical,' insists Mr Hampel. Competitors include Du Pont and Allied Signal in the US, Elf Atochem in France and Hoechst in Germany. In Japan, manufacturers include Asahi Glass, Daikin, Showa Denku and a joint-venture between Du Pont and Mitsui. World capacity is probably about 50,000 tonnes a year, according to ICI. The world's CFC replacement market has not grown as quickly as expected, admits Mr Tudhope. The recession meant many companies had delayed their conversion. However, ICI's sales are running at a monthly rate equal to the annual rate just a year ago, he says. The market is expected to tighten considerably in 1995 and 1996. Mr Hampel says the fluorocarbons business has been privileged to receive so much investment. Like other ICI operations, it has been set aggressive targets for return on capital. Once Mr Hampel has cut the ribbon today, the factory must prove it can achieve its goals, in spite of the handicap of manufacturing in one of the world's most difficult markets. Although the risks involved in Mr Hampel's gamble are high, ICI believes the dice are loaded in its favour.</p>

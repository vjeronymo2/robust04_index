			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: National &amp; Provincial jumps 51% National &amp; Provincial Building Society yesterday saw pre-tax profits advance 51 per cent to Pounds 121m for 1993, assisted by a 37 per cent decline to Pounds 68m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. The improvement at the UK's eighth largest building society follows 1992 results which saw total provisions rise to more than double the 1991 figure. The society said that the stabilisation of house prices was a significant factor in the lower level of provisioning, contrasting the 8 per cent fall in 1992 with an increase of just under 2 per cent last year. Despite the strong competition faced by the societies' sector for personal customers' savings, N&amp;P's retail balances rose 8 per cent to Pounds 8.5bn, taking into account net receipts of Pounds 296m. This enabled the society's wholesale funding ratio, which had been approaching the limit set by regulators at 29.3 per cent at December 1992, to fall back to 26.8 per cent by December 1993. Net interest income rose to Pounds 269.2m (Pounds 252.4m), reflecting an increase in commercial assets. Other income and charges, such as general insurance commissions, rose to Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 67.3m). It now amounts to almost one-quarter of total income of Pounds 348m (Pounds 320m). Management expenses rose from Pounds 130.8m to Pounds 158.7m. Mr David O'Brien, chief executive, said that this reflected investment in extending the network, telephone service and systems. As a result, cost/income ratio rose from 40.9 per cent to 45.6 per cent. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, described the results as 'sound' and said that he expected them to be better than average for the sector. For the first time, the society made provisions for its regulated business in 1993, including the sale of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes; these totalled Pounds 4.8m. N&amp;P said it had paid particular attention to managing arrears and repossessions and by the end of 1993, the value of cases in arrears of three months or less was 29 per cent lower than at the end of 1992. Its stock of unsold residential repossessions was 2,800 at the start of 1993, and 2,250 at the year-end.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Carrefour takes control of Picard Carrefour, France's largest food retailing group, is set to take control of Picard Surgeles, a private company which is one of the country's biggest distributors of frozen food. Carrefour said that it had reached agreement to raise its stake in the company from 10 per cent to more than 50 per cent, although it declined to specify the exact amount of its projected investment or the amount to be paid. Picard is the third largest distributor of frozen foods in France and is particularly strong in the Paris region, where it has a market share of 24 per cent. Its turnover last year amounted to FFr1.6bn, while net profits reached FFr61.7m. According to Carrefour, the Decelle family, which established Picard Surgeles in 1974, will remain active at both the management and shareholder level. Olivier Decelle and Xavier Decelle are currently chairman and managing director respectively. Carrefour has also announced that it is to enter the Mexican market through the establishment of a 50-50 joint venture with Gigante. The new company will develop large supermarkets. The Mexican company, which has activities in food and electronics retailing as well as cafeterias and restaurants, achieved sales of FFr14.3bn last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Xavier Gautier: "Conference on Stability in </F> Europe Starts in Paris Tomorrow -- A Project Limited to Central  Europe"]    [Text] Explicit protection of minority rights; a law  liberalizing the use of languages and names; a promise to settle  "alternative" education controversies through negotiation: By  defusing the nationalist time bomb with a whole series of  initiatives, the new Slovak Government has probably deprived the  "Balladur Plan" of a first success.    After ousting Vladimir Meciar, Jozef Moravcik's team has set  to work to settle, in a European spirit, the fate of 1 million  Hungarians, Ukrainians, and gypsies who share Slovak citizenship  with the 4.5 million Slovaks of the young Danube republic.    "Relations between Slovakia and Hungary have recently  relaxed," French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was able to note  yesterday. He sees in this the early "influence" of the  Conference on Stability in Europe, which opens in Paris tomorrow  for two days. The objectives of this "summit" seem fairly  clear: Inspired by the Madrid Conference, which at the end of  1991 provided the impetus for the Middle East peace process,  France decided to help the Central European countries to settle  "their problems between neighbors." Organized around general  and bilateral issues, the UNESCO Palace meeting is aimed at  producing a "pact for stability" by 1995.  <H5>  Superfluous Initiatives </H5>   According to Mr. Juppe, this conference is addressed  exclusively at the countries which want to join the European  Union [EU], although the 53 CSCE member states are also invited.  Clearly, only the "new democracies," i.e., Poland, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia,  and Lithuania, to which little Slovenia was added at the last  minute, will really be involved.    "It is legitimate for the EU to establish not entry  conditions, but rules of good conduct for them," Mr. Juppe said.  "It is natural that they should put their house in order as we  succeeded in doing with Saarland and Alsace," European Affairs  Minister Alain Lamassoure said at a news conference at the Quai  d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] yesterday.    The reservations of the countries concerned are well known:  Prague is surprised to have been placed in the same category as  other more turbulent capitals, while the Czech-Slovak partition  served as a model. In Central Europe people are questioning the  need to increase the number of superfluous initiatives in the  security sphere. Have the Czech Republic, Poland, or the Baltic  countries not all applied to join NATO?    Of course, the Balladur pact is a diplomatic first by the EU  but, seen from East Europe, it looks very like a means of making  the candidates wait patiently in the waiting room of the EU.    The foreign minister answered its critics rather bluntly:  First, "we are not the applicants," he said. Second, "if a  country participates in the conference, it is not necessarily  because it has problems (minority or border problems), but  because it has concerns with regard to these issues."    Europe will have to rely on mediators, Mr. Juppe pointed  out.  The "good students" of the pact will be able to play this role,  in his view. So will the United States, which is still  wondering what it will do in this new group.    Russia has declared its support. Andrey Kozyrev, its foreign  minister, confirmed to Alain Juppe during his visit to Moscow  his country's explicit support for the conference. This gives a  considerable boost to a rather heavily criticized initiative.  The Russian attitude is not free of ulterior motives. Indeed,  the Kremlin categorically refuses to allow NATO to be  automatically expanded to the former USSR satellites. It  continues to give preference to the broadest possible European  circles.    For want of anything better, the Central European countries  and the former Soviet republics are obliged to cling to what  they are being offered. Especially because the conference was  officially stamped "European" at the Twelve's summit in December.  <H5>  Smallest Common Denominator </H5>   "Poland's acceptance of the project, presented by France and  Germany in Warsaw (last November), shows that after being  accused of being overambitious or not ambitious enough, the  Conference on Stability has found an equilibrium," Alain Juppe  commented optimistically.    In reality, the Balladur initiative has been based from the  start on the smallest diplomatic common denominator.  Discouraged by the fiasco of their policy in the former  Yugoslavia, the Twelve, who have become Sixteen, deliberately  excluded from the process the areas of greatest tension: the  Caucasus, Bosnia, and now Crimea.    There is another important question: How can the Sixteen  aspire to play a mediating role when some of them are directly  involved in border and minority conflicts? This is true of  Greece with regard to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,  Albania, and Cyprus. Nowhere in the plan is Turkey mentioned,  although it has long been a candidate for EC membership. "Other  bodies are dealing with these problems," Alain Juppe pointed out.    At best, the problem of the Slovak-Hungarian Gabcikovo dam  will be settled; and perhaps the fate of the Hungarian minority  in Romanian Transylvania. But the conference is likely to be  powerless to ensure respect for the agreements resulting from  it. "It is not a military pact, but a political exercise" the  French foreign minister said, stalling again.    The exercise is likely to be reduced to an attempt to  protect  the European club in seclusion -- "our six-month old baby" as  Alain Juppe proudly calls it.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Own Correspondent Arif Useynov report: "Neighboring </F> Countries: Will They Agree?"]    [Text] Baku -- Azerbaijan's opposition parties have  reacted cautiously to a visit to Baku by Andrey Nikolayev,  commander in chief of Russia's Border Troops and leader of the  Federal Border Service. Newspapers abounded with headlines like  the following: "Russia Is Trying to Return Border Troops to  Azerbaijan." At the "Musavat" party headquarters the visit was  evaluated as a demonstration of "a new form of Russian  expansionism," bearing in mind that the northern neighbor has  not repudiated the idea of stationing Russian troops in  Azerbaijan and switching the protection of the republic's  external borders to their jurisdiction.    During a meeting with President Geydar Aliyev the Russian  Federation Border Troops commander in chief clarified the aim of  his visit: "The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is a matter for the  politicians of these two states. It is the question of  protecting Azerbaijan's external borders which interests Russia."    In a situation where the republic's southwestern regions are  occupied and the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is to all intents and  purposes non-existent there, while 170 km of the Iran-Azerbaijan  border is under the control of Armenian armed formations, the  proposal for Russia and Azerbaijan to collaborate in protecting  the external borders, according to the head of state's reaction,  has not been perceived in a positive light. AYNA writes that it  is obviously pertinent to take account of the actual state of  play in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and the situation on the  fronts. In this connection Geydar Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan's  border has in point of fact become an arena for military  operations.    According to commentators, the question of collaboration  between the two states is directly linked with resolving the  Karabakh conflict under rigorous compliance with international  norms -- the guarantee of territorial integrity and the  immutability of republic borders. Nowadays Azerbaijan is also  concentrating on this in trying to alter the course and nature  of the Karabakh war. To all appearances it was this  interpretation of the approach to proposals from the Russian  Federal Border Service that led to the decision to continue the  talks.    On this subject Andrey Nikolayevich gave a clarification:  For talks to continue, the forms and methods of cooperation  between the two states will have to be defined. To a question  on the possibility of stationing Russian troops on the  Iran-Azerbaijan border, the Russian Border Troops commander in  chief gave an evasive reply: "It all depends on what both sides  agree."    On the eve of the visit Gasan Gasanov, leader of  Azerbaijan's  foreign policy department, discussed the aforementioned  questions with the higher political leadership of Iran and  Turkey. The Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry Press Center announced  that agreement has already been reached between Turkey and  Azerbaijan on transforming the border treaty between Turkey and  the former USSR into a treaty between Turkey and Azerbaijan.  Working commissions have been set up to study the question.  Among other things, the two sides arrived at an agreement that  efforts to alter the borders of the Nakhichevan Autonomous  Republic and Azerbaijan by force will in general be evaluated by  them as a breach of the Kars Treaty, and in that event Turkey  will not remain a detached onlooker.</p>

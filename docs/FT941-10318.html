			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Lib Dems may suspend council race row group The Liberal Democrat group in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, the only big urban council controlled by the party, has been threatened with suspension unless it accepts the findings of an inquiry into alleged racism. The threat follows a confidential intervention in the party's disciplinary proceedings by Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president. Mr Kennedy wrote to the party's London region in January protesting at a decision to reprieve two Tower Hamlets members recommended for expulsion by an inquiry into the publication of racist leaflets in the borough. The inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat QC, concluded that three Tower Hamlets activists produced racist leaflets during a council by-election won by the British National Party. One of the three members resigned voluntarily. The London region's decision to accept apologies from the remaining two members angered many of the party's MPs. It was described as a whitewash by the Conservatives and Labour. Mr Kennedy said yesterday that he told the London region executive that the reprieve was 'damaging' the national party, and urged it to uphold Lord Lester's recommendations. After discussing Mr Kennedy's letter, the regional executive asked Ms Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of Tower Hamlets local party, to sign a statement accepting the Lester inquiry's conclusions, and withdrawing activists' criticisms. Ms Deakins was told that the Tower Hamlets group would be suspended unless the signed statement was received by Sunday. She was not available for comment last night. The suspension of the Tower Hamlets group would be a victory for Liberal Democrat anti-racism campaigners such as Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey. The suspension would mean that Liberal Democrat councillors would remain members of the party, but activities such as candidate selection would be carried out by the London region.</p>

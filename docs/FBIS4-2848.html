			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 13 (XINHUA) -- A research institute  in Sichuan Province has developed an advanced technological  process that greatly reduces industrial consumption of fuel and  materials.    The "gas separation process by pressure swing absorption"  (PSA) developed at the Southwest China Institute of Chemical  Industry (SCICI) is being used in 270 chemical and other  enterprises throughout China.    According to SCICI President Feng Xiaoting, these PSA  installations consume 500 million kwh less electricity and  600,000 tons less coal a year than the conventional cooling  process.    That means an additional cut of one billion yuan in  production cost for the enterprises.    In 1985, SCICI won the state scientific progress prize for  developing the process and industrializing its use. "Nationwide  application of the process is being promoted by the state  commission for science and technology," Feng said.    "We concentrate on what is most urgently needed by the  country and enterprises -- that's the secret of our success," he  said, adding that since 1984, the institute has won national  prizes for nine scientific accomplishments.    Next in importance to psa is a method that reduces use of  natural gas from 1,200 cubic meters for producing a ton of  ammonia to 850.    The method is specifically meant for synthetic ammonia  plants  with a production capacity of less than 50,000 tons a year.  There are more than 1,000 such plants throughout China,  including about 80 in Sichuan Province.    "If the method is used in all Sichuan plants, that will save  an annual average of 400 million cubic meters of gas and 250  million kwh of electricity," Feng said.</p>

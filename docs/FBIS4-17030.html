Our correspondent Sakit Ochakhly  reports:    [Begin Ochakhly recording] New U.S. Ambassador Richard  Kozlaric presented his credentials to Geydar Aliyev at the  presidential residence today. The ambassador noted that as the  official representative of the United States in Azerbaijan he  will do everything to develop bilateral ties in a healthy spirit  and broaden ties in the social, political, scientific, and  cultural fields.    Kozlaric also stated that in his new post he will use every  means to objectively convey the developments in Azerbaijan to  the international community, primarily to the country he  represents, and to speedily end the conflict between Azerbaijan  and Armenia. He also said that the agreement to be signed with  Azerbaijan's oil company will open a new phase in economic  cooperation.    President Aliyev congratulated Kozlaric on his appointment  as  the U.S. ambassador to our Republic and wished him success in  such a responsible task. The president noted that the  development of diplomatic relations with a great country like  the United States would help to establish closer ties between  the two peoples.    Aliyev briefed the new ambassador on the sociopolitical  situation in Azerbaijan, Armenia's aggressive policy, and the  results of the meeting of CIS heads of state in Moscow. He  noted that everyone knows the problems faced by a country 20  percent of the land of which has been occupied and that has over  1 million refugees, yet the United States has imposed an embargo  on humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan.

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Good news for the few - Pibs The good news is that owners of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's permanent interest-bearing shares will be entitled to a flat-rate payout of Pounds 500 and about 13 per cent of the balance (subject to a maximum balance of Pounds 100,000). The bad news is that very few private individuals hold C&amp;G Pibs, which were issued in denominations of Pounds 50,000 in October 1992. In any case, to qualify, you would need to have bought the Pibs before the end of December 1992 - and hold them to the day the proposed takeover of C&amp;G by Lloyds bank takes place some time in the summer of 1995. News of the restructured deal for C&amp;G customers on Thursday (see page V) had little effect on the price of C&amp;G Pibs, according to Hoare Govett's Peter Capel. He said the spread - the difference between buying and selling - of C&amp;G Pibs had tightened recently in anticipation of the proposed merger. Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital. They have no maturity date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed. Since they are irredeemable, investors can get back their money only by selling them on the open market. In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date. Pib-holders are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up and are not covered by a compensation scheme. But even though the market is relatively small and illiquid - the sort of market in which institutions rather than individuals are more usually to be found - private investors have been attracted to Pibs because of their relatively high yields, as the table shows. These yields are, generally, linked to the gilts market; but, since building societies are considered a less reliable issuer than the government, the Pibs yields are relatively higher. 'The steepness of the yield curve means that Pibs continue to offer yields in excess of 10 per cent,' said Capel. 'This compares very favourably with the most recent Bank of England inflation report, which forecast that the underlying rate of inflation will peak between 3-4 per cent in the first quarter of 1995.' Variations in the price differentials between different Pibs are due to building society factors. Those that are regarded as a better credit risk tend to have lower yields than others. If the C&amp;G/Lloyds merger goes through, prices for Pibs of other building societies - particularly those deemed merger candidates - are expected to benefit. These include Bristol &amp; West, Coventry, Skipton, Leeds &amp; Holbeck, and Cheshire.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                   Coupon     Minimum    Issue date                       (gross %)    (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires      9.38       1,000      16/12/93 Bradford &amp; Bingley       11.63      10,000       30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley       13.00      10,000       29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West           13.38       1,000      11/12/91 Bristol &amp; West           13.38       1,000      31/10/91 Britannia (1st)          13.00       1,000       13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)          13.00       1,000       8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs      11.75      50,000      21/10/92 Coventry                 12.13       1,000       28/5/92 First National           11.75      10,000        4/5/93 Halifax                  12.00      50,000       23/1/92 Halifax                   8.75      50,000        7/9/93 Leeds Permanent          13.63      50,000        3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck          13.38       1,000       31/3/92 Newcastle                12.63       1,000        8/9/92 Newcastle                10.75       1,000       15/6/93 North of England         12.63       1,000       23/6/92 Skipton                  12.88       1,000       27/2/92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                Issue price     Price*        Yield*                         (pence)     (pence)     (gross, %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires    100.17       87.25         10.74 Bradford &amp; Bingley      100.20      114.00         10.20 Bradford &amp; Bingley      100.13      125.25         10.38 Bristol &amp; West          101.79      126.25         10.60 Bristol &amp; West          100.34      126.25         10.60 Britannia (1st)         100.42      123.25         10.55 Britannia (2nd)         107.13      123.25         10.55 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     100.96      116.50         10.10 Coventry                100.75      116.25         10.50 First National          100.25      102.50         11.46 Halifax                 100.28      118.75         10.11 Halifax                 100.62       87.75          9.97 Leeds Permanent         100.00      132.50         10.28 Leeds &amp; Holbeck         100.23      125.00         10.70 Newcastle               100.45      119.25         10.77 Newcastle               100.32      101.38         10.60 North of England        100.14      119.25         10.59 Skipton                 100.48      120.25         10.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett. *Purchase price as at August 11; excludes accrued interest  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Growth in retail sales slows down ahead of tax rises UK retail sales grew only slowly in March, according to the latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The survey will be seen as further evidence that consumers have become cautious ahead of this month's tax increases. Official retail sales figures will be published by the Central Statistical Office on Thursday. The consensus forecast among analysts is for a 0.3 per cent volume increase between February and March, giving an annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent. If the retail sales figures announced on Thursday are weak, hopes of an early interest rate cut will increase. The recently published minutes of meetings between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, showed that the chancellor was worried about the potential impact of this month's tax increases on the recovery. Mr Clarke and Mr George agreed at their meeting on March 2 that signs of weakening in the recovery, provided they were accompanied by news that inflation was under control, might herald a cut. Friday's statistics on retail prices, which showed a fall in underlying inflation to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in March, met one of the necessary conditions. The CBI survey shows that the balance of retailers reporting an increase in sales in March, compared with a year ago, was 12 percentage points. The balances in early 1994 have been much lower than the levels of 20-30 points recorded in the second half of 1993. Figures are calculated by deducting the proportion of those experiencing a decrease in sales from those reporting an increase. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel, said 'the modest growth in retail sales in March is perhaps a further indicator of the uncertainty facing consumers'.

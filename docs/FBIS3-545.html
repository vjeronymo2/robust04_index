Shortly before  leaving the Mozambican capital, that OAU official said he was  hopeful that peace would become a reality in this country.  Salim Ahmed Salim rejected the possibility that Mozambique  might become a second Angola and noted that conditions in the  two countries are rather different.    The OAU secretary general was seen off by Mozambican Foreign  Affairs Minister Pascoal Mocumbi. At a meeting with  representatives of donor countries in Maputo yesterday, Salim  Ahmed Salim called on them to follow the Mozambican peace  process with greater patience and understanding. He said,  however, that he understood why the international community is  applying pressure on the two sides for greater flexibility in  the implementation of the General Peace Accord. The OAU  secretary general noted that it would be important for  Mozambique to continue receiving aid even after elections have  been held. Salim Ahmed Salim assured the representatives of the  international community in Maputo that his organization will  continue to be involved in the Mozambican peace process.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 1989 RETROSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> QUAKE AFTERSHOCKS  </P> <P> The deadly consequences of the Bay Area temblor shook the Southland, spurring  fund-raising drives and a call for public measures to better prepare  earthquake-prone Los Angeles for what scientists believe is the inevitable. As  recently as last April, Los Angeles voters had rejected a $100-million bond  issue that would have brought an estimated 15,000 brick buildings -- many of  them in the city's poorest neighborhoods -- up to earthquake-safety standards.  A similar measure will now be placed on next year's municipal ballot and city  officials say they will push more strongly for its passage. Moreover, an  earthquake-safety committee has been appointed by the Los Angeles City Council  to identify additional unsound structures and find sources to finance their  repair.  </P></p>

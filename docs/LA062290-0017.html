			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLO TO PROBE RAID ON ISRAEL BY GUERRILLAS;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: BUT PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE THE U.S. SUSPENSION OF TALKS BECAUSE OF THE  SPLINTER GROUP'S BEACH ATTACK.  </P> <P> The Palestine Liberation Organization on Thursday angrily denounced the  suspension of its 18-month-old dialogue with the United States as "a test to  the Arabs' will of resistance," but it said it has agreed to investigate the  guerrilla raid that led to the rupture.  </P> <P> In directing an investigative committee to look at the May 30 attack on an  Israeli beach by a PLO splinter group, the organization's leadership said it is  "reaffirming its commitment . . . to the declaration to renounce terrorism, all  forms of terrorism."  </P> <P> A PLO official said the statement from the PLO Executive Committee implies that  the PLO, through its governing national council, is prepared to denounce the  raid and take action against the guerrilla leader who executed it -- a member  of the committee -- if the investigation concludes that the raid violated the  organization's historic commitment renouncing terrorism.  </P> <P> "This is the first time that the PLO in an official statement says in relation  to the beach operation . . . that if it proves to be a breach of the resolution  of the PNC (Palestine National Council), it's going to be denounced, and  disciplinary actions will be taken," said the official, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> However, in its response to President Bush's announcement Wednesday that he is  suspending the dialogue unless such denunciation and punishment occurs, the PLO  also struck a defiant tone. It pledged to escalate the Palestinian uprising in  the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and urged international leaders  to take a "responsible position" against the American decision.  </P> <P> "The PLO is calling for a confrontation to stand against this American  decision," the executive committee said. "Given its heroic and long-term  struggle, the PLO will refuse to kneel down again. The intifada, which is the  backbone, will be heightened and intensified, as this seems to be the natural  way of struggle against occupation, until the attainment of an independent  Palestinian state."  </P> <P> It was unlikely that the carefully worded reference to an investigation,  already alluded to privately by PLO officials in recent weeks, would be  sufficient to satisfy the conditions Bush set for a restoration of the  dialogue.  </P> <P> The statement, for example, disassociates the PLO from the failed beach raid  but still does not, for the present, condemn it.  </P> <P> "The PLO leadership has taken a very clear and responsible position vis-a-vis  the beach operation that was used by the American Administration as an excuse  to suspend the dialogue with the PLO, and the PLO has . . . disassociated  itself from that operation and is not responsible, (nor did) any of its  institutions or forces have anything to do with this operation," the statement  said.  </P> <P> "However, the committee also confirms that the Palestine National Council,  given that it is the highest source of authority that can investigate and the  highest form of authority for the executive committee" will investigate the  incident, the committee said. The statement goes on to say that "in this  respect, the PLO reaffirmed its commitment to . . . renounce terrorism, all  forms of terrorism."  </P> <P> Israeli forces intercepted 16 guerrillas sent by the Palestine Liberation  Front, a hard-line faction of the PLO, stopping some in their speedboats before  they reached shore and killing or capturing all of them. Israeli authorities  said the attackers had targeted the U.S. Embassy and civilians in the large  hotels near the beaches.  </P> <P> Bush, announcing the suspension, cited the PLO's failure to condemn the raid  beyond a vague statement denouncing attacks against civilians. He said the  dialogue would not be restored until the PLO took "the necessary steps,"  including condemning the operation, disassociating the organization from it and  beginning to take steps against front leader Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul  Abbas, a member of the PLO Executive Committee.  </P> <P> The new communique from the Executive Committee on Thursday night criticized  the United States for bowing to Israeli pressure to break off the dialogue  while allegedly ignoring "atrocities" committed by the Israelis against  Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "It is unfortunate to see that a superpower like the United States, which is  supposed to bear international responsibility for peace and security and  stability, is taking such a decision. The PLO is a central party to the Middle  East conflict and thus an essential partner to the peace process," the  committee said.  </P> <P> "Though this incident . . . was not targeted against civilians and not even a  single civilian was injured, we see that the double standard . . . is practiced  by the U.S. Administration," the statement added. "This decision of President  George Bush will really push the Israeli government and its leadership into  continuing its program of aggression and its policies of continuous murder  against the Palestinian people in the territories."  </P> <P> In Israel on Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir applauded the U.S.  decision.  </P> <P> "Today, after the United States has reached its conclusions, we cannot but  welcome it," he said in a radio interview. "I hope this suspension will not be  temporary, but will determine a new chapter in the U.S. attitude toward the  Middle East."  </P> <P> He cautioned that Bush's apparent willingness to talk to the PLO again if it  takes a strong stand against the failed beach raid "raises doubts that perhaps  the United States has not reached a clear conclusion that what we are indeed  talking about is a terrorist organization that never stopped terrorism for one  moment."  </P> <P> Officials in Cairo who are close to efforts to set up peace negotiations said  the suspension was designed not to deal the PLO out of the peace process, but  to pressure PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat into taking tighter control of the  occasionally wayward organization.  </P> <P> "The U.S. has to know that they (the PLO) are speaking with one voice, that  they're selling one company," said one source.  </P> <P> But Arab diplomats predicted that Arafat, under pressure from radicals opposed  to the peace negotiations, would be hard-pressed to make any additional  concessions to the United States.  </P> <P> "Arafat is being squeezed so hard he can't give any more," said one Egyptian  official.  </P> <P> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who has attempted to broker direct talks  between Israelis and Palestinians in Cairo over the subject of elections in the  occupied territories, issued a relatively mild expression of "regret" at the  suspension of the U.S. dialogue, an indication, some Western diplomats  speculated, that Arab states may not be willing to fall in line behind any PLO  demands for radical Arab resistance.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, PLO information department spokesman Jamil Hilal had called on  Arab states to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions against the United  States.  </P> <P> "Egypt sees that, regardless of various evaluations of the PLO's stance,  certain circumstances and the increasing rigidity of Israel's position have  resulted in the freezing of the peace efforts," the Egyptians said. They urged  a speedy resumption of the dialogue "to maintain the interests of all the  people of the area in progressing toward peace and stability and halting  violence, tension and suffering."  </P> <P> Privately, one Egyptian official close to the peace negotiations expressed hope  that Arafat would eventually move to condemn the May 30 raid.  </P> <P> "Basically, the Palestinians should have the nerve and the guts not to be  provoked by this," he said. "In this case, a further compromise by the PLO  should not be considered a result of pressure, but rather a result of keeping  the good work going."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Daniel Williams, in Jerusalem, contributed to this report.  </P></p>

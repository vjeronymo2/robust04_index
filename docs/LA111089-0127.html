			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY OPENS BORDERS; WALL HAS 'NO MORE MEANING';  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: THOUSANDS TEST THE NEW POLICY BY CROSSING TO WEST BERLIN. THEY'RE  WELCOMED WITH CHEERS AND SONG.  </P> <P> The East German government threw open its borders Thursday and announced that  its citizens now may travel freely to West Germany. Thousands of jubilant East  Germans quickly tested the new policy by flocking to the crossing points in  divided Berlin.  </P> <P> At Checkpoint Charlie, a major crossing point, a huge crowd gathered. As East  Berliners in small groups made their way through the last barrier to West  Berlin, the crowds on that side welcomed them with cheers and songs.  </P> <P> East German border guards, who obviously had no instructions on the new border  policy, generally waved them through with puzzled smiles.  </P> <P> "I'm watching history being made," said one West Berlin bystander.  </P> <P> It was like New Year's Eve or a World Series victory celebration at this and  other border crossings along the Berlin Wall. Late Thursday and early today,  hundreds of people climbed atop the grim, grafitti-marred structure, long the  symbol of the Iron Curtain dividing East and West. Some of them danced for joy  there.  </P> <P> The new border policy was explained by Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who  told a news conference here that East Germans would "promptly" be given permits  to go to West Germany. He said they could stay there if they wish, or return to  East Germany.  </P> <P> "This means that the Berlin Wall has no more meaning," an East German official  said Thursday night.  </P> <P> "The long-awaited day has arrived," declared West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper.  "The Berlin Wall no longer divides Berlin."  </P> <P> Crowds swarmed through the streets long after midnight, auto horns blared,  police sirens pierced the air, couples walked hand in hand toward the wall and  people laughed and smiled, offering each other open wine and beer bottles.  </P> <P> Some East Germans arriving at border crossings at Invalidenstrasse and  Prinzstrasse in their small, sputtering Trabant autos were almost prevented  from entering by the crowds gathered to greet them. But they made their way  through to West Berlin's bright lights.  </P> <P> Remarkably, many of the East Berliners returned later today to the drab, gray  Eastern half of the city after sampling the bright lights of the West.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to take a look at the Kurfuerstendamm," said one young man in  his 20s, as he returned from West Berlin's famous shopping district and headed  back through the wall to East Berlin.  </P> <P> From their side, hundreds of West Berliners crossed into East Berlin, shouting,  "The wall is gone, the wall is gone!"  </P> <P> A huge crowd gathered next to the Reichstag building at the Brandenburg Gate --  the traditional scene of anti-wall demonstrations by West Berliners and the  place where President John F. Kennedy uttered his famous line, "Ich bin ein  Berliner."  </P> <P> Many people climbed atop the wall there. At 3 a.m., lights at the gate were  still blazing as the crowd called out: "Open the gate!"  </P> <P> Beyond Berlin, as one analyst here put it: "This news is deeply significant. It  changes the whole shape of Europe. It will take a while for the import of this  to sink in."  </P> <P> In the euphoria of Thursday night, there were few formalities for those surging  through the checkpoints in Berlin.  </P> <P> But beginning this morning, East Germans will be expected under the new open  policy to get exit visas for travel abroad, whether permanent emigration or  just a visit.  </P> <P> They will be allowed to go through any crossing point in the Berlin Wall except  Checkpoint Charlie, which is reserved for foreigners and military personnel.  </P> <P> Whether emigrating or just visiting, they also may enter West Germany through  the various crossings along the fortified inner-German frontier.  </P> <P> West Germans long have been free to travel to East Germany by simply arriving  at the border, paying a small fee and exchanging some West German money for  East German currency.  </P> <P> Schabowski, the spokesman for East Germany's Politburo, was asked about tearing  down the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> "The opening of the wall does not answer its real purpose," he said. "There is  still a whole complex of questions that will have to be discussed."  </P> <P> He mentioned the state of the opposing military alliances in Europe -- the  Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- and progress on arms  control as factors bearing on the ultimate fate of the Wall.  </P> <P> In Bonn, officials said that though East German emigrants are inundating the  country, West Germany will accept all East Germans arriving there.  </P> <P> "No one will be turned back," Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.  </P> <P> Schaeuble warned that new arrivals can expect poor housing for a long time to  come -- in what was seen as an effort to discourage the flood of immigrants.  </P> <P> "For this reason," he said, and because of the cold season, every German from  East Germany should think carefully before they come here."  </P> <P> A session of the West German Parliament broke into the national anthem on  hearing the news from East Berlin about opening the borders.  </P> <P> Bundestag member Willy Brandt, the former chancellor who was mayor of West  Berlin in 1961 when the Berlin Wall went up, wept openly.  </P> <P> The stunning news came after another tumultuous day in East Berlin during the  three-day meeting of the policy-making Communist Party Central Committee.  </P> <P> The Central Committee announced Thursday that there will be a special  Parliament meeting Monday to approve the newly appointed reformist Prime  Minister Hans Modrow.  </P> <P> The Central Committee also called a rare meeting of the Communist Party  Conference for Dec. 15-17 to discuss the economic, political and social crises  swamping the country.  </P> <P> An economic slowdown has been compounded by the flight of about 225,000 East  Germans so far this year.  </P> <P> West German estimates of those East Germans wishing to depart range from  400,000 to 1.2 million -- in a nation of 16.6 million.  </P> <P> Travel restrictions helped spark the massive demonstrations that brought East  Germans out in unprecedented numbers onto the streets of East Berlin, Leipzig,  Dresden, Halle, Schwerin and other cities.  </P> <P> In his briefing on the lifting of travel restrictions, Schabowski said, "The  decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave the country  through East German crossing points."  </P> <P> Schabowski's announcement seemed almost impromptu: He did not read from the  prepared text he was given shortly before the briefing and seemed vague about  some details.  </P> <P> But he indicated that East Germans can take their identity cards to their local  police station and apply for exit visas. Thus, they would not need passports,  which not many East Germans have.  </P> <P> The exit visas, Schabowski said, will be issued without red tape or demanding a  reason for the travel.  </P> <P> Similarly, he said those wishing to emigrate would be treated with dispatch.  </P> <P> The decision, Schabowski said, will ease East German relations with Communist  neighbor Czechoslovakia because emigrants no longer will be forced to pass  through that country en route to the West.  </P> <P> Curiously, some opposition elements in East Berlin did not applaud the  Communist leaders' decision to open up travel to the West.  </P> <P> Hans-Peter Schneider, a leader of the small opposition group Democratic  Awakening, declared: "I doubt that it is a step that will keep the people here.  I would have preferred it if they had said take your passport and get a visa  and come back to us.  </P> <P> "I think this step is a sign of the helplessness of our leaders."  </P> <P> But for thousands of Germans, it was a sign of hope.  </P> <P> About 2 a.m., an animal trainer walked through Checkpoint Charlie with a big,  brown muzzled bear on a leash.  </P> <P> "The bear is a symbol of Berlin," he said, "A united Berlin. We are now one  city."  </P> <P> "We couldn't believe we could get out," said one man who crossed with his wife.  "We just wanted to try it. But we will return."  </P> <P> Most people on foot and in cars appeared to have little baggage with them,  indicating they planned to go back to the East -- in contrast to those who fled  through Hungary and Czechoslovakia carrying all their family belongings.  </P> <P> One woman who had been watching the drama for two hours said: "The Vopos (East  German police) don't know what to do. So they have just been waving people  through."  </P> <P> Another man said: "A Vopo gave me a cigarette. I am keeping it as a souvenir.  Ordinarily they would take your picture to put you on the blacklist."  </P> <P> A bearded West Berliner, watching the amazing sight of East Berliners coming  through the border crossing, said, "It looks like the Berlin Wall is going to  be a relic -- just like the one in China."  </P> <P> REASSESSMENT -- Washington to reassess policy on German reunification.

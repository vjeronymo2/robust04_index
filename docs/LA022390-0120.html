			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA TRADES;  </P> <P> STEVE JOHNSON GOES TO SUPERSONICS  </P> <P> Disgruntled center Steve Johnson, who has feuded with Minnesota management  since being picked third in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, was traded Thursday  night to Seattle in exchange for forward Brad Sellers.  </P> <P> The Timberwolves also would give Seattle their 1991 second-round draft pick if  they make a contract offer to Sellers by July 1 or if they sign Sellers to a  contract that covers at least the 1990-91 season, according to the  Timberwolves.  </P> <P> Sellers, the former Ohio State star who was the No. 1 pick of the Chicago Bulls  in the 1986 draft, is averaging 4.8 points and 1.6 rebounds in 45 games this  season.  </P> <P> The SuperSonics acquired the 7-foot, 227-pound Sellers from Chicago in exchange  for Seattle's first-round draft pick in 1989.  </P> <P> Johnson, who often has asked to be traded this season, has not scored while  playing only 17 minutes in four games for Minnesota.  </P> <P> Johnson was the No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Kings in the 1981 draft. He also  played with Chicago, San Antonio and Portland.  </P> <P> Other centers were on the move as well, as the Charlotte Hornets traded former  UCLA 7-footer Stuart Gray to the New York Knicks for a second-round draft pick  in 1991.  </P> <P> And, in a exchange of West German 7-footers, the Golden State Warriors sent Uwe  Blab to the San Antonio Spurs for Christian Welp.  </P> <P> Gray, obtained from Indiana for Charlotte's second-round pick in the 1989  draft, was expected to be the answer to Charlotte's woes in the middle, but he  averaged only 2.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 39 games.  </P></p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Sumitomo of Japan and Norway's Hydro Aluminium group are joining forces to exploit expected growth in the use of aluminium by the world's motor industry, writes John Griffiths in London. A general co-operation agreement has been signed in Norway between Sumitomo Light Metals, a leading supplier to the Japanese car industry, and Hydro's aluminium extrusion group, whose main markets are in Europe and North America. The launch of Audi's A8 luxury car, the first fairly high-volume car with an all-aluminium body, has encouraged forecasts that industry use of the material will soar.</p>

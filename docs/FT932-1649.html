			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Growing signs of economy bottoming out A CLUTCH of economic statistics published yesterday added further weight to claims that the Japanese economy is bottoming out after a two-year decline. A wide-ranging quarterly survey conducted by the Finance Ministry found that business confidence improved markedly in the second quarter of the year, the second consecutive quarter of improvement. The Economic Planning Agency said the economy was bottoming out in its commentary on its index of leading indicators, which stood at 70 per cent in April. It was the fourth consecutive month the index has stood at more than 50 per cent. A reading of less than that is taken to forecast a deterioration in the economy. The cautious optimism in the surveys may be encouraged by the yen's sudden weakening in the past few days in response to the political turmoil triggered by the defeat of the government in a no-confidence vote last Friday. The yen closed at Y111.25 against the dollar, down Y0.77 from its close on Monday. The fall in the currency will be welcomed by exporters. Another government survey found household spending in April was slightly higher than the same month last year, the second consecutive monthly improvement. However, both the EPA and the Finance Ministry stressed it was too early to say that the economy was starting to recover even if it was bottoming out. Personal consumption remains depressed, capital investment is being cut and in the longer run political instability could throw in doubt the government's ability to support the economy with further fiscal measures after the July 18 election. The Finance Ministry's May survey of business confidence among 4,673 manufacturing companies put the index of business sentiment at minus 12.2 compared with minus 20 in the February survey. Large companies expect business conditions to recover from the final three months of this year. Profits in the first half of the financial year to next April will fall slightly compared with last year, but this drop will be more than offset by a profits recovery in the second half of the year, the survey found. Companies' worries about whether they are carrying excess labour are also easing. About 8.7 per cent of companies in the May survey said they were carrying excess labour compared with 9.3 per cent in the February survey. The rise in the EPA's leading index to 70 per cent was due to a rise in housing orders, demand for consumer durables and the money supply. Household spending rose by 1.6 per cent in real terms in April, compared with the same month last year.</p>

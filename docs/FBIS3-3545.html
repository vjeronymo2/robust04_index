During his recent visit to the island, he urged local  officials to build well the country's largest special economic  zone.    Hainan is also China's second largest island after Taiwan.    From March 9 to 15, the 87-year-old Yang, accompanied by  Hainan provincial leaders, inspected an international airport  now still under construction in Sanya, a tourist attraction, and  a farm for returned overseas Chinese at Xinglong.    At Haikou, the provincial capital, Yang visited two Taiwan  funded companies and hoped Taiwan investment to increase on the  island.    This was Yang's fourth inspection of Hainan. He said every  time he was surprised by the island's great changes in urban  outlook and economic and cultural development.    He encouraged Hainan's residents to concentrate on building  up infrastructural facilities, for transportation in particular,  and make proper arrangements of its urban development and  industrial locations so as to develop the provincial economy and  social undertakings in a coordinated way.</p>

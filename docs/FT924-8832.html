			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Rate cut hopes lift short-dated end A STRONG view that interest rates will come down as part of a package of measures to accompany this week's Autumn Statement was behind the continued rise in prices for short-dated gilts, although longer-maturing securities saw something of a setback. Although the thought that base rates are almost certain to come down from their current 8 per cent bolstered the market, there was also some concern that Thursday's statement from the Treasury will produce bigger than expected projections for the public spending borrowing requirement for the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 financial years. Such a development would probably depress prices because of the implications that a large amount of gilt funding might be needed over the next two years. Such worries had little impact on slowing the recent steady rise in prices at the short end of the market, where yields for most classes of gilts fell by around 50 basis points. That tied in with the feeling that base rates are set to come down to perhaps 7 per cent this week and possibly to as low as 5 per cent by early next year, in a bid by the government to get the economy moving and end the two-year recession. For longer dated securities, however, yields stayed generally unmoved on the week, a result of lingering fears that the recent devaluation of sterling and the interest rate cuts that may be in the pipeline could unleash some upsurge in inflation in the medium term. According to Mr James Barty, an economist at Morgan Grenfell in London, such fears may be founded on an incorrect view of how the atmosphere for wage rises throughout the economy will develop. He reckons that underlying inflation - as measured by the retail price index less the effect of mortgage interest payments - is likely to accelerate somewhat over the next year. It might edge up to a year-on-year rate of just over 4 per cent by the end of 1993, above the current 4 per cent. However, headline inflation - measured by the RPI by itself - will continue to be extremely weak due to the effects of likely cuts in mortgage rates feeding their way into the calculation of the index. That, Mr Barty thinks, should keep headline inflation down to 2 per cent or less for much of next year, giving wage bargainers few reasons to push for large increases in pay. That would help the current climate of disinflation. As a result, prospects for prices at the long end of the yield curve could be distinctly better than some in the markets now believe, with yields being kept correspondingly low. However, this prediction - which involves a flattening of the yield curve, the opposite of what has happened in recent weeks in which the curve has become progressively more upward-sloping - could be blown off course by the large rises in the PSBR being postulated for the next year or so. While the Treasury's Budget forecast in March was for a deficit for 1992-1993 of Pounds 28bn, many economists reckon the updated forecast coming out on Thursday will be for about Pounds 35bn, while the PSBR for the year after could rise to nearly Pounds 50bn. The large amounts of gilts that the Treasury would be forced to issue could push down yields at virtually all parts of the curve. As though with an eye on the future funding needs, the Bank of England announced on Friday that Pounds 1bn of long-dated gilts are to be issued from today. They are 8 per cent Treasury stock due 2009 and will sell for 94.75. Of this, 25 per cent will be payable immediately, 35 per cent on December 14 and 34.75 per cent on February 1993. The first dividend of 1.9834 sterling will be paid on March 25 1993. An additional Pounds 200m of the stock will be reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.</p>

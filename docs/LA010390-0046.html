			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW &amp; USEFUL: LIGHTING UP THE VIDEOTAPES  </P> <P> Seeking to sharpen up your videotapes? Consider SensorLight, a cordless  camcorder light that, its manufacturers say, can double the time of similar  rechargeable units, providing up to 40 minutes of illumination.  </P> <P> Recently introduced by Sima Products Corp., a Skokie, Ill., manufacturer of  video and photographic products, SensorLight also features a built-in computer  circuit that reads the light in an area and adjusts the brightness to produce  the right illumination for sharp videotapes.  </P> <P> It attaches to a camcorder shoe-mount and is powered by a rechargeable  six-volt, nickel-cadmium power pack. It also can run on any of the Sony-type  camcorder batteries and comes with a UL-approved battery charger.  </P> <P> Suggested retail for SensorLight is $179.95. It's available nationally at video  stores and electronics specialty outlets. In the Los Angeles area, you can find  it at Adray's, Dow Stereo, Fedco and Rogersound Labs. If you can't locate  SensorLight in your area, contact Sima Products Corp.. 8707 N. Skokie Blvd.,  Skokie, Ill. 60077; phone, (312) 679-7462.  </P> <P> Getting a Lock on Household Repairs  </P> <P> If you have some fixing up to do around the house and plan to use your  battery-powered, cordless screwdriver, you might also want to have a LockBit, a  key-less drill-chuck. It holds conventional round drill bits up to 1/4-inch in  diameter, so you can use the screwdriver as a drill.  </P> <P> Manufactured by WorkTools Inc., the LockBit, with its hex shank, fits all the  popular cordless screwdrivers, its manufacturer says.  </P> <P> The LockBit is available by mail order from WorkTools for $7.50, which includes  shipping and handling. Contact WorkTools Inc., 20759 Plummer St., Chatsworth,  Calif. 91311; phone, (818) 407-1503.  </P> <P> Smoking Out New Year's Resolutions  </P> <P> Did a friend or relative just make a New Year's resolution to quit smoking? You  might offer some help with the CigArrest Stop Smoking Starter Kit, which sells  for a little more than a carton of smokes.  </P> <P> The money-back-guaranteed CigArrest kit is nonprescription and has no nicotine  products. It includes 15 smoking deterrent tablets (containing lobeline  sulfate, which is derived from the tobacco plant and mimics tobacco's effects,  although it's nonaddictive), seven multivitamin pills, a behavior modification  audio tape and a manual with tips on how to stop smoking in seven days.  </P> <P> A sample piece of smoking alternative gum is also included by the manufacturer,  More Direct Health Products of Carlsbad. The kit retails for $19.95; a 24-piece  packet of gum, $9.95. Additional packages of 15 tablets and 42 vitamins are  sold separately for $9.95 each.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, the kits can be found at K mart, Fedco, CVS, Longs and  Sav-on drugstores and Alpha Beta markets. If you can't find them in your area  contact CigArrest marketing firm, Advantage Life Products, 26051 Merit Circle,  Laguna Hills 92654. California residents may call (714) 582-0035; out-of-state,  (800) 548-8663.  </P> <P> Take a Swing at Better Putting  </P> <P> An Arizona firm has introduced Putt-Par-Fectour, a new indoor device to help  golfers practice and improve their putting.  </P> <P> It's endorsed by PGA tour pro Don Pooley, who ranked Nos. 2 and 1 in 1987 and  '88, and tied for third in '89 in the golf association's putting statistics.  </P> <P> Pooley said the device helps putting alignment and perfects a consistent  stroke.  </P> <P> The putting board has a five-foot long, simulated grass surface with a steel  base that can be raised on one end to simulate longer putts. White edges on the  sides of the board are used as guides to keep the putter blade on a parallel  path throughout the stroke.  </P> <P> Putt-Par-Fectour costs $39.95, plus $5.75 for shipping and handling, and can be  ordered from Align-Rite Co., 1942 E. 17th St., Tucson, Ariz., 85719; phone,  (602) 624-4438.

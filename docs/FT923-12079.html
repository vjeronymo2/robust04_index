			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Mortgage rate rise too great a price for bond THE SUCCESS of the government's First Option Bond has embarrassed the Treasury, so the Department of National Savings last night took the unusual step of seeking to make the bond less attractive by cutting the rates offered on it. National Savings has been under pressure from the government to compete against financial-services companies. But at the same time building societies have been complaining that heavy sales of the new bond could lead to a rise in mortgage rates. Given the weakness of the housing market and fears that a recovery is some way off, a mortgage-rate rise - however small  -is anathema to the government. On the other hand, substantial sales of the bond would have helped fund its public sector borrowing requirement - forecast to rise to around Pounds 35bn this year - but a mortgage-rate increase was too high a price. The cut in the bond rate, at a time when market interest rates are firm, is almost without precedent. The only comparison was in the summer of 1984, when the 28th National Savings issue was withdrawn after just five weeks, having taken more than Pounds 1bn. Sales of the latest bond have not been quite as strong as that. It has taken Pounds 112m in the nine days since its launch on July 7. But that is still significant for a new product. The bond can be cashed in without any interest penalties after only a year and it therefore competes directly with many building-society products. The 10.34 per cent gross rate it paid at launch was significantly more than has been available at many societies. The bond has thus apparently been siphoning deposits from building societies, which could ill afford the outflow. According to figures to be published by the Building Societies Association on Wednesday, Pounds 315m flowed out of societies' deposit accounts in June, before the bond was launched. In order to retain their savers, societies have been forced to push up savings rates - which has also put pressure on them to increase mortgage rates, to prevent an erosion of profits. On Friday, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the sixth-biggest society, raised its home-loans rate from 10.75 per cent to 10.99 per cent. Other societies, notably the Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-biggest, warned they would probably follow suit. But the societies were not only complaining in public. They were also lobbying behind the scenes. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said last night that he met two Treasury ministers - he declined to say which two  -on Friday to explain why his society had found it necessary to raise its interest rates. He added: 'They were understanding and sympathetic. I explained that our move was entirely investment-related and they fully understood where we were coming from.' Today he will decide whether to reduce his mortgage rate to where it was. Other societies said last night that the reduction in the First Option Bond rate, to 9.67 per cent, had reduced the pressure on them for increases in their mortgage ratea - although they stressed that they would nonetheless need to wait to see whether the outflow of deposits is stemmed before making a definitive decision. If societies are pleased with the First Opiton bond rate cut, some investors may not be. National Savings has been conducting a high-profile advertising campaign to attract investors. Anyone who sent in a National Savings coupon from a weekend newspaper will get the higher rate of interest only if the coupon arrives before noon. But if their form arrives too late, they will not be forced to invest at the lower rate. National Savings said it would send these investors a new prospectus, giving them the option of investing somewhere else altogether - perhaps in a building society.</p>

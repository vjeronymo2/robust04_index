			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As part of the storming and search campaigns  undertaken by the military and security forces, a Lebanese Army  unit last night stormed the housing project building belonging  to the former Lebanese Forces in the township of Burayj, Qada'  Jubayl. Large amounts of weapons and ammunition bearing Hebrew  lettering were seized.    Among the estimated four truck loads of weapons are 300 M-16  rifles, 20 RPG's, and 20 machine guns in addition to hand  grenades, radio equipment, and bullet-proof jackets.    Another Army unit this morning stormed a second Lebanese  Forces center in al-Nab'ah. Six 107-mm rockets were found on  the center's lower floor.    Security sources pointed out that the continuing possession  of weapons and ammunition caches and confessions by people  arrested in connection with the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime,  saying they were instructed to gather information on the  Lebanese Army centers in particular areas, again prove the bad  intentions behind this conduct.    Elsewhere, naval targets were monitored off the Jubayl and  Beirut coast today. This called for tightening security  measures among the Lebanese Army forces along the Lebanese coast  to prevent it from being used for illegal transportation.</p>

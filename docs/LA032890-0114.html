			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO SAVE MULHOLLAND VISTAS GETS  ENDORSEMENT  </P> <P> A plan to preserve the view from the city's most famous scenic roadway, the 22  miles of Mulholland Drive, was approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council  Planning and Land Use Management Committee.  </P> <P> The panel unanimously endorsed the plan after more than two hours of debate  between property owners, environmentalists and fans of the winding road on the  crest of the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> If adopted by the full council, the plan would regulate the height and location  of buildings, fences and walls along Mulholland Drive from the Hollywood  Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard. It also proposes construction of a bicycle  path and a trail along the roadside for walkers, joggers and equestrians.  </P> <P>  Landowners say the plan would rob them of their property rights by making  thousands of parcels virtually impossible to develop.  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Watchdog seeks Imro explanation THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment watchdog, has asked Imro, the self-regulatory body for fund managers, for a report explaining how it regulated investment companies owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The move comes as a parliamentary committee prepares to release its report on hearings into the Maxwell company pension schemes in which Imro (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) will bear the brunt of fierce criticism for regulatory failure. In particular, SIB wants to know why Imro approved Bishopsgate Investment Management as an occupational pension scheme member under section 191 of its rulebook - a section that subjected it to a much looser regulatory regime than other fund managers. Of Imro's roughly 1,200 members, 170 are in this category. Imro had initially intended section 191 to apply only to those trustees who managed investment business on a day-to-day basis. Eventually the category was extended to cover fund-management companies owned by the employer or 'any company whose relationship to the scheme was such that Imro felt this chapter should apply'. Of the nine directors of BIM, only four were pension-fund trustees and BIM was not owned by the companies whose pension schemes it managed. Thus, SIB has asked how Imro saw BIM as a suitable candidate for less stringent rules, particularly in light of its initial unease about approving the company. Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, said yesterday in an interview with the Financial Times that the self-regulatory body is reviewing its application of section 191 to pension fund managers. Meanwhile, Mr Morgan called for a new pensions act to clarify the obligations and duties of trustees and their relationship to investment business. 'It seems to me that it (a new pensions act) is inescapable,' Mr Morgan said. 'It is a bit simple-minded to argue that a few good ideas will solve everything.' There are signs of growing support within the City and the pensions industry for new pensions legislation. In particular, Mr Morgan is urging that a new act should contain reporting requirements under which trustees would have to report their investment plans to an independent body, such as the Occupational Pensions Board. These plans would have to be reviewed by auditors at the end of each year and their reports be submitted to the OPB. Additionally, he is urging that beneficiaries have an automatic right to receive reports of trustees, accountants and actuaries. Mr Morgan declined to be drawn on whether the government has a moral responsibility to make restitution to Maxwell company pensioners because its own regulatory system proved faulty. Pensioners are pressing for compensation, arguing that IMRO's failure to supervise BIM properly allowed assets to be siphoned off.</p>

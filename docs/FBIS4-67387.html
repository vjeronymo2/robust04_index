			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on a briefing held by the chairman of </F> Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, Mykhaylo Umanets;  place and date not given: "The Moratorium on Nuclear Power  Stations Is a Headache for the State" -- first paragraph  published in boldface]    [Text] In winter, the entire population felt the shortage  of energy. That we did not freeze to death is largely thanks to  the concerted work of the AES [nuclear power station]  collectives. In those months, they accounted for 40 percent of  the total electricity produced in Ukraine. All together over  the last year, AES's produced 75,238 million kilowatt/hours, or  33 percent of the total amount of electricity. Moreover, it  costs half of that produced by conventional power stations.  These figures were made public at a briefing held by the  chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy,  Mykhaylo Umanets.  <H5>  Nuclear Power Engineering </H5>   "We are pleased with the result," said Mykhaylo Umanets. "We  have not let the country down, and this is what matters. Are we  satisfied with the quality of our work? Safe operation is our  quality. Accidents were prevented from happening. It is true  that there were 11 incidents, but, in accordance with the  international scale of nuclear and radiation safety, they were  rated as incidents of first and second degrees, which do not  have in any unexpected consequences."    Mykhaylo Panteliyovych also regards the cancellation of the  moratorium on the building of new power units, something that  has undoubtedly opened up prospects to the industry, as a  victory of common sense over political intrigue. A decision was  also made to postpone the closure of the Chernobyl station.  This will make it possible to prepare more thoroughly for its  closure and, at the same time, have economic advantages. The  station will continue to produce the electricity that we need so  much for a few more years.    What all of this has cost us! Quite recently, the press  brought to the public's attention the desperate "SOS" by the  nuclear industry, which, while selling the cheapest electricity  to the state, did not have money to purchase fuel because of  customers' failure to pay for the energy; it also sounded the  alarm that specialists are leaving Ukraine's AES's en masse.  The reason is the lack of social protection and salaries, which  are lower than those in Russia.    It appears that this alarm was heard. At any rate, the  president issued an decree enabling nuclear specialists to  resolve many of the burning problems by exporting some of the  electricity. The fuel issue has also been taken off the agenda  for several years. The stations will receive the fuel from  Russia in exchange for nuclear warheads from strategic missiles.    Considerable changes for the better have also been achieved  in raising the level of the stations' operational safety. Over  recent years, hundreds of specialists have received training at  nuclear stations in Western countries. Recently a simulator  started working at the Zaporizhzhya AES, and operators of VVR  [water-water)-1,000 nuclear reactors will improve their  qualifications with its help. The installation of a simulator  presented to us by France will soon be completed at the  Khmelnytskyy AES.    Last year, for the first time, the Sevastopol Naval  Institute  admitted two groups of students to specialize in servicing  AES's. The majority of the students are residents of towns with  developed power engineering.    The price we have had to pay for the moratorium will long  remain a pain. Incidentally, it has not yet been determined  numerically in terms of money. However, it is known that, owing  to those politicians who rose high in their careers on  anti-nuclear wings, we have lost 4 billion pre-inflation rubles.  It is precisely such funding that Ukraine did not receive from  the Union budget, after it stopped work building units that were  at a high level of readiness.    This moratorium has now been canceled. Some people have  received political dividends from this and the state -- a  headache: Where, in our budget made up of holes, can we get  such astronomical sums? The sixth unit of the Zaporizhzhya AES  has to be commissioned this year. The second unit of the  Khmelnytskyy and the fourth of the Rivne stations must be  commissioned in 1996.    Nor will it be simple to fulfill this program in view of the  fact that the construction and assembly collectives have, in  fact, deserted the stations. Only superb specialists can and  have the right to build such facilities. However, not even  these problems are a matter of the greatest concern for  departmental heads. Given our political situation, the lack of  clarity is quite disturbing. Where are the guarantees that the  new parliament will not pass a law on a new moratorium?  Decisions to open or close the Chernobyl AES have been made  five times.  Despite everything, specialists are already looking to the  future: the construction of new-generation fast-neutron power  units, which are more economical and more reliable. Canadian,  U.S., French, and Japanese specialists are offering their  designs.    We have our own scientifically substantiated concept on  developing the industry under the headline of creating our own  nuclear cycle in Ukraine. Of course, it is an expensive  undertaking. However, it is worth the huge outlays, because not  only is it economically advantageous, but also politically  expedient, pointed out Mykhaylo Umanets.    "At present, fuel accounts for 64 percent of the cost of the  electricity produced by the nuclear stations," he reasoned.  "Calculations have shown that this percentage could be halved,  if we did not have to purchase that fuel abroad, considering  that Ukraine is already capable of extracting and enriching  uranium ore to a concentration of natural uranium. We send this  ore to Russian enterprises where the fuel elements are  manufactured. We also send zirconium there, from which the  holders for the cassettes are made. Incidentally, Ukraine used  to have a monopoly on the extraction and production of zirconium  within the USSR. Since we possess it and have specialists at  the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences who may ensure the scientific  implementation of the project, we simply have no moral right not  to use such a potential in the interests of our own state.  These outlays will eventually be returned a hundredfold.  Ukraine could lose its independence if it continues to receive  energy from neighboring states, which often use it to put  pressure on us.</p>

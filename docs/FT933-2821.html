			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS proposes quota plan to stem aluminium flood THE ALUMINIUM industry of the Commonwealth of Independent States has offered to start a quota system to reduce output as a gesture to ease tensions caused by exports to the west. The offer was made by Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, at the first face-to-face meetings with European Commission representatives in Brussels. Mr Prokopov said Concern Aluminiy envisaged a voluntary production quota system similar to the one attempted by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to reports about the meeting by European industry representatives. There are some fears among European producers, however, that CIS aluminium quotas might be as ineffective as those of Opec are proving to be at present. One senior European executive suggested the system would not work unless the CIS smelters actually shut down capacity. There is also some doubt about the influence Concern Aluminiy could bring to bear on individual smelters. Some reports suggest that two big Siberian smelters - Krasnoyarsk (800,000 tonnes annual capacity) and Bratsk (850,000 tonnes) - have dropped out of the consortium. The two smelters' managers are reported not to have attended the last meeting of Concern Aluminiy in June. Nevertheless, this gesture by the CIS industry will be seen by some observers as vindication of the highly criticised action by the European Commission to restrict CIS aluminium imports to the EC until the end of November. EC officials insist the restrictions were meant to be a political gesture to bring the CIS industry to the negotiating table and were not expected to have any impact on the total flow of aluminium from the CIS. At the meetings with Concern Aluminiy last week EC officials stressed the two-way nature of the talks. While they sought export restraint by the CIS producers, they pointed out the EC industry was ready and willing to help in the CIS with know-how, technology and even cash in certain circumstances. Strains between the EC and the CIS industry developed after annual exports to the west surged from 200,000 tonnes before 1990 to about 1m tonnes last year. Traders at this week's annual Metal Bulletin aluminium conference in Montreal made estimates of this year's CIS exports ranging from 1m to 2m tonnes. In the new spirit of growing glasnost between the EC and CIS industries, the Europeans are going out of their way to convince the CIS producers that they see them as equal partners in an industry no longer divided into 'east' and 'west'. This means that calculations about what is needed to restore a supply/demand balance to the aluminium market have had to be done again. As demand in the CIS has dropped so steeply - Mr Horst Peters of VAW estimated at the conference that in Russia alone it had slumped from 2.6m tonnes in 1988 to 1.8m tonnes last year - some observers now estimate that the combined industry needs to shut down at least another 1m tonnes of annual capacity, either permanently or until prices have recovered. Mr Louis Vincinguerra. a general partner at Banque Rothschild in France, said at the MB conference that 1.5m tonnes needed to go. EC officials said that more meetings with the CIS aluminium producers were planned before the end of September. 'It will be difficult, but we hope to reach a formal agreement before the end of November,' one said. Some in the EC industry suggest that, even if there was no full agreement by then, now that the Commission has the full attention of the CIS producers. there would be little purpose in continuing import restrictions.</p>

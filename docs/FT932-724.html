			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Travel: Guns 'n'pagodas - two faces of Burma / Simon Davies lets the train take the strain in an effort to see an area which foreigners are not encouraged to visit THE temple-bells are callin', an' it's there that I would be - By the old Moulmein Pagoda, looking lazy at the sea.  - Rudyard Kipling SADLY, the shrugged shoulders of Burmese officialdom told me that a modern-day Kipling would have to stay put in Rangoon. Moulmein is the largest city of southern Burma, and during the colonial days its port teemed with vessels laden with teak and rubber heading for the four corners of the empire. Foreigners have long been kept away from the area, as the government has been determined to segregate them from the disgruntled minority Mon and Karen inhabitants. However, the combination of a government campaign to procure tourist dollars and a lot of persistence eventually won me a ticket for the Moulmein Express. Trains are the most sensible form of transport in Burma, given the poor state of the roads and the track record of its airline. I was disappointed to find that Rangoon's grand post-colonial station, with its combination of Victorian awnings and Burmese towers, was actually orderly; a barbed wire fence separated hangers-on from the comparatively modern Korean train that awaited. The train departed on time, and there was an immediate change in atmosphere. A parade of turbanned caterers wearing the ubiquitous flip-flops and Burmese longyi (an extended teatowel with a myriad of patterns, which is wrapped around the waist), marched through the carriage offering anything from what looked like barbecued sparrows to a palatable chicken curry. 'Burmese people are always eating. Their problem is not that they are hungry, it is that they have little money and no freedom,' a man confided in Rangoon. It became immediately evident that starvation was not going to be a problem. Nor was isolation. Throughout Burma one reads government slogans on billboards proclaiming: 'Love your Motherland, Respect the Law', or: 'Only with Discipline can there be Progress', but this seems to have had little effect on the open and friendly temperament of the people. The train wound its way around the delta of the Sittang River, and then southwards. Village stations had a festive air, in spite of the wire fencing. Baskets of chrysanthemums, or earthenware pots of water, were balanced on heads and presented through the train window, as the platforms became market places on our arrival. The girls all had patterns marked on their faces with a mud-like paste, which I assumed to have some religious significance. I was informed, however, that it is the local form of make-up, made from a mix of bark and water. 'Very beautiful. Only lazy women don't wear it', a trishaw driver told me later. The journey was punctuated by the inevitable one-hour delay for locomotive repair. After 10 hours of paddy fields, pagodas and searing heat, the express train pulled through a breaker's yard for old British steam engines, and drew to a halt at Martaban. Across the Salween river, Moulmein lay shimmering, dominated by its old pagoda on the hill above the town. Within minutes of arrival, I was accosted by an excited immigration officer in a cowboy hat, who took me to the top of a two-tier British ferry and insisted that I fill in all manner of forms, which occupied the 20-minute crossing to the town. He was most concerned that I should not leave the city centre, since it was surrounded by 'black zones', where he said I might be shot at. After making numerous promises, and being introduced to his boss, I was then escorted to the Number 8 Guest House. The cowboy proudly pointed out that I would be sharing this with a famous Rangoon pop band called Aurora, but the cell-like rooms and mildewed shower stalls indicated that in Burma, pop stardom is not as it is in the West. I never encountered the band, but as the town's lone tourist I had my own difficulties seeking anonymity. A stroll to one of the outlying villages to see a pagoda resulted in my being taken on an escorted tour by the village headman, with 100 waving people parading behind. The focus of the city, which has a population or around 200,000, is its old Kyaikthanlan pagoda, which lies behind the town on a ridge of hills running parallel to the river. The soldier in Kipling's poem Mandalay looked down from here upon 'elephints a-pilin teak'. As a sign of the times, the biggest landmark now is the town's fortress-like prison. A Burmese whispered that it holds more than 5,000 people, many of them political prisoners. The elephants had gone, but little else can have changed. I looked over a line of hazy jungle-covered hills all topped with white pagodas, acres of lush palm trees, and a river crowded with small wooden sailing junks and old steamers. The pagoda was full of young monks playing hide-and-seek in their deep red robes, and schoolgirls chattering. There was not much meditation. One of the temples around the base of the bell-shaped golden pagoda even contained a small merry-go-round, with flashing lights and statues of Buddhas holding out bowls. The aim was to throw notes into the bowls. The winners earn merit, and one step further in the direction of Nirvana. I missed. The high ground above Moulmein definitely belongs to Buddha, with pagodas marking every hill top. But surprisingly, the town itself appears to have become the territory of Islam. The Indians, who were brought over from the British Raj to work the teak plantations in the late 19th century, have built a massive twin-towered mosque in the centre, and their presence was noticeable throughout. The houses along the high street were wooden-fronted, with bright colours contrasting with black wrought-iron balconies, and the streets were crowded with bullock carts and ancient buses. There were only two obvious concessions to a post-colonial era: a gun-boat on the Salween River and a comparatively modern cinema, showing the film Coolie Killer. The town's major focus is the covered market, stacked with cheap Chinese-made goods. The demand for western goods became painfully apparent when someone started negotiating a price for the shirt I was wearing. I set off for Kyaikto, to see the famous golden pagoda. The Kyaiktiyo pagoda is only 5ft high, but it is built on a giant gold-leaf-coated boulder which looks as though it should roll off the cliff on which it is perched. The reason it does not, legend has it, is because it is held up by a hair of the Buddha. For this reason, the four-hour hike up a steep incline is the Burmese equivalent of the Canterbury pilgrimage. An 83-year-old hiker assured me that I would gain significant merit from the ascent. What he could not explain was why all the stores along the path sold bamboo rocket launchers and guns, with the inscription 'Rambo', as toys for the children. My memories of Burma are of smiling faces, golden pagodas - and guns.</p>

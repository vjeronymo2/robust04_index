			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Jakarta (SUARA KARYA)--President Suharto has  praised the work of village Islamic centers as ideal educational  institutions. In these surroundings children not only study  during the school day but also go through an educational process  outside school hours. Indeed, in the village Islamic centers  education inside and outside the school is really one and the  same thing.    Integrating the process of instruction and education is very  important for raising a generation of people who are literate  and at the same time are of good moral character. The president  made this statement when he was opening the Fourth National  Conference of the Nahdatul Ulama (NU) League of Village Islamic  Centers and the First National Working Session of the NU  National Sports Institute at the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic  Center in West Java on 31 January.    The opening portion of the program at this rather modern  village Islamic center in the prosperous residential area of  West Jakarta was washed out by a heavy rain. However, religious  officials attending the event, who came from a number of village  Islamic centers throughout Indonesia, were not discouraged.  Among these officials were K.H. Zainuddin and R.H. Oma Irama,  who arrived at the same time in the midst of a heavy downpour  and received special applause from those attending the program.    The president said that in handling future community  development it is hoped that the role of the League of Village  Islamic Centers will increase in importance, so that it will be  more and more mature, particularly in view of the government's  intention to increase the length of required school attendance  to nine years.    According to the chief of state, village Islamic centers  have  done a great deal to develop national life. The fact that the  village Islamic centers are located throughout Indonesia and  that their educational charges are low has greatly helped  village children in their studies. This is especially the case  since more than a few village Islamic centers have carried on  formal educational programs, not only at the pre-school level  373 but have also functioned as public schools. The challenge  facing them is how to increase the quality of education and  instruction in these centers.    In view of the position and role of Muslim religious  officials in the community all of those present at the meeting  were happy to learn that a number of village Islamic centers are  actively engaged in community development. This situation is  really in accordance with the practice followed by village  Islamic centers, that is, integrating learning and practical  experience. For the village Islamic centers learning without  practical experience is the equivalent of "a tree which bears no  fruit." Therefore, the integration of practical experience and  learning is accomplished through community development activity.    Cooperation is needed in the effort to increase the role of  village Islamic centers in community development, between both  the village Islamic centers themselves and government and  private sector institutions. The president said that, in fact, a  great deal of pioneering work can be carried on by village  Islamic centers in the field of local community development,  particularly by raising the standard of living of the local  people. The chief of state said: "For example, what has been  done by the Asshiddiqiyah Village Islamic Center to help small  businessmen is a model for the direct involvement of village  Islamic centers in community development. These efforts must be  adapted to the respective, local situation. The League of  Village Islamic Centers can and must do a great deal to develop  and increase the role of village Islamic centers." [passage  omitted]    At the meeting Minister of Religious Affairs Tarmizi Taher  said that research on the position of village Islamic centers  needs to be carried out to determine both the strengths and  weakness of village Islamic centers, both as educational  institutions as well as centers for carrying on community  activity, in terms of missionary activity as well as in the  social and economic field. Honesty in self-evaluation at present  and in the past will help the leaders of the village Islamic  centers to identify future opportunities and demands,  particularly those of the 21st century, an era full of  challenges which cannot be anticipated in detail as yet.</p>

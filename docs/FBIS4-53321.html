			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- A House of Councillors panel  decided Tuesday [17 May] on a reform plan that would reduce the  number of seats in the upper house from the current 252 to 250,  parliamentary sources said.    The committee, comprised of representatives from all upper  house parliamentary groups, will complete the plan by May 24 and  draft a bill by the end of the month, they said.    Under the scheme, 150 upper house members would be elected  from prefectural constituencies and 100 through a proportional  representation system, sources said. Currently, 152 are chosen  from constituencies.    The panel has discussed reform in line with electoral system  changes made law in January, in which House of Representatives  seats would be reduced from the current 511 to 500.    The number of upper house seats was designed to be a half of  those in the lower house, the sources said.    The House of Councillors reform program also aims to level  the value of votes that differs from constituency to  constituency through readjusting the numbers of seats in eight  electoral districts, they said.    After readjustment, the maximum vote value disparity stands  at 4.81 to 1, compared with 6.48 to 1 as of 1990, they said.    Two seats would be added each in Gifu, Kanagawa, Miyagi and  Saitama prefectures, four seats would be reduced in Hokkaido and  two would be reduced each in Fukuoka, Hyogo and Kagoshima  prefectures, they said.    The new system also allows voters to vote for individual  candidates, and not only for political parties as in  proportional representation polling, they said.</p>

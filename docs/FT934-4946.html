			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: DTB sets date for Fibor future launch Germany's futures and options exchange, Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), plans to launch its long-awaited three-month interest rate contract, the Fibor future, on March 18. Seven designated market makers have signed up to trade the contract, which will be based on the Frankfurt inter-bank offered rate (Fibor): Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechselbank, BfG Bank, Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank and Dresdner Bank. The instrument will complete the DTB's range of products across the German yield curve. 'Investors will now have the opportunity to trade short-term interest rates in addition to the medium and long-term range,' said Mr Jorg Franke, DTB chairman. The DTB offers a future on 10-year government bonds (bunds) and on five-year government notes (bobls). The Fibor future closely resembles the Euromark contract on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) which is based on the British Bankers Association Interest Settlement Rate for three-month Euromark deposits and has traded successfully since April 1989. The DTB's Fibor future is not expected to lead to an escalation of competition between DTB and Liffe - partly because the underlying instruments for the two contracts differ slightly. 'While we have to be wary about being complacent, I don't see a big risk of business being taken away from Liffe,' said Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at Liffe. Like Liffe's Euromark contract, the Fibor future will have a contract size of DM1m, minimum price movements of 0.01 per cent (or a value of DM25), and will be quoted in per cent, as 100 minus the going rate of interest.</p>

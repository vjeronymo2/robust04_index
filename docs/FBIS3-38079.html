			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Bosnia's Enfant Terrible Is </F> Expected in Moscow Soon"]    [Excerpts] Russia intends to follow up on its diplomatic  success in the Balkans. Andrey Kozyrev has personally invited  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to come to Moscow. In the  West his name has become a synonym for "Serb aggression" and he  is considered "the number one defendant" in the future  international trial of Yugoslavia war criminals. He will arrive  in Moscow at the beginning of next week. This sensational piece  of news was reported to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent Sergey  Tsekhmistrenko in an exclusive interview by the president's  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, the main "culprit" for the Balkan  triumph. The conversation took place immediately after  yesterday's session of the Federation Council, where Mr. Churkin  made a statement during the debate on sending an additional  Russian troop contingent to Bosnia. In his opinion, Russia,  having blocked the execution of NATO's ultimatum, saved not only  Sarajevo but the North Atlantic bloc itself from an inevitable  ground war in the Balkans. [passage omitted]  <H5>  What lies ahead? </H5>   According to Mr. Churkin, Russia intends to exploit the  success. In this context he welcomes the Federation Council's  decision to send an additional 300-strong contingent to the  conflict zone which will be deployed not only to Sarajevo but  also other hot spots (the results of the discussion, in the  diplomat's opinion, point to the first indications of a  democratic consensus on foreign policy emerging). The dialogue  with the Serbs will also be raised to a basically new level, and  in this sense Karadzic's upcoming visit can be seen as only a  first sign that could be followed by Moscow's de facto  recognition of Slobodan Milosevic (up to now his relations with  Yeltsin have been rather cool). Mr. Churkin said preparations  are under way for a summit meeting of "great power" leaders (on  Yeltsin's initiative). In his words, the West has supported  this idea while the debate at present is centered around the  "format of the meeting:" whether it will be attended by five  (as Yeltsin proposed) or more leaders. At this point  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator differs with the deputy minister,  believing that there is far from universal support for Yeltsin's  idea in the West while considerable efforts are yet to be  undertaken to make sure that Vitaliy Churkin's hopes are  translated into life. And his own efforts will also be  essential here. May God help him!</p>

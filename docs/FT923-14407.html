			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling Sterling has yet to breach its narrow band limit against the D-Mark, but it was already below it against the Belgian Franc yesterday afternoon. It is difficult to see how the authorities can respond if the market persists. Intervention would do little in the face of disbelief that the chancellor would follow Italy's example and raise interest rates. He may thus have no choice but let sterling find its own level much closer to its wide band floor. That was what happened before the election, but the government was less reliant then on overseas funding of the PSBR. For now, the gilts market may be underpinned by the fact the hedging cost in D-Marks is virtually zero. How long that will last is another matter.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 24% EARNING HIKE FOR SARA LEE  </P> <P> Sara Lee Corp. reported record first-quarter earnings today, a 24.1% increase  over the year-ago period.  </P> <P> Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30, the company's first fiscal  quarter, rose to $93.8 million from $75.6 million for the same period last  year, Sara Lee said in a statement.  </P> <P> Earnings per share increased 15.4% to 75 cents, compared with 65 cents a year  ago. The lower percentage increase in earnings per share relative to the 24.1%  earnings increase is due to a higher level of preferred dividends and more  common shares outstanding in the current quarter, the Chicago-based company  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Allason returns with apology MR RUPERT ALLASON, the only Conservative MP who failed to support the government in the confidence vote in the Commons on Friday, was back at Westminster yesterday. He said he had apologised to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and added: 'As far as I am concerned that is the end of the matter.' Mr Allason, MP for Torbay since 1987 but better known as Nigel West, author of spy stories, declined to discuss where he was when the crucial vote was taken. He was described by Mr Dennis Skinner (Lab Bolsover) as the 'MP for the Bermuda triangle' when he welcomed the inclusion of Torbay in the new assisted areas map.</p>

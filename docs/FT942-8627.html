			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: ABB improves 20% to Dollars 246m ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering group, posted a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter profit to Dollars 246m before tax and extraordinary items. New orders were up 8 per cent to Dollars 8.2bn, due to several large orders for power plants. Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive, said that the trend of orders was continuing, with demand coming mainly from Asia and the Americas. The group forecast a rise in 1994 profits before tax and extraordinary items from last year's Dollars 1.19bn. It signalled that its tax rate would recede to a normal 45 per cent. Last year, it soared to 87.9 per cent because of a Dollars 596m restructuring charge. Revenues in the first quarter eased 1.4 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn, reflecting the recession in Europe, the group's most important region. 'Europe is still flat and we see no upturn until 1995,' Mr Barnevik said. The main European subsidiaries were sustained by export orders. The group's order backlog stood at Dollars 31.1bn at the end of March, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier. The increase in first-quarter profits was due to a 4 per cent reduction in personnel costs and sharply lower inventories. 'We are starting to get the real impact from what we have done in the past few years,' Mr Barnevik said. Last year, ABB was shedding 1,000 jobs a month. That dropped to 400 a month this year, he said. Operating profits were up 18 per cent to Dollars 481m, reflecting a rise in the operating margin to 8 per cent from 6.6 per cent.</p>

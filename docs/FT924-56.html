			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Stranger than fiction: Letter from Rio If, when your son reached nine, you discovered that he had been swapped at birth, would you want to keep the boy you had brought up or exchange him for your whiter-skinned biological son? This may have been one of the most momentous years in Brazilian history, climaxing in the world's first impeachment trial of an elected president, but the real dilemma exercising the nation concerns the plot of the top soap opera. Even more than football and samba, soap operas or novelas as they are known, are a national obsession, drawing audiences of up to 80m each day. On TV Globo, the main channel and home of the best novelas, more than three of the four peak-time hours from 6pm to 10pm are devoted to soaps, and seven out of 10 TV sets tune in nightly. As each six-month serial reaches its close, restaurants empty at viewing time and, whether on the bus or in boardrooms, people talk of little else. Executives' lunches start with heated discussions on who should keep which son before progressing to minor matters such as 1,500 per cent inflation or the president's impeachment. For Brazil, 1992 has been the year of the soap opera - in real life as much as on the television screen. In classic novela behaviour, the president's jealous younger brother denounced him for corruption, sparking off a filial feud which sent their mother into a coma. Young Pedro Collor's motivation was apparently a past attempt to seduce his wife by Fernando, the glamorous head of state who loves dangerous sports. Moreover, the street campaign which ultimately brought Collor down was fuelled by a mini-novela. Anos rebeldes (Rebel Years), about protests in the 1960s against military repression, encouraged students to take to the streets singing its theme song. That a novela could, however unwittingly, help topple an elected president shows their influence. Rio psychoanalyst Alberto Goldein explains: 'They not only provide escapism from economic and psychological problems but also have enormous impact on the behaviour of people, particularly given the general lack of education.' This can range from simply copying an actor's hairstyle to far more radical effects. After the heroine in De Corpo e Alma (Body and Soul), the melodrama currently gripping the nation, almost died from heart disease and was saved by a transplant, the number of donors increased rapidly. The high incidence of children mixed up at birth exposed by the novela has forced hospitals to introduce DNA testing. In a challenge to the nation's machismo, De Corpo e Alma has introduced the concept of the 'male-object', inspiring male strip clubs to spring up all over Brazil, attracting middle-class women. Gloria Perez, writer of De Corpo e Alma and an old novela hand, believes, 'novelas have a social function in putting themes into discussion and confronting taboos as well as fulfilling an important educational role compensating for the inadequacy of institutions'. For instance, characters always wash their hands before eating and practise safe sex. A pre-Christmas episode, showing characters taking gifts to a children's hospital, inspired a flood of donations. Brazilian novelas are highly topical. All through the Collorgate scandal the most popular novela was Deus Nos Acuda (God Help Us), a satire on corruption which showed the characters drowning in a symbolic sea of mud as the opening shot. It told of a wayward angel, appointed as guardian of Brazil, who falls foul of the divine authorities because of the moral and economic turpitude into which the country descends. Throughout the run-up to impeachment, scenes were being written and aired within two days to keep up with the latest twists in the real-life scandal. It is not just their topicality that makes novelas such a success. Daily polls are carried out to monitor audience reaction and storylines or characters are altered accordingly so that in effect the viewers almost write their own script. Perez employs a researcher to queue in shops and banks, sit on buses and chat to unsuspecting strangers about novelas. Ironically the idea of airing novelas at peak viewing time was an accident. In 1969, Walter Clark, then director of TV Globo, had a programme scheduled for 9.30pm kept off the air by the censors. He was left with no option but to screen an imported novela. It was a huge success and in the 1970s Globo started making its own soaps, moving from traditional tearjerkers to topical themes. It began filming on location rather than on sets and attracting top actors, gradually building up an industry which made Brazil one of the world's top exporters of TV programme. Brazilian Novelas can be seen from Bulgaria to Canada, Cuba to the United States and Malaysia to South Africa. Jorge Adib, head of novela marketing at Globo, claims 'we permanently have one of our novelas showing in practically every country'. Only the English have proved resistant. The climax of the Collor novela came on Tuesday when the disgraced former President resigned just before impeachment hearings. Although his younger brother is now writing a grand expose, this year's events are not likely to end up on screen. 'It's just too unbelievable,' says Perez.</p>

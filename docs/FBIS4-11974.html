			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri by Artur K. </F> Vogel; place and date not given: "Uncertainty After the Civil  War"]    [Text] [Vogel] The differences between the rich and the  poor are crass and seem to have increased.    [Al-Hariri] In Lebanon there was a broad middle-class, which  largely disappeared because of the war. Now it is recovering,  but this will take some years. Reconstruction has begun: You  see everywhere many projects and many building sites. The hope  in financial circles is that the country will really take off.  Many Lebanese are coming back and investing here.    [Vogel] Several hundreds of thousands of expellees are also  waiting for help; they do not notice any reconstruction.    [Al-Hariri] My government is the first that is seriously  taking care of them. We took thousands of families back to  their places of origin. Now a bill that is to enable the  government to spend $436 million on this has been presented in  parliament. If the bill goes through, the problem might be  solved in a few years.    [Vogel] However, many refugees do not have much confidence  in your government. They are saying that you are not concerned  about the common people.    [Al-Hariri] I cannot blame them. They are right if they  feel ill at ease, but they are not right if they think that we  do not take care of them.    [Vogel] To put it mildly, unease can also be felt among the  Christians. On 27 February, 10 men were killed and 60 injured  by a bomb attack in the Maronite-Catholic Church of Suk Mikhail  near Junieh. When you visited the site, you talked of the  involvement of foreign powers, in order to divert international  attention from the Hebron massacre (two days before). Your  information minister even accused Israel directly. Are you  sticking to this theory?    [Al-Hariri] Even during the war -- it was a religious war --  nobody dared to attack a mosque or a church. The attack was an  event that is far from the habits of the Lebanese. They were  cruel, but they never did such a thing.    [Vogel] Meanwhile, 127 people have been arrested. Does this  not point to local perpetrators?    [Al-Hariri] If a crime is committed and the police do not  have any direct clues, they examine the suspects. Most were  released after a few hours.    [Vogel] You said yourself that certain forces still want to  destroy Lebanon's fragile unity. What would be their motivation?    [Al-Hariri] After a civil war, there is always uncertainty  for a few years. There are people who want to overthrow the  government in order to get into power themselves.    [Vogel] That is to say, are you as a Sunni Muslim denying  that the center of power in Lebanon is moving too far toward the  Muslims and away from the Christians, as many Christians are  claiming?    [Al-Hariri] We are not trying to deprive the Christians of  their power; we are trying to create a balance of power.    [Vogel] You have another problem: Israel continues to  occupy 10 percent of your country.    [Al-Hariri] We are negotiating with the Israelis on their  withdrawal. We are prepared to guarantee security at their  border. It is for the Israelis to decide whether they want to be  part of the Middle East or to dominate it. If they want to  dominate, there will be no peace.    [Vogel] Among other things, Israel is calling for the  disarmament of the Hizballah militias.    [Al-Hariri] The Israeli occupation is creating resistance.  If Israel wants to withdraw from Lebanon, the Lebanese  Government would be responsible for nobody trying any longer to  disturb the peace. But as long as the occupation continues, I  cannot keep the Lebanese from putting up resistance.</p>

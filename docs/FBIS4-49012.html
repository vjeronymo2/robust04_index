			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan should  advance their long-term, stable and friendly cooperative  relations, a senior Chinese official said here today.    Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said China and  Japan should draw lessons from history so as to maintain  long-term friendly relations, which is important not only to the  Asia-Pacific region but also to the rest of the world.    Qian made the remarks at a meeting with Bunbei Hara,  president of the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and  a delegation he is leading.    China hopes to develop friendly relations with all  countries,  neighboring countries in particular, Qian said, adding that the  development of Sino-Japanese relations is particularly necessary.    Hara said that he agreed with Qian. He said that Japan also  needs a stable social and economic environment and should  reflect on its history and make efforts together with China to  develop bilateral relations.    At the meeting, Qian also touched on some international  issues at the request of the delegation. Referring to the  situation in the Korean peninsula, Qian reiterated China's  consistent stand to solve problems on the peninsula through  peaceful talks. On the issue of Cambodia, Qian said foreign  powers should no longer interfere in the internal affairs of  Cambodia, but let the Cambodian people headed by King Sihanouk  solve the problems themselves.</p>

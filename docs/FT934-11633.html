			<p>931030 FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Blow a multimedia raspberry Sir, The convergence between telecommunications and cable television ('Multimedia superhighways', October 15) is truly remarkable and seems to promise us untold benefits. In the midst of all this high technology, can no one invent a gadget that will identify and disconnect (preferably with a loud raspberry) Tania and Jacqui, the ubiquitous telesales persons who constantly try to sell me something I neither want nor need, usually at a time of greatest inconvenience. David Jewsbury, 19 The Beeches, Shaw Hill, Melksham, Wiltshire SN12 8EP</p>

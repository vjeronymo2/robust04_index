			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family Mexico market expectations - At a Glance Mexico's financial markets are expected to show a muted reaction next week if the country's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Ernesto Zedillo, wins Sunday's presidential election. A PRI victory has already been factored into the recent rally in equities. Since the end of July the IPC index of the 37 most traded stocks has risen by almost 20 per cent, and the market has recovered all of its local currency losses due to pre-election nerves earlier in the year. However, it still remains among the weakest performing Latin American bourses in dollar terms over the same period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Illarionov report: "Siberians Discuss Strategy for </F> Stabilization of Economy"]    [Text] Novosibirsk -- A scientific-practical conference has  been held in Novosibirsk with the following agenda: "A Strategy  for the Stabilization of the Region's Economy: Problems and  Solutions." It was organized by the Russian Federation  Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, the  relevant Federation Council committee, and the Novosibirsk  Oblast Administration.    None of the country's regions can get out of the economic  crisis on their own today, but the immutable condition for  getting the country out of the crisis lies precisely in a  flexible and differentiated regional policy. In his report on  the basic avenues of the state's regional policy, Nationalities  Affairs Minister Sergey Shakhray spoke of the need to strengthen  the state's regulating role in leading the country out of the  crisis, backing federalism in conjunction with the development  of local self-government. Developing this thesis, the minister  said that a more clear-cut, strict and differentiated regional  policy is needed today, geared to solving social problems, as  well as economic and other problems connected with them. This  concerns, in particular, the need for a certain redistribution  of resources in favor of regions which do not have large  reserves of natural raw materials, and which have found  themselves in the most difficult economic and social position  today.    Sergey Shakhray also spoke of the fact that Russians have no  alternative to economic integration with the CIS states, and  that this task is urgent and at the same time requires civilized  ways of being solved. An era of the revival of Russia, its  statehood, its economy, and the dignity of Russians, and the  revival of the country's cultural and national traditions is  imminent...    Sergey Glazyev, chairman of a State Duma committee [bureau  records list Glazyev as head of Duma Economic Policy Committee],  gave a report about the basic spheres of economic stabilization  in Russia. Academic Valentin Koptyug analyzed the crisis  processes in Siberia and possible stabilization models. Ivan  Indinok, head of the Novosibirsk Oblast Administration, spoke of  the problems involved in the approach to stabilizing the  socioeconomic development of the region.    The participants in the conference have started discussing  the problems of stabilization at section sittings.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Golf: The decade of the oldies IN GOLF the 1980s was an age of excess. The 1990s are different. They will have an excess of age. This is no bad thing. Last week there were two separate signs that to be old is not necessarily to be forgotten. First came the launching of The Oldie, a magazine edited by Richard Ingrams for those in middle age. Hardly had that hit the streets than the PGA European Tour announced the start of a tournament circuit for senior professional golfers, ie those over 50. A minimum of eight tournaments with a total prize money fund of more than Pounds 500,000 will be staged in England, Wales, Ireland and France between April and October this year. At some of these venues you will be able to see men who will take you back to the '70s, '60s, even the '50s, men like Neil Coles, Gary Player and Christy O'Connor. 'I am tempted to get my clubs out,' Peter Alliss said last week on hearing about the proposed new tour. Then he added: 'There's no fool like an old fool.' In launching this tour golf is following a trend to longer participation in sport, a trend that has become more apparent recently. Both swimming and skiing have their Masters' championships with age-group categories as high as 75 and over. If you are a rugby supporter you will be familiar with the Golden Oldies rugby events for men over 35. Why are we playing sport longer? Because as a race we humans are generally healthier than ever with more leisure time and money on our hands. And in Britain, at least, we are living longer. In 1961 the average life expectancy of a man was 57.9 years. In 1988 it was 72.4. A consequence of this is that the numbers of those over 60 are increasing. There were 7.8m men and women in this age category in 1961. By 1990 that had risen to 10.5m and by the year 2030 it is projected to be 14.1m. Golf is an ideal game to be played later in life, more suitable than violent, body-damaging games such as rugby and soccer. It is also one of the best, if not the best, at which to combine business and pleasure. The courses may need to be shortened and perhaps flags should be placed in less terrifying positions on the greens but in many other respects the game is the same for a 45- or 55-year-old as a 25-year-old. Lee Trevino slogged wearily through the last few years on the US men's tour until he could become eligible for the senior tour. 'I'm tired of playing against the flat bellies,' sighed Trevino as he approached his 50th birthday. 'I want to play against the round bellies.' And when he did he thought he had died and gone to heaven. The man who was born into extreme poverty and never knew his father won seven events and more than Dollars 1m in his first year. That memorable year he was the leading money-winner in all golf, not just seniors' golf. The inaugural season of the seniors' tour reminds me a little of the early years of the mens' tour. Prize money is small - Pounds 60,000 or less at seven of the scheduled eight events, which is chicken feed compared with the average purse on the men's tour of nearly Pounds 400,000. Whereas the men's events invariably start with a pro-am on Wednesday followed by one round each day, concluding on Sundays, the seniors will more often than not be three-day events including the pro-am. To my mind, seniors' golf is to be championed as much as three-hour rounds and golfers who carry their clubs. It bears far more relation to the standard of golf that most of us play than does the sort of golf demonstrated by Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam and the like. My idea of a nightmare would be to partner Seve Ballesteros in a pro-am because I would be so nervous I would be shaking in my shoes. A heavenly pro-am partner, on the other hand, would be Peter Alliss, if only I could stop him talking. With him there would be no shortage of gossip and with a bit of luck he would correct my hook. Men of 50-plus are more interesting to talk to because they have knocked around a bit. They have learned to show a genuine interest in their pro-am partners and are no longer as self-centred as they were when they were younger. They are more aware of their duties in a pro-am, less likely to intimidate and might even fluff the odd downhill chip. And they can still play golf a bit. I am in favour of this tour. Deep in the most severe recession many of us have ever known is hardly the most auspicious time in which to launch a project such as this. Yet it is 21 years since the start of the European Tour itself and look how that has grown. Perhaps one day soon we shall be talking about a seniors' Ryder Cup?</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / East Timor protest ship forced to turn back A PORTUGUESE 'peace boat' heading for East Timor to protest against a massacre of civilians was forced to turn back early today after a confrontation with the Indonesian navy, Reuter reports from Darwin. After receiving a direct order from an Indonesian frigate, the ferry Lusitania Expresso stopped in sight of East Timor's coast and turned around. On board were 120 people from about 20 nations, including Portuguese former president General Antonio Ramalho Eanes. They had planned to lay wreaths in memory of protesters who died last November when Indonesian troops opened fire during a funeral procession in East Timor.</p>

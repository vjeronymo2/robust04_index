			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 21 -- The National Council of the  Freedom Union (UW) Saturday adopted a statement warning against  centralistic tendencies in the policy of the present government.  The statement says that the government wants to "fully control  the state, offices, banks and supervisory boards of state  enterprises" by filling important posts with members of the  ruling coalition parties. "The Freedom Union comes out against  this policy" and will support the development of  self-governments, reads the document.    In his address to the council members, Party leader Tadeusz  Mazowiecki also pointed to a growing threat from the government  and the president to independent institutions of a democratic  state, such as the National Radio and Television Council.    After a heated debate, the UW Council appointed 11 persons  to  the newly created posts of national secretaries of the party.  Their task will be to monitor government policies in important  areas of economy and public life and react to government  decisions. Leaders of the party denied the new posts were  modelled after the shadow cabinet in the British system of  government, an opinion prevailing in the press recently.    Among the 11 secretaries are Jerzy Osiatynski (in charge of  economic policy), Wojciech Arkuszewski (economic system), Piotr  Nowina-Konopka (foreign affairs), Michal Boni (social policy),  Bogdan Borusewicz (public security).</p>

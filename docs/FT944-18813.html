			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Equities still in thrall to bond markets - London Just how quickly is the American economy recovering? That may seem an odd preoccupation for the UK equity market, but it was the dominant concern during a week in which traders and investors remained in thrall to the international bond markets. The FT-SE 100 sank below the 3,000 mark amid fears that the rapid pace of US growth might cause the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates again, which would increase pressure for another rise in UK borrowing costs. All eyes were fixed on Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. Shares shed 20 points in the preceding two days, but then recovered when the meeting passed without any rise. However, Thursday's news of an upward revision in American growth rates - plus a 9.7 per cent leap in August's new house sales in the US - was enough to wipe 46.2 points off the FT-SE 100 index. Bond traders are concerned that resumed over-rapid growth could lead to inflation, and indeed the rapid increase in commodity prices illustrated by the chart gives some grounds for concern. Yet there was little in this week's corporate results to suggest that retail prices are on the up - particularly in the housing market. Shares in Tarmac, Britain's second largest housebuilder, fell after the group said house sales had halved during the two weeks since UK interest rates rose by a half percentage point. However, shares in Beazer Homes rose after the fourth largest housebuilder said that sales had risen by a fifth since July 1 and had not been dented by the recent rise in interest rates. Victor Benjamin, Beazer's chairman, said: 'While it is too early to evaluate the outcome of the recent interest rate increase, we believe that in the current market it is uncertainty over interest rates rather than the actual rate which unsettles consumer confidence.' One place where housebuilding continues to thrive is Germany. Redland, the British building materials group, said it would seek a Frankfurt stock exchange listing after announcing a 40 per cent rise in German profits in the first half of this year. The group has so far seen no sign of slackening in demand in Germany, where sales have been boosted by repairs to homes in the east and the accommodation demands from large numbers of immigrants to the west. UK retailers also reported little scope to increase prices, in spite of improved sales level. Sears, which owns the London department store Selfridges and the Dolcis shoe chain, expects the economy to continue a steady but slow improvement. House of Fraser, which owns department stores around the country, said sales in September had recovered strongly after a poor August. It said the recent rise in UK interest rates had produced no marked effect but warned that a further rise could be damaging. One bright spot for beleaguered parents came with the news from Sears that its Olympus sports chain had suffered a dip in sales. Apparently youth fashion has moved away from trainers. Consumers can also expect more bargains in the bookshops soon, following the decision by Hodder Headline to become the second publisher to leave the voluntary agreement that allows publishers to set minimum prices for most books for six months after publication. Reed Books, the publishing arm of Reed Elsevier, already publishes its books 'non-net' and says market share has increased as a result. Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of illustrated reference books, said it was disappointed by this latest blow to the agreement. It believed the agreement's abandonment would result in the closure of smaller, independent bookshops and the availability of fewer titles. The biggest deal of the week came from Reckitt &amp; Colman which put its mustard business up for sale to help finance a drive to become one of the world's leading suppliers of lavatory cleaners and other household products. Reckitt announced the Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 980m) purchase of L &amp; F Household, a leading US supplier of household products, from Eastman Kodak, and offered for sale Colman's mustard and Robinson's barley water. Sir Michael Colman, chairman and last family member in the business founded five generations ago in a Norwich mill, said it was a difficult decision to sell Colman's. But he believed the business would be better run by a group with a strong food strategy now that Reckitt was concentrating on disinfectants, cleaners, air fresheners and insecticides. The market rallied sharply yesterday afternoon and the FT-SE 100 ended the week comfortably above the 3,000 mark. However, the outlook for the fourth quarter's trading, starting on Monday, remains uncertain. The broker S G Warburg argues that the pressure on bonds is coming from stronger than expected growth around the world, which points to a bullish environment for equities on any strategic view. However, it concedes that 'the strong growth in analysts' estimates (which remain solid this autumn) needs to be set against the prospect of continued uncertainty in bonds over the next 12 months.' Warburg has accordingly cut its year-end FT-SE 100 forecast from 3,500 to 3,250 - 'a more plausible central assumption,' in view of the lack of investor confidence in the bond markets. Warburg now reckons that the 3,500 mark will not be reached before the end of 1995. The unsettled trading of the past week - which saw low volumes and few significant corporate results - demonstrates that UK equities remain vulnerable to any tightening of interest rates. It is for this reason that the most significant item in most traders diaries will be next Friday's US employment figures.</p>

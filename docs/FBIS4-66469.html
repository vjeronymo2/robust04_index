			<p>Coal-Water   Mixture   <F P=102> 94FE0585A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Feb 94  p 15-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0585A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Ube industries has successfully tested long-distance  transport of a coal-water mixture (CWM). The CWM was carried  round-trip between the company's plant in Ube City, Yamaguchi  Prefecture, and Singapore to study changes in quality as  preparation for its practical application. Ube Industries has  determined that long-distance transport is possible, and based  on the results of these tests, plans to market its utilization  to electric power companies and other potential customers.    The CWM that was transported consists of 70% finely  powdered  coal and 30% water with a small amount of additives. The  advantages of CWM are that it can be transported in tankers just  like heavy oil, and because CWM can be stored in tanks after  unloading, it is easier to protect the environment than with  conventional coal.    Ube Industries plans to produce the CWM in New South Wales,  Australia, and ship it to Japan. Many times in the past Ube  Industries has manufactured CWM and actually used it in  combustion tests to get an idea of its practicality, but the  remaining problem was whether CWM could withstand long-distance  transport from Australia.    For the Ube-Singapore round-trip CWM transport test, which  was a longer distance than one-way transport from Australia, Ube  Industries obtained the cooperation of Nippon Yusen, Nissho  Iwai, and Tsurumi Transportation (Minato-ku, Tokyo).  Two-thousand tons of CWM were carried about 20 days while the  effect on quality of the rolling of the ship's hull and the heat  of tropical temperatures was studied. As a result, Ube  Industries concluded that long-distance transport is feasible  with modifications to heavy oil tankers.    Ube Industries announced, ``With the completion of these  transport tests, we have overcome the technical problems for the  practical application of CWM,'' and the company will now work  toward its utilization in Japan. CWM produced in China is  already used in part as a fuel source at thermal power plants,  but Ube Industries will market its Australian product as a  stable supply of CWM. If business talks bring favorable results,  Ube Industries will build a plant at Newcastle in New South  Wales.</p>

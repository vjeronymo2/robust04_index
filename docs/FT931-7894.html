			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pinault considers Prisunic sale PINAULT, the French retail group, is considering the sale of Prisunic, one of France's largest store chains, as part of its efforts to raise capital to reduce the debt left by its takeover of the Au Printemps stores group. Galeries Lafayette, one of Printemps' main rivals in the department store sector, is mooted as a prospective purchaser. Galeries Lafayette, already burdened by FFr2.8bn (Dollars 505m) of debt after its acquisition of the Nouvelles Galeries group, has denied French newspaper reports that it was in negotiations with Pinault. However, it left open the possibility of future talks by saying it 'did not envisage bidding for Prisunic at present'. Prisunic, a chain of 94 mixed merchandise stores with 230 affiliates, is a leading player in French retailing. It came to the fore in the 1970s when it was influential in introducing contemporary design to France, fulfilling a similar role to Habitat in the UK. The group has come under pressure in recent years, reflecting the sluggish state of French consumer spending and the intensely competitive condition of the retail sector. It made operating profits of just FFr34.3m on sales of FFr4.9bn in 1991. Pinault has been selling assets for some time. Initially it concentrated on its old industrial interests but in recent months has started selling its recently acquired retail interests. Pinault, which is reported to hope to raise FFr2bn from the Prisunic sale, has also reshuffled its finances in an attempt to alleviate the burden of its FFr19bn net debt.</p>

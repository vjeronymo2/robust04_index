			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Skachko: "They Voted for the State"] </F>   [Text] At the 26 June elections, not only did the entire  adult population of Ukraine vote for a new president, but also  for 11,440 chairmen of local councils and 165,000 people's  deputies at all levels. Tentative data indicate that 68.4  percent of the electorate (more than 25 million people)  participated in the elections, and, consequently, the elections  are valid.    Final results regarding individual people are still being  summarized, but it cannot be ruled out that there will be the  second round of both presidential and local elections, but one  can already discuss certain trends. First, the activity of  those who came to more than 30,000 polling stations indicates  that the people in Ukraine are still interested in renewing the  power at all levels. Second, compared with the parliamentary  elections, the activity of the people abated, even though its  main pattern has remained: The voting was more active in the  West, more passive in the south, and the center showed the  "golden mean." As before, the capital added its "negative"  touch -- less than 52 percent of the electorate voted in Kiev.    Third, only final results will show which political forces  and where prevailed, but it may already be asserted that the  very fact of elections that have taken place indicates that,  despite the possible sharp political regionalization (the "left  wing" in the east and south and the "right wing" in the west),  no one spoke against the existence of the Ukrainian state.    The dissimilar political preferences are nothing but  indications that there exist dissimilar visions of the  approaches to building both the local and general state order.  Therefore, the main task of official Kiev is to find such a  model of state building as would balance out the political  differences. This is precisely the case when the general state  consensus must be based on values common to all people. For  example, political confrontation must be abandoned for the sake  of overcoming crisis phenomena and improving the standard of  living of the people. There may be dissimilar roads to this in  different areas.    Yet another conspicuous (at least in words) characteristic  of  these elections was the fact that none of the presidential  candidates spoke about excessive politicization. On the  contrary, everyone spoke about the building of such an  independent state, which must be underlain by a sound economy.  At the polling stations in Kiev where Ukrainian presidential  candidates spoke, we managed to record ideas of some of them  about the main principles of our state's existence. We offer  them for your attention.    L. Kravchuk (on the main result of the election campaign and  private ownership): "I visited many regions and became  convinced that the people want to have their own state. It is  true that the people disagree with leaders and their policy, but  they are not against the statehood. Nor do they, incidentally,  oppose private ownership, as some people maintain. If a citizen  wants to have his private property, let him have it. It is only  necessary to specify its status, rights of ownership, and the  mechanism for its protection. There will be no democracy  without [private] ownership. If a person is not free  economically and if he cannot freely use his property or the  results of his work, there will be no democratic development."    I. Plyushch (on proposals with regard to a Slavic  conference): "It cannot be done the way they want. It takes  years to do such things, they must be allowed to ripen. We have  not even ultimately divided the Union, but are already trying to  create something else. We must bring the previous process to its  logical completion, create a CIS market, and then, possibly,  create something new. Radical measures are only proposed when  one wants to do harm to someone."    L. Kuchma (on Ukraine's future): "Ukraine needs new  technologies and new equipment. Everything else is mere talk.  Ukraine does not need philanthropic assistance. Europe and  America must proceed from this and must determine what kind of  Ukraine they want to see: economically strong or something else.    "I was asked about my first steps in case I am elected  president. I answer: Everybody must feel that a real master has  appeared in Ukraine and that the situation, which prevails  today, when nobody heeds others, must end."    V. Lanovyy (on governing the state): "The main thing is to  have local self-government so that those leaders who receive  powers would be answerable. It is not so important whether  these are left or right-wing forces. They have received their  mandates and will be under the control of those people who  elected them and may recall them.    "I am in favor of having presidential representatives in the  provinces, representatives who supervise the fulfillment of the  general state legislation. However, in addition to that, we  must constitutionally approve restrictions to the legislative  powers of local councils. If there are no such restrictions,  other regions may follow in the footsteps of the Crimea."    Other leaders also care and will care about strengthening  the  Ukrainian state and, therefore, these elections have constituted  yet another step toward crystallizing the Ukrainian political  elite whose absence is anyone's talk.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates The market's benign response to Slough Estates' Pounds 147m rights issue is mystifying. Here is a property company with a distinctly patchy investment record tapping shareholders effectively to help redeem Pounds 181m worth of convertible bonds. Slough accepts there is precious little evidence of any improvement in the property market. Indeed rents and asset values are still falling. There is some justification for the issue's appeal. Slough's new shares offer a secure yield of 6.75 per cent, while, further out, the company's strengthened balance sheet will give it greater headroom to invest and generate income growth. Slough's heavy weighting in the more resilient industrial property market gives it better prospects than those exposed to office property. Its international presence will also help. Even so, the issue looks more like an opportunistic exercise in balance sheet repair. The danger is that similarly optimistic arguments may be trotted out by a string of other property companies. If so, they should also be treated with suspicion. Dividends may be safe at current levels but for most companies it will be years before they can justify any increase. The direct market will remain soggy as it soaks up surplus stock. Property shares have rebounded strongly from last autumn's slough of despond. Since September, the sector has outperformed the market by 35 per cent, Slough by 76 per cent. Such movements invite rights issues from any company that can concoct a half-way convincing story.</p>

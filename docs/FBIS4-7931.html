			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrew Hawker: "Restructuring Is `a Question of </F> Survival' for Czech Steel Industry"]    [Text] Vitkovice, north Moravia--With Czech steel  production expected to plummet to half its 1989 level, the  industry that was once the pride of the central planners is  struggling to keep its mills rolling.    More than 90 percent of the output and much of the pain of  restructuring is concentrated in the bleak region around  Ostrava, north Moravia, which already suffers one of the  country's highest unemployment rates--6 percent.    The Vitkovice company, Ostrava's 160-year-old steelmaker,  has  shed 10,000 of the 35,000 employees it had in 1989. Local  authorities have decided to shut down the smelly blast furnaces  and sinter plant around which the city grew up, a development  that could cause another 5,000 workers to be laid off in the  coming years.    "We have to repair our equipment and buy cleaner and more  efficient technologies while our sales keep on dropping," says  Jan Svozil, head of development and ecology at Nova Hut, the  country's largest steel producer.    The complex churned out 3.8 million tons of steel five years  ago, but the company expects production to stabilize around 2  million tons. Most of its Czech clients do not pay for their  purchases. Nova Hut officials say that if the company stopped  supplying those who don't pay, it would not produce any steel at  all.    "We never had to think about marketing under the  communists,"  Svozil says. "Whatever was produced was sold."    Fortunately, the company exports half of its output, helping  to balance the cash-flow situation. However, the firm owes  billions of crowns to the Ostrava mines for coal supplies.    As for the future, "A lot depends on the state's plans for  the region," Svozil says.    Last week, the Czech Economics Ministry decided to provide a  loan guarantee for the construction of a sheet-steel mini-mill  at Nova Hut, which won out over its neighbor Trinecke zelezarny.  Nova Hut's joint-venture project was better-prepared, according  to Minister of Economy Karel Dyba.    Trinecke zelezarny, however, is threatening to go ahead with  its project regardless of the governmental decision. Its foreign  partners are set to go through with the construction even  without state guarantees, say sources in the office of the  company's director.    Nova Hut Director Svatopluk Velkoborsky reacted by offering  to let Trinecke plug into its joint venture with American  producer Intercontinental Steel.    Better cooperation between companies is necessary for good  results, says Ministry of Industry and Trade steel overseer  Otakar Kopecny. One of Kopecny's main tasks is to encourage  producers to coordinate their production programs so that they  do not compete against each other, he says.    But simple cooperation may not be enough, according to some  specialists. The Ostrava factories need to merge production  horizontally, says Frank Wheeler, senior steel executive at the  Toronto-based engineering and management consultancy group Hatch  Associates.    "Coordination works as long as interests coincide. As soon  as  they don't, the companies could start destructively competing,"  he says. "It would be very inefficient if each one of them tried  to make it on its own."    The steel makers will only start seriously restructuring  when  they see how desperately they need to, says Wheeler, who earned  a doctorate in metallurgy at Ostrava. "Right now, they haven't  quite realized that it's a question of survival. They're still  at the denial stage."    The industry's challenge is to downsize, modernize and  become  environmentally compliant at the same time.    "Putting off ecology as an expensive luxury, as [Prime  Minister Vaclav] Klaus suggested, would be a costly mistake.  When one accounts for the social costs of pollution, such as  treatment of lung diseases, environmental investments become  more attractive," Wheeler says.    The Czech steel industry has excellent technical expertise,  continues Wheeler, but it needs foreign help to prioritize  problems, evaluate markets and develop strategic plans. "These  companies often don't know which of their products earn money.  They need to understand their markets. For decades, they haven't  had to."    Last month, the National Property Fund also guaranteed a  bank  consortium loan for the area's steel producers to introduce  energy-saving continuous casting. The technology, which brings  the steel into the rolling mill without cooling and reheating,  was adopted in most Western factories many years ago.    "We are grateful for the state-guaranteed loan," says Ivan  Boros, spokesman for Vitkovice. But he adds that the Czech press  exaggerated the loan's importance. The state's guarantee affects  900 million Kc (just over $30 million), less than a fifth of the  improvements' cost.    Companies can grow resentful when the state suddenly backs  out of industries just when they need the most support. "The  government has rid itself of its responsibility," charges Nova  Hut official Svozil.    Many Moravians and Silesians look at Prague as a huge  bureaucratic parasite living off the sweat of the provincial  economy.    "Our taxes go up to Prague, and very little of it trickles  back down to us. They get lost somewhere along the way," says  Tomas Pavelko, ecology director of Moravian Chemical Works.  "Regional authorities are more accountable."    Less than 60 percent of the fees paid by north Moravian  companies into the national environmental fund are reinvested in  the region, a fact that has angered locals. But the state cannot  go on mothering industries as it did before, government  officials counter.    "We chose to privatize and let the companies do the  restructuring," says Kopecny, the Ministry of Industry's steel  expert. "We are not like England. We can't afford to finance and  direct the industries' restructuring. All industries here are  restructuring here at once!"    Though the National Property Fund is still the majority  owner  of all three Ostrava plants, the national government in Prague  keeps the steel mills on a very loose leash. The plants hope a  World Bank loan will help finance the project.    Some observers, however, do not foresee this loan coming.    "It's unrealistic to expect the steel-saturated West to  finance any capacity expansion here," argues Hatch Associates'  Wheeler.    Rather than developing new facilities at great cost, better  use should be made of the existing ones, he recommends.    Inside the hulking plants, workers feel the brunt of the  slowdown acutely. With monthly salaries averaging 8,000 Kc,  laborers hover around outdated, ill-repaired equipment amid  noxious gases.    A man stands over the open door of a blazing oven manually  spraying magnetized steel into the huge furnace to patch up the  visible cracks in its walls. Extreme noise levels--up to 160  decibels--bombard the workers all day long. In some parts of the  plant, airborne flakes of steel cover one's clothes in a few  seconds.    "It's all very well to talk about ecology and restructuring,  but you have to see it from our side as well. We breathe in the  pollution at its source, you out there get only a bit of it,"  says Vladimir Tajchert, a Nova Hut repairman.    "The steel industry," he concludes, "needs more investment."</p>

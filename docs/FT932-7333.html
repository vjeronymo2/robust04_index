			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez faces another scandal over party funds SPAIN'S ruling Socialist party yesterday moved a step closer to defeat in the June 6 election after a Madrid newspaper published allegations that the party may have illegally financed the 1986 referendum campaign to remain in Nato. The Socialists, while not denying the charges, said they were a political attack. The income was not illegal, the party said, since it pre-dated the current party financing law. The allegations, published so close to the election, are bound to affect wavering voters. The conservative Partido Popular and the Socialists continue to run neck-and-neck. Although the Socialists appear to have escaped from the recent peseta devaluation and increase in unemployment with little damage, a new corruption scandal could be much more wounding. Polls suggest that up to half the electorate is undecided, and many former Socialist voters have been dismayed by the torrent of corruption charges made against the party in the last four years. El Mundo, the newspaper which published the charges, alleged the party raised more than Pounds 3.2m in 1986, mainly in the form of commissions paid to it by construction companies. El Mundo has been responsible for uncovering nearly all the scandals that have weakened the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, including the so-called Filesa scandal, which is credited with having forced Mr Gonzalez to call an early election. Filesa was a dummy consultancy company run by Socialist party officials, which raised more than Pounds 6.4m in the late 1980s by selling reports and services to client companies. None of the reports has ever been produced and Treasury inspectors suspect they do not exist. The Filesa cash is alleged to have been used to finance the Socialists' 1989 election campaign. The new El Mundo claims came just before Mr Gonzalez held a televised election debate with his main political challenger, the Partido Popular leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar. Up to 5m people watched a dull late-night debate in which Mr Gonzalez unexpectedly failed to dent his increasingly confident opponent. Often on the defensive, the prime minister failed to force Mr Aznar to speak in any detail about the Partido Popular's economic plans, which remain the campaign's best kept secret.

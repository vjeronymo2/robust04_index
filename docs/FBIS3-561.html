			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] France is coming under severe criticism in Niamey,  where political circles suspect it of encouraging separatism.  The right claimed by the Tuareg rebellion to autonomous  administration of the country's northern regions strongly  opposed by opposition parties and black Tuaregs, who see Paris'  hands in the separatist resolve of the Tuaregs. Jean de Dieu  Ndong Ovono reports:    [Begin Ovono recording] Public opinion in Niger is  traditionally hostile to the Tuareg community, which represents  only 10 percent of the country's population, and the Niamey  press, of course, echoes this. The paper to cast the first  stone was SAHEL DIMANCHE, the government daily, which accused  France of wanting to relaunch its colonial dreams to create a  common organization of Saharan regions. This was an old dream  for Paris, which wanted to make the Sahara a single entity so as  to gain control over a region it saw as part of its sphere of  influence. The Saharan part of Niger has enormous mineral  resources, especially uranium, the country's main source of  revenue.    Needless to say, what is being described in Niamey as the  French plot is simply unacceptable. This is why the weekly  DEMOCRATE urgently called on the Niger Government to seek a  clear and unambiguous clarification from France on this affair.  To crown it all, the weekly REPUBLICAIN, which is close to the  Tuareg community, this week published an interview with Mano  Dayak, president of the Coordination of the Armed Resistance, a  coalition of four organizations of the Tuareg rebellion. This  interview gave support to France's critics. Some Tuaregs even  joined in the criticism. Thus a group of intellectuals, claiming  to represent the black Tuareg community, issued a press release  denouncing France's efforts to keep them in ignorance and  servitude. France, they claim, is largely responsible for the  trampling of our rights and liberties by deciding to put our  community under the trusteeship of the white Tuareg minority.    Representatives of the Niger Government and the rebellion  are  to resume their negotiations at the end of this month in Paris.  France, Algeria, and Burkina Faso have been chosen as mediators  by the two sides. The Tuareg rebellion has already claimed over  100 lives since it was launched at the end of 1991. It seeks  the right to autonomous administration of certain northern  regions and is also demanding quotas which guarantee its  community's representation within the government, the National  Assembly, and the Niger Army.

The First Tangible  Result of Russian-American Partnership"]    [Text] Ironically, the first, really serious result of the  Russian-American strategic partnership was achieved precisely at  a time when the authorities in Washington and Moscow are once  again, as in the glorious years of the Cold War, expelling  diplomats, accusing each other of spying, at a time when  bilateral relations in general are at the freezing point.    The counselors-cum-spies, Aleksandr Lysenko and James  Morris,  were packing their bags and packages as Ukrainian warheads were  already heading for Russia. SEGODNYA has learned from more than  reliable sources that Russia and Ukraine have finally gotten  around to implementing in practice the  Russian-American-Ukrainian trilateral agreement "On the Terms  and Conditions of Eliminating Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons in  Ukraine," which was signed in Moscow 14 January by Boris  Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk, and Bill Clinton.    Under the agreement, in the last days of February the first  60 warheads removed from strategic missiles in service with the  46th (Pervomayskaya) Missile Division of the 43d Missile Army  were loaded on specially equipped flatcars of a special-purpose  train and sent to Russia. Today, the train with the special  cargo is to arrive in a closed city run by the Atomic Energy  Ministry (former Medium Engineering Ministry) in the Urals, in  the plant where the warheads had once been assembled. Now they  will be dismantled. There are still, of course, around 2,000  nuclear warheads remaining in Ukraine, but now there is hope  that this problem will finally be resolved.    It will be resolved first of all by joint efforts of Russian  and American politicians and diplomats who have managed to  convince President Kravchuk that the nuclear warheads, which  Ukraine can neither service, use, nor safely store on its own  will not bring Ukraine security or profits.    We can expect that the first real success may hold up  further  worsening in Russian-American relations. Apart from friendly  rhetoric, the strategic partnership does have a stable  foundation, albeit a nuclear-missile one. The nuclear threat  once helped to avert a third world war. Let us hope now that it  will prevent Russian-American relations from taking too drastic  turns in their course.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Interest helps push Lilley down 26% LILLEY, the Scotland-based construction and contracting group, yesterday reported a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in 1990 after a sharp increase in interest costs following its failure to take over fellow construction and property group Tilbury last summer. Taxable profits fell to Pounds 14.14m from Pounds 19.06m on sales up almost 10 per cent at Pounds 323.04m. Earnings per share fell to 7.99p (9.55p) but the directors are recommending a maintained final dividend of 1.5p, for an unchanged total of 2.5p. The failed takeover left Lilley with a 29.9 per cent stake in Tilbury and cost it Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 1.58m) in interest before the stake was sold in November. The Pounds 8.41m loss on the sale appeared as an extraordinary item. Interest on ongoing activities also rose to Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 246,000), largely because of the increased carrying cost of completed development properties. Debt fell to Pounds 31m (Pounds 48m) and gearing fell slightly from 114 to 98 per cent, excluding Pounds 17m of guaranteed debt relating to associated company investments. Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman, said the result was 'not unsatisfactory', given the tough market conditions. The decline had resulted from the property and housebuilding activities but sales and profits in the construction-related operations had improved. The group had opened offices in the Midlands and south of England and was well positioned to take advantage of a turnround in the economy. Currently Lilley has a land bank sufficient for four years. Mr Bob Rankin, chief executive, said the company planned to cut this to two and a half years, releasing about Pounds 10m of cash for debt repayment. He also said that Lilley was well positioned on the contracting side because it concentrated on small-sized 'bread and butter contracting' valued at less than Pounds 1m. COMMENT Judging by the share price, the market views Lilley as something of a bad penny. But like all coins it has two sides. Operationally, the contracting side has consistently outperformed the sector in terms of margin. Small acquisitions since last year when it failed to buy Tilbury have also positioned it well geographically to take advantage of any upturn in the economy. The problems lie in the balance sheet. Gearing down marginally at 98 per cent obscures at least Pounds 17m of off-balance sheet obligations relating to its share of properties in associate companies. Not only do the two largest properties remain unlet but interest that was capitalised before their completion will now directly have an impact on revenue from associated companies. Proposed asset sales will help, as will a reduction in the land bank. Nevertheless brokers are forecasting Pounds 13m pre-tax profits for this year, giving 6.3p of earnings and a prospective multiple of about 8.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Swiss entry threatens IMF balance THE delicate balance in the International Monetary Fund between developing countries and the industrialised world is being shaken by a dispute over Switzerland's entry into the Washington-based organisation. Switzerland has for decades refused to join the IMF or the World Bank because of its strict policy of neutrality, but in May the Swiss government won a national plebiscite in favour of IMF membership. Developing countries complain, however, that Switzerland is now reneging on a pledge made last year by Mr Otto Stich, its finance minister, not to claim a seat on the IMF's board to the detriment of developing countries. Diplomats in Washington say Switzerland's aggressive drive to obtain a seat could displace from the board the representative of a group of mostly French-speaking African nations. Swiss Finance Ministry officials deny they are reneging on their pledge, but say the IMF must deal with the inevitable shake-up resulting from the entry of a country with its financial weight, as well as the republics of the former Soviet Union. IMF members with the largest quotas - the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan and Saudi Arabia - hold permanent board seats in their own rights. Other countries must form constituencies to elect the remaining 16 executive directors, with votes apportioned according to each country's IMF quota. If Switzerland forms a constituency it would have enough votes to squeeze out a constituency currently composed of 24 African and Indian Ocean countries, most of them Francophone. Switzerland's quota alone, about 2 per cent of the IMF total, would be more than the 1.99 per cent mustered by the Francophone countries. This would upset the board's balance by adding, in the view of developing countries, another voice for the economic policies espoused by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Paris-based grouping of 24 industrialised nations, including Switzerland. Swiss finance ministry officials confirm they have had contacts with other countries, including Turkey, Poland and several former Soviet republics, about forming a constituency. They are optimistic one will be set up by the end of the month. The officials acknowledge they promised not to eject a less developed country from the board; indeed, they say it would be impossible as there is a convention requiring African groups to control at least two IMF seats. But they also made clear their belief that a country the size of Switzerland should be represented. 'We have written to the rules committee saying we want a seat, but as newcomers we do not feel we should propose solutions. It is up to them,' an official said. One proposed solution would be to add another seat to the executive board, which is already due to grow to 23 with the addition of a Russian director. While OECD countries generally feel Russia would side with other borrowing nations, some developing countries believe it will attempt to behave like a superpower. But several leading countries - including the US, Japan and Canada - have indicated they would oppose creation of yet another seat for Europe, which already has three permanent and four elected executive directors. Between them they have enough votes to block the creation of a new seat.</p>

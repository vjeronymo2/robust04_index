			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Oftel to ease curbs on competitors to BT A SHIFT TO a lighter regulatory regime for competitors to British Telecommunications is signalled by Oftel, the industry regulator, in its annual report. The change, which Oftel believes could lead to improved service and more competition, concerns the 'service obligations' imposed on new telecommunications operators in their licences. These typically include requirements to build networks covering a proportion of a licence area in a specified period, and to maintain minimum service standards. Mr Bill Wigglesworth, Oftel's deputy director-general, says in the report: 'Sufficient obligations are needed to ensure satisfactory services . . . but improved services will otherwise generally be best secured by consumer choice in a competitive market.' Mr Wigglesworth makes a distinction between obligations on BT as the dominant operator, and those on competitors. 'This was previously partly obscured by the restricted number of players, all of whom could be regarded as having a privileged position,' he says. Although geared mainly to new companies, which have been encouraged to come forward since the government abolished the formal duopoly between BT and Mercury two years ago, Oftel says its ideas on 'regulatory simplification' might also be applied to existing operators by amending their licences. The Department of Trade and Industry, acting on Oftel's advice, has already moved in this direction with recent licences. Those granted to Ionica and Energis to build national networks contain far fewer obligations than does Mercury's licence. Mercury, as well as the cellular mobile operators and the cable TV companies which are building phone networks in conurbations, stand to gain from the reform. Although stressing their readiness to meet obligations, a number of cable companies, in particular, might welcome a relaxation of 'staging post' obligations to pass certain numbers of houses within a specified time. Oftel's annual report shows the number of complaints to the regulator down for the first time in five years. Last year 41,026 complaints were received from consumers in England, down from 41,393 in 1991.</p>

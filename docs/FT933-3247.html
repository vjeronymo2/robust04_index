			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / US retail sales point to stronger growth THE US economy may be gathering momentum after a lacklustre first half, figures released yesterday indicated. The Commerce Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent between July and August, the biggest increase since the spring. Wall Street analysts had predicted an increase of 0.2 per cent or less. The annual rate of inflation was unchanged at 2.8 per cent. Separate data for retail sales pointed to stronger than expected consumer spending. Officials said retail sales rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 6.3 per cent compared with August last year. Figures for July were revised substantially to show a gain relative to June of 0.3 per cent against a previous estimate of 0.1 per cent. Analysts at Merrill Lynch, the New York broker, said the figures were consistent with growth of real consumer spending at a robust annual rate of 3.5-4.0 per cent in the third quarter. Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the figures implied the economy was 'on track' to achieve the acceleration of growth predicted in the Clinton administration's recent 'mid-session' economic forecast. The economy grew at a disappointing annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the first half. The White House and many private sector forecasters are predicting growth at an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent in this half. The strongest components of retail sales last month were sectors sensitive to interest rates that have benefited from a sharp recent decline in long-term rates to the lowest levels in a generation. Sales of building materials, hardware and mobile homes rose 1.8 per cent last month and 11.6 per cent in the year to August. Sales of motor vehicles and parts rose 0.7 per cent and 14.3 per cent respectively. Overall, sales of durable goods (items lasting several years) rose 0.6 per cent last month and 12.1 per cent in the year to August. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.</p>

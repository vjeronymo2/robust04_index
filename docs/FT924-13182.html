			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / High stakes but low hopes: Today's summit is unlikely to break the Maastricht impasse Only one thing is certain about today's European summit at Birmingham: it will not solve the problems hanging over the future of the Maastricht treaty. The 12 European leaders will all declare their unanimous commitment to Maastricht. But there is clearly a danger that this public relations exercise, which is intended to help assuage the widespread popular mood of scepticism towards the treaty, will in fact backfire, and instead persuade the public that the treaty and perhaps the Community are irrelevant to the deepening recession in Europe. British diplomats say they are optimistic that the European leaders should have no great difficulty in drafting a declaration on the elusive new European principle of 'subsidiarity', which is supposed to reassure the voters that the treaty will not take the European Community rushing in the direction of a centralised federal state. 'I see no great difficulty,' says one senior British diplomat. 'All we need are criteria and procedures for filtering new European legislation which goes too far in the direction of centralised interference, as well as criteria and procedures for repealing old legislation which went too far.' Such confidence seems overdone. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, finds the problem so perplexing that he has offered a reward to anyone who can define subsidiarity on one side of a sheet of paper. The German government has circulated a memorandum on the subject which runs to 10 pages and is totally incomprehensible, at least in its English translation. But even if British optimism on this particular issue should turn out to be justified, it is already clear that the Danish government will need much more than a declaration on subsidiarity, however lucid, before it can submit the Maastricht treaty to a new referendum. And unless the Danes can reverse their No vote of last June, the treaty as it stands cannot come into force. No one knows what would be needed to persuade Danish voters to change their minds, and the Danish government has yet to formulate its requirements. But the signals from Danish political parties indicate that they will be looking for changes of substance in such areas as economic and monetary union (Emu), defence and social policy, which would allow them to opt out of commitments accepted by the others. Moreover, these changes would have to go well beyond informal gentlemen's agreements, and be legally enforceable. There lies the rub. The Danish prime minister said yesterday that special arrangements could be made for Denmark without changing the treaty. But if these arrangements are legally enforceable, they must be a substantive change to the treaty itself. Since this would amount to a renegotiation of the treaty, all the member governments would be compelled to start their national ratification procedures all over again. That could spell the death of Maastricht. It was only by the narrowest of margins that the French electorate voted in favour of it last month, and there could be no assurance that they would vote the same way again. French officials and pro-European commentators freely admit that there are aspects of the treaty which are open to criticism; but the last thing they want is to open the Pandora's Box of a renegotiation. 'The treaty framework for Emu is much too rigid,' says a senior French diplomat; 'to pretend to set up a system which would make the movement towards monetary union unstoppable is just puerile. But the immediate task is a salvage operation.' The main threat to the survival of Maastricht does not come directly from the Danish No vote, however, but from the possible knock-on in Britain. As a matter of principle all member governments are firmly opposed to any renegotiation. As a matter of practice, they would no doubt be prepared to make some declaratory concessions to Denmark. But, in the last resort, they are unlikely to be ready to jeopardise the whole treaty just to appease the Danes. If the Danes are unable to reverse their No vote, the Community is in a quandary with no easy solution. One option, clearly allowed for in the Danish government's White Paper, would be for Denmark to leave the Community. If that were to happen, it would constitute a seismic reversal of the process of European integration, and a traumatic blow to the European Community. But in the case of British ratification, the stakes are even higher. A refusal by the House of Commons to ratify Maastricht would not merely kill the treaty, but would have far-reaching consequences for the general trend of European integration which are impossible to predict in detail but hard to overstate. That is why the Danish conundrum is potentially triply dangerous. The first danger is that Danish demands could trigger a chain reaction of similar demands in other countries, starting with Britain, for the same or different opt-outs. This could mean a progressive unravelling of the treaty, and perhaps its eventual abandonment. Second, even if such general unravelling were avoided, the British government could find that ratification in Westminster might start to become conditional on securing analogous treaty changes for Britain. As of now, it may be able to intimidate the waverers with a stark choice between Yes and No, in or out; but the argument could become more difficult if there seemed to be a three-way choice, between Yes, No and Danish. Third, the Danish government's drawn-out timetable, which envisages a new referendum next summer at the earliest, could delay the ratification process in the House of Commons. The official British line is that the UK government only needs a clear signal from the Danish government, on its proposed solution to the Danish problem, to be able to press rapidly ahead with ratification towards the end of this year. The undertow of political reality, however, is likely to force a certain coincidence between the British and Danish timetables. That suggests that the future of Maastricht could still be up in the air nine months from now. It is not at all clear that the other member states are ready to wait that long. Last month there was speculation that an inner core of member states, starting with France, Germany and the Benelux countries, might start to move towards monetary union without waiting for Britain or the complete ratification of the treaty. These rumours were immediately denied and they are still being denied: 'There is no plan for a two-speed Europe,' a senior German diplomat said this week. 'The Maastricht treaty must be ratified by all 12.' Strictly speaking, these denials are true in at least three senses: there is no agreed two-speed plan, as such, even of a contingency character; the French, at least, are very uncertain that they want to find themselves in a mini-Europe with the Germans; and the French and Germans both want to stifle any talk which could make John Major's domestic predicament more difficult, by suggesting that 'the Continent' is ganging up on Britain. 'We have a very simple idea,' says a top French official. 'We want Maastricht to be ratified as soon as possible. We have no new initiative to take. We want to help Mr Major as far as we can.' When Mr Delors floated the idea of a two-speed Europe, he caused anger in the French government. 'It looked as though Delors was trying to blackmail the British,' says Mr Serge July, editor of Liberation, the French daily. 'The people at the Elysee thought this was stupid, because they want to help Major, and they were wild with rage.' There is no reason to doubt French sincerity on this point, since they have always been committed to a universalist idea of the Community. Throughout the negotiations on the treaty, they stuck to the view that all member states ought to be aiming to reach the final stage of monetary union, including such unlikely candidates as Italy. This was partly for the semi-sentimental reason that Italy was one of the original six member states. But closer to home is the deep conviction that the wider Community is the essential counterpart of the Franco-German relationship. Ever since De Gaulle and Adenauer, Franco-German friendship has been a cardinal component in the foreign policy of both countries. For France, in particular, it has been the vehicle of reconciliation after three cataclysmic wars. As a result, their partnership has become the central motor in the development of the Community, especially in the past decade. The Maastricht treaty is primarily the result of a sequence of joint initiatives repeatedly taken by President Francios Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. The Community serves the interests of all its members; it also helps to resolve the painful political conflicts inherited by France and Germany, but that heritage would be much more difficult to handle without the Community. Talk of a two-speed Europe has brought these doubts to the surface in both capitals. 'It is useful that France and Germany stick together now,' says a senior German diplomat. 'But in the medium term there will be various alliances in the Community, and there should not be too much emphasis on the Franco-German axis. I cannot imagine the EC going on without Britain.' His view is echoed by Mr Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs spokesman for SPD, the German opposition party. 'The Franco-German relationship is still a necessary motor. But France alone is no longer strong enough to bind us. There is no longer a balance with France.' The French still believe in the partnership as the traditional motor of the Community. But they fear German domination in a mini-Europe of five or six countries, and they certainly do not want to be left alone in an uncomfortable tete-a-tete with Germany. Moreover, there is emerging in Paris a new tendency to see the Community in more political and inter-governmental terms, in which the tone would be set by the triple relationship between France, Germany and Britain. 'Our conception of Europe,' says a senior Elysee official, 'is that France, Germany and Britain are fairly close.' But the desire of France and Germany to help Mr Major is not unlimited, and it will not last for ever. It will not extend to changing the treaty, and it may not last much beyond next spring. Neither France nor Germany wants to forge a mini-Europe; but neither is likely to be prepared to leave Europe in limbo. Mr Mitterrand is an elderly man in uncertain health, and his Socialist party is expected to suffer a heavy defeat in the general elections next March. That may well be the deadline for Mr Major to show that he can and will ratify the treaty as it stands.</p>

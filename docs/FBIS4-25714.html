			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Government Work Report delivered by </F> autonomous regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the Second  Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Congress; from the "News" program -- read by announcer]    [Text] In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: For  some time to come, the guiding principle governing economic  development in farming and pastoral areas is to deepen reform,  rely on scientific and technological progress, increase  investment, make better use of our resources, readjust the  industrial structure, quicken the pace of eliminating poverty,  increase peasants' and herdsmens' incomes in keeping with the  need to establish a socialist market economic system. We will  continue to stabilize and improve the policy that will remain  unchanged for a long time to come -- that of letting farmers  cultivate land independently and herdsmen own the domestic  animals they raise and conduct their own management. We will  also institute measures to ensure that land acreage will not  change with the increase or decrease in the number of people  working on it; implement a licensing system for grassland  utilization; clearly define grassland utilization rights; and  gradually institute the system of transferring, on a voluntary  basis, the right to use land and grassland in return for  payments without changing the ownership and designated uses of  land and grassland. We should increase the proportion of fiscal  and credit input in fixed assets related to agriculture and  animal husbandry, and will encourage collectives and individuals  to increase input in agriculture and animal husbandry.    In accordance with market demand, we will revamp the crop  and  plant cultivation structure while ensuring steady increases in  grain output, focusing on the Yarlung Zangbo-Lhasa-Nyang Qu  Valley and the Nyang He Valley. We will gradually switch to a  three-crop structure based on grain, cash, and feed crops. We  will make active efforts to develop animal husbandry in rural  areas, promote local grain conversion, and speed up the  construction of bases for fattening cattle and goats.    In his report, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu noted: In developing  village and town enterprises, we should proceed from local  conditions, map out rational and overall plans, and concentrate  such enterprises in cities and towns where energy supplies are  assured, transportation facilities are developed, and the  economies are relatively brisk. In accordance with market  demand and local resources, we should launch projects geared to  whichever sector can be developed. We should organize  production and management in whichever way is beneficial to  development. Localities with the right conditions may set up  joint enterprises across township and county lines. The  departments concerned should lend full support to the  development of village and town enterprises in terms of capital,  technology, manpower, and information, and provide sound  guidance and service.    The report said: With the marketing of newly harvested grain  this year, we will increase the procurement prices of wheat and  rapeseeds. After adjusting the price of chemical fertilizer, we  will convert into direct subsidies for peasant households any  funds made available as a result of reduced subsidies to  agriculture-supporting enterprises as compensation for  policy-induced losses. Both the autonomous region and all  prefectures, cities, and counties should establish risk-control  funds for agriculture and animal husbandry, and ensure the  sustained development of these two sectors.    The autonomous region has created a leading group for  aid-the-poor projects, which will specifically take charge of  aid-the-poor projects across the region. It will actively aid  the poor through development, science and technology, and  resource exploitation so that a number of people will be lifted  out of poverty within specified periods and become better-off  gradually.</p>

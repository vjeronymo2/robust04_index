			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz in Tel Aviv] </F>   [Text] This morning's cautious optimism about the Cairo  talks has not changed even after the negotiating team reported  to a meeting at the prime minister's bureau. The team reported  on the progress made -- although no agreements were reached --  on what is called security in the territories, or more to the  point, the observers and Palestinian police force in Hebron.  The following agreements are being worked on: About 100  Norwegians will be deployed as an observer force. They will be  armed with revolvers. The Palestinian force will apparently be  made up of several dozen policemen, which will belong to the  Hebron Municipality and be linked to the Palestinian police  force to be set up in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, while  operationally it will be subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces]. This is the deal being worked out. One of those who  participated in this morning's meeting is Minister Yosi Sarid  who is on the telephone with us.    [Raz] There is talk of restrained optimism. Can you tell us  on what we should be optimistic and on what pessimistic?    [Sarid] Not only can I not expand, but I do not want to. In  fact, I even wish to minimize. I think all the figures being  mentioned are very imprecise, and I do not think it is proper to  make a commitment about a figure. There are still differences  between our position and that of the Palestinians. We will now  try to bridge the gaps, but I would not like to mention a  figure. I recommend treating any figure mentioned with  circumspection.    [Raz] Minister Sarid, is the problem one of figures, since I  believe that the understandings being worked out refer to about  100 Norwegian observers and several dozen Palestinian policemen.    [Sarid] I do not want to go into that because I do not think  we should go into numbers, since as I have already said that  figure is so imprecise.    [Raz] Is the problem one of numbers while the principle of  deploying observers and a Palestinian police in Hebron has been  agreed on?    [Sarid] I think Israel has already agreed to a Palestinian  urban police force. We still have many problems relating to its  size, powers, and to whom it will report, that still have to be  resolved. The same is true about the international presence. I  think that in principle the matter is agreed on, but there are  issues which still have to be resolved.    [Raz] What was the mood of the Palestinians you met? Are  they still trying to dictate to us terms for the resumption of  the autonomy talks?    [Sarid] First, I did not meet them, therefore I cannot say,  but I think that based on the report we received from the  Israeli delegation, we got the impression that there were deep  deliberations. I do not think that any ultimatum was issued.  What is perhaps important to note is that both sides appear  committed to continuing the process and that they want to make  progress since both understand it is vital in the present  situation.    [Raz] Was it hinted to them in some, as reported by one of  the newspapers, that the Jewish settlement in Tall al-Rumaythah  will be uprooted immediately after Passover?    [Sarid] Nothing like that was hinted to them. I reiterate,  if the Israeli Government one day makes a decision on the  relocation of the Jewish settlement in Hebron it will do so  totally unrelated to the negotiations with the PLO and to any  PLO demands. It will be an independent decision by the Israeli  Government based on clear-cut security reasons.    [Raz] Minister Sarid, this morning Foreign Minister Peres  said that assuming the Gaza-Jericho talks open in Cairo, they  can be completed within two to three weeks. Does that  assumption remain intact following the consultations at the  prime minister's bureau?    [Sarid] I usually support the foreign minister's evaluation.  I believe that in addition to both sides being committed to the  negotiations, there is also a desire by both to speed them up  and complete them as soon as possible while remaining as loyal  as possible to the original dates in the Declaration of  Principles [DOP]. As is known, due to what happened in Hebron,  time was lost, therefore it is difficult to assume we will  totally meet the original dates, but they will hopefully be as  close as possible to the date in the DOP.    [Raz] Does that means that the withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho will start in the first third of April?    [Sarid] I do not want to make a commitment about any  specific date; I think that would be wrong. We always know  there can be unanticipated events. I said, and I am prepared to  say so again, that whoever views late May as the date when the  implementation of the DOP can take place, will not be far off,  but that is merely an assumption.    [Raz] One more question. Minister Sarid, after Sunday's  cabinet meeting you said that the time is drawing near when a  decision will have to be made about evacuating Hebron since  otherwise the whole country will go up in flames. Are we  drawing close to that date?    [Sarid] That is my personal view. I do not think we can put  off for long decisions which have to be made, but they have to  be made independently irrespective of the negotiations since the  situation calls for them.</p>

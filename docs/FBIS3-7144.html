Papers here  today brand this as unpardonable acts of military provocation  and premeditated kickup of military confrontation.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The grave military step taken by the South Korean puppet  clique at the instigation of the United States is a very grave  provocation going beyond the limit of mere threat to us.    We can never tolerate and overlook the military racket of  the South Korean puppets encouraged by outside forces.    The Korean people and People's Army do not want a war but  are  never afraid of it.    If the South Korean puppets dare ignite a war against us,  our  people and People's Army will answer it with a hundred-fold  retaliation.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst declares that if the Kim Yong-sam  group provoked a war against the North in league with outside  forces, we would take a decisive self-defensive step to defend  the socialist motherland and the dignity of the nation.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASTRO PITCHER GETS OFF SCOTT FREE IN EYES OF HERSHISER, DODGERS  </P> <P> What does The Times have against bike racing?  </P> <P> There has been minor coverage of a few local events, some wire-service stories  on international races and attention paid to Greg LeMond's Tour de France  victory. But during this period The Times has carried three in-depth  cycling-related stories: on Barbara Buchan's lawsuit against the U.S. Cycling  Federation; on Cindy Olavarri's problems with steroids, and Randy Harvey's  follow-up piece on Greg LeMond -- featuring the rumor that his last pro team  sponsor wanted him to take a banned drug.  </P> <P> That is too much scandal for the small substance The Times prints about bike  racing.  </P> <P> HOWARD DOERFLING  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

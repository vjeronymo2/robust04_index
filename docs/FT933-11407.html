			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Grupo Industrial Maseca Grupo Industrial Maseca, Mexico's leading corn flour maker, reports net profits of 36,348m new pesos (Dollars 11.65m) in the second quarter, a better-than-expected 19.7 per cent increase in real terms compared to the same period last year, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Maseca is one of Mexico's largest consumer food companies, and the biggest seller of corn flour, out of which is made the tortilla. It is currently expanding capacity, having just opened a new plant in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city. Maseca's margins also increased from 14.3 per cent to 16.25 per cent in the second quarter.</p>

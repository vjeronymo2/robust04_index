			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTING THE DESERT  </P> <P> Your editorial "Desert Dilemma" (Aug. 27) conveys the impression that  proponents of the California Desert Protection Act have not sought compromise  to help it pass. In fact, there have been a number of significant changes made  in the most recent introduction of the bill, and we have been very clearly  willing to address specific concerns. There haven't been more changes simply  because it takes two to make a compromise, and there are few specific conflicts  to be addressed.  </P> <P> The bill's opponents have consistently taken an anti-park and wilderness  position. They want to retain their privilege to continue past destructive  practices without change. They consider land management that stresses resource  protection and development for public recreation and interpretation as an  infringement of that right.  </P> <P> The lack of evident agreement also results from there really being few specific  conflicts in the bill that require compromise. It was drawn so as to avoid  unnecessary problems with existing uses, and it has little impact on current  mining, recreation, and other consumptive purposes.  </P> <P> Finally, we are uniformly convinced that there is an increased need for  National Park Service management in the California desert. The NPS mission to  preserve and interpret for the enjoyment of future generations differs  fundamentally from the Bureau of Land Management's mandate for multiple-use  management.  </P> <P> The desert requires large areas for effective ecosystem protection and  interpretation, and it is difficult to find such expanses in pristine condition  for future parks. Instead, it requires the vision to see the potential of such  areas, and the patience to pursue management practices to restore them to their  intrinsic glory. The East Mojave is such a rough nugget, and despite its few  scars it is a treasure trove of natural and scenic wonders. It has well-defined  and manageable boundaries. It is a natural find for the management skills of  the Park Service, and an essential part of the land use mix envisioned for the  California desert.  </P> <P> JIM DODSON  </P> <P> Director, California  </P> <P> Desert Protection League  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

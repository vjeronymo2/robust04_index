			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK 1992 Forecast: Signs not encouraging - David Currie says any British upturn will be anaemic and hesitant It has been a grim Christmas for business and the prospect is for a bleak new year. This time last year, Mr Lamont's best hope was that the recession would be short and sharp, leaving time for the sense of recovery to be firmly established ahead of the election. As it is, weakness overseas in the US and Europe, coupled with lack of confidence at home, has led to a prolonged slowdown. In a technical sense, recession is probably over, with the economy bumping along the bottom and a slow, hesitant rise in output in prospect. But it is only technical and may not help Mr Lamont and his government's electoral position: it will be some time before perceptions shift and confidence recovers. The UK position is not helped by the absence of any good news about the world economy since the summer. In the US consumer and business confidence is fading away, and it remains to be seen whether the action of the Federal Reserve in cutting the discount rate to its lowest level for more than 25 years will head off a 'double-dip' recession. Germany, which acted as a locomotive for Europe through much of 1990-91, slowed markedly towards the end of last year as a result of tax increases and high interest rates. The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates further in the week before Christmas to head off inflationary pressures will add to the slowdown in Germany. In consequence, recovery in the other European economies is being held back by high real interest rates and slow export demand. At home, the striking policy success has been the rapid fall in inflation from its peak of more than 10 per cent in the later part of 1990 to about 3 1/2 per cent now. In large part this reflects the impact of recession, though it probably also owes something to Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism. But there remains an important question-mark over the UK economy's ability to combine low inflation with growth. Nineteen ninety-one has demonstrated that a German inflation performance is possible in the UK. In 1992, we will learn whether the UK can sustain low inflation only at the cost of slow output growth and unemployment close to 3m. The signs are not encouraging: the prospect is for a hesitant and anaemic recovery this year and next. The recovery of demand at home is restrained, as elsewhere, by high real interest rates and slow world growth, but also by very high debt levels, both personal and corporate, and a weak housing market. Last year, pressures on the corporate sector and in the housing market led to an overall fall in investment of more than 11 per cent, while destocking exceeded 1 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product. At the same time, consumer spending fell by 0.8 per cent as the personal sector savings ratio rose to more than 10 per cent. This year, investment is likely to fall a little further, by about 2 per cent, while destocking will continue, though at about half the level. The reduction in destocking provides an important boost to domestic demand, adding about 0.8 per cent this year. Even with fairly sluggish external demand and a flat savings ratio, this gives positive growth this year of about 1 1/4 per cent, measured year on year. This represents a 1 percentage point slower recovery than the chancellor forecast in the Autumn Statement, and a much more anaemic recovery than he would like as the election looms. Output will take until 1993 to regain its previous peak of 1990: the UK economy will then have been in a no-growth trough for three years. Unemployment is set to rise towards 3m in 1993, before turning down. With a sluggish economy ahead of the election, Mr Lamont will be examining all available policy options. Unfortunately these are strictly circumscribed. The Bundesbank's decision to raise interest rates has all but eliminated the scope for a cut in UK rates ahead of the election if sterling's position within the ERM is not to be jeopardised, and it is quite possible that we will have to match the rise in interest rates of other European countries. The size of the prospective Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, set to rise to more than Pounds 20bn, in excess of 3 per cent of GDP (see accompanying chart), means that there is little economic case for a giveaway Budget, which would in any case have no impact on the economy in time for the election. The effects of an expansionary budget would come through just as the economy was recovering spontaneously, and might excessively stoke up domestic demand. Despite this, Mr Lamont and his advisers will be seeking to maximise the effects of their budget measures on immediate electoral prospects and on confidence, so the likelihood of a giveaway Budget must be high. Beyond the election, the policy options widen. There will be the early opportunity to correct the impression left by Maastricht that the UK is lukewarm on Europe by renouncing the opt-out clause on monetary union. It may well prove more politically advantageous to do this early on in a new parliament, rather than leave it as a divisive mid-term issue, and a Labour government may choose to combine this with adoption of the Social Charter. With the uncertainty associated with the election out of the way, the time may be right to move to a narrow band in the exchange rate mechanism. The newly elected government will also face a continuation of the problem that has plagued the Conservatives for the period of this parliament: the fact that the electoral and economic cycles are out of kilter. There is the danger that the economy will boom in the first half of the next parliament, and then slow for the second half, just as it has in this parliament. One possibility is to bring the parliamentary cycle into line with the economic cycle, by having an election within two years (a possible necessity in the event of a slim majority or a hung parliament). Alternatively, a newly elected government may prefer to take the hard measures early, and adopt restrictive fiscal measures, bringing down the widening budget deficit. In that case, it will take longer for output to regain its 1990 peak, and unemployment will peak at more than 3m before starting to fall again.

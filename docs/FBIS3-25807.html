It issued a circular to keep a tight rein on the country's  fixed asset investments in 1994.    While affirming the achievements made in economic  construction last year, the circular warns against the tendency  in investment over-expansion caused by extended building scales  and sluggish restructuring.    It points out that construction should focus on top-priority  projects, while approval of new projects should be brought under  strict control. In principle, no new projects will be approved  this year, it adds.    The People's Bank of China should keep a close watch on the  overall loans for fixed asset investment and where they go,  while no banks are allowed to offer loans for any new project  that is not approved by the State Council and the State Planning  Commission, it says.    It also bans any extending of issues of bonds and securities  and expansion of experimental scope of stock companies without  authorization.    While focusing on badly needed housing, a tight rein must  also be kept on development of real estate and building of  development zones, it says.    It says that close attention should be paid to strengthen  the  guidance and standardized management of direct foreign-funded  projects in order to encourage foreign investment in the  domestic infrastructure facilities and basic industry.    The circular concludes that the leadership of the  macro-control over fixed asset investment should also be  enhanced to ensure a sustained, fast and healthy economic  development in 1994.</p>

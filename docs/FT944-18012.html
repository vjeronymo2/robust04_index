			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Honda to make Dominator in Italy Honda Motor is to manufacture its NX 650 Dominator motorcycle at its Italian plant, shifting production of the model from its Japanese operation, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. The car and motorcycle manufacturer said production would start before the year end at Honda Italia's Atessa plant at an initial rate of 6,000 units a year. Honda is shipping production equipment for the motorcycle from its Japanese plant to Atessa, making investment for the output start-up minimal. The NX 650 Dominator, sold exclusively in Europe, is currently exported from Japan. Honda will continue to export engines from its Japanese plant, but all other parts will eventually be acquired from sources in Europe. The company said the shift of production to Italy would help reduce manufacturing and marketing costs, which have been affected by the strength of the yen since last year.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / CSCE defers peace mandate Foreign ministers of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe yesterday postponed a decision on Russia's bid for a CSCE mandate for its 'peacekeeping' operations in the former Soviet Union. However, they did ask the CSCE secretariat in Vienna to draw up a set of rules as a basis for the sanctioning of military intervention by Russian forces. These are likely to emphasise the timely dispatch of armed monitors to potential trouble spots and the setting up of parallel political dispute-settling processes. Former Soviet states have been arguing that approval for Russian military peacekeeping in former Soviet territories would constitute a new 'Yalta agreement', creating two security zones in Europe. But western diplomats argue that the west is unlikely to provide troops to address the security risks in Transcaucasia and central Asia. With elections in Russia looming, ministers also wanted to avoid any hint of rejecting the Russian proposals. But Mr Anatoli Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister refused to be restrained by electoral considerations when he strongly rebutted the attack on Ukraine's nuclear policies made on Tuesday by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. Dismissing Russia's claim that Ukraine's slow and partial ratification of the US-Soviet Start 1 agreement was re-creating a nuclear risk in Europe, Mr Zlenko said 'everyone knows that the nuclear button remains in Russian hands and that Ukraine has no intention of obtaining operational control'. Quentin Peel adds from Bonn: France and Germany yesterday called for the Western European Union, as the arm of common defence policy in the European Union, to become a vehicle for bringing the countries of eastern Europe closer to western defence structures - but stopping short of full Nato membership.</p>

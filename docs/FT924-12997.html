			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Be sure you understand just what you're buying - Scherazade Daneshku explores the finer points of the market / Planning Your Pension SO you have decided to take out a personal pension. The variety of choice might tempt many people to give up the whole exercise; but if you are not in an occupational scheme and do not take out a personal pension, you will have only an inadequate state pension to live on after retirement. When it comes to choosing, the golden rule is to forget about projections which are presented to you and are far too theoretical to be of any use. It is better to understand how your premiums are invested so you can get an idea of what you might expect from different types of policies. There are, essentially, two types of personal pension plans - with-profits or unit-linked, although there are also cash-based deposit funds. Unit-linked You are most likely to be offered a unit-linked plan these days. Your contributions are invested through buying units in a selection of funds offered by the life company. Unless you choose a cash fund, units are bought at the offer price and sold (when you come to take the benefits) at the lower bid price. The difference between the two is usually around 5 to 6 per cent to account for the cost of managing the fund and releasing the assets. There are no bonuses. But the trouble with unit-linked funds is that they depend mainly on stock market performance - and the aptitude of the fund manager. They are, therefore, considered somewhat riskier than conventional with-profits policies (see below). But policyholders have flexibility because of the choice of funds available, and they can seek to lessen risk by splitting contributions between funds. For example, if you are nearing retirement, you could switch into a cash fund to avoid a last-minute market plunge. With-profits plans These contracts, which date from the 1950s, used to dominate the market but have been eclipsed by the sale in recent years of unit-linked and unitised with-profits pension policies. Contributions are paid into a common fund which is invested in equities, property and gilts after initial charges are deducted. The 'profits' are those that the fund manager is expected to make through his investment strategy. These are passed on to the policyholder as bonuses. The life company guarantees to pay you a substantial sum at maturity. That amount is supplemented by two types of bonuses - annual and terminal. Annual bonuses (also known as reversionary bonuses) are declared each year and added to the contributions. Once the annual bonus is added to the guaranteed sum, it cannot be taken away. When you come to take the benefits, a discretionary terminal bonus is added to the accumulated fund. The size of terminal bonuses had been increasing until last year when many life companies began cutting them. Some industry observers believe they could disappear completely. Annual bonuses also are falling and are unlikely to be as high as they were in the 1980s. Unitised with-profits These are a new product in the industry. Over the past three years, around three-quarters of life companies providing conventional with-profits policies have replaced them with the unit-linked version, mainly because they are cheaper for the companies to operate. Unlike a conventional with-profits policy, the life company does not guarantee a sum to be paid out at maturity. Your premiums are used to buy units, after which charges are deducted. Annual bonuses are added to the units. Deposit Cash or deposit-based plans do not have the long-term growth potential of equity-based plans but, if you are nearing retirement, you might not want to risk stock market investment. Interest on deposits is credited gross, instead of net, and you cannot make withdrawals until the time comes to take the benefits. The rates of interest paid are similar to base rates. Single or regular premiums? If you are in regular employment and expect to remain so you could opt for a regular premium contract. If your independent financial adviser (IFA) works on commission, you are likely to be recommended a regular premium contract, mainly because the commission is higher than on a single premium contract. Make sure you know which type of contract you are being sold - there are still cases where people who think they have a single premium contract realise too late that they were sold a regular premium contract. Commission on a single premium contract is unlikely to be more than 4 per cent, compared with as much as 60 per cent of the premiums you pay in the first few years on a 20-year regular premium contract. With the latter, commission usually is paid to the salesman at the beginning of the policy term, and the expenses to the policyholder are spread over the term of the contract. This means that if you have to cash-in the policy early, the expenses of the commission will have to be taken out of it - and your returns will be much lower than you expected. Charges are lower at the few non-commission life offices, including Professional Life and Provident Life, and with the few providers of unit-trust pensions, which include Fidelity and Gartmore. Single premium contracts are more suitable for those with fluctuating earnings or younger people who might expect to join an occupational scheme later in their working life. They also have the advantage of allowing you to spread risk by taking out a series of single premium contracts with different life companies. How to choose an insurance company Do not let yourself be sold a pension. Pensions are a personal and complicated area and it is important to have the best advice available. For this reason, Don Hall, of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, recommends going to a fee-based IFA specialising in pensions. But beware of fee-based IFAs promising to rebate you the full Lautro commission - they may pocket the difference between the Lautro rates and much higher actual rates. Avoid, too, the advice of a 'tied' agent who sells the products of one company. His range is limited, and he will often earn more in commission than an IFA for the sale of the same product. In the end, it is you who are paying the commission. Working out the charges on individual policies is a notoriously complicated affair because of the industry's obduracy in making its charging structure transparent. In general, your choice must be based on a combination of performance, low charges and good administration. Look at the top six or seven companies over at least five years and then check if their performance has been consistent over longer periods. Money Management magazine published its annual performance tables this month. Offices with a consistent performance over five, 10 and 15 years on the with-profits side (regular premiums) include Co-Operative, Pearl Assurance, Norwich Union, Commercial Union; and (single premiums) Clerical Medical, Pearl Assurance and Scottish Life. On the unit-linked side, consistency of performance is harder to detect, but companies which feature in the top five include M&amp;G over 15 years, Irish Life (over 10) and Premium Life (over five). The survey shows that, in general, the performance of with-profits policies are better than those of unit-linked policies, particularly on regular premium contracts. But when the October 1987 stock market crash falls out of the five-year performance tables and if cuts in bonuses continue, there could be a reversal of fortunes in the performance of the two types of policies in the future.</p>

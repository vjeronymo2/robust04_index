			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Conservatives lose seats across country THE CONSERVATIVES lost seats steadily across the country in yesterday's municipal elections while Labour captured a number of key councils, write Richard Evans and Neil Buckley. Labour's performance varied in different parts of the country, with the most impressive results coming in the north-west and in parts of the Tory heartland in the south, but with a weaker showing through most of the Midlands. The Liberal Democrats did much better than forecast, scoring particularly well in some councils they had specifically targeted, but they also scored some unexpected victories in unlikely areas such as Durham and Wear Valley in the north-east. It was a mixed pattern that showed the Conservatives, seeking to hold the seats they won in 1987, very much on the defensive, while both the opposition parties made significant but not overwhelming inroads. The worrying news for the government was the number of councils lost in the south, where the Conservatives had hoped to retain most of their seats and virtually all the councils where they had gone into the election holding majorities. In the event, they lost overall control in Canterbury, St Albans, Winchester, Brentwood, Northampton, Stratford on Avon, Dover and Reigate and Banstead to a combination of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Independent opponents. The Tories also lost overall control at Solihull in the Midlands, one of only two metropolitan authorities that was still in Conservative hands. Labour scored significant victories at Darlington, taking the council with a swing of more than 6 per cent, and at Luton and Nottingham. Among councils captured in the north west were Wirral, Blackpool and Pendle in an area containing many Tory Parliamentary marginal seats. There was also good news for Labour in Cardiff, where they took the council with a swing of 8 per cent, and in Plymouth where they won overall control, taking seats from both the Tories and Liberal Democrats. However, there was less welcome news from Liverpool, with left-wing Labour rebels standing against their party's official candidates taking five out of the six seats contested. Labour also lost overall control in Barrow in Furness, Chorley and Basildon. The impressive Liberal Democrat gains came at Eastbourne, where the party won a Parliamentary by-election last year, Torbay, Gosport, Congleton, and Oadby. In addition, however, the party took Lewes from the Tories in the south and Wear Valley from Labour in the north east. A big blow for the Tories was the loss of overall control in Derby, but they gained Boothferry on Humberside from Labour.</p>

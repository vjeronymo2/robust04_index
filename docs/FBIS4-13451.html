			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Text] The prime minister's candor in today's session of  the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee was  surprising, at least in view of the fact that merely two days  ago, Rabin was furious at the disclosure of the very existence  of the General Staff working papers on the Israeli-Syrian  negotiations.    Senior political and military elements told us today: Rabin  has just confirmed what everybody has known for some time: He  and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have accepted the concept of  a full IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Golan  Heights, including the evacuation of all the settlements. The  ideal line suggested in the IDF treatise on partial withdrawal  lies 5 to 8 km away from the mountain ridge line -- the line  from which the Lake of Tiberias and the Hula Valley can be  observed. Today Rabin said: I am ready to move west of there  -- namely, up to the ridge line itself in the first stage and  probably completely off the Golan Heights in the second stage.    Hence, the haggling with the Syrians will be over other  issues: security arrangements, the manning of the Golan Heights  early warning stations, and the gradual nature of withdrawal.  As for acreage, the die has been cast.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1700 GMT on 19 April, in a report by political correspondent  Gadi Sukenik, adds: "There is doubt in Jerusalem that progress  with Syria is feasible" at this time, because "at this stage,  Peres and Rabin are not enthusiastic about either a U.S. visit  or any meaningful progress with Syria. At this stage, they  would prefer to postpone it until the IDF completes its  withdrawal, or rather, to turn to the Syrian track only after  the first stage of the Israel-PLO agreement is implemented."  Sukenik adds: "Almost every element involved in this issue  believes that when the process gets down to brass tacks, there  will be talk of full peace and full, or almost full, withdrawal  from the Golan."]</p>

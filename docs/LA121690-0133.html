			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME, AZTECS GET LAST LAUGH;  </P> <P> UC IRVINE: SAN DIEGO STATE, A 13-POINT LOSER TO THE ANTEATERS LAST SEASON,  SCORES AN 87-73 VICTORY.  </P> <P> They had heard all about UC Irvine and its full-court press, fast-break offense  and penchant for three-point shots. They remembered last year's 13-point loss,  embarrassing because Irvine proceeded to go on a school-record 15-game losing  streak immediately afterward.  </P> <P> What the San Diego State Aztecs weren't sure about was how their inexperienced  guards would react to it all, and whether their injury and flu-stricken team  would be able to keep up with the pace.  </P> <P> But Irvine was the team that needed to worry. The Aztecs led by 15 for much of  the second half and eased to an 87-73 victory in front of 1,384 in Peterson  Gym.  </P> <P> It was the first victory over a Division I team this season for San Diego State  (3-3), which has seen seven players miss practice time since the season started  because of various injuries or flu. But the Aztecs didn't have much of a  problem.  </P> <P> Marty Dow, San Diego's 7-foot-1 center, led the way with 23 points and 14  rebounds. Arthur Massey had 19 points, nine assists and six steals.  </P> <P> Jeff Herdman led Irvine (3-5) with 16 points.  </P> <P> With Dow clogging the middle, Irvine's Ricky Butler managed only 14 points --  five below his average -- and six rebounds -- two below his average.  </P> <P> San Diego State shot 52.9% from the field. Irvine shot 47%.  </P> <P> The Aztecs led, 50-39, at the half, but Irvine cut that to 56-53 with 15:26  remaining. James Lewis entered the game at that point, and he and Massey led  the way as San Diego State went on a 12-0 run. The Anteaters never got their  deficit below double digits again.  </P> <P> The turning point came after an exchange of centers with 8:09 remaining before  halftime and San Diego State ahead, 27-26.  </P> <P> At that point, Dow, who had been given a three-minute rest, re-entered the game  for Neal Steinly. Meanwhile, Irvine's Butler left after he picked up his second  foul.  </P> <P> The Aztecs went on a 10-4 run and led, 37-30, with 5:12 left. During that time,  Dow scored seven of San Diego's 10 points.  </P> <P> Dow had 15 points and eight rebounds at halftime, and despite Butler's return,  Irvine couldn't catch up.  </P></p>

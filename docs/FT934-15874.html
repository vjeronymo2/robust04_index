			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Ghost of Vietnam looms over Somalia muddle: The dilemma facing President Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton may have pacified for the moment a restless Congress and public with his exposition on Thursday evening of US policies in Somalia, doubling the size of US forces there but promising the withdrawal of almost all of them by March 31. But he did not answer, even to the satisfaction of those sympathetic to his dilemma, many of the questions still surrounding the US involvement in a distant country where, in the post-cold war era, no apparent US national interest is at stake. Perhaps the biggest of these is his assertion that conditions on the ground in Somalia will be so much improved six months from now that the UN and other nations, including Africans, can assume the US burden. In purely domestic terms Mr Clinton undoubtedly scored points with his argument that the US simply cannot 'cut and run' because American soldiers are killed or captured. Quoting General Colin Powell, the immensely respected and just retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to this end lent an additional validity. It also helped that he disavowed any central US role in shaping Somalia's future in the longer term beyond trying to prevent in the months ahead a return to anarchy and starvation and sending Mr Robert Oakley, the diplomat who knows Somalia well, back to facilitate any negotiations. But Mr Clinton's attempt to strike a middle ground between the twin poles of an early withdrawal and a bigger commitment struck many in the US as indelibly reminiscent of the early stages of US involvement in Vietnam. Already, comparisons are being freely made in the media here between General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somalia faction leader, and Ho Chi-minh, the Vietcong master tactician. The sense that his rag-tag, though well-armed, urban army would be easy meat for US firepower has been disabused by last weekend's disastrous engagement. Mr Clinton said in his speech, which never mentioned General Aideed by name, that it was crucial not to personalise the situation, and yesterday Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, did not rule out negotiations with the warlord. Yet US officials seem uncertain about General Aideed's intentions. On the one hand there is fear that he may seek to exploit US captives, as the revolutionary regime in Iran did in 1979-80: on the other it would be logical for him to lie low and husband his resources until after US forces depart, thus undermining Mr Clinton's rationale that the US merely wanted to make it possible for Somalis 'to reach agreement among themselves'. In this muddled context, the precise role of the beefed-up US military contingent remains unclear, beyond the task of protecting forces already on the ground. The president's mission statement included a reference to keeping the pressure on those who would frustrate the political process and the delivery of humanitarian supplies, but whether this amounts to a fully fledged assault on General Aideed's forces in south Mogadishu is unknown. There is also palpable tension between the US administration and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. He is widely accredited with persuading the US to go after General Aideed after the murder of 24 Pakistani peacekeepers in June which, in turn, led to the loss of American lives. It follows that there is little confidence in the ability of Mr Boutros Ghali and the UN to assemble the sort of peacekeeping presence able to take over from the US. If he fails - and if Mr Oakley is also unable to persuade other African nations to step in - then Mr Clinton may find himself facing another tricky decision next spring. There is another serious consequence of the Somali question. The tenor of political and public reaction in the US can leave no expectations that the US would agree to send its military to help enforce any peace in Bosnia were a settlement there to be reached. Indeed, it will only require a US soldier to lose a life in Haiti, where 600 are supposed to smooth the way for the return of President Jean Bertrand Aristide, for the overall cause of peacekeeping in American eyes to have been dealt a grievous blow. But buying time with Congress and the public does help. Mr Clinton's popularity ratings, awful this summer, are recovering towards where he stood at his inauguration, mostly because he has seemed more sure-footed and innovative at home. That is the business he needs to get back to.</p>

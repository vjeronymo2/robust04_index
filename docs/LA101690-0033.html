			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CONDEMNS HUSSEIN AMID CONFUSING SIGNALS  </P> <P> Bush Administration policy-makers are intensely studying a rash of confusing  signals from occupied Kuwait that could indicate an Iraqi plan to withdraw from  part of the country, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, Bush and his senior aides continue to issue  bellicose warnings about Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait -- warnings that one  official said are part of a deliberate campaign to prepare the American people  for the possibility of military action against Iraqi forces.  </P> <P> Bush, campaigning in Texas, for the first time explicitly compared Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler and, also for the first time, publicly  raised the possibility of a war crimes trial for the Iraqi leader's "ghastly  atrocities" against the Kuwaiti people.  </P> <P> "The story of two young kids passing out leaflets: Iraqi troops rounded up  their parents and made them watch while those two kids were shot to death --  executed before their eyes," Bush said as he listed the "horrible tales" of  Iraq's actions in Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Hitler revisited," he declared.  </P> <P> The strong rhetoric, U.S. officials say, is part of an effort to keep  international pressure focused on Iraq at a time when events elsewhere in the  Middle East, particularly in Israel, threaten to create dissension within the  anti-Iraq alliance.  </P> <P> Even more dissension would be likely if Iraq did withdraw from parts of Kuwait,  officials fear. And new signs indicating that may be a possibility have  prompted considerable discussion within the Administration.  </P> <P> "There are two schools of thought here," one Administration official said.  "One, that Saddam Hussein is trying to find a way out; the other, that he is  simply trying to divide everybody" by pretending to be willing to withdraw. The  tactic is one Hussein used frequently during the Iran-Iraq War.  </P> <P> "It could be something. We don't know," the official said.  </P> <P> Earlier this fall, some U.S. analysts, pointing to the massive looting of  Kuwait, had suggested that Hussein was planning to strip the country first,  then pull out of most of it. Iraq's chief interests in Kuwait, the analysts  noted, are a large oil field straddling the border between the two nations and  two Kuwaiti islands, Warba and Bubiyan, that command the approaches to Iraq's  only Persian Gulf port.  </P> <P> Iraqi denials of any willingness to withdraw from any part of Kuwait had  quieted such speculation. But the possibility is now being taken seriously once  more because of more recent signals, ranging from movements of border signposts  by Iraqi troops to statements by a ranking Soviet official after a visit to  Baghdad that Hussein had indicated a willingness to withdraw from much of  Kuwait.  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, the wife of the Kuwaiti planning minister, who recently left  Kuwait, reported that Iraq is fencing off the northern third of the country --  an area that includes the oil field and the disputed islands.  </P> <P> "The Iraqis are setting up a wire fence across Kuwait. They apparently plan to  gulp up Bubiyan and the northeastern oil field," said Fatima Hussein, who fled  her occupied country last week. She is the wife of Planning Minister Salman  Abdul-Razek Mutawa.  </P> <P> At the same time, a senior member of the Saudi royal family confirmed that  intelligence reports indicate Iraqi troops may be building reinforced positions  in northern Kuwait south of the disputed islands and the Rumaila oil field.  </P> <P> And a member of Kuwait's ruling Sabah family said he has received reports that  Iraqi troops are putting up concrete barriers along the Mutla Ridge, a range of  low mountains that separates northern Kuwait from the more populated areas  around Kuwait city.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti officials at the government-in-exile in Saudi Arabia are clearly  alarmed about the possibility of what, for many of them, has been a nightmare  scenario: a partial Iraqi pullout that likely would cause fatal leaks in the  international alliance against Iraq.  </P> <P> Nations now willing to confront Iraq for the liberation of Kuwait would be far  less likely to do so over a mere border dispute between the two nations, they  fear.  </P> <P> "We would become just another international conflict," one member of the Sabah  family said. "Another Palestine. Another Lebanon."  </P> <P> Indeed, many officials say that -- had Hussein seized only part of Kuwait in  the first place -- the international campaign against him never would have  gotten off the ground. After a brief period of protest, "we would have jumped  quickly there and mediated and kissed each other," one senior Arab diplomat  said.  </P> <P> The Kuwaitis, along with some Saudi and U.S. officials, fear that Hussein may  now try to pull back, hoping to hold onto much of what he truly wanted in the  first place while avoiding a war that would probably end his regime.  </P> <P> Other officials are far more skeptical, however.  </P> <P> "I don't believe Iraq now has any thinking of withdrawing from Kuwait," one  Saudi official said. "There is no sign at all that that is Hussein's intention.  The Iraqi officials still say they don't want to leave Kuwait, that there is no  Kuwait. Something like that doesn't mean peaceful intentions."  </P> <P> Administration officials say Bush would oppose settling for a partial  withdrawal from Kuwait but would have to defer to whatever decision the  Kuwaitis made on the issue. Any such compromise, U.S. officials fear, would be  seen in the Middle East as a victory for Hussein.  </P> <P> "It's certainly better to use the military option than it is to compromise your  objectives," one senior U.S. official said. "Do I think it is better to use the  military option than realize the existing objectives diplomatically? No. Is it  better to use the military option than having Saddam Hussein sit in Kuwait  forever? Yes. . . ."  </P> <P> The official said "everyone is pretty sober" about the possibility of war  although he added, "People realize that it's potentially costly, but it's a  serious option."  </P> <P> Bush, meanwhile, stepped up his condemnation of Hussein. In Texas, where he  campaigned for Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for governor, Bush  denounced Hussein's "systematic assault on the soul of a nation."  </P> <P> Reiterating reports delivered last month, when he was visited at the White  House by the Kuwaiti emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, Bush told of infants  removed from incubators and dialysis patients taken from kidney machines so  that the equipment could be shipped to Iraq.  </P> <P> "Remember -- when Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials," Bush  said, referring to the war crimes trials that followed World War II.  Administration officials have privately been investigating the possibility of  such trials since August.  </P> <P> Staff writers Kim Murphy in Saudi Arabia, Jack Nelson and Robin Wright in  Washington and James Gerstenzang, traveling with President Bush in Texas,  contributed to this report.  </P></p>

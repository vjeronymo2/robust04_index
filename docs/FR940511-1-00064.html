			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We propose to amend the regulations of the TCC program at &sect;256.2(a) to allow the State to determine ``physical or mental incapacity'' and at &sect;256.1(a) to allow the State to define the term in the State's Supportive Services Plan. Our reasons are further explained in the preamble to the proposed changes for part 255.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Voluntary Cessation of AFDC and Eligibility for TCC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We propose to amend &sect;256.2(b)(1) by adding a new subparagraph (ii) to allow States the option of making families who voluntarily terminate receipt of an AFDC benefit eligible for TCC. Under this option, working families that receive AFDC could request that their AFDC be terminated and still become eligible for TCC, provided that they meet all other TCC eligibility requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing regulation, which we propose to redesignate as &sect;256.2(b)(1)(i), requires that a family's eligibility for TCC is based on a loss of eligibility for AFDC due to the increased hours of employment, increased income from employment or loss of the income disregards due to time limits. In our consultations we have heard concerns that some working families find themselves ineligible for TCC because they voluntarily leave AFDC when they are still entitled to a grant. Therefore, we propose to allow the State the option to provide TCC to those working families who voluntarily request that their AFDC be terminated because their hours or income from employment have increased or they have lost the income disregards due to time limits, but are still eligible for AFDC. This policy, coupled with our proposal to give States the option to eliminate the need for a request for TCC, should allow States to provide TCC to more families, while easing the administrative burden on them to provide that service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not proposing to require States to provide TCC in voluntary closure cases because we are unsure of the administrative and fiscal impacts on States. At the same time, we want our regulations to support families who take the initiative to get jobs and move off AFDC. Therefore, we are interested in receiving comments as to whether it would be more appropriate to allow or to require States to provide TCC in voluntary closure cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to revise the regulations concerning the State Supportive Services Plan at &sect;256.1(a)(6) to include information on whether the State elects to provide TCC to working families who voluntarily cease to receive AFDC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Requesting TCC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The existing regulations require States to provide information to families about their potential eligibility for TCC, the steps they need to take to request TCC services, and their rights and responsibilities under the program. States must provide this information during initial application for AFDC, during orientation to the JOBS program, at redetermination of eligibility for AFDC benefits and at termination of AFDC benefits. ACF issued an Action Transmittal (CC&hyph;ACF&hyph;AT&hyph;92&hyph;3), dated June 16, 1992, that reiterated the necessity for all families to be informed about TCC ``in writing, and orally as appropriate, at the time they become ineligible for AFDC.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing regulations also require that all families request TCC before services are provided. ACF did not regulate the nature of the request or application process. Rather we encouraged States to make the process simple, citing the example of a current recipient for whom the State might approve TCC through a recertification process if the necessary information was on file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have, however, heard concerns that the requirement for the family to request services may have discouraged some families from seeking TCC or caused disruption in child care arrangements. This requirement is especially frustrating for families when necessary information is already on file with the State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we propose at &sect;256.2(b)(3) to give States the option to provide TCC, without requiring a request, to eligible families. We believe that such a policy would be most applicable to families who were approved for child care services under part 255. For example, an AFDC recipient reports her newly-begun job to her AFDC case manager. At that time, the case manager determines that the family will remain eligible for AFDC until the time limitations on the income disregard at &sect;233.20(a)(11) cause the family to lose AFDC eligibility. Because the case manager recognizes that the family will be eligible for TCC in four months, if circumstances remain the same, she obtains the necessary information with which to determine eligibility and establish the level of the family's fee for TCC, if any. Continuing child care services in this instance would be possible because all the appropriate information is available to determine TCC eligibility, including fees, when the family loses eligibility for AFDC and transitions to TCC. Adopting this option can make the delivery of title IV&hyph;A child care services more seamless for the family. Additionally, the transition from child care services provided under part 255 to TCC services may well be ``transparent'' to the family if the State also adopts the proposed option to waive TCC fees for those families who are at or below the poverty level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid held  a  news conference, in which he stressed that the session was  eventful and beneficial. He said that there is Arab interest  and the highest level of coordination in making the Middle East  region free from weapons of mass destruction. He added that  there is a unified Arab concept on reassessing the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty during 1995.    He also said that the council decided to lift the boycott of  Liberian companies that were on the boycott list.    On the obstacles impeding Arab reconciliation, he said that  the issue is still under study and, despite the passage of one  year since this issue was raised, it still needs some time in  view of the consequences of the Gulf crisis.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that some Arab countries' demand to  amend the Arab League Charter does not mean closing the door on  his initiative to set up the Arab Court of Justice and achieve  Arab reconciliation.    On Jerusalem, he said that the Arab League has reiterated  its  firm stand on the Arabism of Jerusalem and the inalienable Arab  rights and that efforts are now being held at the highest levels  on current Arab issues, such as Somalia, Yemen, and the  Libyan-Western crisis. In this respect, he praised President  Husni Mubarak's efforts to attain a peace declaration between  the Somali factions.    On Arab water security, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab  foreign ministers discussed this issue carefully and decided to  have more studies on the protection of Arab waters.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A lacklustre session in stock index futures brought poor volume as dealers continued to await the outcome of last night's US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. The June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,124, up 18 from its previous close and at parity with the underlying cash market. Turnover, at 8,345 contracts, was one of the lowest in recent sessions. Earlier, June started trading at 3,110 and briefly slipped to 3,103 before recovering to trade around the 3,120 level for the next few hours. Dealers said the little activity there was consisted of sideways trading with light buying seen occasionally. The firm opening on Wall Street led to an advance in June during the afternoon and a peak of 3,130 was recorded in the last half-an-hour of trading before a bout of profit-taking just before the finish. Traded options remained buoyant and saw turnover of 30,174 contracts, of which 9,381 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,035 in the Euro FT-SE option. British Gas was the most actively traded stock option with a total of 2,745 contracts. Most of the trading was carried out in the June 280 calls. It was followed by Hanson, also busy in the cash market, with a total of 2,568 contracts.</p>

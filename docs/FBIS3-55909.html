			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Inart Skujins from Riga, including </F> recording of remarks by Colonel General L.S. Mayorov, commander  of Northwestern Group of Forces, and V. Birkavs, prime minister  of Latvia; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Yesterday Latvia and Russia were on the brink of a  military conflict. Rucs, head of the Vidzeme district of Riga,  undertook a provocative action. He decided to capture a few  facilities where for the time being the Russian army is  stationed. He ordered the deputy commander of the Northwestern  Group of Forces and the deputy commander for personnel work, who  had come to the talks, to be arrested and dispatched to the  Latvian-Russian border in handcuffs.    [Mayorov] Gentlemen, I believe that this action pursued  political aims, and the main aim which the Latvian nationalists  were pursuing was to disrupt the talks between Russian and  Latvia, talks which had been proceeding normally, and to disrupt  the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvian territory.    I must report to you that after these events -- and these  events had been building up from the morning onwards, gradually  -- on the order of the defense minister, combined units and  units of airborne troops, including the Pskov Airborne Division,  combined units and units of the military transport aviation, the  front aviation, and the navy and, of course, units of the  Northwestern Group of Forces were brought into combat readiness  for the liberation of our servicemen and captured facilities.  We were prepared to liberate our people and our facilities by  force.    I informed Latvia's President Mr. Ulmanis before midday. In  reply he requested -- well, first, he told me that he was taking  measures to resolve this conflict, that the organizer himself of  this action -- well, evidently this is the outside organizer,  behind him evidently there are other forces of nationalist  persuasion -- Mr. Rucs would be indicted, and the officers and  the facilities would be freed. He requested that no strong-arm  methods be undertaken. We acceded to this request.    [Birkavs, shown standing in office with Latvian coat of arms  on wall] First of all, I express regret in connection with what  happened, and on behalf of the government I apologize to those  concerned. The absolutely impermissible conduct of head of the  district council Mr. Rucs resulted in the Cabinet of Ministers  immediately relieving him of his post. Criminal proceedings  have been instituted. Now the police are looking for him in  order to bring him to book. The official reply of the Foreign  Ministry with apologies to Russia will be presented today.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Law of diminishing returns hits world fish catch - A crisis caused by over-exploitation of limited resources THE WORLD fish catch declined in 1992 for the third consecutive year and fisheries experts say that gross over-fishing is wrecking chances of increasing output. According to recent figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the 1992 catch was just under 97m tonnes compared with a record 100m tonnes in 1989. Until then the world fish catch had risen steadily, from little over 20m tonnes in the early 1950s. In both 1990 and 1991 the catch fell back from the 1989 peak. The overall figures hide the even steeper decline in fish caught at sea. In 1992, the marine catch totalled about 80m tonnes, down from about 86m tonnes in 1989. Catches from inland waters are continuing to grow, from 14m tonnes in 1989 to 17m tonnes last year. 'We are going through a crisis in world fishing,' says FAO fisheries specialist Mr Robin Welcomme. 'There are strains showing in the system.' All the major fish resources in the world are under stress and to some extent over-fished, he believes. The FAO says that fish has been harvested under the misconception that natural stocks are an unlimited natural resource, 'incapable of being affected by fishing pressure'. According to Mr Welcomme, the drop in sea catches is due to a large over-capacity in fisheries equipment around the world - 'This makes for over-fishing and means that fishing grounds are exploited long after they should be'. 'When people see others making money from fisheries, they invest in new fishing boats and equipment,' says Mr John Caddy, the chief of FAO's marine resources division. 'At first the increased investment leads to increased output, but now it is leading to a decline.' With the protection afforded by the 200-mile exclusive economic zones, agreed under the Law of the Sea treaty, many governments of developing grounds have invested heavily in deep sea fishing fleets. 'They assume that the more money they put in, the more they will get out, but that is not the way it works,' says Mr Caddy. By using 'vacuum cleaner' technology, large commercial trawlers have wrecked the inshore fishing grounds of some developing countries, and the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen. In an effort to increase their shrimp catch, fishermen in parts of South Asia are destroying the coastal mangrove forests, but as these are fish nurseries the catches soon tail off, often within two years. Fisheries experts believe that the only hope of raising the world's overall fish catch is for much better management of sea fishing and the FAO is supporting projects that help countries to manage their fisheries sectors. The northern Mediterranean, the Gulf of Thailand, the southern part of the North Sea and the seas of south-east Asia are the most overfished areas. 'The trouble is that countries that are supposed to know best, including the European Community, have done nothing to stop overfishing,' says one expert. China continues to be the world's largest fish producer with a rise in output in 1992, mostly reflecting higher inland catches.</p>

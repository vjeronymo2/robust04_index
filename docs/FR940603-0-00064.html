			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS is not considering broad-based whalewatching regulations at this time, but may consider minimum approach distances specific to northern right whales as part of the recovery planning process (see Response to Comment 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear may be rare from the perspective of total fishing activity and vessel traffic in the various areas. However, at least two right whales were struck and killed in the past 3 years. That means that about 2 percent (a much higher rate for calves) of the right whales known to occur in the area since late 1989 have been killed by a collision with a vessel. This percentage may underestimate the actual percentage struck during the period because many whales, including calves, have been seen with propeller scars. In the view of the commenter, this information demonstrates a significant risk from the perspective of right whales in this area, especially since the threat is concentrated on the reproductive core of the population and the calves, essential for population recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter recommended that NMFS expand the proposed critical habitat designation to include conservation measures that would reduce the likelihood of right whales being struck by vessels or becoming entangled in fishing gear. The commenter continued that the designation of critical habitat will serve as a warning to those who operate ships in these areas that steps must be taken to reduce the risk of collision with right whales. While finding the steps already taken by harbor pilots, ports authorities, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, ACOE and others to be encouraging, the commenter believed that more needs to be done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS recognizes that the loss of each northern right whale has a measurable impact on this population. The first priority of the Southeast Implementation Team was to develop a program to reduce or eliminate ship strikes throughout the whales' wintering area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) has restricted all commercial fishing in Gulf of Maine Groundfish Area I, which roughly covers the GSC, because of the importance of the area for haddock spawning from February 1 to May 31, since 1986. The haddock no longer spawn in that area, but NMFS and the NEFMC have recommended leaving the closure in place for all gillnet gear to protect the northern right whale, and other whale species that use that area in the spring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS will continue to focus recovery/management efforts on ways to reduce human-induced mortality as a result of ship strikes and entanglement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the continued availability of these areas for use by northern right whales is critical to the survival of the species. The commenter further stated that under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, Massachusetts has already designated the portion of CCB critical habitat that occurs in Massachusetts waters as ``Estimated Habitat'' for a State-listed wetland wildlife species. Estimated habitat, under the Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR), 310 CMR 10.37, is defined as the estimated geographical extent of the habitats of State-listed species for which an occurrence within the last 25 years has been accepted by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program and incorporated into its official database.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also stated that regulations have already been promulgated by Massachusetts law to prohibit vessels from approaching within 500m of a right whale in State waters. Fishery measures that reduce the risk of entanglements of marine mammals with fixed gear such as lobster gear and gillnets have also been adopted in Massachusetts. There are moratoria on gillnet and lobster licenses, a limit on the number of lobster pots per fisherman and limits on the length of lobster pot trawls and gillnets. Further restrictions on gillnets, some to complement what the NEFMC is considering to reduce by-catch of harbor porpoise,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phocoena phocoena <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , are being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter believed, however, that a designation of critical habitat at the Federal level would extend comprehensive, interjurisdictional protection to the right whale, a correct approach to conserving the species. The commenter further stated that since, the proposed rule said ``fishing practices and locations may require special management considerations when the timing of the fishing season and the presence of the northern right whale overlap,'' NMFS should work closely with Massachusetts and the NEFMC to assess the need for, and nature of, special management considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NMFS recognizes and appreciates the efforts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to protect the northern right whale. NMFS is establishing a Northeast Implementation Team for the Recovery Plan (see Response to Comment 5). It is the intent of NMFS to work closely with these teams to determine for, and effectiveness of, special management measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One Federal agency supported the proposed critical habitat designation for the northern right whale, but was concerned that NMFS would be the Federal agency listed as having management responsibilities within the boundaries of Cape Cod National Seashore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Designation of critical habitat does not create management responsibilities for NMFS, nor does it give NMFS primary jurisdiction over Federal lands included in the critical habitat designation. While a Federal agency may undertake an activity that may affect either the listed species or critical habitat, and may be required to consult with NMFS pursuant to section 7, it is the action agency that decides whether to initiate consultation. Likewise, the action agency determines whether and in what manner to proceed with the action in light of its section 7 obligations and NMFS' biological opinion (See 50 CFR 402.15). NMFS' role is advisory in nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, while NMFS has responsibility over this listed species, the National Park Service (NPS) at Cape Cod National Seashore has major responsibilities for the long-term preservation of Cape Cod's natural resources, including this federally listed endangered species. As such, the NPS at Cape Cod National Seashore has management responsibilities within the proposed area of critical habitat that overlaps with the legislative boundary of the Cape Cod National Seashore. NMFS believes that the NPS and NMFS can work together on issues pertaining to the northern right whale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 9: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that two of the proposed critical habitat areas violate the prohibition on habitat designation outside the jurisdiction of the United States. The proposed critical habitat designation in the GSC and portions of the SEUS exceed the 12 nautical mile territorial sea recognized by the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

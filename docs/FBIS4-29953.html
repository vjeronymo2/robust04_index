			<p>BFN     [Text] The Economic Planning Agency [EPA] is to analyze the  effects of deregulation on the economy. It will examine how  deregulation measures -- such as reviewing the Large-Scale  Retail Stores Law, liberalizing the information and  communications sector, and easing rules on housing construction  -- will contribute to economic growth and how these will affect  consumer prices. By demonstrating deregulation's effectiveness  with specific figures, the agency aims to provide a basis for  promoting deregulation. It plans to inaugurate a research group  composed of intellectuals as early as next week so that it will  be able to compile the results of its assessment during July.    Private sector think tanks have conducted many surveys on  the  scale of the market and the possibility of market expansion when  deregulation is promoted in each industry. Meanwhile, it is  rare for the government to study comprehensively the effects of  deregulation on the economy.    The government plans to compile external economic measures  at  the end of June which would include deregulation measures and  macroeconomic policies. The EPA intends to examine whether the  deregulation measures to be included in the external economic  measures will be effective in causing economic growth. Its  assessment is expected to center on the housing, information,  and distribution sectors. The agency aims to provide specific  figures on how much consumer prices will be lowered through a  review of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, and on how  effective the liberalization of the information and  communications industry will be in improving the employment  situation and attaining economic growth.    The EPA thinks that if companies' productivity and  international competitiveness are enhanced through deregulation,  "the Japanese economy's latent power for growth will be  strengthened." In order to promote deregulation as early as  possible, the agency plans to compile the results of its  assessment in about a month, after the research group decides on  the items to subject to analysis.</p>

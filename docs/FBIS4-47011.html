Grigoryev: "The Central Bank Will Be Selling </F> Curerency Only at the Exchanges"    [Text]  <H5>  No institutional changes anticipated on the currency market </H5>   As reported by the Interfax agency, with reference to Igor  Knyazev, deputy director of the Department of Currency  Operations of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, in the  immediate future the Central Bank "does not intend changing the  tactics of regulating the ruble exchange rate and plans to carry  out secret intervention through networks of authorized banks."  According to Mr. Knyazev in May the Central Bank had already  completed several direct transactions in the sale of foreign  currency to commercial banks. That is, the Central Bank carried  out currency transactions, bypassing all of the Russian  exchanges, on the basis of a bilateral agreement with commercial  banks.    In general, the start of operations by the Central Bank in  the sector outside the exchanges evidences recognition by it of  serious changes in the institutional structure of the entire  currency market. In principle the concentration of the largest  share of currency transactions on one (or several) exchange  floors is characteristic of an insufficiently developed and a  highly centralized financial system dominated by vertical ties.  That was exactly the situation in Russia in the past (and still  is for the most part). Therefore the conduct of currency  conversion operations, ceasing to be the prerogative of state  banks, because of necessity needed an organizationally  formulated mechanism. The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange,  organized by the Central Bank and commercial banks became such a  mechanism (by the end of 1993 its turnover exceeded 80 percent  of the total Russian market) along with five more regional  currency exchanges established later.    Until recently the development of the financial  infrastructure was reflected in quantitative parameters--a  decrease in the cost of business on a consignment basis, evening  out of cash and non-cash exchange rates. In March of this year  the currency market in the capital was subjected to a peculiar  fiscal racket by the Moscow government. One year ago a rise in  the cost of conversion operations by 0.1 percent would have been  received by the banks, even if without pleasure, at least  without serious reciprocal measures. At present, however, all of  the main participants of trading on the exchange shifted to  direct interbank transactions, limiting their activity at the  exchange to mandatory sale of proceeds of their clients from  exports. The volume of transactions in the dollar section of the  MMVB [Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange] decreased by one half.    The slow, smooth, and predictable change in the ruble rate  promoted the withdrawal of many banks from the exchange. The  point is that during periods marked by a swift drop of the ruble  the Central Bank appeared as the only seller of currency, which  meant that it was possible to purchase it under "run from the  ruble" conditions only on the exchange. At present, however, the  market is not experiencing a need for large-scale currency  intervention by the Central Bank. Moreover, periodically the  rate in transactions outside of the exchange proved to be below  the MMVB rate. By the way, it is highly likely that the steady  increase of initial demand over supply on the exchange in the  course of May is the consequence of skillful manipulation with  bids by the Central Bank. After all correspondence of the  dynamics of the exchange rate to the inflation rate is a  strategic task of the Central Bank and for its achievement the  Central Bank may consciously and systematically lower the rate  through intervention on the exchange.    In that manner the Central Bank suddenly encountered an  important tendency--the shifting of the center of currency  operations to the interbank market outside the exchange. This  presupposes two important conclusions: the result of exchange  trading, remaining adequately representative, no longer fully  reflects the market correlation of the ruble and the dollar,  which means that the mechanism allowing the Central Bank to  regulate it grows weaker. That line of reasoning explains the  announcement by Mr. Knyazev to the effect that the Central Bank  intends to initiate active operations on the interbank market.    Naturally, in order to realize that idea it will be  necessary  to form a limited circle of authorized banks. There are two  possible variants of interaction between the Central Bank and  commercial banks. The bureaucratic selection of candidates on  the basis of subjective criteria (which is indirectly evidenced  by the term "authorized banks" itself) creates a rigid structure  in which commercial banks will be given the role of agents, or  more precisely, brokers of the Central Bank fulfilling its  instructions. In this case the Central Bank will retain a  monopolistic position on the currency market. If financial  indices should become a condition for inclusion in this list  then in essence a market of large operators will form with the  Central Bank becoming their dealing center. At the same time the  Central Bank and commercial banks will become almost equal  partners, while rates in transactions will reflect the state of  the national currency in the most objective manner possible.    Today, however, neither variant is being studied by the  leadership of the Central Bank. As reported by Aleksandr  Potemkin, director of the Main Currency Administration of the  Central Bank, his agency does not see the need for any changes  in the mechanism of the currency market. All currency  interventions by the Central Bank are carried out and will  continue to be carried out through the currency exchanges. As  far as bilateral transactions with commercial banks are  concerned, the Central Bank only purchases currency, and only  the export proceeds subject to mandatory sale. The thing is that  with its sufficiently large volumes it is sometimes difficult  for the banks to fulfill client instructions by deadlines  stipulated by legislation. In such a case the Central Bank helps  with the fulfillment of its own instructions at the same time  guarding the exchange from a sharp surplus of currency and  sudden changes in the exchange rate. (According to Mr. Potemkin,  the volume of transactions was not less than $15 million and the  exchange rate could have been even worse than the market rate.)    With the current inflation and level of monopolization of  the  banking system, according to Alkesandr Potemkin, it appears to  be impossible to organize a liquid interbank market. If the  system of currency exchanges provides access to the currency  being sold by the Central Bank for almost 300 banks, whereas on  the market outside of the exchange the Central Bank will be able  to interact with 20-30 banks. That is why with continuation of a  sufficiently high rate of inflation transition to a direct  interbank currency market is premature. Any sharp change in the  financial situation will lead to a drop in its liquidity and  even to the curtailment of transactions. Banks which have access  to currency will begin holding on to funds purchased from the  Central Bank disturbing the market with speculative games.  Intervention by the Central Bank through authorized banks will  in that manner be transformed into an administrative  distribution of currency resources.</p>

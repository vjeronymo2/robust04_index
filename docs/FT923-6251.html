			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Currency factors were still the main influence on BASE METAL trading on the LME. However there were signs that the cheapness of the metals in European and Far East local currency terms (because of the dollar's weakness) was attracting some consumer interest. This underpinned most of the metals when they staged an opening dip and saw them gradually advance over the day, although copper fell back in the last few minutes of trading. The rises triggered dealer short covering and some speculative interest although investors were still wary of any sudden currency fluctuation. Three-month TIN maintained its midday break through previous resistance above Dollars 6,850 a tonne, at one stage reaching Dollars 6,915. GOLD encountered resistance in the Dollars 342 area as the dollar slid on news that a French opinion poll on Maastricht showed the No vote at 51 per cent and the Yes at 49 per cent. Dealers said gold would have to push though Dollars 342.80 a troy ounce in order to trigger short covering by US funds. There was some concern that the Australian central bank might fail to defend its currency, triggering forward gold sales by local mines attempting to lock in higher prices. Compiled from Reuters</p>

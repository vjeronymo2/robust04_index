			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (5): Keeping it almost in the family - Investment trusts / The open markets offers a tax-efficient route Family trusts are usually very private things, handled discreetly by the old family solicitor and stockbroker. But a handful of wealthy families have taken the unusual step of using investment trusts, listed on the London stock exchange, as vehicles for their personal investment portfolios. The option is only open to seriously rich investors, but it does carry tax advantages. Three of the very small number of trusts run along these lines are managed by partners in the same firm - Cazenove &amp; Co. The trusts involved are Updown, Capital Gearing, and the tiny Hotspur. Anyone is free to buy shares in the trusts on the open market, but they all have a core of long-term investors belonging to the different families and their associates, who are represented on the board, and can influence the investment policy. Updown is connected to the Wills family, of tobacco fame; Hotspur is the family trust for the Duke of Northumberland; and Capital Gearing has always had ties with the Harding family of Northern Ireland. Similarly, the Finsbury Trust, managed by Finsbury Asset Management, is still half owned by the family of the late Sir Walter Salomon, the founder of the trust. Harry Henderson, the Cazenove partner who manages Updown and Hotspur, believes that other families could benefit from using a similar structure. The main advantage of using an investment trust is that investments can be bought and sold within the trust without incurring capital gains tax. This makes it ideal for families with substantial portfolios dedicated to investment for long-term growth, who do not want the managers to be restricted in their investment decisions by tax considerations. Of course, capital gains tax may be due when shares in the trust are eventually sold or the trust is wound up. Having an investment trust to call your own also means that its portfolio can be tailored to meet your precise needs - income or growth, low or high risk, or any particular enthusiasms. Managers benefit from having a body of loyal shareholders who will stick through the bad years as well as the good. The easiest way to create a 'family' investment trust is to acquire an existing trust, rather than start from scratch. The would-be owners and their advisers look for a suitably sized trust nearing the end of its scheduled life, or which has run into difficulties with a very wide discount. They then make a bid for the trust. Once the new owners are in control, they can restructure the trust as necessary and dispose of the existing portfolio to meet the new requirements. For example, Cazenove bought into an existing trust called Updown, on behalf of the Wills family in 1978, after liquidating the previous family investment trust - Malton - largely for tax reasons. Hotspur was formed from the British Kidney Patients trust, which had been due to be wound up in 1990. Naturally, there are some drawbacks to using the investment-trust route. The set-up costs can be quite high, because of legal and professional fees incurred in selecting, acquiring and restructuring a suitable existing trust, as well as the actual cost of buying it. You need to make a long-term commitment to the trust for it to be worthwhile. And it is only practicable if your family has a few million to invest: the smaller an investment trust is, the more burdensome the fixed administration costs become. Hotspur, at less than Pounds 3m, is one of the very smallest trusts around. Also, an investment trust cannot be a purely family affair - by law they cannot be 'close companies', defined as companies where less than 35 per cent of the voting shares are held by the general public. In the case of the three Cazenove trusts, about half of each trust's shares are held by family members and directors, with the rest held by the public. The charm of family investment trusts is that they can reflect not only their beneficiaries' investment needs, but also their character. Take Hotspur, for instance. The name means 'reckless and rash' - not a reference to the trust's investment strategy, but to an ancestor of the Northumberland family. The trust was named after the son of the first Earl of Northumberland, Sir Henry Percy, who appeared in two Shakespeare plays under his nickname Harry Hotspur. Capital Gearing's name, on the other hand, reflects its investment policy: buying shares principally in split-capital investment trusts with the aim of maximising capital growth. The fund was launched by Major GWC Harding, a member of the family it still benefits, when he was working at stockbrokers Sir RW Carden, later taken over by Capel Cure Myers. Major Harding still sits on the board, together with another Harding family member. Capital Gearing is a small trust - it has assets of about Pounds 13m - and its shares are very tightly held. Its record has shown the perils of buying into a small, illiquid trust: when only small numbers of shares can be bought in the open market, even tiny fluctuations in demand can have a serious impact on the share price. A few years ago, Capital Gearing's performance put it at the top of the comparative tables, so demand for the shares rocketed. The share price was driven to a crazy premium to net asset value - a premium of more than 90 per cent at one stage. Typically, investment trusts trade at a discount to net assets of about 10 per cent, or a premium of a few points for the most successful funds. Not surprisingly, the anomaly in Capital Gearing's share price was soon eliminated, and the share price came back down to earth. Therefore, in share price terms, the fund's performance over certain recent periods has not been impressive, but the underlying assets have been growing at a steady rate. Long-term shareholders will have been unaffected by the market antics, but anyone who bought at a large premium will have suffered. However, the trust's board has announced its intention of providing outside shareholders with an exit opportunity at about asset value in 1998.</p>

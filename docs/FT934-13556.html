			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / People: Lamb leaves RAM Richard Lamb, a Latin American fund manager at Rothschild Asset Management, is joining the flood of emerging market new recruits heading for Morgan Grenfell. However, Lamb, 36, is joining the fund management side of the business rather than the brokerage operations. He will head a team of three covering Latin America's emerging stock markets. Morgan Grenfell Asset Management Ltd has about 100 fund managers worldwide with about Pounds 37bn of money under management, out of which about Dollars 1bn is in the emerging markets including about Dollars 200-300m in Latin American equities. At RAM, Lamb was responsible for managing its Chile Fund and Five Arrows Fund. MGAML says it is keen to strengthen its Latin American investment team, and is also hoping to raise its profile in Latin America by managing funds for local institutions and other investors. Morgan Grenfell's Debt Arbitrage and Trading operations recently lured about 20 emerging markets equity traders, analysts and sales staff from James Capel because it intends to complement its existing debt trading operations by expanding in the emerging equity markets business.</p>

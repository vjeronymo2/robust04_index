The stock was the biggest percentage gainer on the  over-the-counter market Tuesday.  </P> <P> Right behind was Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a Newport Beach  firm whose stock price jumped 28.9% after it was disclosed that the New England  Journal of Medicine will publish a favorable report Thursday on the company's  experimental AIDS drug, isoprinosine. The company's stock was the  second-largest percentage gainer Tuesday among over-the-counter issues.  </P> <P> On the New York Stock Exchange, MAI Basic Four, a Tustin computer company, rose  37.5 cents per share -- or 21% -- to close at $2.125, making it the biggest  percentage gainer on the Big Board.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As I already announced in advance, at the beginning  of the top-level meeting between the national government and  provincial governors being held in Chapadmalal, the Catamarca  governor and the president of the Republic signed the fiscal  pact. Now only Neuquen, Rio Negro, and Cordoba Provinces have  not signed the pact yet, although it is believed that the  forthcoming days or hours will be decisive for them to also join  the fiscal pact.    The pact was signed by President Carlos Menem; the Economy  and Public Works and Services Minister, Domingo Felipe Cavallo;  Interior Minister Carlos Federico Ruckauf -- all of them  representing the national government; and Catamarca Province  Governor Arnoldo Anibal Castillo.    The document says that the national government is pleased  with the decision of Catamarca Province to join the fiscal pact  for employment, production, and growth as evidence of the will  to adopt harmonious policies to achieve the common goal for  national economic growth and the reactivation of the regional  economies. These are the main subjects being discussed at the  top-level meeting here in Chapadmalal. We will continue  reporting from Mar del Plata concerning this important meeting  between governors and the national cabinet that obviously is  being headed by President Carlos Menem.</p>

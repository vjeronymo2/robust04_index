			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, June 14 (AFP) -- Lebanon on Tuesday  dismissed a claim attributed to a Palestinian activist that he  had placed the bomb which exploded on a US airliner over  Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.    Yusuf Sha'ban "never said that he had placed the bomb in the  Pan Am plane" that killed 270 people, state prosecutor Munif  'Uwaydat told AFP.    "But he said that under torture he was ready to confess to  anything, even the Lockerbie bombing, if asked to," 'Uwaydat  said, noting Sha'ban's comments were not logged in court records  because they were not connected to his trial.    The state prosecutor charged that statements attributed to  Sha'ban on Monday were "deformed on purpose to embarrass  (Lebanese) justice," and he ruled out any investigation into the  claim.    Sha'ban, according to the state-run news agency ANI, told a  court here that he was responsible for bombing the plane.    The 29-year-old member of Abu-Nidal's hardline Fatah  Revolutionary Council (FRC) was being heard in the murder trial  of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran al-Ma'ayitah who was shot  dead outside his Beirut home in January.    Sha'ban faces a possible death penalty.    The United States said it had no evidence to corroborate  Sha'ban's claim and reiterated its demand for the extradition of  two Libyans who have been indicted in both Britain and the  United States for the attack.    Barbara Bodine, the State Department coordinator on  counter-terrorism, said that Sha'ban "was not a suspect."    "We feel very strong evidence against the two indicted  Libyans, but we are serious in following up this lead to see if  there is any veracity in it at all," Bodine said.    London and Washington have for three years been trying to  force court appearances of 'Abd-Basit al-Mijrahi and Al-Amin  Khalifah Fahimah, who are charged in the bombing.    Britain also renewed its demand that the two Libyans be  brought before a Scottish or a US court to answer the charges.    Al-Mijrahi and Fahimah's Libyan lawyer, meanwhile, sent a  letter to the Lebanese judicial authorities urging them to  further interrogate Sha'ban on the Lockerbie bombing.    Ibrahim Legwell asked that lawyers defending the Libyan  suspects be allowed to take part in any investigation, according  to a copy of the letter received by AFP in Tripoli.    Libya has been under UN sanctions since April 1992 because  of  its refusal to hand over the two suspects. The sanctions cut  international air links and arms sales, and limited diplomatic  ties with Libya.</p>

The U.S.  official defined these five states as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba,  and North Korea.    In a commentary on this, the JANA local affairs editor said:  It seems that these five states, which the U.S. official  described as rebels, are the independent states which have not  made their independence subject to the will of the West. What  should occur is the complete elimination of all weapons of  destruction from all states. If these weapons are harmful to  humanity, as is the case, humanity must be saved from them.  This must be applied to all states, and not by pursuing a  policy of double standards.    It would be more appropriate for those who make such  statements and calls to get rid of their nuclear weapons and the  Israeli nuclear arsenal, which they do not only disregard but  even reinforce by supporting and developing it, because if these  states which give the appearance of being keen on world peace  and security did not possess weapons of mass destruction, the  others would never have thought of possessing these weapons.    Libya is a peaceable state which does not possess such  weapons, nor does it have the capacity to possess them. It has  never considered doing so. The International Atomic Energy  Agency has attested to this and commended Libya for it.    The continued accusations against Libya by western officials  are a form of terrorism and blackmail.</p>

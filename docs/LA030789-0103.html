			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS WILLING TO CUT PRODUCTION IN EFFORT TO BOOST WORLD OIL PRICES  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is prepared to cut its oil production for at least six months  in cooperation with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in an  effort to raise world oil prices, Soviet officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Officials announced a 5% cutback in Soviet oil sold on the open market or  delivered to Western customers on contract and said it would amount to 100,000  barrels a day over the next six months.  </P> <P> Western observers said it was the first time the Soviets -- the world's biggest  oil producer -- have publicly announced steps to bolster OPEC. But they said it  wouldn't have a dramatic effect on oil markets and noted that Soviet production  might have fallen anyway.  </P> <P> The Soviets, which have long supported the goals of OPEC to boost and stabilize  oil prices, join China, Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia, Oman and other non-OPEC oil  exporting nations which have recently announced steps intended to bolster  prices.  </P> <P> Vasily A. Dinkov, the Soviet oil minister, said at a news conference that  Moscow viewed a price of about $20 a barrel as high enough to make production  viable. World prices currently range from about $16 to $19 a barrel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Further Efforts Possible  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, analysts credited the Soviet announcement  for sending the April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.  crude, up a modest 11 cents to $18.67 a barrel. OPEC crude oils typically sell  for $1.50 a barrel less. The cartel's official goal is to reach an average  price of $18 a barrel.  </P> <P> Moscow is clearly hoping that the consolidated action by OPEC and non-OPEC  members will eventually push oil prices back up and that it will be able to  recover initial losses through subsequent price rises.  </P> <P> Grant Margulov, the first deputy chairman of the Bureau on the Fuel and Energy  Industries, said the cutback symbolized Moscow's desire to cooperate with OPEC  pricing and supply policy and that further joint actions were possible.  </P> <P> "The Soviet Union shares in the efforts made by other states in maintaining  closer cooperation with OPEC countries to achieve stable oil prices acceptable  to both importer and exporter," Margulov said, putting the 5% reduction in the  context of Moscow's participation as an observer at recent OPEC conferences.  </P> <P> "We are prepared to cooperate closely with OPEC countries and take possible  joint actions if necessary," he said. "As for cutting back our exports, the  decision we have taken is for the first half of the year, and the future will  show if we will maintain this form of cooperation. This question is being  considered at the moment."  </P> <P> However, the Soviet Union's mature oil fields and weak technology have made it  difficult to prevent declines in oil production anyway, analysts say.  </P> <P> "We put the Soviet announcement in the same category as some of the other  announcements by non-OPEC countries," said Thomas Burns, manager of the  economic staff at Chevron Corp. in San Francisco, one of the leading oil giants  in the race to do business in the Soviet Union. "It is nice to show support for  OPEC, but it is not going to be terribly significant."  </P> <P> Analysts generally agree that there is less to some of the non-OPEC pledges  than meets the eye. Production cuts by Mexico, Egypt and some other nations are  less policy decisions than examples of bowing to the inevitable, one observer  said.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's oil totaled about 12 million barrels a day last year --  roughly 45% more than that of the United States and three times that of Saudi  Arabia -- but it uses more than two thirds of that petroleum itself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue Problems  </P> <P> More than half of the Soviet exports of oil and oil products in 1987 went to  Moscow's partners in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the socialist  trading bloc known as Comecon, and to other close allies. Soviet officials said  the cutbacks will not affect sales to the East Bloc.  </P> <P> Finland, France, Italy, Spain and West Germany also bought substantial amounts  of Soviet oil, according to Soviet trade figures for the year, the last for  which complete statistics are available.  </P> <P> Moscow, in fact, relies heavily on its oil and gas exports to finance its  imports of Western machinery, and a 5% cutback represents a further reduction  of hard currency revenue. Together, oil and gas constitute nearly 35% of Soviet  exports by value -- and about 60% of its hard currency earnings.  </P> <P> Declining prices for oil and gas on the international market resulted in $64  billion in lost export revenue for the country over the past three years,  according to Finance Ministry officials. This has been an important factor in  the growing budget deficit, which is emerging as a major economic problem here.  </P> <P> Time staff writer Donald Woutat, in Los Angeles, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

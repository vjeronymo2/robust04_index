While he refrained from stating the specific inflation rate  for January in an interview with a reporter yesterday, an  authoritative official at the department concerned in the  Guangzhou City government said: "It is certainly a little  higher than last January's 19 percent." The precise figure is  not known until it is released by the relevant government  department, he said.    The official said that the Guangzhou market was relatively  stable in the Spring Festival period.    But this official is concerned about preset price increases  in Guangzhou. He said that pork recently went up by 23 or 24 or  even 30 yuan per jin from an original price of less than 20,  adding that such unreasonable rises are unacceptable to citizens.    The government's new task is to exercise effective price  controls while freeing prices, he continued. [sentence as  received]    Guangzhou's inflation rate in 1993 was as high as 25.1  percent, ranking third among other areas across the country.    Guangzhou Deputy Mayor Chen Kaizhi stressed here two days  ago  that Guangzhou's inflation rate must be kept below 15 percent  this year.</p>

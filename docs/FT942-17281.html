			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Wandsworth plans to bypass boycott of school tests Wandsworth, the Conservatives' 'flagship' borough in south London, yesterday unveiled a plan to carry out national curriculum tests in schools this summer in spite of the boycott by the largest teachers' union. Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth, intends to send supply teachers and inspectors into the borough's three secondary and 65 primary schools to carry out the tests. He said: 'We are determined that the tests will go ahead. We will send in special teams to make sure that they do.' Teachers' unions have objected that the tests - compulsory for all children aged seven and 14 in England and Wales and voluntary for 11-year-olds - would create an excessive workload. Wandsworth says external markers would address this issue. The external markers would be drawn mainly from teachers who have retired, been made redundant or who have taken a career break. Delegates at the NUT union's annual conference in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, reacted angrily to the move, which was thought to pave the way for a wider government initiative to introduce external marking in England and Wales. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, described Wandsworth as 'the government's favourite poodle', and said the action would not deter members. Wandsworth made a similar offer to its secondary schools last year, but the head teachers refused to allow extra teachers in their schools. The council unsuccessfully challenged the teacher boycott in the courts last year, but seems unlikely to do so this year. Ms Julia Alterman, a Wandsworth NUT delegate, said the council's money would be better spent on maintaining teachers for the borough's 'ethnic-minority children'. She said: 'It's a very sad state of affairs. It will create more disruption because we will be asking parents not to send their children to school on the days of the tests. Of course we would far rather have them in the school.' At the conference Mr McAvoy and the moderate wing of the union defeated two leftwing motions to amend the union's strict rule that a two-thirds majority of all members is needed for strike action and for a national strike against job losses. In his closing address Mr McAvoy said the tests meant the '11-plus exam' and selective schools would return. Government policy was to 'provide privilege to the few by denying to the many, by whatever name they use for that selection'. Ms Margaret Morrissey, co-ordinator of the National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations, which last year opposed the tests, said school governors should take ultimate responsibility for deciding whether the tests went ahead in individual schools.</p>

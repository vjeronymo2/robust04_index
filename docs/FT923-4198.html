			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sour response to milk co-op plan - A row over plans to reform the UK dairy market MR ANDREW DARE, after just one week as chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board, found his own words used against him in a blistering attack by the Dairy Trade Federation on plans to end the 60-year-old statutory milk marketing monopoly. Mr Brian Smith, president of the DTF, said he could not understand how a government that believed in a free market could be in favour of the MMB's proposal to turn itself into a voluntary co-operative. And he quoted Mr Dare, himself a former president of the DTF, as saying three years ago: 'We are not prepared to see the MMB try to make itself voluntary'. Mr Smith said: 'Now he is the architect of the MMB proposals.' However, he said the DTF's main argument was with the government and the agriculture ministry, not the MMB itself. The MMB's proposals were published only at the beginning of last month after more than two years of intense debate. The Ministry of Agriculture has given interested parties until September 18 to comment on the plan, which will also have to be approved by the European Commission. A Bill to end the monopoly is expected to come before parliament this autumn and be given the Royal Assent next June. However, the Dairy Trade Federation has whole-heartedly backed only one part of the plan - the proposed spin-off of Dairy Crest, the MMB's wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's manufactured dairy products market. The DTF welcomed the fact that farmers should be free to sell milk to anyone they chose once the MMB was closed - but Mr Smith doubted that the market would be genuinely free. He pointed out that the proposed legislation would create a single co-operative handling more than three times the milk of the largest co-operatives in Europe. Mr Smith criticised plans for the co-operative to retain its assets, such as central testing of milk. The assets were a disguised incentive to persuade farmers to join. He pointed out, again citing Mr Dare when he was DTF president, that the rules of supply and demand were different for milk because there was a monopoly supplier and the UK was under the EC's production quota system. Mr Smith said that while supply could not be increased, prices could only rise. In addition, Mr Smith pointed out that the MMB was subject to all sorts of statutory controls. 'What is to control the co-operative?' he asked. The DTF proposed that all MMB assets, including property, should be realised and returned to farmers along with their share of Dairy Crest. The MMB's farm services should be transferred to an independent body such as the Agricultural Development Advisory Service (Adas). 'The current proposals from the MMB tend towards replacing a statutory monopoly with a private one,' said Mr Smith. 'If the government is unwilling to intervene to stop this, the DTF believes that the government must act to establish simple but effective regulatory controls over prices, supply and contract terms in order to prevent the co-op from abusing its dominant position in the market.' Mr Dare yesterday counter-attacked, saying that he stood by everything he had said as president of the DTF. When he was president of the DTF he had made lots of criticisms of the board. 'I can tell you I made those same criticisms in the boardroom,' he said. The situation had changed completely, and the DTF had been 'less than fully appreciative of what we have said'. The proposed co-operative, which he believed about 80 per cent of the 30,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales would join, would have to stand or fall in a free market, he said. 'There is nothing to stop anyone else setting up a co-operative - regional or otherwise.' Since he had started advising the MMB in November last year, he had urged it to become much more open and commercial, and it now met most of the DTF's original requirements. Dairy Crest would be floated off, farmers would not be under contract for more than a year, and anyone could set up in competition against the new co-op. He described the DTF demand for the MMB's testing service to be hived off as bizarre. 'Whoever heard of a co-operative buying and selling milk without testing facilities? We have the best quality milk in Europe and that's got to stay.' Defending the potential size of the co-operative, he said that on the consumer side there were now only four major dairy groups, he said - Northern Foods, Dairy Crest, Unigate and the Co-operative Retail Services. Annual turnover of the MMB without Dairy Crest would be about Pounds 2.4bn if all dairy farmers joined - about the same size as Unigate, he said. The plans to end the milk monopoly are not the only source of friction between the MMB and the DTF at the moment. Late last month the two organisations failed to agree on a new way of pricing milk for manufacturing which should have started on September 1 - the day Mr Dare took up the reins as MMB chief executive.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STAMP ART: Reproductions of the painting on the annual federal duck-hunting  stamp are said to net $1 million or more for the artist (E1).  </P> <P> But that doesn't hold true for the scores of state hunting stamps, according to  Dave Chapple of Irvine, onetime Rams punter whose paintings are on six state  stamps. "You have to give them the painting free, and some states make you  publish the stamps too, and that's around $15,000," Chapple says. "If you've  got time to . . . promote your pictures, you can do OK. I'd rather just sell  the original." Lanie Jones and Bob Schwartz  </P></p>

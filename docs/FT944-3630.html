			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Tapie quits football club Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing French politician and businessman who is fighting bankruptcy, yesterday resigned as president of Olympique Marseille football club and said he would sell his majority holding in the club. Mr Tapie, who was banned from running the club by French football authorities following the alleged rigging of a league match against Valenciennes last year, said he would be giving up all his shares in the club next week. Mr Tapie at present heads the company owning two-thirds of the club, which won five consecutive French championships and was the first French team to win the European cup. Marseille were relegated to the second division last season because of the rigging scandal and bankruptcy. Mr Pierre Cangioni, a former television anchorman, will take over as president.</p>

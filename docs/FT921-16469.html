			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa warns of need to cut costs rapidly MR JUERGEN WEBER, the chief executive of Lufthansa, warned employees yesterday that the German airline would have to bring its costs down rapidly to avoid 'bitter consequences' from the competition. 'Lufthansa operates too expensively, expenditure is above income,' he said. He added that the airline also had some catching up to do in the area of service. 'Our customer service systems are by no means 'state of the art'.' The airline has already said that it would make an operating loss in 1991 as a result of poor business in the first quarter when the industry was hit by the Gulf war. Subsequent profits were not enough to offset the loss in the first three months, so that the nine months result showed a pre-tax loss of DM159m (Dollars 99m). Lufthansa will offset last year's loss through aircraft sales and transfers from reserves. Mr Weber said it was small comfort that 1991 was a bad year for all airlines and that Lufthansa had done better than most of its European competition. 'Our reserves are not meant to be used as a comfortable cushion; they will be quickly used up,' he said. The airline, which is 52 per cent state-owned, has been bringing in new productivity measures such as improved communications and data processing systems. It is also streamlining its management structure. Among steps taken to upgrade services was the introduction of an automatic ticketing system at Frankfurt last year.</p>

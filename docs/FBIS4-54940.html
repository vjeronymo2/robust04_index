			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats -- Fidesz] has been misunderstood; he does not want to  resign. Katalin Horvath reports:    [Horvath] The country does not want what the Fidesz wants.  Probably we could not explain well enough and could not convince  people of the ideas of the Fidesz. This was the cause of our  poor performance, said Fidesz Chairman Viktor Orban.    As a matter of fact, the Hungarian election result resembles  a Polish scenario. It means that the government party could not  cope with the economy and people cast their votes for the party  which ruled before 1990. The Fidesz has been working for one  and a half years to prevent this -- unfortunately, without  success.    The Fidesz will continue to be in opposition. If necessary,  in the second round, Fidesz candidates will step back in favor  of the Alliance of Free Democrats. By doing so at least the  Hungarian Socialist Party's advantage can be reduced even though  it cannot be changed, Viktor Orban said.    Speaking about his chairmanship, he merely said that his  statement of last night had been misunderstood. He is not even  thinking of resigning. The party congress will decide on his  chairmanship.</p>

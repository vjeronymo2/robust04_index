			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: VW scuppers DM1.4bn Skoda deal VOLKSWAGEN yesterday cancelled a complex DM1.4bn (Dollars 879m) investment financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, hours before the deal was due to be signed in London today. The move, which threatens to bring VW into conflict with the international banking community and worsen already-strained relations with the government of the Czech Republic, highlighted the intensity of the scramble to cut costs at the beleaguered automotive group. The package, negotiated with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and a private banking consortium led by Dresdner Bank, was no longer needed, VW said. The participating banks, stunned by the news, offered no comment, but were hoping for a full explanation over dinner at the Mirabelle restaurant in London last night, arranged by Dresdner Bank and intended to celebrate the signing. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, was understood to be attending. He is believed to have telephoned Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, yesterday to assure him that VW's commitment to Skoda remained unaltered. It was not clear if the VW supervisory board, which must usually be consulted on important investment decisions, had been informed. 'It was an honest step, even though it was taken at short notice,' said Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs, a group spokesman. The company could have signed and then cancelled it, he added. He credited Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's controversial new production director, with improvements to manufacturing processes which had helped make the loan unnecessary. 'This is a positive move which will improve profitability both at Skoda and group level,' Mr Wachs added. Interim results of an investment review, due to be considered by the company's supervisory board in November, showed that productivity improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be 'considerably lower' than thought, the company said in a statement. Under current plans VW was expecting to spend a total of DM7bn at Skoda this decade, it added. It is understood that only around DM500m has been paid out this year. The planned total has been cut to around DM4bn. Volkswagen is already embroiled in a row with the Prague government which blew up last month when it announced an 8 per cent increase in Skoda prices in the Czech market and suggested it might import component supplies because of rising local costs. The prices of some Skoda models in the Czech republic are now around double the levels of three years ago, before VW took control.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Traders' costs fall as volume soars on futures exchanges FUTURES brokers in Europe have had a banner year, with commission income leaping above last year's levels in the wake of soaring trading volume on most European exchanges. One result has been lower costs for the most active traders, as higher volume has translated into lower commissions. Turnover rose sharply on the main European futures markets in the first 10 months. In London, the number of contracts traded leapt by 78 per cent over last year, to 48m. In Paris, volume was up 56 per cent to 47m. Futures exchanges have been among the biggest beneficiaries. Liffe reckons its income this year will reach Pounds 60m (Dollars 90.6m), compared with Pounds 33m in 1991. A year ago, it was considering borrowing to help finance a move into new premises. Thanks to the jump in trading volume, it has been able to pay for the move out of current income, rebuild its reserves and still plan to hand money back to its members. Brokers have seen a similar rise in income. With fixed costs accounting for a high proportion of total outlays, much of the extra revenue has flowed straight through into profit. In some cases, the benefits are being passed on to customers. Barclays de Zoete Wedd says its typical commission (excluding clearing costs) for its most active customers has fallen from Pounds 1.50 per contract a year ago to around Pounds 1. Clearing costs, though, have remained static at up to Pounds 2 a bargain, with a further 45p fee payable to Liffe. Paris trading costs have followed a similar pattern. From FFr15 a year ago, Matif commissions are now nearer FFr10 for active customers. However, these reductions have not come across the board. Another London broker says that its all-in charges - which range from around Pounds 5-Pounds 8, depending on the customer - for a 'round-trip' (a purchase and a sale), had not changed over the year. Part of the reason why commissions have not fallen further, says brokers, is that rates have historically been too low to make futures broking a profitable business in its own right. Many banks act as brokers, mainly to transact in-house orders from other parts of their group, and as a result offer broking services to clients at a marginal cost. Also, brokers fear the consequences if this year's volatile market conditions are not repeated. The head of one futures trading operation in London said: 'If we cut commission rates now to reflect good volumes, how do you get them up again next year? Commissions are a one-way street.' Investors generally seem to accept the rates they are asked to pay. 'It works both ways,' says one of the UK's biggest insurance companies, which adds it is still paying much the same commissions as a year ago. 'If I want first call from a broker, I have to pay the market rate for the service.' Estimating how much commission brokers have earned in total is not easy. Charging methods differ, with some firms applying an all-in rate and others charging separately for brokerage and clearing. Also, much of the business conducted on exchanges is either commission-free or at low rates. Two out of every five trades on Liffe are prompted by member firms trading for their own account or by orders from the members' associates. If the other 60 per cent of trades had earned an average commission of just Pounds 3 each (including clearing, but not the exchange charge), Liffe brokers would have earned around Pounds 170m so far this year (since two commissions - a purchase and sale - are paid on each bargain). Brokers also earn interest on clients' margin payments. According to one estimate, this accounted for as much as a quarter of some brokers' total income a year ago, but is now down to below a fifth due to falling interest rates.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Doing Radio" program] </F>   [Text] The Matanzas power authority predicts power will be  interrupted for up to eight hours per circuit this week.  Matanzas consumes more than 2,000 megawatts per day. Sector  officials report that the conservation program will reduce  electrical output by about nine megawatts 1000-1100 GMT, 18  megawatts 1200-2100 GMT, and 45 megawatts 2200-0300 GMT. The  report indicates that 1,458 megawatts -- 47 percent of the total  generated amount possible -- is available from the nationwide  electrical system. Currently in Cuba, six units are being  repaired, eight remain broken down, and three are having water  and fuel problems. This amounts to a deficit of 500 megawatts  during the period of maximum demand.    [Havana Radio Reloj Network in Spanish at 1403 GMT on 28  June  reports: "GRANMA newspaper reports on 28 June that Unit No. 3  of the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Electric Plant in Cienfuegos  was taken off line from the nationwide electrical system on the  morning of 27 June for scheduled maintenance. GRANMA adds that  the work is scheduled to last 35 days and will be undertaken by  the plant's technicians and workers, as well as by the Basic  Industry Ministry's electrical plants maintenance enterprise.  Specialists believe that the Japanese-made unit requires  extensive maintenance to remedy diverse technological problems  and to elevate generating capacity from 130 to 158 megawatts.  The electrical plant's workers have once again pledged to work  very quickly."]</p>

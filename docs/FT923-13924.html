			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dramatic recovery by dollar THE DOLLAR gained over two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday on one of the most volatile days of trading on the foreign exchanges this year, writes James Blitz. Early morning trading in London continued the bearish trend set on Wednesday, with the US currency hitting a low of DM1.4805. But the dollar was boosted later in the day by comments from several European finance officials who said that they would like to see the dollar bottom out at its current levels. Mr Michel Sapin, the French Finance Minister, issued the first blow in the dollar's favour by saying that none of his counterparts in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations wanted to see the currency drop further. Later, a Bundesbank board member compounded this comment, saying that Germany wants strong and stable dollar. The US currency finished trading in London at DM1.5190. In late American trading, it fell back to DM1.5150. By that stage it had climbed more than three pfennigs in the previous ten hours. Few believe this recovery can hold. 'We've seen a lot of short covering and a lot of operators trying to buy the dollar because they think it's cheap,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'I think they're moving too early.' Mr Mark Slater, managing director of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International, agreed: 'Nothing has changed in terms of the fundamentals. There is no sign of any reversal in the dollar's trend,' he said. Underlining that view were renewed fears that the Bundesbank could raise interest rates or the banks' reserve requirements at its council meeting next Thursday. 'The underlying problem is that the Germans have still not managed to get money supply under control,' said one commercial bank trader. Sterling was the other volatile currency yesterday, suffering a heavy fall both in overnight trading and the early morning in London. At 9 am in London it was trading at a low of DM2.8585, 1 1/2 pfennigs down from the previous night's close in London. For the rest of the day, it was boosted by a series of comments from British government ministers, suggesting that sterling would enter the narrow bands of the European Monetary System when the time was right. The pound ended the day  3/4 of a pfennig stronger than its previous close, at DM2.8800. But sterling could have been expected to profit more from the dollar's dramatic rise and from intervention by the Bank of Spain, which yesterday sold D-Marks to buy pesetas. Its failure to do so is one of the clearest signs yet that the currency has an a weakness independent of market uncertainty.</p>

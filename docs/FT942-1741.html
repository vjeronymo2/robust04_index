			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Ciller denies impropriety Turkey's prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller went on the record yesterday to deny allegations of official impropriety in her business dealings after newspaper claims that she had used her office to acquire property in the US. Mrs Ciller is under pressure to clear her name after a whispering campaign about her business dealings and those of her husband, who publicly gave up his licence as franchisee of the US fast food chain 7-Eleven when she became prime minister last year. Mrs Ciller told the official Anatolia news agency she had not declared the assets when she became an MP in 1991 because the properties were owned by Marsan, a Turkish-registered company in which she and her husband are shareholders. Moreover they were acquired before she became a minister. Milliyet, a Turkish newspaper cited documentation alleging the prime minister and Mr Ozer Ciller were the owners of a hotel, shopping centre and villa near Salem in Oregon, properties acquired since she was appointed to the cabinet in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTALANNEX+ JOINS MAIL FRANCHISE STAMPEDE;  </P> <P> SERVICES: YOUNG COMPANY TOOK OFF AFTER ITS FOUNDER'S MEETING WITH THE HEAD OF A  BIG COMPETITOR.  </P> <P> Jack Lentz, founder of Postal-Annex+, was small potatoes when he agreed in late  1985 to attend a lunch meeting with Anthony DeSio, president of San Diego-based  Mail Boxes Etc., the nation's leader in privately owned postal-service  stations.  </P> <P> At the time, Lentz owned three postal-service outlets -- in University City,  San Ysidro and El Cajon -- and was planning for the day he would lay claim to  18 stores of his own.  </P> <P> The lunch was arranged because DeSio was interested in buying one of Lentz's  sites to add yet another franchise to what was then Mail Boxes Etc.'s  230-outlet chain, the largest provider of private mailbox rentals and related  services.  </P> <P> "He asked me if I had a price, and I said, 'No, I haven't thought about that,'  " recalled Lentz, a retired insurance executive who had entered the  postal-service business with encouragement from a similarly employed friend.  </P> <P> Instead, Lentz left the fateful meeting with a concept he had never considered:  franchising.  </P> <P> Since then, PostalAnnex+ has sold 83 franchises, including the three originally  owned by Lentz. Last month, less than five years after the meeting with DeSio,  Entrepreneur magazine ranked PostalAnnex+ among the top 25 new franchises in  the nation. In fiscal 1989, the company grossed $1.5 million, more than  doubling its 1987 revenue, and is expected to pull in $2.5 million in fiscal  1990.  </P> <P> In total outlets, PostalAnnex+ still trails Mail Boxes Etc., a publicly held  company that has more than 1,100 franchises worldwide and recorded $2.4 million  in profits in fiscal 1989. But the up-and-comer, PostalAnnex+, is rapidly  gaining on a field of contenders for second place, led by Denver-based Pak Mail  Centers of America, with 238 outlets.  </P> <P> Lentz and DeSio have not spoken since their luncheon, which appears to have  left a bitter taste in DeSio's mouth.  </P> <P> "He brought up the possibility of selling that store (in University City) and  the others," said DeSio, whose recollection of the meeting differs  substantially from Lentz's. "We really weren't interested. The other stores  were in pretty bad locations, losing a lot of money. As a result, we decided  just to go ahead and take our franchisee elsewhere."  </P> <P> Each company pursued its own expansion plan, eventually making San Diego County  home to more than 100 alternative postal-service outlets, more locations per  capita than any other county in the nation, industry experts say. Mail Boxes  Etc. lays claim to 55 of them, PostalAnnex+ to 40. The rest are in the hands of  other chains and independent operators.  </P> <P> Lentz and DeSio agree that the marketplace for alternative postal-service  stations -- which offer customers everything from post-office boxes and office  supplies to facsimile and answering machine services -- is far from achieving  its potential. Although there are now more than 6,000 alternative postal  outlets nationwide, estimates of the number of outlets the national market  could bear range from 20,000 to 40,000.  </P> <P> "The indications are that we're far from the point that would indicate we are  near any point of saturation," said Roger Lipton, managing director of  Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., a New York investment banking firm specializing  in the franchising industry. "Ten years ago, people thought McDonald's had  already saturated the marketplace. Today, they've got almost three times the  number of stores."  </P> <P> If the market could support just one private postal-service station for every  U.S. Post Office in the nation, he said, it would mean there is room for more  than 40,000 alternative outlets.  </P> <P> "The services provided (by companies such as Mail Boxes Etc. and PostalAnnex+)  are substantially broader and different from those provided by the post  office," Lipton added. "And what we have found with other examples is that if  service providers do their job professionally, the market has proved to be  broader than anyone expected."  </P> <P> Alternative postal outlets were born of a market niche created in 1979, when  high labor costs forced the U.S. Postal Service to stop building post offices.  The Postal Service vowed instead to place mail stations in gift shops and other  retail outlets, to be run by independent operators.  </P> <P> But the policy left a shortage of post-office boxes in many major cities. And,  as the population base expanded, the demand for postal services increased.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc. entered the scene in 1980, offering post-office boxes to  clients in free-standing stations for a quarterly fee comparable to that  charged by the U.S. Postal Service. Despite the ability of companies such as  Mail Boxes Etc. to provide some services more inexpensively than the  government, the U.S. Postal Service did not welcome the commercial  mail-receiving outlets.  </P> <P> Indeed, the U.S. Postal Service refuses to forward mail to anyone who receives  mail at a commercial station.  </P> <P> U.S. Postal Rate Commissioner John Crutcher, one of five commissioners  appointed by the President and an outspoken critic of the U.S. Postal Service,  said: "It's ridiculous for the Postal Service not to negotiate with these  people to handle all of the normal mail services that people need. . . . If,  instead of fighting with them, they would make common cause with them, then the  Postal Service would be relieved of the necessity of manning all those  substations."  </P> <P> But U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Sharon Hamilton denied that there is any  fear of competition with commercial outlets and described the government's  service as more reliable and convenient.  </P> <P> When Mail Boxes Etc. first opened, the bias against commercial outlets reached  beyond the U.S. Postal Service.  </P> <P> "Initially, these businesses were called post-office drops, mail drops. It had  a bad connotation," said Blaine Roberts of La Jolla, a member of Mail Boxes  Etc.'s board of directors whose father, Norman, is a stockholder. "The idea was  a lot of shady operators used them because that way people couldn't find their  home. But now it has evolved to be a very practical and perfectly legitimate  way to do business."  </P> <P> During Mail Boxes Etc.'s first year in business, it began selling franchises, a  dynamic expansion method that proved to be extremely successful and  cost-efficient. Housewives, retired postal workers, schoolteachers and even  marine biologists bought franchises.  </P> <P> "When we started this company, if we put a mirror under their nose and it  steamed up, we gave them a franchise," Mail Boxes Etc. Vice President Bob DeSio  said. "We qualify them a little more now."  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc. virtually invited competition, however, when it misjudged the  market. The company now acknowledges that it granted its first franchisees  larger than necessary territories, which, in effect, opened retail holes for  competitors such as PostalAnnex+.  </P> <P> Patricia Langan, a real estate agent who, along with her husband, Patrick,  bought a PostalAnnex+ franchise in mid-1988, said they were attracted to the  business after becoming regular customers at a PostalAnnex+ in Solana Beach.  </P> <P> "We were familiar with it, we used it all the time," Langan said. "And we saw  it being a business of the times, one that a lot of people want to use. We also  thought it was a clean business. We're not slicing tomatoes."  </P></p>

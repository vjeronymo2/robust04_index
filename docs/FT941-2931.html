			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer with a sense of smell A 'neural nose' which can sniff out fine wines by identifying the grape and vineyard can also smell fake perfumes and contaminated food. The computer with a sense of smell, developed by two British companies, Neotronics and Neural Technologies, incorporates 12 sensors made of conducting polymers - the human nose has 10,000 sensors. Nevertheless, by using neural computing techniques the nose can identify subtle smell combinations. Neural Technologies: UK, 0730 260256.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Smell of decay lingers in Kigali, city of the dead There is an emptiness about Kigali which is more sinister than the mere lack of people. It is the city where the genocide of Rwanda's minority Tutsi community began in April, and a faint, cloying smell of decaying flesh alerts newcomers to the fact that in Kigali, the living are outnumbered by the dead. After the massacres, the majority Hutu population took flight as the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, led by Tutsi exiles, captured the capital. It is a city of abandoned cars and abandoned villas. The three-month-long battle for Kigali, which ended earlier this month, also left its scars. The parliament building, which stood on one of the city's seven hills, was bombed beyond repair, so the ceremony which installed Rwanda's new RPF-led government had to be held outdoors. There was no officialdom present at the ceremony. Most civil servants were recruited from the ruling Hutu party, now in self-imposed exile. The new government has no bureaucracy to execute its orders and no people to govern. The foyer of the Meridien hotel, where half the new cabinet has taken up residence, is barricaded with sandbags. Few of its windows withstood the constant shelling which marked the fight for that sector of the city. There is no electricity to lighten the gloomy interior and, like the rest of the capital, the hotel has no running water. Therese, a Hutu employee left in charge of the Meridien after the evacuation of its European management, has only ventured outside the hotel once since the RPF took control of Kigali. 'I went to see if my house was still standing,' she says. 'A Tutsi family has taken it over.' She does not plan to register a complaint. She fears the new government and the boy soldiers who guard the numerous RPF roadblocks in the city. Inside the hotel, however, she feels protected by the presence of UN troops who are billeted there. The RPF victory has sounded the clarion call for the Tutsi diaspora to return home. Driven into exile by a succession of Hutu governments, the returnees are breathing new life into Kigali. They are easy to spot in overloaded cars with Burundese or Ugandan number plates. Mr Protais Nkeshimana, a taxi-driver born in neighbouring Burundi, set foot in the land of his parents for the first time this week. He chose an empty mansion in one of the capital's smartest districts to begin a new life. 'If the owner comes back, we will vacate the house,' he says, without much conviction. In the new Rwanda, there are as yet no courts or police to evict him. Outside the offices of Transintra, an international shipping company, Emile Twahirwa has come back to inspect the damage wrought by the widespread looting which accompanied the massacres in Kigali. Twahirwa, a Tutsi, was separated from his wife and daughter when the killings began. He was saved by an officer of the former Hutu army, who gave him a Hutu identity card and helped him escape from the capital. His family was murdered. 'Every exile I know plans to return,' he says. 'We must rebuild the country, but this time without the ethnic distinctions that divided us in the past.' The less affluent return on foot. A constant trickle of peasants arrive in the capital daily in search of food and shelter. They head for the markets where there is a brisk trade in looted goods. Orphanages have multiplied since April, as the Red Cross and other relief agencies rescued children from houses in which all the adults had been killed. The convent of the Sisters of Mercy, founded by Mother Teresa of Calcutta, looks after more than 200 children. Those who are old enough help the nuns carry jerry cans of water which are filled each day from a Red Cross water truck. The nuns will not speak about the children who were dragged away from the convent by Hutu militia. When asked whether they believe Hutu and Tutsi can live together again, they shrug and look away. What has happened in Rwanda has been a test of their faith.</p>

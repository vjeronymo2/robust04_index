			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Technology: The Orbital comes full circle / Examining a prototype engine capable of meeting strict emissions standards Some ordinary-looking, but distinctly strange-sounding, Ford Fiestas have been cruising the British country lanes of Suffolk recently. Beneath their bonnets lie prototype engines which, if an evaluation programme just beginning proves successful, are likely to form the bedrock of Ford's petrol and diesel technology for the mid- to late-1990s. The engines have been developed jointly by Ford and the Orbital Engine Company of Western Australia. In the Fiesta, they have three cylinders and work on the two-stroke principle, providing twice as many power strokes per revolution as a conventional petrol engine - and thus having the smoothness and flexibility of a six-cylinder unit. Another advantage is that the engine has no valves and thus none of the heavy and complicated components needed to operate them. It is half the size of a conventional engine of similar capacity and saves about one-third the weight of a conventional unit (equivalent to 30 kilogrammes in the Fiesta). Size for size the engine is 10 per cent more powerful and 12 per cent more economical than its conventional rivals. Not least of its attractions, according to Ford development engineers, is that it is already capable of meeting the most stringent exhaust emissions standards currently in force. The unit is now being assessed amid optimism that it will be able to qualify as an 'Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle' under even stricter Californian legislation due in 1997. To achieve this, Ford and Orbital claim to have made a 'technological breakthrough' in terms of minimising emissions, but are refusing to discuss the details. Ford has just finished production of 25 Orbital prototypes, which are set to enter service with police forces and other intensive users for a one-year evaluation programme. As some doubt remains over the engine's durability, it is hoped that during the test period each one will cover 100,000 miles. A further 35 engines are to be manufactured at Ford's Dagenham plant before the end of the year. Some of the test vehicles will enter service in Germany as well. If the programme does not result in any unexpected problems, Ford hopes to have small, Orbital-engined cars in its range by as early as 1995. Although initial applications are expected to be on small cars, Ford acknowledges that it has other, long-term projects with Orbital covering a variety of engines, including six-cylinder and supercharged units. Indeed, Jaguar, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford of the US, has just made the surprise disclosure of its own joint project with Orbital, of a 3.2 litre V6 engine. Prototypes of this type are 40 per cent lighter than Jaguar's V12 engine but have the same power output.</p>

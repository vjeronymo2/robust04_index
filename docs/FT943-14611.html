			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Whitehall faces sweeping reform: Government outlines four-year plan to cut 50,000 civil service jobs Mr John Major's government yesterday pushed its campaign for an improved public service to the very heart of Whitehall with plans for the most comprehensive restructuring of the civil service in decades. In a long-awaited white paper, the government outlined a set of reforms which will reduce the size of the civil service by about 50,000 people over the next four years and expose Whitehall to management practices that are commonplace in the private sector. The reforms will give individual Whitehall departments more autonomy over the selection of senior staff and the determination of running costs. It is proposed that more senior civil service posts should be open to candidates from the private sector and that the salaries of senior officials should be partly linked to their performance. Departments will also be obliged to introduce a fundamental reform of accounting practice, monitoring capital expenditure more comprehensively. Presenting the white paper to the House of Commons, Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said the aim of the reforms was to 'map a way forward for the civil service to the end of the century and beyond', making the Whitehall structure 'tauter and flatter' than it is now. However, he also acknowledged that the civil service had a 'unique role' in maintaining Britain's unwritten constitution. He assured MPs that the government would adopt a bipartisan approach to its proposals, and would consult opposition parties before implementing them. Some Labour MPs believed the proposals were far less radical than Mr Waldegrave might have wished, and that some cabinet ministers had ensured that the apparatus of government would remain in its traditional shape. 'The consolidators have won,' said Mr Giles Radice, who chairs inquiries into Whitehall by the Treasury and civil service select committee. 'This is not a radical document and the chance to open up the civil service has not really been taken.' At the heart of the proposals is the creation of a Senior Civil Service, which will be composed of the top 3,500 officials. It is proposed that these officials should receive explicit written employment contracts for the first time, and that salaries should be partly based on performance. Fixed term contracts could be used but ministers underlined that these would be in exceptional cases. Mr Waldegrave said open competition for posts 'should become a more normal part of the process of selecting people for senior appointments'. But the white paper failed to outline any specific targets for such appointments. The accounting reforms, outlined in a Treasury green paper yesterday, proposed that all government departments comply with radically different accounting practices more in line with the private sector within the next four years. The planned switch from cash-based to 'accruals' accounting will impose for the first time on the civil service the need to account for capital expenditure and to develop a series of more accurate management indicators. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said: 'This is a highly significant event that will make a great different to how government carries out business, makes decisions and is made accountable.' Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said: 'This is good news. It is part of a continuum of steps to improve the quality of management of government services.'

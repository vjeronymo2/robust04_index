			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (19): Japan plays biggest financial role - The search for loans for the project is an unfinished struggle As Eurotunnel embarks on its fifth fund-raising exercise since the company was created in 1986, its bankers and advisers are wondering whether the group's Japanese bank lenders will once again have to be 'handbagged' into supporting the refinancing. Japanese banks have contributed more of Eurotunnel's loan finance - some 23 per cent - than those from any other country. But on a famous occasion in the summer of 1990, Eurotunnel was kept out of receivership by the intervention of the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, when she wrote a letter - famous in Eurotunnel as the 'handbag letter' - to the then Japanese premier, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, urging him to persuade Japanese banks not to block a much needed injection of new bank loans. In the past two weeks, Eurotunnel and its bank advisers have been wondering whether they might need the persuasive powers of Mrs Thatcher's successor in their attempt to raise Pounds 1.3bn of new debt and equity. If the company succeeds, it will have raised more than Pounds 10bn in loans and equity since it was created in 1986, far more than has ever been raised by any other private sector infrastructure project. Funds started to disappear into the black hole under the channel in September 1986, when Pounds 46m of seedcorn equity was provided by five banks - Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Banque Indosuez, National Westminster and Midland - and the Transmanche Link Anglo-French construction consortium. The following month, a further Pounds 206m came from a placing of new shares with investment institutions. But the big fund-raising exercise was in the the following year, when a Pounds 5bn loan facility was raised from more than 200 international banks and Pounds 770m in equity came from a share sale involving public offers in the UK and France and placings elsewhere. However, not long after the money was raised, the company became aware that construction costs were spiralling out of control - and that the construction contract was far too kind to TML, the contractors. Under the contract, the lion's share of the cost increases fell on Eurotunnel rather than on TML. Eurotunnel needed to enlarge its banking facilities and raise additional equity. But the banks would not even let it continue drawing on the original Pounds 5bn facility without a renegotiation of the TML contract, to ensure a more equable distribution of the cost over-runs between the company and its contractors. The new contract with TML was finally signed on February 22, 1990, only hours before the receivers would have needed to be called in. But though Eurotunnel was given permission by its banks to continue drawing on its loan facilities, its financial problems were only just beginning. Its estimate of the construction costs it had to carry - as opposed to those faced by TML - had increased 46 per cent since 1987. Including financing charges and central overheads, it now estimated it needed Pounds 7.6bn in cash resources to finish the tunnel and operate shuttle and train services till they started to break even. However, it only had Pounds 6bn in loans and equity. So it spent most of 1990, trying to persuade banks to provide Pounds 2bn of additional facilities, prior to obtaining Pounds 566m from a rights issue. Though this appeared to be more than it needed, the company wanted a cushion to prevent any further cash crises from any future cost over-runs. The banks were not enthusiastic to provide more. There was a worldwide recession in the banking industry. Big international banks were short of capital and were reluctant to make substantial new loans to any customer, however strong - and Eurotunnel was not at the time an unblemished credit. Eurotunnel had by that time only drawn around a fifth of the Pounds 5bn original facility. So some banks argued that if it was put into receivership at this stage, their losses would be limited. On the other hand, they argued that the losses could be huge if Eurotunnel was allowed to continue drawing on this original facility and was also given Pounds 2bn more but subsequently ran into further difficulties. In the face of such hostility, the group's four leading or agent banks - National Westminster and Midland of the UK, Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris of France - agreed to try to raise the money from the syndicate. In mid-August, perilously close to a deadline which had been fixed so that the crucial rights issue could go ahead in the autumn, 93 banks were still declining to provide their share of the new money. Most reluctant were the Japanese banks, some of which had backed Eurotunnel in the mistaken belief that the British and French government would bail it out if it ran into difficulties. However, after Mrs Thatcher's letter to Mr Kaifu, the Japanese Ministry of Finance summoned the main Japanese bank lenders to a meeting. In the end, they agreed to provide their share of the new funds. The final amount of the increase in the facility was Pounds 1.8bn, or Pounds 200m less than Eurotunnel wanted. But the company secured a further Pounds 300m loan from the European Investment Bank. However, since then Eurotunnel's need for capital has increased yet again. Part of the reason is that construction costs have risen even more. But the requirement for new loans and equity stems mainly from the delays in the opening schedule and the slow build-up of passenger services - which means that Eurotunnel will start to generate revenues far later than it originally hoped. It is now trying to persuade its banks to provide around Pounds 650m from a new class of senior bank debt, prior to a Pounds 650m rights issue in late May. The new debt would rank ahead of the existing bank loans in a winding up. It is also scheduled to be repaid in approximately 10 years, compared with the 2010 repayment date of the existing debt. But unlike the 1990 refinancing, the company has recognised that it will not be able to persuade all its banks to contribute to the new loan. In particular, it is not expecting the Japanese banks to participate fully in the new loan. Banks' participation in the new credit line will be at their discretion and not a fixed proportion of their existing exposure, as was the case in 1990. Nonetheless, Eurotunnel needs the Japanese banks to vote in favour of the reconstruction proposal, because 90 per cent approval of bank creditors is required for it to go ahead. Bankers say that some banks - including the Japanese - may be reluctant to back the plan, since their existing debt would be placed second in the creditors' rankings by the issue of new senior debt.</p>

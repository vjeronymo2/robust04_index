			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: FORD CO. DELVES INTO CUSTODIAL CARE  </P> <P> In an area where few have dared to tread, the Ford Motor Co. has begun a pilot  program for workers in Louisville that pays for non-medical custodial care at  home or in a nursing home. About 6,600 people, including active employees and  those who have retired since 1987, and their dependents, are eligible.  </P> <P> The program provides help with activities of daily living -- eating, bathing,  dressing, preparing meals and housecleaning -- for the severely impaired. It is  intended to support rather than replace care provided by family and friends.  Beneficiaries can briefly stay in a custodial nursing home, giving family  members respite from care-giving.  </P> <P> The Jefferson County Department of Human Services manages the program under  contract with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan and Kentucky. County  nurses and social workers determine eligibility and supervise the care. The  program extends longstanding employee health benefits at Ford, which include  skilled nursing care under a physician's supervision and hospice care for the  terminally ill.  </P> <P> The new health plan, requested by the United Automobile Workers Union, is a  pioneer employee-financed program. Similar pilot programs are being planned at  General Motors and Chrysler.  </P> <P> Question: I am a 67-year-old widow in excellent health who enjoys her  independence and freedom. However, like everyone else, I am beginning to feel  the pressures of inflation. While I could use extra cash, I don't want to sell  my house or take in boarders. A friend suggested I apply for a reverse  mortgage, but couldn't provide details. Can you?  </P> <P> Answer: Reverse mortgages, also called home-equity conversion mortgages, allow  owners to convert the equity in a home into cash that does not have to be  repaid until the borrower moves or dies.  </P> <P> A new Housing and Urban Development demonstration project will help those who  own their homes but can't meet expenses to use their home equity as a source of  income. Between now and Sept. 30, 1990, HUD will insure up to 2,500 FHA-insured  reverse mortgages to homeowners age 62 or older who live in homes they own free  and clear (or nearly so).  </P> <P> According to HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research, the insured  mortgages offer three payment options: a tenure option, which provides monthly  payments to homeowners as long as they occupy the home as a principal  residence; a term option, which provides monthly payments for a fixed period  selected by the homeowner; and a line-of-credit option, which permits  homeowners to draw money at times and in amounts of their choosing up to a  maximum amount.  </P> <P> In addition, the homeowner may receive lump-sum draws, combine a line of credit  with monthly payments or change the payment plan if needed.  </P> <P> Regardless of the option selected, homeowners may continue to live in the house  until they move, sell or die. They may sell their property at any time,  retaining proceeds that exceed the amount needed to pay off the mortgage.  Homeowners cannot be forced to sell their home to pay off the mortgage. HUD  will insure lenders against the risk that the mortgage may grow to exceed the  value of the property.  </P> <P> For more information and a list of participating lenders, contact HUD USER,  P.O. Box 6091, Rockville, Md. 20850, (800) 245-2691 or (301) 251-5154.  </P></p>

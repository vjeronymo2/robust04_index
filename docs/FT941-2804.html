			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Maltese borrowing debut draws high-yield investors The first offering by a Maltese borrower met selective demand yesterday from investors looking for higher-yielding paper. Freeport Terminal (Malta) launched a Dollars 205m 15-year offering of bonds to finance a new container terminal. The deal is guaranteed by the Republic of Malta and is rated A2 by Moody's. The issue has a sinking fund, which starts to repay principal from March 1999, giving the issue an average life of 10 years. The structure, which is rather unusual for a Eurobond, is designed to suit the nature of the project financing. Dealers said the issue was attractively priced, taking account of the structure. At 115 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury, it appeared generous relative to other single-A rated credits, they said. More than half the paper was placed in the US, where single-A corporate bonds are trading as tightly as 60 basis points over the curve, according to lead manager Bankers Trust. The offering included a 144A option for placement with US institutional investors. European investors were less enthusiastic, as they remain nervous about buying long-dated dollar paper, and are also less familiar with sinking funds. 'The deal was attractively priced - it was just a question of selling the story on the borrower,' said one syndicate manager involved in the transaction. The deal reflects growing demand for less than top-rated dollar paper. Dealers said they have seen selective buying of dollar-denominated corporate bonds, which are trading at relatively wide spreads and have the potential to tighten. In the Canadian dollar sector, Toyota Motor Credit and ASLK-CGER launched smallish three-year offerings, which are expected to be placed gradually with retail investors. Elsewhere, in an important step in Bolivia's return to the international capital markets following the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, BHN Multibanco, a Bolivian commercial bank, launched a Dollars 10m issue of Euro-notes. The bank has already issued certificates of deposits, but this is its first offering of notes, made under a Dollars 25m programme arranged by West Merchant Bank. Moody's has upgraded the rating of New Zealand's foreign currency debt from Aa3 to Aa2, reflecting important structural changes. The rating agency said that New Zealand's foreign currency debt/exports ratio and current account deficit are declining, while economic growth is picking up. New Zealand launched a Dollars 1bn offering of five-year floating rate notes earlier this week.</p>

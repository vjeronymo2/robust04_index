Elettra is a super microscope that uses synchrotron  light and began operating in Trieste on 4 October. According to  the three companies, in the future 80 percent of the research  into the structure of new pharmaceuticals will be performed  using this extremely powerful insturment.    Elettra, the most powerful super microscope in Europe, took  6  years to build and to date has cost 300 billion lire. Inside  Elettra electron beams are brought an energy of 1.5 Giga  electron volts by a linear particle accelerator and are then  injected into an accumulator ring containing curved magnet and  other devices that cause them to loose energy under the form of  synchrotorn light.    This intense radiation is then directed into channels  leading  to experimental laboratories where the researchers work. The  light produced acts like an extremely powerful microscope that  is capable of observing matter, both organic and inorganic, in  great detail. "It is unique in the world because of the  particular `brilliance' of its light beam," said the physicist  and Elettra Scientific Committee President Giorgio Maritondo,  "this light is capable of investigating the chemical bonds of  the molecules contained in any given substance." Elettra can be  used in the field of biology to examine the distribution of  toxic elements in cerebral cell systems.    The "light" will not be used for pharmaceutical research  alone. Many other sectors will benefit from Elettra: Its 50  "light lines" will enable unique experiments to be performed,  both basic and applied research, in the field of computer  science for the production of integrated circuits; in the  mechanical field for the manufacture of microcomponents, and in  the chemical sector for the study of new materials.</p>

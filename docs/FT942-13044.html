			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Virgin considering Channel 5 bid The Virgin group is working on plans for a new general entertainment television channel and has expressed interest in launching it on Channel 5. Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications, confirmed yesterday that he had had talks with the Independent Television Commission about the possibility of bidding for the franchise. The ITC has said it would like to decide at its May meeting whether to advertise a Channel 5 franchise, but is waiting to hear from the government whether the necessary franchises will be made available. A complex debate is going on within the government on the extent to which a Channel 5 using existing analogue technology would impinge on the future development of digital terrestrial television. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, has made it clear he hopes to have the government's verdict in time for an ITC decision next month. Three significant groups have now been publicly identified as potential bidders for the channel, which could reach about 70 per cent of the UK population. The others are NBC, the US network company, and a consortium grouping Time Warner, MAI - the company that owns Meridian and Anglia Television - and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Mr Devereux stressed yesterday that the level of his interest would depend on the size of the bill for retuning video recorders likely to face interference from the Channel 5 signal. The main target audience for the Virgin television channel would be under 40  -similar to that for Virgin 1215, the Virgin national commercial radio station. Mr Devereux said a launch on satellite had not been ruled out if Channel 5 did not go ahead.</p>

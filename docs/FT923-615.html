			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Buthelezi pulls Zulu party out of S Africa peace talks CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday withdrew his party from talks on a new South African constitution, throwing into doubt prospects for the early installation of a multiracial interim government. In a fiery speech at a rally in honour of Shaka, the 19th century militaristic Zulu king, Chief Buthelezi insisted Inkatha 'will not be bound by decisions reached in bilateral negotiations between the government and the African National Congress'. Only hours earlier, Mr FW de Klerk, the South African president, and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the ANC had ended three months of acrimony by committing themselves to putting an interim government in place as soon as possible. At a peace summit held outside Johannesburg on Saturday, they agreed to resume constitutional negotiations suspended since June. Addressing the crowd gathered in KwaMashu, a township on the outskirts of Durban, Chief Buthelezi said Inkatha and the KwaZulu government, which he heads, 'are not marginalised', adding 'and it's my sincere hope that we will not have to prove the reality of the statement'. Police said a woman was shot dead and six people were wounded by Inkatha supporters heading home from the rally. One Inkatha member was stabbed on his way to the meeting. Chief Buthelezi accused the ANC of indulging in Yugoslavia-type 'ethnic cleansing' and 'anti-Zulu racism' in seeking action against migrant worker hostels. The government and the ANC agreed at the weekend that some hostels would be fenced and patrolled by police, but the Zulu leader said hostel inmates would tear down fences 'with their bare hands if needs be'. He rejected restrictions on the carrying of dangerous weapons, also agreed at the weekend, saying any attempt to impose them on the Zulus would lead to more violence. He threatened Inkatha would boycott any elections held in the present climate. The Zulu leader's withdrawal damped the euphoria of Saturday's agreement which Mr Mandela said he hoped would send a 'signal of hope' to South Africans. 'We have begun today to rescue our people from (the) chaos' of seemingly endless violence, he said. Mr de Klerk, too, pledged rapid progress toward a post-apartheid constitution, and underlined this promise by making big concessions on issues such as the release of political prisoners and on his demand for a general amnesty for security force personnel. As part of the deal, three ANC guerrillas convicted of terrorist crimes against white civilians are to be freed later today, along with self-confessed racist killer Barend Strydom, who killed seven blacks in 1988.

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Where diversity helps balance the books - Royal Bank of Scotland and its true worth In the four years since Mr George Mathewson took control of Royal Bank of Scotland, his constant refrain has been that his bank's true value is not appreciated. The steep climb in its share price over the past two years has reduced the volume of his complaint, but not yet stopped him making it. 'I'm in a bind, because when I say value is not recognised, people ask why we don't release value by floating something. But no, I still don't think it is,' he says, undaunted by the fact that his bank's shares now trade at 2.46 times their book value - marginally higher than even Lloyds Bank. This is a considerable turnaround from when Mr Mathewson was appointed deputy chief executive in 1990. It was part of a reshuffle engineered by Lord Younger, the chairman, to shake up what Mr Chris Ellerton, a bank analyst at SG Warburg, refers to as its 'moribund' former management. The publication of its interim results today marks a further step in its development since then. The flowering of businesses such as Direct Line, its telephone insurance arm, and Citizens, its US subsidiary, have now pushed its value to some Pounds 1.25bn more than its old rival, Bank of Scotland. Yet whatever the quality of the former senior executives, it was they who made a series of strategic decisions that have paid handsomely. These include the acquisition of Direct Line and Citizens, and forming an alliance with Banco Santander after it bought 9.9 per cent of Royal Bank's equity. Mr Mathewson, a former engineer who joined the bank from the Scottish Development Agency, has cemented what once seemed a strained link with Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line. He has also developed the Santander link strongly by investing in its Ibos cross-border payments system. But questions remain over whether he has turned Royal Bank into a coherent business, rather than a collection of several. The bank has faced constant speculation about the flotation of Citizens or Direct Line, despite his insistence that he will continue to develop the bank as a single entity. The rising share price has helped. Doubts about it having overlapping distribution methods in Direct Line and its branch bank are also easing. As more banks reduce their branches and turn to telephone and direct selling methods, Royal Bank's dual delivery approach appears increasingly sensible. 'I think it does make sense as a business, because banking is boiling down to the number and quality of the customers you can get,' says Mr Ellerton. He says that Direct Line's ability to attract reliable, well-off customers means that Royal Bank can take market share cheaply, and with little risk. 'People do not realise the value of having more than one brand,' says Mr Mathewson. He cites Direct Line's ability to price personal loans differently according to its assessment of how credit-worthy the borrower is. The branch bank could not do it because it would be socially unacceptable. This ability to deploy a variety of selling approaches is one reason why Mr Mathewson likes having a diversified bank. A second is that he has been trying to reduce the volatility of the bank's earnings after the shock of the Pounds 1.1bn bad debt provisions it had to make between 1991 and 1993. He says that corporate lending has proved the most volatile activity. The bank has partly tried to address this by working harder to sell things such as treasury products, and custodial services to large companies. But its main emphasis has been on diversifying its businesses to balance volatile ones. Mr Mathewson says this is one reason for keeping Citizens, which made Pounds 19.7m in 1992 when pre-tax profits of the whole group fell to Pounds 20.9m. 'Citizens earnings were very convenient then. The US banking market is not directly correlated with the UK one, so it gives us a balance,' he says. This belief in diversification, and reducing volatility of earnings, means that speculation about Royal Bank has been turning from the question of whether it will sell businesses to whether it will buy another one. Mr Mathewson himself insists that the latter is the more obvious course. He argues that Royal Bank's capital backing and management expertise have helped to develop operations such as Citizens and Direct Line. 'We have added value to Citizens even though we do not run the operations, and we will continue to try to create new and exciting businesses,' he says. Mr Mathewson sees the obvious next target as a building society. The bank has already been selling more mortgages because they provide more consistent income than lending to companies. 'The right society would give us a stable earnings stream, and perhaps a higher credit rating,' he says. The problem is that societies have been alerted to their potential value by Lloyds' bid. For the moment, many analysts think that investors have already recognised at least the greater part of Royal Bank's value. 'The expectations are built into the price already,' says Mr Ellerton. It remains for Mr Mathewson to prove that these expectations are still not great enough.  --------------------------------------------------------                 PROFIT BEFORE PROVISIONS               DIVISIONAL ANALYSIS (POUNDS M)  --------------------------------------------------------                                           1992     1993  -------------------------------------------------------- Branch banking                           262.1    307.1 Corporate and institutional banking      117.3    155.8 Direct Line                               15.1     50.2 Citizens                                  35.5     56.0 Operations                                35.6     51.5 Central items                             (6.0)   (23.7) Totals                                   459.6    596.9  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

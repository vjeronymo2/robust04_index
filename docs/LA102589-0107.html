			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL UNITES ON ANTI-DRUG PROPOSAL  </P> <P> In a rare show of unanimity, the City Council has supported an ordinance that  would bar felony drug offenders from publicly subsidized housing in Mission  Viejo.  </P> <P> The often-divided council voted Monday night to back the proposed law in  concept and send it to City Atty. Scott Fox for review. His recommendation will  be heard by the council at its Nov. 27 meeting.  </P> <P> Mayor William S. Craycraft, who announced the proposal at a community anti-drug  rally Saturday, said it "felt good to receive the support of the council."  </P> <P> The proposed law would also force all residents with felony drug records to  register at the Laguna Niguel station of the Orange County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> In addition, the ordinance would empower city officials to place liens on homes  where drug activity occurs.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great idea," Councilman Norman P. Murray said. "We've got to  get off the dime and get moving on this."  </P> <P> While backing the proposed ordinance, council members Christian W. Keena and  Robert A. Curtis, both attorneys, cautioned the city to move slowly because of  potential legal complications.  </P> <P> "We pay good money for legal counsel," Keena said. "I would like to receive  input from the city attorney before we act."  </P> <P> Representatives of Orange County homeless shelters said Monday that they are  uneasy about the proposal because they fear that other cities will follow  Mission Viejo's lead by passing similar laws.  </P> <P> "Even if a man has been convicted of a drug crime, what do we do with him?"  asked Jim Lands, executive director of the Orange County Rescue Mission. "If  you deny these people housing, they're going to sleep in the streets and  defecate in driveways."  </P> <P> Warren Johnson, an administrator for the 145-bed Salvation Army shelter in  Anaheim, said the law is unfair because it apparently does not separate  one-time offenders from habitual criminals.  </P> <P> "It seems not to address the individual," he said. "I would like to think we  live in a forgiving world. I would feel very uncomfortable with this law."  </P> <P> Other county officials, who did not wish to be identified, did not see the need  for targeting housing projects in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Although city officials said they could not provide any figures on  affordable-housing projects, the Orange County Housing Authority said 14  families receive subsidies under the main federal housing assistance program in  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Craycraft said that if only one drug dealer were kept out of the city, the  ordinance would be a success.  </P> <P> "Any steps we can take are worthwhile," the mayor said.  </P> <P> He expressed sympathy for families and recovering addicts who would be affected  by the ordinance, but said that "with all due respect to those who need  assistance, I think the needs of Mission Viejo take precedence over those who  abuse drugs. We are determined to make this city a drug-free zone." FRANK  MESSINA  </P></p>

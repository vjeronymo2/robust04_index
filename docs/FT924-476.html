			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Cyclical stocks bear brunt of currency turmoil - William Cochrane reviews the best and worst performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 in the second half The progressive departure of the cyclicals from the European share price leader board, apparent after the first six months of 1992, has turned into a rout in a second half marked by currency devaluation, or the lack of it. Four big carmakers - Volkswagen, Fiat, Daimler and Peugeot - figure among the bottom 10 performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index in the approximate six-month period to December 21; Philips, the Dutch electricals giant, would have joined them, but it has just been deleted from the Eurotrack; and just outside the bottom 10 come BMW and tyremaker Pirelli SpA. This is in distinct contrast to the position in early June, when there were four consumer durables leaders among the top 10 performers - VW, Pirelli, Volvo and Philips. In some cases, sentiment has switched from a mood of euphoria to one of sickening gloom. Mr Bob Barber, who heads the automotive and capital goods analysis team at James Capel, notes that until the end of June the automotive sector was the best performer in Europe, outperforming the broker's own European (ex-UK) index by 13 per cent. In the second half, says Mr Barber, it has underperformed by 26 per cent. Prospects for German carmakers have gone from bad to worse recently. Strengthening terms of trade against various other European currencies have left German industrialists worried about dropping export margins, and plummeting pro-fits on foreign production facilities. Volkswagen secured its place near the bottom of the Europile with a mid-December forecast of substantial fourth-quarter losses, effectively confirm-ing it would cut the 1992 dividend and indicating that 1993 could be a good deal worse. Mr Dieter Ullsperger, VW's finance director, also forecast that the German car market will shrink by 20 per cent in 1993, and that deliveries to Europe will fall by 10 per cent. Daimler-Benz, meanwhile, said on December 15 that short-time working would cut its total 1992 output of cars to 529,000, compared with 578,000 in 1991, and that profits would fall from DM1.9bn (Dollars 1.2bn) to around DM1.5bn. The oil industry, too, went through a series of corporate setbacks in the July to December period. BP, the UK giant, lost its chairman in mid-year and halved its second-quarter dividend at the beginning of August; this was accompanied by boardroom strife, and a slump in refining and petrochemical operations at OMV, the state-controlled Austrian energy and petrochemicals group. OMV said early in November that it had returned to profits in the third quarter. However, by then the bears had focused once, and were about to focus again on Petrofina, Belgium's oil company, which said in mid-December that it was halving its dividend and that 1993 would also be an extremely difficult year. The top 10 is headed by Credito Italiano and BCI. The Italian government is planning a radical reduction in state control of the Italian banking and financial system as the central feature of a far-reaching privatisation programme submitted to parliament in mid-November. Privatisation fever inflamed the Milan market from the end of October, cooling down a little by December but with occasional eruptions from time to time. In the same sector, but somewhat different in character, Kredietbank, of Belgium, looks like one of the linchpin defensive stocks in the top 10. Other defensive stocks in or near the top 10 are the pharmaceutical majors, Astra, of Sweden, and Roche, of Switzerland, and the food group Nestle. Merrill Lynch characterises Kredietbank as highly conservative, a local bank with a strong domestic franchise: 'Kredietbank has not vied for expansion abroad except in business areas related to the international and specialised needs of its domestic client base, and this has left it in an enviable position in terms of asset quality,' the broker says. It is also, of course, trading in a hard currency. Trading share prices in soft currencies means that the Eurotrack top five, based in Italy and Sweden, have been apparently less profitable for the foreign investor than for domestic punters - whereas numbers six to 10, in Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, have done better for the foreigner than for investors at home. Among the other leaders, Ericsson, the telecommunications group, was strong in both halves. Before that, the B frees showed 18 months of severe weakness, from mid-1990 to the end of 1991. In 1992, however, performance has improved, with third-quarter results released in November demonstrating outstanding cost control and coinciding with the floating of the Swedish crown. Merrill Lynch analysed the company at the time and estimated that, with half of costs and revenue in 'soft' and half in 'hard' currency countries, the overall effect of the Swedish currency's devaluation was only mildly positive for the company, although good for business in the long run. Of Astra, James Capel said on December 17 that while its R &amp; D presentation meeting for analysts had disappointed the market's high new product expectations, it had reaffirmed the strong growth trends of its most important pharmaceutical products.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100: WINNERS AND LOSERS, JUNE 30 - DECEMBER 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10        Actual      Change*    Bottom 10      Actual      Change*               change  relative to                   change  relative to                    %    Eurotrack                        %    Eurotrack                             100 %                                 100 %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cdt.

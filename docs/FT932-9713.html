			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (6): Subtle shift in attitude - The view from Canada The attitude of Canadians towards North American free trade has undergone a subtle but perceptible shift since the fiery debate which dominated the 1988 election campaign. Instead of arguing about free trade, Canadians are learning to cope with its challenges and opportunities. Recent opinion polls show that a majority still oppose the bilateral pact with the US which came into force in January 1989, as well as the wider Nafta deal. But the polls also point to a rising number who, however reluctantly, have come to accept that there is no turning back. A plethora of anti-free trade groups still dot the political landscape, raising many of the same arguments against Nafta that were heard in 1988. They contend that the agreement will deprive Canada of control over its natural resources, especially energy, and divert investment to Mexico. Mr Bob Rae, Ontario's social-democrat premier and one of the most vocal opponents of both the FTA and Nafta, predicted recently that 'companies in Ontario will insist that if they are to compete with enterprises in Mexico, Ontario workers must reduce their wages or face job losses.' Generally, however, the reaction to Nafta has been far more muted than to the four-year-old deal with Washington. The House of Commons has already approved Nafta legislation in principle and is set to ratify the deal by the end of June. Free trade is unlikely to ignite the same passions in the election due later this year as it did in 1988. One reason is that the Liberals, the main opposition party, are divided on the agreement. Another is that Mexico is a miniscule trading partner in comparison to the US. Canada's imports from Mexico currently run at only about 1.8 per cent of purchases from the US. Finally, just about all that can be said about free trade has been said over the past six years. Free trade is not dead as a political issue, but it has come to be overshadowed by other controversies. Implementation of the 1989 agreement has, however, proved to be a wrenching experience for Canadian companies and their workers. The provisions of the FTA are relatively modest. They include the gradual elimination of customs duties over 10 years, liberalised rules on US investment in Canada and the highly successful system of bi-national panels now used to settle protracted trade disputes. But the FTA coincided with such other pressures as the slump in domestic demand, low commodity prices and rising taxes. In addition, the prospect of lower trade barriers has encouraged companies on both sides of the border to rethink the way they do business in North America. They have spent the past four years rationalising and integrating US and Canadian operations in much the same way as the motor industry did in the years after the 1965 Automotive Pact. US multinationals typically no longer view Canada as a 'branch plant' country, but as part of their domestic operations. Instead of producing an item at two or more factories on each side of the border, companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Campbell Soup and Stanley Tools now supply both countries from a single plant. Almost all of Canada's large flour mills are now either owned by US companies or have US joint-venture partners. The move towards a free-trade zone has brought a gust of competition to the labour market, straining traditionally friendly relations between US and Canadian trade unions. The tensions are illustrated by a dispute at an instant-coffee factory south of Ottawa owned by Nestle, the Swiss food and beverage company. Nestle, which has excess capacity in North America, locked out the Canadian workers in March after they refused to accept more flexible overtime rules which have become standard practice at the company's two US plants. Even Canada's farmers, long accustomed to special protection, have not been immune from the pressures. For example, Canadian brewers have complained that high domestic prices for malting barley are putting them at a disadvantage to US brewers. The US industry pays lower prices for Canadian barley which then finds its way back across the border in US beers. Ottawa signed the Nafta deal last year mainly to protect gains made in the FTA and to ensure that Canada would continue to compete for foreign investors eyeing the entire North American market. Many Canadian companies have seized the opportunity to take a closer look at trade and investment in Mexico. A record 4,500 exporters visited the commercial division of the Canadian embassy in Mexico City last year. While Ottawa is scaling back diplomatic representation in other parts of the world, it recently opened a trade office in Monterrey. Canada's exports to Mexico soared by 37 per cent last year to CDollars 771m, due largely to sales of cereals and other foodstuffs. Imports were up by about 8 per cent to CDollars 2.8bn. Mexico's burgeoning economy and improved payments record has encouraged Canadian banks to increase their trade credits and to reduce rates on export finance. Bank of Nova Scotia paid CDollars 90m last autumn for a 5 per cent interest in a Mexican financial institution, Grupo Financiero Inverlat SA. A recent study by the Conference Board of Canada predicts that Canadian exporters of grains, oilseeds, livestock, textiles, oil and gas services, telecommunications equipment and engineering services are among those which will benefit from more liberalised trade and investment rules under Nafta. On the othe hand, Canadian industries at risk from labour-intensive, standard-technology Mexican exports include clothing, footwear, metal fabrication, machinery and electrical products. Canadian officials and businessmen also have a less tangible - but very real  -concern that implementation of Nafta may be hampered by cultural differences between the US and Canada on the one hand, and Mexico on the other. They wonder to what extent political corruption in Mexico will interfere with efforts to bring down trade barriers. They also question the ability of the Mexican government to enforce a complex multilateral agreement whose provisions in many cases will override domestic laws. One Canadian official predicts that the different ways of doing business north and south of the Rio Grande will create many 'hassles' over the next few years.</p>

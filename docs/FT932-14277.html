			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs hear attack on student loan body THE Student Loans Company has breached government undertakings by taking more than Pounds 1.5m from the higher education system, the Commons public accounts committee heard yesterday, John Authers writes. Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, quoted figures from the committee of vice-chancellors and principals to back his claim. 'The CVCP says it's costing colleges an average of Pounds 7 per student, and the department is only paying them Pounds 4 per student,' he said. He also quoted a statement made in 1990 by Lord Caithness, then the education minister responsible, that the government intended to 'cover the costs for universities'. Mr Williams combined the total number of student loan accounts administered by the Student Loans Company, of around 524,000, and the average subsidy of Pounds 3 per loan to claim that the SLC was taking 'more than Pounds 1.5m' from the colleges, in breach of Lord Caithness' undertakings. Mr Ronald Harrison, chief executive of the SLC, denied this, saying that the Pounds 4 figure was intended as a reasonable contribution towards cost. He added: 'There are colleges which are administering it within the Pounds 4 per student that we pay. There are other universities which cannot meet this standard and they are the ones which are complaining.' Committee members also criticised the optimistic assumptions for take-up made by the SLC when it was launched. It assumed that 80 per cent of eligible students would take out a loan in its first year. The eventual figure was 28 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL AND TRAGEDY IN A STOCKTON SCHOOLYARD  </P> <P> In the wake of the Stockton schoolyard tragedy (not to mention the senseless  massacres before it), where innocent little children were murdered, I would  like to make at least one thing perfectly clear: Any politician who even  remotely supports the NRA or does nothing about gun control will not get a vote  from me -- and I know I do not stand alone. Enough is enough.  </P> <P> LUCY M. CONKLIN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

The provincial government's stipulations are as follows:    1. As far as the tax reduction and exemption policy toward  enterprise income tax formally given by the Ministry of Finance  and the State Administration of Taxation are concerned, 15  preferential policies will continue to be implemented.

Some individual enterprises which have a heavy task of  technological transformation in line with industrial  requirements and need support and which have trouble paying  taxes and need income tax reductions and exemptions will be  given income tax reductions or exemptions at regular intervals  after reporting to the provincial government and getting its  approval in accordance with their management structure.</p>

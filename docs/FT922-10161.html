			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: High hopes of low rates It looks as if a base rate cut might finally be on the way after all. Not only was the Bank of England discreetly but systematically intervening in the money markets this week. Yesterday's Pounds 800m issue of five-year gilts also seems designed to raise expectations of a cut. Since paper of such short maturity is more geared to short interest rates, it might prove difficult to sell if hopes were disappointed. Of course, there is still a risk that a rate cut could backfire given the narrow differential with Germany, especially since markets there are worried about a seemingly runaway money supply. The risk was greater before the UK election, however. Sterling is now close to its DM2.95 central rate in the European system and the government could raise rates again with relative impunity if sterling came under pressure. The Bank can also study the reaction to its signal in continental markets on Monday before finally making up its mind. Given sterling's strength, the Bank might be tempted to go for a half point cut. The received wisdom is that after the election, the UK is a beacon of stability. Germany is facing strikes, France has an election next year and Japan runs the risk of incipient financial crisis. The US has riots and Italy lacks a president. Yet, despite the Bank's astonishing success in selling gilts since the election, it still needs the support of international investors to fund the PSBR. The UK might have less appeal if investors believed the rise in the exchange rate and the fall in interest rates had run their course. This is an argument for a quarter-point cut. A half point would imply the government is privately less convinced about the prospects for recovery than its public utterances suggest.</p>

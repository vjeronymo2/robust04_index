			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin: `Russia Has </F> Its Own Way of Entering the Market.' Extract From Russian  Premier's Speech at 20 May Meeting With Leaders of Industrial,  Construction, and Transport Enterprises and Organizations"]    [Text] Today the root of all problems is the lack of  specific mechanisms for economic regulation designed to  stimulate vital market forces, create a competitive environment,  overcome the sales crisis, and solve payment defaults. Marking  time is akin to death now. We must make far more rapid progress  to develop and fine-tune the necessary regulators in order to  keep even what we have already achieved. That is the  government's main cause for concern and anguish in the  foreseeable future.    In this connection we have prepared a whole series of draft  statutory documents -- in the form of presidential edicts and  government decrees -- designed to bolster the priorities of the  policy of accord that have been discussed today. They all stem  directly from the president's instructions on tackling the  urgent problems of economic reform.    To be brief, the purpose and substance of these instructions  boils down to a single formula: Transformations of the Russian  economy should be geared to the national manufacturer of goods  and services, his interests must be protected, and his  initiative given free rein.    The first set of measures that have been outlined concern  the  prompt and full payment into the budget of taxes and other  mandatory payments, strengthening payment discipline in the  national economy, and stepping up tax policy.    What am I talking about? Primarily that taxpayers' liability  for observance of tax legislation is enhanced.    It is envisaged that they will provide tax organs without  fail with regular information about their bank accounts and  banks will report on enterprises opening accounts. This is to  ensure fuller monitoring of enterprises' financial position and  stop a number of widespread means of tax evasion.    A procedure will be established governing the mandatory use  of enterprise funds in deposit and hard-currency accounts to  meet commitments to budgets and other creditors and to pay  wages. This will make it possible to considerably reduce the  amount of payment defaults and speed up payment even if  enterprises do not have money in their main accounts.    What is more, in order to ease tension in funding  enterprises' priority needs, including wages, during a temporary  shortage of cash, they will be granted the right to obtain funds  from banks amounting to no more than 5 percent of average daily  receipts in their settlement accounts.    In order to attract foreign investments it is intended to  exempt enterprises with sizeable foreign investments from the  payment of profit tax into the federal budget for three years.  And over the subsequent two years the tax will be levied at a  reduced rate.    We are also proposing to even out the terms of value added  taxation [VAT] on Russian and imported goods and impose tough  restrictions on the range of goods liable to VAT at a reduced  rate.    The question of surmounting sizeable wage differentials that  are not justified by real labor input and results is extremely  topical and it is no exaggeration to say that it concerns  everyone today. This problem has become highly social and  sometimes takes on a political slant. I must say that the  government is planning to submit draft legislative acts  authorizing restrictions on the growth of funds used for  consumption in respect of enterprises with high wage levels  allowing for the rate of inflation.    I want to stress that the prohibitive measures will by no  means apply to all enterprises. Those which are increasing  production will receive definite concessions.    The Statute on the Procedure for the Sale of Debtor  Enterprises that has been drafted considerably furthers the  reform of state enterprises. This statute extends to all  insolvent enterprises in state and municipal ownership.    I recently signed a government decree "On Certain Measures  To  Implement the Legislation on Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of  Enterprises." It introduces criteria for deciding insolvency.  The Federal Administration for Bankruptcy Cases is obliged  prior to 1 July 1994 to begin producing a list of insolvent  enterprises.    Now let me say a few words about what will be done in the  foreign economic sphere. We are planning to considerably reduce  export customs duties on goods that hold a leading place in the  structure of Russian exports -- oil and petroleum products, gas,  electricity, aluminum, pulp -- and to abolish export quotas and  licenses.    No program, no matter how good, will work on its own. We  have taken strict control of fulfilling the action plan to  implement the first phase of the Government Program and the main  provisions of the president's message to the Federal Assembly.    For all the malfunctions and mistakes, for all the attempts  to hamper things, two years of reform have not been wasted.  Russia can already be said to have its own way of entering the  market and its own Russian model for development.</p>

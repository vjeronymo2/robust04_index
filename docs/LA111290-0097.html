			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> ITSALLGREEKTOME SURVIVES FOUL CLAIM TO WIN HOLLYWOOD DERBY BY A HEAD  </P> <P> Few things come easy for Itsallgreektome, so there was no reason why Sunday's  $200,000 Hollywood Derby should have been an exception.  </P> <P> Coming from 10th place, Itsallgreektome bounced off of Septieme Ciel twice  shortly before the wire, finished first by a head and then survived a foul  claim to earn the $110,000 purse before a crowd of 20,531.  </P> <P> Itsallgreektome's owner, Jheri Redding, is appealing the outcome of the Del Mar  Derby, an August race won by Tight Spot. The victory was given to  Itsallgreektome by the track stewards but taken away by a California Horse  Racing Board referee. Also on the 3-year-old charcoal-gray gelding's record are  photo-finish losses in the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park and the La Jolla  Handicap at Del Mar, plus narrow victories in the Ascot Handicap at Bay Meadows  and the Spotlight Handicap at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> This is a horse who usually has his trainer, Wally Dollase, on the edge of his  seat, and on Sunday, with about a quarter of a mile to go in the 1 1/8-mile  grass race, Itsallgreektome stirred doubts in his jockey, Corey Nakatani, even  though they were in high gear on the far outside.  </P> <P> "Turning for home, I thought we might be too far back," Nakatani said. "But  this horse has a tremendous finishing kick."  </P> <P> In Excess was on the lead then, having passed Marquetry, who set the pace from  the start. In Excess also weakened and Septieme Ciel, who had trouble getting  through on the turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole.  </P> <P> Nakatani had his mount perfectly timed for the wire, but Septieme Ciel, making  his first start in the United States, was hanging on stubbornly.  </P> <P> Kent Desormeaux, riding Septieme Ciel because Laffit Pincay suffered a broken  collarbone in a spill last Thursday, was whipping left-handed and he and his  colt came over to bump with Itsallgreektome. The horses came off of each other,  then bumped again shortly before the finish.  </P> <P> Desormeaux claimed foul, but the stewards allowed the finish to stand. "The  first time we bumped, my horse changed his lead (foot)," Desormeaux said. "Then  he got to trying to head off the other horse again. The second bump, he was  intimidated and lost his drive."  </P> <P> After watching the head-on replay angle, which the stewards used to help them  with their decision, Desormeaux said: "I came out a certain extent. But my  horse was jostled. His legs almost went out from underneath him at one point."  </P> <P> While Nakatani explained the race from his viewpoint in the jockeys' room,  Desormeaux went by and said: "That horse of yours is one game son of a gun."  </P> <P> They were rivals for a few minutes with big money on the line Sunday, but  usually these two jockeys are friends. Desormeaux's wife, Sonia, was the  baby-sitter for Nakatani's daughter when Nakatani went back to ride  Itsallgreektome in the Breeders' Cup Mile two weeks ago. Nakatani's wife,  Michelle, is Dollase's daughter.  </P> <P> "The other horse was getting hit left-handed and drifted out toward my horse,"  Nakatani said of the stretch run. "My horse just reacted. We bumped twice, and  I had to grab my horse by the head to keep him off the other horse."  </P> <P> Septieme Ciel, who won carrying 138 pounds in France in his last start, was at  equal weights with Itsallgreektome, 122 pounds apiece. The 3-year-old son of  Seattle Slew finished two lengths ahead of Anshan, another European invader,  and it was another 1 3/4 lengths back to In Excess, with the late- running  Silver Ending finishing fifth. Late money on In Excess made him the slight  favorite and Itsallgreektome, timed in 1:46 3/5, a fifth of a second off the  stakes record, wound up the second choice and paid $7.60 to win.  </P> <P> "This proves that the horse is genuine," Dollase said. "I was worried about him  coming back so soon after the Breeders' Cup, but he was touting me about a week  after he got off the airplane. He was just bouncing around and feeling  terrific."  </P> <P> Dollase thought he got a bargain the day he was able to buy Itsallgreektome in  Lexington, Ky., for $75,000. Had the Sovereign Dancer-Sans Supplement yearling  been offered at one of Keeneland's high-profile sales there, Dollase estimates  that he would have brought twice that price. Also, Dollase said, few people  were aware that Itsallgreektome had the same dam as Big Stanley, another horse  who liked to run.  </P> <P> "This horse has a lot of courage, and he always fires," Dollase said. "He's  always been a lot to handle. They told me when they broke him at Cardiff Stud  that he was like a bucking horse. He'd jump around with all four feet off the  ground."  </P> <P> Itsallgreektome's first five races were on dirt, and since being introduced to  grass in the Spotlight at Hollywood Park last May, he's finished first four  times and had three seconds and a third in eight starts.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Derby was Itsallgreektome's third race in about six weeks and  he's going to get a rest until next year. Dollase indicated that the people  behind him need a rest, too. This is a horse who is as hard on his handlers as  he is on himself.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Septieme Ciel is now the property of a syndicate that includes R.D. Hubbard and  he will race as a 4-year-old for his new American trainer, Richard Mandella.  "He ran a tremendous race," said Criquette Head, who saddled him for the last  time on Sunday. "I just wish we could have run him in the Breeders' Cup  (Mile)), because that's his best distance. Today he kept fighting and never  quit.". . . Anshan, saddled by John Gosden, the former California trainer who  now works in England, is staying in America and will be trained by Charlie  Whittingham. On Sunday he was ridden by Chris McCarron, who failed for the 15th  time in trying to win a Hollywood Derby.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Park stewards have not heard from Pat Valenzuela in the week  they've given him to explain another absence from riding last weekend.  Valenzuela, who was suspended for 30 days after testing positive for cocaine  late last year, has until today to report to the stewards. There were reports  at Hollywood Park Sunday that Valenzuela's attorney may meet with the stewards  today. . . . Hollywood has a holiday program scheduled today. . . . Alex Solis  rode three winners Sunday while Gary Stevens and Jose Santos, battling for the  national money title, were both blanked. Stevens gained about $21,000 on Santos  with two second-place finishes and has a lead of about $786,000.  </P></p>

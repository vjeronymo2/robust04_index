			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY FORFEITS FINAL 2 GAMES; INELIGIBILITY OF PLAYERS CITED  </P> <P> The Valley College basketball team, which forfeited a Western State Conference  game against Glendale on Wednesday because only four players showed up on time,  also will forfeit its two remaining games, Valley Athletic Director George Goff  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Goff said that the decision not to complete the season was made after a review  of academic records from the first semester revealed poor attendance and  failing grades for several players that would have made them ineligible.  </P> <P> "There's no alternative," said Goff, who could not recall a similar situation  involving a team sport at Valley during his 17 years as athletic director. "The  only thing you could do is get some people from the football team, but that  wouldn't be putting forward a worthwhile program. It's a sad situation, but  that's the way it is."  </P> <P> Valley Coach Jim Stephens said that despite multiple warnings, several of his  players failed to attend classes regularly or show up on time for practices and  games.  </P> <P> Point guard Joey Manliguis left the team last week because of academic problems  and forward Earl Davis became ineligible for not paying his out-of-state  tuition.  </P> <P> Valley had been in contention for a berth in the Southern California regional  playoffs. The Monarchs conclude the season 17-15 overall and 7-8 in conference  play.  </P> <P> "It's sad and disappointing for everyone concerned but at this point it's the  only answer," Stephens said. "It was my 27th season in coaching and it was a  big lesson for me."  </P> <P> Freshman guard Tory Stephens, the team leader in scoring, said that some of his  teammates' problems were caused by a lack of transportation from their homes in  Los Angeles to the Van Nuys campus.  </P> <P> "I feel bad for the sophomores because it was their last year," he said. "But  coach was tired of putting up with people's . . . I can understand where he's  coming from because there was a lot of stuff that went on this season."  </P> <P> Valley-area junior college coaches said the problems that plagued Valley this  season are indicative of the struggle faced by many programs.  </P> <P> "It's a never-ending battle," said Canyons Coach Lee Smelser, whose team was  supposed to play Valley on Monday. "We try to communicate the need to get it  done in the classroom as best we can. The kids have to accept some of the  responsibility."  </P> <P> Said Glendale's Brian Beauchemin: "Kids are at junior colleges because they  have academic or athletic shortcomings. The kids that do well understand where  they're at and work to get better. Those who don't overestimate their abilities  and they have trouble."  </P> <P> Goff said that the basketball program would return next season and that he  hopes returning and incoming players will learn a lesson from Thursday's  decision.  </P> <P> "If you're at a place like USC and you've got scholarships, you can start  wheeling a mallet around," Goff said. "It's a little tougher in the JCs.  </P> <P> "These kids are already getting a second chance athletic-wise or academic-wise.  How many chances can you get?"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By James Hardy, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] European countries pressing for greater state  interference in economic and social issues were today given a  blunt "hands off" warning by Treasury Chief Secretary Michael  Portillo. He said government intervention was damaging to  individual freedom and economic efficiency.    Mr Portillo's comments to Spanish business leaders in  Barcelona were being seen at Westminster as a veiled message to  Brussels bureaucrats to back away from their long tradition of  greater centralisation and regulation. He said governments  should confine themselves to creating conditions which helped  ordinary citizens generate wealth for their countries.    Pressure to block free trade through protectionism presented  particularly grave dangers to prosperity. "It has recently  been argued that the free market is a jungle to be tamed by  governments -- it is at least as plausible to argue that  governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market," he  said.    The majority of emerging democracies were embracing free  market principles of deregulation, competition, privatisation  and low tariffs on imports. "They see the connection between  economic freedom and political freedom clearly. So must we,"  said Mr Portillo.    "We must apply our understanding of the link to our trade  policy. That is a difficult challenge for European governments.  We must be suspicious of arguments that urge us to impede  trade in order to drive up health and safety standards or  environmental standards in developing countries."    European experience showed the wealth of nations was best  increased through trade between them. ``We want to see a  free-trading Europe as a prelude to ever-increasing global free  trade. There would be no sense in creating the Single European  Market if we are not going to extend its principles globally.    ``The arguments that apply to individual nations apply to  Europe as a whole. If we surround ourselves with barriers to  trade, we shall saddle our consumers with higher prices and our  productive industries with dead wood. To be a good European you  have to know that there is a world beyond Europe.''</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Russia aids ailing industries with cheap Pounds 1.4bn loan President Boris Yeltsin has granted Rbs3,500bn (about Pounds 1.4bn) in low interest loans to aid Russian industry, raising doubts about the government's ability to confront loss-making enterprises and to keep spending limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund earlier this year. A decree issued late on Thursday just before Mr Yeltsin left on a tour of the Volga region says the funds are to be divided between the defence sector and 'investments' in heavy industry. The ambiguously worded decree instructs the central bank to issue government credits at one quarter of the prime lending rate. 'It is very disconcerting,' an official from a western financial institution said yesterday. IMF economists are examining the decree, which western analysts fear will be the first of many in a continuing but futile attempt to bail out ailing companies. About Rbs200bn is to be lent to the defence sector and Rbs400bn is earmarked for industrial investment in the third quarter of 1994. An additional Rbs900bn is to be lent by the government to the defence industry and Rbs2,000bn is to be lent for investment in the fourth quarter of this year. The low interest loans are the Russian government's most decisive step to date in tackling the mounting corporate debts which threaten to overwhelm the Russian economy. But it remains unclear whether the government will be prepared to tackle the loss-making factories by allowing them to fail. Mr Oleg Soskovets, deputy prime minister and head of a special commission established last week to deal with the inter-enterprise debt issue, yesterday estimated the crippling debt burden at Rbs87,800bn. 'The question of inter-enterprise debt cannot be solved through the issue of credit,' Mr Soskovets said. However, he said 'we should, of course, make an exception for defence industries'. Debts have mounted as companies have failed to pay suppliers, and the problem has worsened since the government tightened credit after its spring agreement with the IMF. In some cases, companies have been unable to pay their workers, raising the prospect of social unrest. One western financial official said of the debt: 'It clearly cannot be allowed to go on because otherwise it could lead to a total collapse of the Russian economy.' Mr Yeltsin's decree is a sign that the government may be departing from the market reform path it appeared to choose earlier this year.</p>

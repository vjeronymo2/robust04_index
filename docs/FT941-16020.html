			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / A party labouring to make a point: The UK opposition's struggles to find a long-term strategy to beat the Tories Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, looked more than usually buoyant as parliament reassembled yesterday after the Christmas recess. No wonder. Mr Smith knows that Labour's big chance may have arrived. After coming close to disintegration over during last year's debate over the Maastricht treaty on European integration, the government shows further signs of tearing itself apart in a tortuous debate over private morality. Adultery is not an issue on which elections are won or lost. But trust may be. No one in the shadow cabinet is making public comments on Conservative morals. But no one needs to. Every time Mr Smith tells the voters that they cannot trust to Tories on tax, the message is clear: you cannot trust their morals either. Mr Tony Blair, one of Labour's rising stars, puts it succinctly. 'Back to Basics' - the government's campaign for a return to traditional family values - has, he says, 'opened a gaping crack right at the centre of the government. As a result, the Tories are now incapable as a party of providing the sense of direction and cohesion that our country needs.' From Labour's point of view, the furore could hardly have erupted at a better time. A year and a half ago, amid a deep UK recession, it lost a general election it was confident of winning. Since then Labour has struggled to formulate a set of policy ideas capable of preventing a fifth successive Conservative victory at the next election, due by 1997. But an opportunity to exploit the enemy's mistakes is one thing. Does Labour have the intellectual confidence - and the stomach - to sustain a long-term offensive against the government? Mr Smith tried to demonstrate Labour's fighting spirit at the end of the last session by withdrawing parliamentary co-operation with the Conservatives, ostensibly because the government guillotined debate on its statutory sick pay and national insurance contributions bills. Few MPs accept Mr Smith's assertion that his motive is to defend Parliament against an arrogant government. After all, Mr Michael Foot, leader of the Commons in Mr James Callaghan's Labour administration in the late 1970s, once cut short debate on five bills in a day. The cynical view in the bars and tea rooms at Westminster is that the non-co-operation campaign was launched as a smokescreen to hide the opposition's procedural incompetence during December's Budget debate, when Labour's treasury team missed a prime chance to embarrass the government: it failed to table an amendment to government plans to impose value added tax on heating fuel. 'This is an artificial row,' says a Conservative whip. 'I've been here during real rows when Labour MPs have been snarling at us in the corridors. Nothing like that is happening at the moment; they are all smiles - when they bother to turn up.' This is not Tory hyperbole. Commons records show that more than 190 of the 200 MPs with the best voting records are Conservatives. With the exception of a handful of zealots like Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwing 'Beast of Bolsover', Labour MPs are largely going through the motions of challenging the government and, after 14 years in opposition, many say that morale is at best mediocre. There have been successes. Mr Smith and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, have plugged away on the theme of broken promises. Mr Major has been pushed on the defensive when explaining why the government promised at the election not to increase taxes, and then did so. Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, has reversed Labour's traditionally poor image on fighting crime with his promise to be tough on criminals as well as the causes of crime. At the same time, Mr John Prescott successfully attacked the government's road-building plans as shadow transport secretary, and shows signs of being effective in his new role as shadow employment secretary. Mr Robin Cook, trade and industry spokesman, has shown that the government can be rattled on economic policy - he has even provoked Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to intervene in his Commons speeches. All of this has had some effect. The party has led the Conservatives in the opinion polls for more than a year. At times it has had the support of more than 45 per cent of voters. But few at Westminster take the polls too seriously. Labour enjoyed a similar lead two years before the last election, only to see it melt away as polling day approached. To stay ahead, Labour will have to convey a positive message, and it is failing to do so. All oppositions find it difficult to get their message across. But Labour has a different problem. It has, almost literally, no message to sell. To some extent, this is deliberate. Almost the first decision taken by Mr Smith when he replaced Mr Neil Kinnock was to ditch the policies on which the last election was fought. The strategy is intended to free the party from its historical baggage. After the battles of the Kinnock years, fraught with fratricidal clashes over unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalisation and taxation, Labour needed a rest. In internal party terms, the policy review launched by Mr Smith has served its purpose. Arguments about economic and social policy have been kicked into touch. The simmering divisions between the party's modernist and traditionalist wings have been cooled, or at least been papered over. But the divisions have not disappeared. They surfaced during the debate on the Sunday trading bill in December. Traditionalists argued for tight restrictions to defend shopworkers; modernists argued for greater individual freedom, particularly for working women. There was an ugly moment after the vote when Mr Skinner delivered an angry lecture on working class solidarity to Mr Blair, the prototype modernist. Other currents are swirling around Mr Smith. More than 30 MPs have joined the Full Employment group, set up by Mr Bryan Gould, a former trade and industry spokesman, to campaign for a return to explicitly Keynesian economic policies. The Social Justice Commission, set up to develop a fresh social policy framework, has provoked unrest with modernist interim reports which, for instance, have hinted that universal child benefit might not be retained by a Labour government. Labour leaders argue that the review process has enabled the party to avoid committing itself to detailed policies of the sort which, arguably, cost it the last election. Even cabinet ministers concede privately that Mr Smith is right to keep his powder dry. That way, he will retain the room to manoeuvre in changing circumstances which was denied to Mr Kinnock in 1992. But the review is not confined to details. Its scope is so wide that the party no longer has an ideological framework within which its spokesmen can operate with confidence. A leading moderate says: 'What does the party stand for? I don't know, and I don't believe anyone else does either.' For the time being, Labour has a hole where the policy should be, and it shows. Every time a Labour spokesman stands up to criticise the government, the response is the same: what would you do, and how would you pay for it? These are questions Labour cannot answer. 'Back to Basics' has given Labour some much needed ammunition. But some senior party figures fear that the party will need to do more than exploit Tory peccadilloes if it is to return to power. And the issue of trust, they warn, may be a double-edged sword. 'The party is bland,' says one. 'Smith's strategy is not to upset anyone and to hope for the best. But the truth is that the public don't trust us, and they won't until we offer a real alternative. That is the only way we can win; that is what people voted for in 1945 and 1963 (Labour election victory years), even though it didn't necessarily turn out that way.'</p>

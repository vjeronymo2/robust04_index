The creation of  several blocs has already been announced, and for the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation they have prepared alliances  with "Russia's Choice" and the Liberal Democratic Party. But  what is happening in reality?    [Kuptsov] It is too soon to talk about blocs and factions.  A great deal of serious preparatory work is going on. Deputies  are working in temporary commissions preparing for the first  days of the sessions and agreeing working questions -- on the  procedure for forming factions, refining the standing orders,  and carrying out consultations on the leadership of standing  committees and commissions.    [Nikiforova] Valentin Aleksandrovich, many deputies are  taking their seats in parliament for the first time. Won't they  prove powerless to resolve state questions?    [Kuptsov] We have taken account of this; that is why we are  holding a seminar for our deputies 8 January. There we will  give advice on the forms of participation in State Duma  committees and commissions.    [Nikiforova] An all-Russia day of action by left-wing forces  "For the Restoration of Legality and Civil Peace in the Country"  has been appointed for 9 January. What is this?    [Kuptsov] It was initiated by our party organizations. It  will be held differently in different places: meetings with  deputies, passing on voters' mandates to them. People will meet  in clubs and culture centers and at rallies.    [Nikifirova] Where will our deputies be living?    [Kuptsov] For the time being, in the "Rossiya" Hotel. But  no one is there to meet them, and there is no transport. We  hope that these are temporary difficulties.</p>

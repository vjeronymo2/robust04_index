			<p>BFN     [Text] We have learned that in Kinshasa seven  candidates--seven candidates have presented themselves for  election as prime minister of the transition. Of these seven  candidates, the name of Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba does not  appear on the list. All candidates were given 48 hours from 11  June to campaign for their election. The elections themselves  will take place tomorrow, 13 June 1994, at the level of the High  Council of the Republic, the transitional parliament, which will  hold a collective plenary session (?for) the seven [word  indistinct] candidates from the moderate opposition.</p>

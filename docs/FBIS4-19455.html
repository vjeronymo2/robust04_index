			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by Nino </F> Sunseri in Milan on 17 April: "A Broader Majority and New Rules  in the Senate"]    [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Sunseri] Mr. Speaker,  you will now have to take part in and, above all, umpire rather  more complicated "matches" than a soccer game. Your own  election, for example, was a complex contest, do you agree?    [Scognamiglio] I believe that two lessons can be drawn from  the uncertainty surrounding my election as speaker of the  Senate. One is political in nature, and the other technical.  These are serious issues that must be tackled and solved.    [Sunseri] Let us start from the first. Which is the  political issue?    [Scognamiglio] The political problem is no doubt linked to  the majority's enlargement. It seems obvious to me that the  existing majority is too puny, at least in the Senate, to enable  the country to be governed acceptably. I am concerned about  what may happen when important laws, such as the finance bill or  the budget, have to be passed. There is the risk that the  legislative system may become paralyzed, which would certainly  not do Italy any good.    [Sunseri] Do you have any proposals to make concerning the  enlargement of the majority?    [Scognamiglio] It is not up to me to make any operational  proposals. It is a task for politicians, and I am not a  politician but a professor. I have now been elected Senate  speaker, and it is my duty to make it function properly.  However, I believe that reaching broader agreements is  essential to avoid the danger of paralysis.    [Sunseri] However, your own appointment, which was secured  in  such an aggressive fashion, certainly does not help in seeking  broader agreements, do you not agree?    [Scognamiglio] What you are saying does not seem very  accurate to me. My election was not secured by forcing the  situation, but rather, it resulted from an act of clarity. A  candidacy was submitted, and then consensus was sought. The  candidacy obtained the necessary support, and was therefore  approved. I find nothing abnormal in such a procedure.    [Sunseri] But how do you feel being the speaker of a house  which is split down the middle, and in which your name prevailed  only by a single vote?    [Scognamiglio] I feel fine. I will be the speaker for all  the senators, not only of those who voted for me. I think  calling me only a half-speaker does not do justice to the real  situation. A vote was taken, and this led to a result.  Everything took place by the book, and it is pointless to dwell  on whether the majority was achieved by one vote or one hundred.  We must now forget this. I feel I represent all the senators,  and that it is my task to ensure that the assembly can function  fully.    [Sunseri] However, without a majority it will be difficult.    [Scognamiglio] Of course. This is why I favor seeking new  alliances. This, however, is not my task. My duty is to  safeguard the institution. Politicians must muster the  necessary consensus to ensure that the country can be governed.    [Sunseri] Earlier on, apart from the political aspect, you  were mentioning a technical problem. Does the Bocconi [Milan  University] professor intend to apply his theories to the  government institutions?    [Scognamiglio] The problem is very simple. The Senate's  organization was set up on the basis of the old proportional  law. Now it has been elected through a majority system.  Clearly, changes must be introduced to take account of this  fundamental difference. Once upon a time, agreements were  reached behind closed doors, which today, however, must be  opened. I am committed to this goal, and will not pursue it  alone. I will seek agreement with all other collegiate bodies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament May 24 SAPA -- Newly elected chairman of  South Africa's Constitutional Assembly Mr Cyril Ramaphosa  dedicated himself on Tuesday to the "monumental" task of  drafting the new constitution that would have to reinforce  reconstruction and development aspirations, and help achieve  lasting peace.    ANC Secretary-General Mr Ramaphosa, 41, who was elected  unopposed by a joint sitting of the 400-member National Assembly  and the 90 member Senate, will oversee the two-year process  which is to draw up the country's final constitution. Former  minister of manpower, National Party MP Mr Leon Wessels, was  elected his deputy. Neither nomination was opposed.    Speaking to the 490-member Assembly immediately after his  unopposed election, Mr Ramaphosa said he was eager to get down  to the task.    When Senate President Mr Kobie Coetsee, who oversaw the  election, announced that Mr Ramaphosa had been duly elected, all  the members of the Assembly, except for a handful of Freedom  Front MPs, rose to their feet and applauded.    After being escorted to the presiding officer's seat, Mr  Ramaphosa shook Mr Coetsee's hand and took the chair.    He told the Assembly that its inaugural meeting was the  culmination of many bitter struggles waged by "the mass of our  people" to install democratic rule in South Africa.    It was also the embodiment of a vision now shared by many  South Africans that the final constitution should be drafted by  an elected body of men and women to realise the long-cherished  dream that the people should govern.    The Constitutional Assembly gave the country prestige and  raised hopes that the task of broadening and deepening democracy  in South Africa would indeed be accomplished.    The Assembly had a historic and important task, Mr Ramaphosa  said. The constitution would have to reinforce the aspirations  of all South Africans on the matters of reconstruction and  development, would have to enhance national unity and  reconciliation, and help achieve lasting peace. "It is a  document that must spell out the fundamental principles by which  we as South Africans want to be governed," he said.    He regarded it as a great honour as well as a formidable  challenge to be elected to chair the Assembly charged with such  an important task, and undertook to perform his duties in a  spirit of fairness and openness so that South Africans as a  whole could see that their parliamentarians were involved in a  truly transparent process.    He trusted the Assembly's deliberations would be marked by a  spirit of co-operation and good humour. Drafting the document  would entail tough political bargaining, but the quality of the  final product would depend on the intellectual and emotional  balance, the farsightedness and wisdom each of the Assembly's  members were able to bring to the task. "I trust we will not be  found wanting," he said. Those who elected the MPs had reposed  a great deal of trust in them. "We must not and cannot fail,"  he said.    Immediately after Mr Ramaphosa's speech, ANC Chief Whip Mr  Arnold Stofile moved without opposition that Mr Ramaphosa be  empowered to appoint a rules committee for the Assembly, and  that he chair the committee.    Mr Ramaphosa dissolved the Assembly "until further notice".    He was the ANC's chief constitutional negotiator, a former  security detainee, and headed the National Union of Mineworkers  before becoming prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics  in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 OKLAHOMA U. FOOTBALL PLAYERS ACCUSED OF RAPE  </P> <P> Prosecutors charged three Oklahoma football players with first-degree rape  today in an alleged gang rape at a university athletic dormitory.  </P> <P> Nigel Clay, Glen Bell and Bernard Hall are accused of raping a 20-year-old  woman at the dormitory Jan. 21, District Atty. Tully McCoy said.  </P> <P> Clay and Hall were also charged with two counts each of furnishing alcohol to a  minor.  </P> <P> The charges are the result of an investigation into an Edmond woman's report  that she was gang-raped at the athletic dormitory.  </P> <P> None of those charged is a starter for the football team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No More Charges Seen  </P> <P> McCoy said no additional charges are expected from the investigation.  </P> <P> About the same time across town, the university's board of regents adopted a  recommendation that any student athlete charged with a crime be prohibited from  participating in sports at the school while charges are pending.  </P> <P> That was one of a series of recommendations David Swank made in light of the  alleged gang rape and a shooting that occurred recently at the university. All  the recommendations were approved.  </P> <P> In addition to the charges filed today, a football player was accused last  month of shooting and wounding a teammate in an argument in an athletic  dormitory.  </P></p>

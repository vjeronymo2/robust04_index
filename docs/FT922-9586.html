			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cresta slides into Pounds 11.3m loss HEAVY PROVISIONS against potential losses on its property portfolio left Cresta Holdings with a Pounds 16.6m fall for 1991. There is no final dividend. The group has been disposing of its property portfolio and concentrating on its CrestaCare nursing and retirement homes business in the Isle of Man - where it is currently resident  - and the UK. That business increased profit by 53 per cent to Pounds 3.5m, which contributed to a group operating profit of Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 5.44m). But exceptional costs of Pounds 12.6m and heavier interest charges resulted in pre-tax losses of Pounds 11.3m, against a profit of Pounds 5.3m. Losses per share were 15.6p (earnings 9.1p). An interim dividend of 0.7p had been paid (last year's total was 2p). Of the costs Pounds 12.1m represented potential losses on property pending disposal. 'These provisions should protect us against further losses, and the future growth prospects for CrestaCare look set to continue,' claimed Mr Brian O'Connor, chairman. Since the year-end the Northampton development was sold for Pounds 6.3m, along with certain other properties. Realised losses have been fully provided for in the 1991 accounts. Mr O'Connor said CrestaCare had reached its target of 1,400 nursing home beds with the opening of eight new homes over the past 12 months. Expansion was being constrained, however, by the recession which was hampering property disposals. Directors plan to move the company's residence to the UK, where most profits are generated, and change the name to CrestaCare. There will also be a capital reconstruction to eliminate the Pounds 13.6m deficit on revenue reserves.</p>

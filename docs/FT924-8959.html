			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (6): The fast road to the Alps - Stuart Marshall tells you how to avoid hazards when taking your car abroad this winter COMPLETION OF two missing motorway links, one in Britain, the other in France, has made driving to ski resorts in the French Alps and Switzerland easier than ever. We can thank the start of work on the Channel Tunnel for the decision to close the M20 gap between Maidstone and Ashford. Disgracefully, this had existed for years after the rest of the motorway between London and (almost) Folkestone had been built. By far the best stepping off point for France is Dover. P &amp; 0 and Sealink Stena have their best and biggest ships on this 75-minute journey. Or try the faster SeaCat, but only if the sea is calm or you have a cast-iron stomach. Dover is now an easy day's drive from any part of Britain on the motorway network. The worst part is from the end of the M20 near Folkestone to Dover docks; the Capel-le-Ferne by-pass which will extend the M20 right into Dover will not be open until next year. But Calais docks are the Western terminal of the A26 autoroute. Within a few minutes of driving off the ferry one can be cruising legally at 80 mph (68 mph in wet weather) toward the slopes. Last summer, the missing 47-mile stretch of the A26 autoroute between Chalons-sur-Marne and Troyes was completed. This has revolutionised travel across France south-eastwards from Calais. No longer does one have to use the lorry-infested A1 between Lille and Paris and the A6 south from Paris. Even better, one can forget all about the notorious boulevard peripherique around Paris which joins the A1 to the A6, rather as our M25 links, say, the M3 and M4 with the M1 and A1(M). To be fair, it was not essential to use it on a north-south journey via Paris if you had a good map and a confident navigator. But most Britons just followed the signs and stuck to the peripherique, with its demon drivers, weaving motorcyclists, poor signposting and frequent hold-ups. Now, you leave Calais and head for Reims, 172 miles and about 2 1/2 hours away. From Reims, the autoroute flows uninterruptedly around Chalons-sur-Marne, Troyes and Dijon to intersect with the A36 and A6 at Beaune. Now it is decision time. If you prefer to stay on the autoroute all the way to resorts in, for example, the Chamonix and Megeve areas - and in winter it has much to recommend it - you must head south on A6 to Macon and then turn east on A40. For Chambery or Grenoble, stay on the A6 until just north of Lyon and then take the A46. This bypasses Lyon to the east and joins with the A43 for Chambery and A48 for Grenoble. The alternative route to Geneva, Chamonix and Megeve from Beaune is by N5 via Dole, Poligny, Champagnole and Morez. It means crossing either the Col de la Givrine or Col de la Faucille. In spite of the best efforts of snowploughs, there is a risk of these passes being blocked when the autoroutes are still open. If in doubt, take the autoroute. It is further and means paying more tolls but probably quicker in the end. Unless the weather is exceptionally severe, you are unlikely to be seriously troubled by snow on the autoroutes. But it is wise to buy or hire a set of tyre chains for use on minor roads and resort areas. Driving to the ski slopes in winter need be nothing more than a routine journey if a few sensible precautions are taken. Make sure your tyres have at least 2mm of pattern all over the tread and are at the right pressure for the load you are carrying. Replace worn wiper blades. Add plenty of the correct kind of antifreeze (not radiator antifreeze) to the screenwash reservoir. Have cans of de-icer and a good scraper. If your car is a diesel, tank up only with winter grade fuel that does not go waxy until the temperature falls below - 20' Celsius. It is available everywhere in France. Take a tip from the Scandinavians and carry a soft brush. After a heavy overnight fall, sweep all the snow off the car before clearing the windows and driving away. Leaving a foot of snow on the roof is dangerous - it can blow off in one great lump and blind the driver of a following car.

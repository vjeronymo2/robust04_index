			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Trimmed McLeod rises 23% to Pounds 6.4m Shares in McLeod Russel rose 10p to 117p yesterday as the group reported increases in operating and pre-tax profits of 57 per cent and 23 per cent respectively for the year to September 30. Profits for the group, which has interests in surface coatings, air filtration, environmental engineering and property investment, grew to Pounds 6.36m (Pounds 5.16m) pre-tax and Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 5.17m) at the operating level. Turnover expanded 24 per cent to Pounds 109.7m (Pounds 88.4m). The year was one of integrating and returning to profit the Wheway businesses, which it acquired in March 1993. Mr Paul Humphreys, finance director, said: 'We have done a reasonable job, though there is still some upside to come before we get a full return.' While there had been no huge hidden problems within the lossmaking environmental engineering company, he said the aggregate problems had been greater than expected. He added that McLeod had been accurate on the cash position, but that the profit side had been more difficult. With the aim of reducing the group's overdraft from last time's Pounds 17.8m, McLeod sold most of the non-core businesses. Various 'sundry businesses' had been retained because they took little management time and generated cash and a decent return on capital employed, Mr Humphreys said. However, Blakes Marine Paints had been sold because it was small, in a different market sector, and a trade buyer had made an approach. Losses on disposals were Pounds 490,000, but borrowings were reduced to Pounds 10.5m for gearing of 31 per cent. Mr Humphreys said the pressure was now off that area. Interest payable, however, rose steeply to Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 490,000), reining in the pre-tax advance. Earnings grew by 1p to 8.54p and the final dividend is lifted to 3.45p (3.35p) for a total of 6.2p (6.1p).</p>

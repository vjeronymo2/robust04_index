			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega; from the </F> "Evening Information Review" newscast]    [Text] General Barry McCaffrey, a veteran of many wars, has  just become the new chief of the U.S. Southern Command,  replacing another general, George Joulwan. In his assumption of  command speech, the new chief of this strategic territory stated  among other things that terrorism and drug trafficking continue  to undermine Latin American democracies. One can expect almost  anything from a U.S. general (?on active duty) except that he be  so misinformed. Perhaps, however, McCaffrey's remarks were part  of the profession of faith of the bullheaded U.S. military,  whose only current mission seems to be meddling in the internal  affairs of other countries while always seeking a pretext to  conceal the ploy.    What fundamentally undermines the democracies in America is  the indiscriminate implementation of neoliberal policies that  have plunged the people into edginess over poverty and the  possibility of losing their jobs. Despite being elements of  destabilization, terrorism and drug trafficking have less  bearing on the internal situation of the Latin American nations  than the adjustment plans. Moreover, if indeed drug trafficking  and terrorism stemming from drug trafficking played a key role  in destabilizing governments, countries such as the United  States would carry a large share of the responsibility,  primarily because U.S. drug demand is the greatest in the world.    One really has to read between the lines in McCaffrey's  speech -- mainly when he says his purpose in the Southern  Command is to continue establishing ties of cooperation in the  entire Latin American region to promote and consolidate  security. In general terms, those ties of cooperation take the  form of dispatching U.S. troops from the Southern Command, which  is headquartered in Panama, to various countries. Once there,  they conduct missions of repression, such as the ones conducted  periodically in Bolivia and other nations to eradicate the coca  crop.    More often that not, U.S. soldiers conduct these tasks in  the  company of local troops. This is often a mere formality,  because the one taking the lead in planning the repression is  the U.S. side. In recent years, however, U.S. Army troops have  tried to disguise their interventionist ploys using the pretext  of social assistance -- namely, the construction of bridges and  roads and the repair of this or that rural school, tasks that do  not hide their true intentions. Today, under different  pretexts, U.S. troops are deployed in remote and rugged areas of  Latin American nations. The speech about cooperation does not  deceive anyone today, because the United States has always had  the ambition to control everything in our nations.    In addition, Gen. McCaffrey, whose past is linked to U.S.  military intervention in Vietnam and Iraq, knows he is the  appropriate figure to hold the post of chief of the Southern  Command. Fortunately, the meddling incursions of the U.S.  military from the Southern Command will exist for only five more  years, because on 31 December 1999, the Torrijos-Carter treaties  signed in 1977 should begin to take effect, which will put an  end to the U.S. presence in Panama and will return the nation's  interoceanic waterway to the Panamanians.</p>

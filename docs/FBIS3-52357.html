Lord Archer, better known as the novelist Jeffrey Archer,  arrived at the head of an eight-member delegation including  Catherine Royal, head of the Foreign Office's Iraq desk. They  plan to stay in the region for five days. He will address the  parliament in Irbil on Wednesday and deliver a message from  Major, whose contents he did not disclose. The delegation was  staying Tuesday at the allied military coordination centre in  Zakho.    Lord Archer said he wanted to see how the situation in  Kurdistan had developed since his last visit a year ago, and to  discuss aid. The Kurds set up their own government and  parliament in northern Iraq after the Gulf war and are protected  by allied warplanes patrolling an "exclusion zone" closed to  President Saddam Husayn's aircraft.</p>

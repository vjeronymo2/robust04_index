			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious result if deferred tax provided for on discounted basis Sir, Lex refers to the possibility of establishing deferred tax provision on a discounted basis ('Deferred tax', September 28). The wind is already blowing in that direction. In the furore over the provisioning aspects of FRS7, many people may not have noticed its reference to the discounting of long-term monetary items. It does not actually say that it should apply to deferred tax, but this is the implication. However, until deferred tax is put on to a more rational basis, this could lead to the rather curious result that deferred tax provisions would be discounted if they come with an acquisition, but not if they are internally generated.

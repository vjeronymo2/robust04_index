They  will be used for the reconstruction of cities and villages  destroyed in 1988 by the catastrophic earthquake. The  Association for International Development approved the plan for  this work.    The republic's Ministry of Economics advised us that in one  and a half years the credits granted will help to provide  apartments for more than 2,000 families, which suffered from the  calamity, to complete the construction of seven plants, and to  improve the sanitary and epidemiological living conditions of  the population of half a million, which to this day lives in  small vans and temporary housing. A network of service lines and  new domestic service institutions will appear.    Credits were granted on very favorable terms for 35 years.</p>

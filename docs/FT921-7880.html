			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credit doubts hit US grain futures US GRAIN futures prices fell yesterday as trader scepticism set in about more US agricultural credits to Russia and the weather looked favourable for winter wheat. Prices for maize and soyabeans had risen on Tuesday because of the announcement that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, had requested another Dollars 600m in agricultural credits from Washington. It was believed that the Russians would be primarily interested in these feed grains. But by mid-morning yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade, maize had fallen by 1 cent in the March and May contracts, to Dollars 2.62 3/4 and Dollars 2.70 1/2 , and soyabeans have dropped by  3/4 cents and 1 3/4 cents in its March and May contracts, to Dollars 5.71 3/4 and Dollars 5.80 3/4 . Grain analysts in Chicago said they doubted that Washington would be quick to agree to fresh credits for Moscow. They expect that the US government will wait to see if the Russians keep up with their hard currency payments in March on previous loans. There was also uncertainty about Mr Yeltsin's political longevity. 'There is caution about how to trade this information (about Russian credits),' said Mr Steve Freed, a grain analyst with Dean Witter. Wheat futures took a bigger fall, dipping 5 cents for the spot month of March to Dollars 4.065 and by 4.5 cents to Dollars 4.04 for the May contract. Traders had been expecting an Artic blast in the upper Midwest, which would have potentially damaged winter wheat. But warm, moist weather, which will help the crops, settled in the region.</p>

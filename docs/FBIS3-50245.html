			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian rightist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  president and deputy of the Liberal Democratic Party, will  arrive in Slovenia on Thursday [27 January]. We have learned  that Zhirinovskiy has officially applied for the entry visa,  which he will also be granted. For the time being it is not  known whether the Slovene politicians have coordinated their  views about this visit. In connection with the claim that  Zhirinovskiy has allegedly sent a letter to some Slovene  political institutions informing them of the visit, the Foreign  Ministry says that this is not the case and that the Foreign  Ministry has received no such letter. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is  expected to remain in Slovenia until 1 February. He will be  staying in Bled where he will be joined by sympathizers from all  over Europe.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Arts: More beast than beauty - Opera/Film The theme of transformation is central to Cocteau's magical film La Belle et la bete. Not only does the Beast turn into a Prince, his castle is also alive with statues that become human, invisible hands that open doors and jewels that turn into worthless trinkets. Now the composer Philip Glass has endeavoured to make his own transformation of the film. Last week's 'Meltdown' festival on the South Bank brought film and music together as part of its theme of new work in the arts crossing boundaries. Glass's re-working of La Belle et la bete is almost impossible to classify. He calls it a 'live opera/film event', the programme an 'opera for ensemble and film'. What it involves is as follows. The Cocteau film (its original un-edited version) is shown on a big screen, but without its soundtrack. A quartet of singers sing the words that would have been spoken by the actors and a small ensemble combining keyboards and saxophones provides the live accompaniment. This showing was billed as part of the 'world premiere tour', but the conductor, Michael Riesman, seemed practised at keeping the music in sync with the film. As in Nyman's film scores (so fashionable of late) the constant motor rhythms of the minimalist school can become wearing over a film's unbroken hour-and-a-half duration. Glass varies the pace more, but still not enough. In the intimate encounters between Beauty and the Beast one longed for the repeated chords to relax their pulse just for a few minutes. Otherwise Glass has put together an atmospheric score, which captures the grand guignol fantasy of the film. Whirling upward scales set the mood, underpinned by ominous rumbling bass lines; bells peal along the chateau's dark corridors, their ring electronically twisted into the shriek of ravens. Unfortunately the amplification of the music drowned the singers' words. Like most multimedia events, La Belle et la bete falls between two stools. As a straight opera, there is probably not enough interest in its vocal writing. Whether there is any future in opera/film as a medium beyond this one-off exercise is another question again.</p>

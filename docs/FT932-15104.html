			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / People: Alas ..poor Warwick Colin Mayer is returning to Oxford for the second time since his undergraduate days, this time as Peter Moores professor of management studies, a flagship post for the university's new business school. It was only at the beginning of this academic year that Mayer took up the chair of economics and finance at Warwick; but he says that the Oxford position was 'made available a bit earlier' than expected. There will be some overlap in the jobs, as he has agreed to see out his responsibilities at Warwick for the next academic year as well, while formally starting in Oxford next April. As deputy director responsible for the school's academic development, he will report to the director of the School of Management Studies, Clark Brundin. The two have crossed paths before; when Mayer read engineering science and economics, Brundin was one of the lecturers; later, when Mayer was appointed to the Warwick job, Brundin was vice-chancellor. Of the Warwick connection, Brundin comments: 'It was genuinely pure coincidence. I chaired the committee that appointed him to Warwick, but it is not proper to go headhunting in one's old institution.' Instead Mayer's name was put forward by a member of the electoral board. Mayer, 39, worked in the Treasury for two years before taking up a fellowship at St Anne's College, Oxford. More recently he was professor of corporate finance at City University. He has researched extensively into the effect of financial systems on corporate activity, and says he is shifting focus now more towards relations between companies - cross-shareholdings and the like. Aside from research, he sees his new role as 'attracting the very best academics and helping to design first-rate courses'. Oxford is now looking for a deputy director in charge of the MBA programme, at Reader level.</p>

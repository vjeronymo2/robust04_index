			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Hard choices for Germany CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl did not promise that German unity would be a bed of roses. Two years ago, he warned that the eastern and western halves of the country faced a 'fatal, if not catastrophic' risk of being divided by the economic pressures of unity. The prescience of that warning now looks remarkable - as does the chancellor's insouciance in not taking better heed of it. Mr Kohl's greatest mistake was in telling Germans in the east that the economic benefits of unification would become apparent relatively quickly, and in promising Germans in the west that the benefits would be generated without additional taxes. Neither forecast proved correct. To make unification a success, Germany will need to maintain public sector transfers from west to east of at least DM100bn (Pounds 35.8bn) a year until the end of the decade. The monetary strains caused by high German public sector deficits are exporting deflation throughout Europe, and are now raising the risk of recession at home too. To prevent further damage, Mr Kohl has no choice but to organise a sounder method for financing recovery. The 'solidarity pact' he is trying to negotiate with industry, trade unions and the opposition Social Democrats is a worthwhile effort to spread the burdens. All participants, however, face some hard choices. This time, they must not be shirked. First, significant reductions in the central government budget deficit during the next few years will not be possible without specific measures to raise extra revenues. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is relying above all on spending curbs to reduce the deficit by 1995. But, in a bleaker economic climate, the assumptions underpinning these plans could soon look unrealistic. Mr Waigel may be able to avoid an across-the-board tax increase of the sort temporarily put into effect in 1991-92. But he urgently needs to take charge of a cacophonous debate about alternative financing sources. A plan for a compulsory bond to tap the better-off, launched by the subtle mind of Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the conservative parliamentary floor leader, has been brushed aside for the moment, but Mr Waigel may have to give it serious thought. Second, wage restraint in both east and west Germany is now high on the agenda. Excessive wage increases in east Germany have been a prime factor spurring high unemployment there. Trade union agreement to shelve the accord to bring pay for east German metalworkers up to west German levels by 1994 should be an important part of any 'solidarity pact'. If the price for this agreement is higher taxes in the west, then this price is worth paying. Third, Mr Waigel must clear up the opacity caused by multiple 'shadow budgets' for unity financing established during the last two years. Worries about fast rising public indebtedness will not be assuaged as long as doubts persist over the size of the debts being created in the east which will eventually be borne by central government. In trying to form a cohesive policy to master Germany's challenges, Mr Kohl cannot avoid some degree of understanding with the Social Democrats. Without this, much-needed restructuring of the financial system for distributing resources around the 16 German lander will be impossible. An SPD imprimatur will also be necessary for any deal with the unions. The Social Democrats, resentful at Mr Kohl's high-handedness towards them during the unity negotiations two years ago, are in no mood to bargain away cheaply support for an unpopular government. Mr Kohl refuses to have any truck with the idea of a Grand Coalition with the SPD, and the Social Democrats themselves are still in the preliminary phase of weighing up the benefits and disadvantages. Yet if Germany's difficulties persist, power-sharing between the two main parties, at some stage before the 1994 general election, may prove to be the only way to forge a national consensus.</p>

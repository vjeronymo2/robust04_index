			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Austrian group plans Sch3bn issue Mayr-Melnhof (MM), a family owned Austrian company and one of Europe's leading carton and packaging companies, plans to raise about Sch3bn (Dollars 250m) through a share issue early in the spring, Mr Michael Groller, chief board executive, said yesterday. The Mayr-Melnhof family will keep a two-thirds stake after the flotation which is expected to take place in April with Morgan Stanley as international lead managers and Creditanstalt Bankverein, the Austrian bank, as domestic managers. The shares will be offered to investors in western Europe and the US, and will be listed on the Vienna Borse. The proceeds will finance acquisitions in Europe. 'The industry is going through a process of concentration. We have two options. We can either be a local niche producer or build up our strength in Europe,' said Mr Alfred Fogarassy, board member.</p>

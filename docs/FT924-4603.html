			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (2): After-hours Globex has yet to live up to its promise - Volumes continue to expand, but the growth of the two huge futures exchanges has been dwarfed by foreign rivals THE WORLD's two largest futures markets, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), have put the city on the world's financial map. The two exchanges have experienced over 200 per cent growth during the past decade; and, along with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the world's largest options market, they account for the largest portion anywhere of international trade in exchange-traded derivatives. In the process, they have attracted financial firms from around the globe, and generated thousands of jobs and millions of dollar in revenue for the city. While their volumes continue to expand, their growth has been dwarfed by foreign rivals. Global competition and maturing markets are denting the exchanges' margins, and have forced them to initiate new product strategies. Chicago exchanges still trade commodities, but their bread-and-butter is financial instruments. Their foreign currency, debt, and stock index futures cater for a profession of financial engineers who specialise in risk management. Managed money, in the form of pension funds, mutual funds and investment portfolios, is the lifeblood of the pits. That money follows the best returns at the lowest cost, and is indifferent to geography or whether the trade is made on an exchange or over the counter. As managed money sloshes around the globe, more and more of its is settling in overseas futures markets modelled on Chicago. While the CME saw 27.8 per cent volume growth in the first half of 1992, and the CBOT 11.1 per cent, the London International Futures Exchange (Liffe) expanded its trading by 83.9 per cent, and the new Deutsche Terminborse had a 142.8 per cent volume increase. The size of the futures pie grows with each new exchange that opens, but Chicago's share is dwindling. Five years ago, the two Chicago giants commanded 80 per cent of the world market. In 1992 that share is down to about 40 per cent. Chicago's long-awaited global trading weapon, Globex, opened in June after a five-year incubation. The electronic after-hours system, developed as a partnership between the CME, CBOT, and Reuters Holdings, has yet to live up to its promise. Traders ignored the system during Europe's August currency crisis and hurled their trades into Europe's exchanges, generating record volume at Liffe and not even a blip on Globex. On average, daily volume bumps along below 10,000 contracts. At that rate, it will take years for Reuters to recover the estimated Dollars 70m investment it has made in the system. The CBOT has been more direct about answering the foreign incursion. Since 1987, it has run a second shift of bond trading in the evenings, bridging the gap between the regular US and Japanese trading days. Preferring open outcry to screen trading, CBOT executives are negotiating with Liffe for rights to trade UK, German and Italian debt futures in its evening pits. Chicago's exchanges are also domesticating their new competitors' products, with mixed success. The CME's dollar-denominated version of the Nikkei-225 stock index generates about 14,000 contracts a month, but its new FT-SE 100 product has been slow to catch on. The CBOT's stab at a Japanese yen bond contract failed entirely. Closer to home, the CME and the CBOE are betting that new index products, aimed at institutional money managers, will generate business. Sector investing is a hot property on Wall Street. The CBOE recently launched options on a small-stock index called the Russell 2000, and plans an entire portfolio of industry sector indices. The first of these, an index of biotechnology stocks, is already being traded. The CME has created a stable of indexed futures, starting with its S&amp;P 500 futures contract, two foreign stock indices and a new mid-cap index of US stocks. This year it also launched futures on a commodity index compiled by Goldman Sachs and used by some traders to track inflation. The CBOT is branching out in two new and untried lines of business with its proposals to trade futures on emission control permits to be issued by the US government under new clean-air legislation, and its planned catastrophe insurance futures. The first of the insurance futures contracts will be launched on December 11. New regulations governing US futures trading, passed last month, are expected to give the Chicago exchanges additional opportunities to expand the types of product they trade, and the way in which they trade them. In addition to the CBOT, the CME and the CBOE, the city has three other exchange entities that are often overshadowed by their more visible counterparts: The Midwest Stock Exchange, formed in 1882 as the Chicago Stock Exchange, is second only to New York in stock trading volume. An average of 10.5m shares a day pass through the exchange, with about 43 per cent of those block trades of 2,000 shares or more. In addition to stock trading, the MSE has a healthy business clearing trades and providing equity-related trust services. The MSE is also the authorised clearing house for the US mortgage-backed securities industry. Like Chicago's futures exchanges, the MSE sells its trading technology to developing markets overseas. The Options Clearing Corporation, first created to process trades for the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 1973, is now the world's largest clearing organisation for derivative instruments. It matches and guarantees stock options trades and provides high-tech communications to its members. It is jointly owned by the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the Pacific Stock Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, for whom it provides clearing services. The Chicago Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, owned by, but independent of, the Chicago Board of Trade, provides trade clearing and processing services to the futures exchange.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad, </F> by Ye. Chubasheva in St. Petersburg; date not given: "Under the  `Roof' of the Road"]    [Text] Exactly three years ago the only just then  created registration department of the committee for foreign  relations of the Saint Petersburg municipal council registered  the first joint venture. Now there are more than 7,000 of them  in the city.    Some of them have become strong firms, others--are born  and die like ephemeral butterflies, not having stood up to  competition. Two out of 10 joint ventures have officially  announced their own liquidation.    The October Railroad is one of the region's leaders  with respect to the number of joint-stock company and joint  venture institutions. A. Zaytsev, chief of the October Railroad,  tells about this sphere of activity.    [Chubasheva] About 50 joint ventures and joint-stock  companies are under the railroad's "roof." What will they give  the mainline?    [Zaytsev] They will make it possible to survive. The  railroads remain state enterprises in the Ministry of Railways  system. However, they are forced to operate within the framework  of market relationships. Previously the government always set  the prices for the services of the roads but it also ensured  their vital activity and supplied the cars and locomotives,  cross ties and fuel... Now the Ministry of Railways has been  left not only without funds but also without plants. We get  nothing in a centralized fashion. The Riga Electric Car Building  Plant, the Poltava Diesel Locomotive Repair Plant, and others  have found themselves beyond the border.    The Russian High-Speed Mainlines Joint-Stock Company is  building the high-speed Moscow--Saint Petersburg road. The  Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company is engaged in work on the  Vacha--Kochkoma border section, which will connect Karelia with  Finland by the shortest route. Passenger cars are being made in  the Tverskoy zavod Joint-Stock Company. The Torzhok Car Building  Plant Joint-Stock Company has already created the first Russian  Bylina electric trains...    The road participated in the financing and reconstruction of  these and other enterprises and they are already producing.  There are a number of commercial structures in which we have  invested money with the sole purpose of getting income.  Transport operations, especially passenger, do not yield a  profit but on the other hand the road has millions of rubles in  profit from ancillary activity, including from participation in  various commercial structures.    And yet the main goal of this not typical for us activity is  not the money but the necessity to preserve the highest volume  and cheapest for the population form of transportation. This  cheapness, although relative, is long since no longer a  contribution of the government. Subsidies have been abolished  and you won't get compensation payments to cover losses. Today  life has compelled state enterprises to adapt to market  relationships, and to enter into them through the commercial  structures which have been created under their "roof."    Far from all the enterprises into which we have entered and  which we have created ourselves are flourishing. One has had to  take one's share out of 10 joint ventures and the work of  several more doesn't justify our hopes. We have recently left  the structure of the Russian-Italian Furniture Production  Enterprise, which had promised to become highly profitable and  to supply railroad children's institutions with its products.  Here our compatriots have accused their foreign partners of  dishonesty.    There are also positive examples. There is the work of the  Raskom joint venture. The railroad workers, jointly with the  specialists of several US firms, have created a new  communications line, having run it along the supports of the  contact system on the existing Moscow--Petersburg mainline. It  will play a large role in the conducting of the Goodwill Games,  improve the quality of communications in the region, and yield  millions of rubles in profit.    [Chubasheva] The unsinkable "flagships" of our industry such  as Kirovskiy zavod are suffering failure. Why are you, and not  the general director of Kirovets, making an attempt to save its  branch in Tikhvin, Transmash, from bankruptcy through attracting  Austrian technologies there?    [Zaytsev] This is an attempt not to save Transmash but to  protect the October road from collapse. Equipment is needed to  maintain the quality of the tracks. It's time to produce it  ourselves and not to purchase it for foreign currency. There are  no plants in the CIS which produce heavy-duty track machines.  However, there is the potential of the unutilized productive  capacities in Tikhvin. There is the technology of the best in  the world producer of such equipment--the Austrian firm Plasser  and Toyrer [as transliterated]. We have acquired several samples  from it and in the course of periodic talks we have proposed a  variant of the collaboration with Transmash to the guests and  have acquainted them with its possibilities on the spot. This  plant, which previously worked for "defense," has, with the help  of the road's investments, already reorganized a number of its  shops to turn out component parts for the production of electric  trains. We would like to utilize the potential of this  enterprise also in future.    The industry of the region is so varied and developed that  it  is capable of turning out all the necessary technical facilities  for Russian railroads. We look with hope at the Kirovskiy zavod,  which could build general-purpose diesel locomotives. The Czechs  made them previously. Now we have been left without passenger  locomotives. This is not a railroad but a national problem. The  government should intervene now: remove taxes and grant  preferential credits to those enterprises which are being  reconstructed for the needs of transportation--things should get  going.    [Chubasheva] Payment for hauls with commodities is being  used  ever more widely recently. What do you think of this?    [Zaytsev] Payments "in kind" have entered firmly into  practice, incidentally, in the interests of the very enterprises  who are not able to pay for transport operations in money.    It's advantageous to us to receive crushed stone. It's  needed  for repairing the track bed. The Cherepovets Combine has paid  with metal--it comes in handy for manufacturing electric train  bodies.    The Apatit Production Association has owed us 6.5 billion  rubles for transport operations. They propose settling with  products. One would think, why fertilizers for a railroad? But  we'll take it. Otherwise you won't get anything from them. And  we will sell the apatites to the Novgorod Azot Association and  the Voskresensk Mineral Fertilizers Production Plant.    Willy-nilly the railroad has become an unique "sales  service"  for many enterprises. The ties of the railroad people are  extensive and one can find buyers. But who should be engaged in  this? We don't have any specialists in sales. So we are looking  for people and creating structures which would run all these  commercial operations and would find materials the railroad  needs in exchange for those that the non-payers offer us.    Today one can supply all the construction projects which are  underway on the mainline with the materials and equipment being  delivered by debtors. One can even obtain rails and cross ties  not by direct contracts but by having formed a network of  enterprises which have owed one another. For example, contact  wire is already being manufactured at the road's order this  way--our debtors supply the copper to the producer.    "Spin around as you are able. Only don't ask for  anything,"--such has become the position of the Minstry  recently. Quite recently they stigmatized the leaders of the  October Railroad for the fact that we take "in kind" for a haul.  Now they have authorized one even to register the debts  officially as securities--bills of exchange (veksel). All the  railroads are obliged to collect a debt from clients in their  products.    Eurosib (Evrosib), one of the joint-stock companies  organized  on the railroad, is engaged, by the way, in selling metal. And  rather successfully. The last operation yielded a R1.5 billion  profit. Eurosib has contracts with foreign and domestic  clientele engaged in the dispatching of freight. This is a  purely market structure. It gets the money at once and is not  bound by any moral obligations like the railroad, which is  obligated to all to provide transportation, even if it is not  paid for it.    [Chubasheva] But a road can "strangle" a debtor by not  providing cars to the enterprise?    [Zaytsev] Yes, we have received a directive from the  Ministry: conclude a contract with clients and don't provide  cars for loading if the terms are not fulfilled, in particular,  with respect to payment. However, for our actions to be lawful,  it is necessary, at a minimum, to change the Charter of the  railroads in which it is written that at the request of the  enterprises one is to provide them with rolling stock for hauls.    The port workers, for example, are able to not take from us  the cars they have ordered and to dictate whatever they like.  The power engineering people threaten to cut off the  electricity. They all are now bosses. The road has received the  usual refusal of its being made a joint-stock company and cannot  conduct a dialog with them "as an equal." The debts of the  enterprises of the October Railroad have grown already to R100  billion.    [Chubasheva] And in such a situation you are starting new  construction projects and creating new structures?    [Zaytsev] We are electrifying multi-kilometer sections of  the  mainline, for example, Volkhovstroy--Svir, and we are erecting  housing.    [Chubasheva] And the railroad workers ride in Japanese  automobiles. They already know in the city: a Mazda has passed  by--this means, almost for sure, a railroad worker has driven  by. Are you cooperating with this firm?    [Zaytsev] The time when all will ride in automobiles remains  a dream for the present. But we have gambled on one firm from  economic considerations. The very same Eurosib is the official  Mazda dealer in Saint Petersburg. They are selling the  automobiles successfully and have opened a technical service  station. There are about a thousand Mazdas now in the city and  no more do their owners have problems with repair. By using one  brand of machines, the enterprise has completely reorganized the  service park for them. Yes, today we have spent money. But  tomorrow it will be recouped.    I believe in common sense. In the fact that the recession is  not eternal. I believe in the upsurge of the country's economy.  It will come and will require an increase in the volume of  transport operations from the railroads. We must be ready for  this so as not to become a break on the development of  production. That is why we are doing so much today for the  future.</p>

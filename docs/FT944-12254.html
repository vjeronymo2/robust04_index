			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Thames Water buoys up sector - Shareholders can expect generous pay-outs This was always going to be a bumper year for water companies, as they reap the benefits of cost-cutting and enjoy the final stage of generous price limits set in 1989. Yet, as Thames Water opened the sector's interim reporting season yesterday, it appeared this could be a bumper year for shareholders as well. Thames Water's greater than expected 11 per cent increase in its interim dividend, and coyly optimistic views for the full year, have heightened even the most bullish pay-out expectations for the sector as a whole. Previously, analysts had been looking for average dividend increases of about 8 per cent at the half-way stage and earnings growth of about 10 per cent. Last night, the market appeared to have adopted Thames Water's argument that 11 per cent earnings growth justified an equivalent increase in the pay-out. Forecasts for interim dividend growth were revised upwards to about 10 per cent. 'Thames has acted as a pace setter,' said one analyst. 'Provided there isn't too much adverse reaction, some companies may feel comfortable raising the dividend more than they might have envisaged previously.' The rush to share the expected windfall helped to push up the sector's shares by about 2 per cent in a falling market. Some companies benefited significantly more than others from the improved sentiment. Welsh Water was the clear winner, rising 29p to 667p. This company, which has the strongest balance sheet and highest dividend cover, is widely expected to beat the dividend benchmark set by Thames. Ironically, Thames appeared to have been the loser, only one of two companies whose shares actually fell on the day. While some of this could have been due to continuing disappointment on the performance of non-core businesses, there was also the very clear indication that 1994-95 was something of an exceptional year. 'There is good reason to be wary of taking this as a sign of things to come,' said Mr Bill Dale, analyst with SG Warburg, 'with significant constraints re-emerging from next April' when the new pricing regime takes effect. Other aspects of Thames' results are expected to echo through the interim reporting season, which continues with Anglian next week and ends with Wessex Water on December 20. Water companies are expected to emphasise tight control of operating costs and lower capital expenditure. 'The water sector now has the incentive and opportunity to outperform the deals set by Ofwat,' said one analyst. 'We should see the first indications that they will be able to do that.' The knock-on effect of cutting costs is almost certainly going to mean further exceptional charges for some companies. Welsh Water has already indicated charges of some Pounds 17m, with Yorkshire Water also likely to announce exceptionals. South West Water, meanwhile, is forecast to provide about Pounds 2m for the costs of its appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the price limits set by Ofwat. A further Pounds 2m charge is likely for job losses. Diversification - or, rather, the failure of water companies to diversify successfully - will also be an issue. The water companies will be keen to emphasise the importance and performance of the utilities operations, to draw attention away from the lack of excitement in non-regulated businesses. Finally, water companies may well have to address the accounting treatment of infrastructure renewals in the first set of results after the summer price review. Since flotation, the water companies have been building up substantial provisions in their balance sheets to cover the costs of maintaining the pipe network. Yet it has become apparent that the initial annual index-linked charges may have been overly generous. By calculating lower annual charges, the regulator saw the water companies could achieve higher profits. 'Now the questions are, what is the right level of annual charge and how should the cumulative position be treated?' said Mr Robert-Miller Bakewell, of NatWest Securities. Given the amount of provisions accumulated by many water companies - such as the Pounds 139.3m at Yorkshire Water - this is no insignificant issue. Mr Miller-Bakewell expects companies such as Yorkshire to credit the provision straight to shareholders' funds. This brings us back to the view that shareholders are likely to get a good deal out of this set of results. In the longer term, however, investors should not ignore issues which are likely to overshadow the sector. Aside from the political risks presented by a possible change of government, there is the fundamental question of just how geared the water sector is to economic growth. 'This sector, more than any other, has no real exposure to that,' said Mr Dale.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial:"Improved Relations Between France and China"] </F>   [Text] There are two possible interpretations of the joint  communique released on 12 January by France and China to  announce that after deteriorating relations between the two  coutries, in the wake of the sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan,  relations are now back to normal. For Beijing, the communique  means that France has agreed to all Chinese demands, promising  not to sign new armament contracts with Taiwan in exchange for  an end to trade sanctions. So Deng Xiaoping's intransigence  seems to have paid off.    Unsurprisingly, Paris' interpretation is quite different, to  say the least, which shows the benefits -- or the limitations --  of the equivocal diplomatic language. In order to patch up  relations with China, which had gone sour as a result of his  socialist predecessors's action, and above all because of the  sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, Mr. Balladur has agreed to  take into account China's political needs, but reserves the  right to use a -- small -- way out: France may approve some  arms sales provided they are not considered as threatening --  and offensive -- for China. Still according to Paris, then,  French firmness would have prevailed.    In fact, both sides needed to unlock the situation. Paris  wanted to cut its trade balance deficit and give French  companies a new chance to do business in China. Above all, it  wanted to reestablish relations with one of the world's foremost  political, military, and economic powers, and not be cut off  from the huge Chinese market.    For China -- which has been squabbling with the United  States  over human rights, trade, and exports of atomic and missile  technology; and which is currently in a row with Britain over  Hong Kong -- restoring friendly ties with France was a way of  putting an end to a certain isolation.    So all is well that ends well. Provided Mr. Balladur manages  to meet expectations aroused during his visit to China "in the  near future." In the meantime, he has asked Mr. Peyrefitte  [former minister of De Gaule] to be the first one to go to  Beijing. But will the latter be able to convey the French  determination to his hosts in such a way that they give up any  hope of brazenly pressuring Paris into accepting their point of  view in the future?    One would be mistaken to believe in a necessarily bright  future. The Chinese have shown in just how little regard they  hold their promises of trade advantages. The eagerness to enter  the fray demonstrated by French companies already counting aloud  the billions of francs they stand to make does not strike one as  particularly appropriate. Beijing -- convinced that  "hypocritical" Western concerns for human rights will eventually  be superseded by greed -- is bound to take advantage of it to  raise the stakes. Subsequently, other large industrial powers  such as Germany will have to be reckoned with.</p>

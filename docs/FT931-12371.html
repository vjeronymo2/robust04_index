			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Night owls will want to catch part two of Heimat (BBC 2, 11.20), the remarkable German saga of small-town life which tonight has Hitler's rise to power as its backdrop. Friday night is meant to provide the kind of high-octane green fuel which will take you on Saturday morning roaring into the garden, to dig and weed and prune like a wild thing. The relative newcomer of the evening's gardening fare is Gardens Without Borders (C4, 9.00). A minibus full of gardeners and would-be gardeners tours France, led by an over-talkative garden designer with questionable taste. Last week, passing through Brittany, the pilgrims came to the manor-house and garden of a certain Prince Peter Wolkonski. It was a place of such ravishing beauty that to see it so fleetingly was something like a televisual experience of Le Grand Meaulnes. But even the most perfect gardens can be marred by the combination of a presenter's ego-mania, a garrulous and at times plain moronic commentary, not to mention lamentably uninformative filming of the plants. Thus far, the programme is a (French) dog's dinner.</p>

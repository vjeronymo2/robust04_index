			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 1 May -- Brother Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir,  the secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation, has sent a message to  Hamed Algabid, the secretary-general of the Islamic Conference  Organization [ICO].    In his letter he calls for the necessary contacts to be made  regarding the call to ICO member countries to hold an emergency  session of the conference of ICO foreign ministers before the  date of this year's pilgrimage. The meeting would be to discuss  the subject of Libyan pilgrims being impeded from carrying out  the religious ceremony of pilgrimage, due to the unjust measures  imposed by Western states via the Security Council, that would  enable Libyan citizens to perform this religious duty free from  the hindrances imposed by the resolutions of the Security  Council.    In his message he emphasized that the resolutions of the  Security Council which imposed an air embargo on the Great  Jamahiriyah were in essence purely political resolutions which  had led to Libyan pilgrims being impeded in the performance of  their religious duty securely, peacefully and easily and had led  brotherly Islamic states to assist the Security Council in its  resolutions by stopping the Libyan people from getting to the  holy mosque in Mecca.</p>

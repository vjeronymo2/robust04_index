This is stated in a report on the situation in  the social and labor area prepared by experts from Russia's  Labor Ministry. The report was forwarded to Interfax.    According to the report, in 1993 the gap between people's  wages widened considerably. For example, the average salaries  of the highest-paid officials (10% of the work force)  were 27  times higher than the wages of low-paid workers who make up the  same percentage.    At a number of facilities directors' salaries were 12 to 15  times higher than the wages of their employees.    According to the report, the growth of salaries lost any  connection with the final results of production. "The dynamics  of price increases are a decisive factor in this process," the  document points out.    The wages of about one half of government employees continue  to remain below subsistence minimum, the report says.</p>

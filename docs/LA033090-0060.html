			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: LAUNCHING AN UPSCALE BOATHOUSE  </P> <P> Remi looks loved.  </P> <P> This is not surprising. Remi, 1451 3rd St. Promenade, Santa Monica, (213)  393-6545, was designed by architect Adam Tihany, who has already given us Bice  and Pomodoro.  </P> <P> But this time Tihany has done more than merely design a beautiful new  restaurant; this time around, he's also the owner.  </P> <P> That's him over there, walking worriedly around the room checking details. "Do  you like your seat? How's the service? Is the pasta prepared the way you want  it?"  </P> <P> The answers are yes, very good, absolutely. The seats -- like everything else  in this charmingly upscale boathouse -- are designed for both comfort and  beauty. They cradle you.  </P> <P> The service is solicitous: When the waiter arrives with your food, the captain  is right behind him making sure that all is as you ordered it.  </P> <P> And the food is -- for the most part -- good. Best dish of the evening: creamy  polenta with squid in its own ink. Penne piccante was truly piquant, salads  (especially one with arugula, Parmesan and walnuts) were superb. A veal chop  was big, juicy and came with a comfortingly large mound of mashed potatoes. And  the rest of the menu looks equally enticing.  </P> <P> L.A. already has so many Italian restaurants, it's easy to wonder whether we  really need another. But when the new one's this lovely, the answer is obvious.  RUTH REICHL  </P></p>

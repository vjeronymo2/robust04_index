			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Earthmovers scoop awards - JCB Simply commending JCB, the Midlands based manufacturer of construction equipment, for winning two Queen's Awards would be only to scratch the surface of what many in the construction plant sector will undoubtedly acknowledge is a remarkable achievement. It is not so much that the company has scooped two Queen's Awards in one year for the second time - JCB Hydrapower has received an export award for its mini-excavator range and the backhoe loader division of JC Bamford Excavators has won a technology award - but more the way it has achieved its goals. When JCB Hydrapower entered the mini - excavator market (a segment of the industry for diggers up to six tonne operating weight) with its own product in 1989 the news prompted mixed reactions from the competition. JCB had built its reputation on the success of its now famous backhoe loader digger. The mini - excavator market, however, was saturated with well - established brand names, many belonging to Japanese manufacturers which had built up big sales in their domestic market. By the late 1980s they were feeding European customers from factories within the Euroepan Union. But JCB had identified a growth market and the company argued that the mini  -excavator was a natural extension of the backhoe loader concept, the cornerstone of the JCB empire. To attack what was predominantly a Japanese - controlled industry in Europe JCB moved a small subsidiary, JCB Hydrapower, to its own facility in Rugeley, Staffordshire, away from the hub of JCB's operations at Rocester, Staffordshire. Under the guidance of Mr Martin Coyne, now JCB's group's chief executive, a single status plant was established and an assembly line laid down in 1988. The company addressed the largest segment of the UK market first, launching a 1.4 tonne machine in early 1989. It was robust and simple to operate and maintain. 'We went for the largest segment of the market to prove our ability and technology without overstretching our position,' explains Mr Howard McCallum, JCB Hydrapower's director and general manager. The company then turned to continental Europe, developing a three tonne machine in 1991 which would appeal to owner - operators. It also developed three machines around 1.5 tonne but to higher specifications than the original unit. This further enriched the range of machines it could offer into this high volume market segment which could 'cater for the vastly different tastes in continental Europe,' says Mr McCallum. The tactics worked. Total sales in Europe grew from some 14,470 units in 1989 to 20,380 units in 1992 before easing back to around 18,000 last year, according to London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. And JCB Hydrapower says that between 1991 and 1993 its market share in Germany grew from 1.3 per cent to 2.6 per cent (the German market peaked at 11,000 units in 1992 according CIG), in France increased from 4 per cent to 7 per cent and rose marginally in Italy. During the same period the value of its mini - excavator exports increased from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 8.3m. The company this year has increased production from six to 11 machines a day and is changing the factory layout to triple capacity to 3,000 units a year. It was the needs of a much smaller market which prompted the group's backhoe loader division to develop the award winning 4CX 4x4x4 Servoplus. The machine is a derivative of the equal - sized wheel, all - wheel steer 4CX which cost around Pounds 4m to develop and was launched three years ago. A backhoe loader digger, the 4CX combines the stability of a rigid chassis machine with the manoeuvrability of its articulated competitors through the introduction of four wheel steer and four wheel drive. The Servoplus version was developed some 18 months ago at a cost of about Pounds 250,000. The Servo system itself - joystick controls built into the armrests which allow the operator to control many functions with fingertip movements rather than moving levers - is not new but JCB has developed what it claims is a unique double command servo system which allows the operator to drive and operate the machine from two standard operating positions. The machine was developed initially for the demanding conditions experienced in the Nordic countries, a small but technically sensitive market. Since the introduction of the Servoplus, JCB's market share in the Nordic countries has increased from 14 per cent to 25 per cent. Dr Henry Shirman, managing director of the backhoe loader division, says the Servoplus machines have generated interest in other technically sensitive but much larger markets such as Germany, France and North America.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Insurance company alters flexitime CLERICAL MEDICAL, the insurer, has abandoned its system of flexitime, reports the latest bulletin from Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay analysts, David Goodhart writes. Flexitime allows employees to decide their own hours of work around a core time specified by the company. Clerical and Medical said it had moved to a system of paying people to do a job rather than to sit at a desk for a fixed number of hours. This new culture clashed with the notion of 'counting hours and minutes' inherent in pure flexitime systems. It has run a flexitime system since 1975 for 1,200 of its 1,600 staff, but said it had had to change as a result of growing competitive pressures. The bulletin also reports on a survey of 123 organisations into fixed-term contracts. This found that on average only 2.5 per cent of staff were employed on such contracts with their use concentrated in the public sector.</p>

Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BROTHER'S TASTES NOT FOR JANET  </P> <P> Janet Jackson shares her brother Michael's taste in rehearsal halls, but  apparently not in main courses.  </P> <P> When Michael Jackson rehearsed at the Pensacola Civic Center to prepare for his  1988 "Bad" tour, his chef whipped up vegetarian entrees garnished with flowers  from the Hilton Hotel florist shop, hotel employees said.  </P> <P> But Janet Jackson, who is using the 10,000-seat Civic Center before starting  her first solo national tour in Miami, has developed a fondness for Chicken  Supreme sandwiches from McGuire's Irish Pub &amp; Brewery a few blocks from the  Civic Center and Hilton, the Pensacola News Journal reported today.  </P> <P> "From the day they arrived, Janet Jackson's roadies and sound crew have made us  their second home," said Susi Lyon, promotion director for McGuire's.  </P></p>

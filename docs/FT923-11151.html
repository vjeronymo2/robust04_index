			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Management: A light bite and a heavy sell - Business Lunches /- Michael Cassell begins a series on expense account eating IF lunch is 'for wimps', to quote Gordon Gekko, the Wall Street financier who preferred to dine off other people's misfortunes, then the streets of London are well populated with weaklings. For in spite of the longest recession for 60 years, the business lunch is still on the day's agenda across the Square Mile and throughout the West End. It may be quicker, almost certainly cheaper and possibly healthier, but the working lunch remains big business in the capital, where restaurants are trying harder than ever to make their cash in two hours, five times weekly. The excesses of the 1980s have gone, with customers increasingly going for the 'menu rapide' instead of the 1980s-style blow-out, when champagne stocks ran out and the bills ran up. But many people still make time for a bite to eat with the contact who would otherwise remain a disembodied voice on the telephone. 'Lunch today is a more modest affair but it still counts. It's usually one or two courses, a glass of wine, a bucket full of gossip and, with some luck, the chance of a deal. That's good value for Pounds 50,' according to Jamie Dunn, a futures market man buying lunch at Le Cafe du Marche, a former warehouse close to the Barbican and now one of the most popular business venues. 'Lunch is not a perk. Good times or bad, it always helps if you can look someone in the eye when you need to,' says Neill Moran, an investment banker indulging his guest in one of 36 varieties of champagne available at The City Flogger. 'I would refute the idea that hard times have wrecked the business lunch. Try turning up at any good restaurant in the City without booking and you run the risk of embarrassing yourself in front of your client,' according to Mark de Wesselow, publisher of Square Meal, the City and West End guides to eating out. He adds: 'The fact that, even in a recession, the Square Mile alone can support well over 225 restaurants is the greatest testimony of all to the role of the business lunch in the 1990s.' Even so, many big employers in London have cut back their entertainment budgets - Pounds 25-Pounds 30 per head for lunch seems about average - although there is always the tricky question of not appearing either too cheap or too extravagant. 'If it's cheap and nasty, you know they're having a hard time. If it's over-the-top, you can draw the same conclusion,' says Murray Jacobs, a commodities broker who has crossed the Thames to lunch by Tower Bridge at Sir Terence Conran's Le Pont de la Tour, one of the current places to be seen. Do not use it, or the Stephen Bull bistro near Smithfield market, if you want to keep your business liaisons secret. Increasingly, large companies are trying to make lunch an in-house affair, where the duration and the cost can be better controlled. Goldman Sachs, the US investment house, was once regarded as one of the more generous lunch-time entertainers around the City but it now boasts a stylish, 10th-floor restaurant in its modern, Fleet Street headquarters. Christopher Brown, the managing director of Corney and Barrow, which has seven city restaurants, confirms that people want better value out of lunch. This year average expenditure is down by nearly 20 per cent, although the number of transactions is up 30 per cent. 'It is a question of talking six to the dozen about business in the time available.' To compete for clientele, Corney and Barrow offers little extras such as a 'host button', enabling the host to surreptitiously summon service without interrupting the flow of conversation. Although companies like Legal and General, National Westminster, Gestetner, Shell and Imperial Chemical Industries have removed alcohol from their premises, the capital's wine and champagne bars are bearing up. Pimms or champagne still top the summer pops. London can also claim to offer a more interesting range of food than was the case a few years ago. The French cuisine which first ousted the 'nursery' food beloved of British businessmen has been joined by tastes from around the world. Oriental restaurants such as Tatsuso - the Japanese restaurant in Broadgate Circle - thought to be the first in Britain with a Michelin star - are increasingly popular. But old eating habits still die hard. Simpsons in Cornhill, purveyors since 1757 of steak and kidney pud and plum duff and custard, has its loyal fans. Places like Sweetings, the most hectic fish restaurant in town, and Bubbs, a maroon-panelled oasis alongside Smithfield market, also rarely lack customers. Some of the most popular restaurants for a business lunch, however, remain well over the Square Mile's western boundary. The Savoy Grill, where favourite tables are annoyingly reserved for captains of industry or the Chancellor of the Exchequer, still ranks among the most popular lunch-time venues. Others include the Connaught, where quail's eggs in pastry boats offer a tasty insight into what can follow, Wiltons, the Jermyn Street fish restaurant favoured by property men and former prime ministers, and Le Gavroche, a shrine to the Roux brothers. Many of them will effortlessly deduct well over Pounds 100 a head from any expense account, though the bill will be less indigestible at some of the newer, trendier West End eating spots, such as Orso in Covent Garden, used by younger executives out to impress. Similarly, sassy places to talk business include the Greenhouse off Park Lane and Le Caprice - sister restaurant to the wildly popular Ivy  - behind the Ritz, itself offering one of London's grandest dining-rooms and dubbed the 'Trafalgar House canteen' in deference to the hotel's owners. Conran fans away from the City head for the light and spacious Bibendum restaurant in the Fulham Road's Michelin building while the set lunch at La Tante Claire in Royal Hospital Road provides an opportunity to marvel at Pierre Coffmann dishes which can cost a bomb in the evening. But if your expenses cannot stand it, try a fresh approach. Whisk your guest up Bow Lane and usher him into Sorella for a tasty triple-decker honey roast, Jarlsberg cheese and turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread. The cost? A mere Pounds 2-75 - unless the chauffeur gets a ticket.</p>

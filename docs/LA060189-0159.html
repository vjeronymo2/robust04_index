			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NWA DISCLOSES CHECCHI, UNION ALSO MADE BIDS  </P> <P> NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, has received takeover offers from  Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi and from Northwest's machinists union,  bringing the number of known bidders to four.  </P> <P> Details about the bids were not disclosed. As previously reported, NWA has also  received bids from Pan Am Corp. and Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis.  </P> <P> NWA, based in Eagan, Minn., is the fourth-largest U.S. airline and has a strong  Pacific route system and valuable real estate in Japan. It has been for sale  since late March, when Davis offered $90 a share for the company. In rejecting  Davis' offer, NWA said it would explore alternatives for the company --  including a sale -- to enhance "shareholder value."  </P> <P> NWA shares closed Wednesday at $107.375, up 12.5 cents in trading on the New  York Stock Exchange. At that price, NWA would cost about $3.2 billion to  acquire.  </P> <P> In a press release, International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers  District 143 said it made a "proposal" concerning the airline to NWA's board.  The union said its proposal would reward shareholders while "providing  increased level of security to employees, consumers and the communities in  which Northwest operates."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Line's Largest Union  </P> <P> Jim Conley, a spokesman for the machinists in Washington, said he could not  provide details about the proposal but that it is a "buyout proposal." In the  past, the machinists have said they might finance an offer with borrowed funds  and with savings from reduced labor costs.  </P> <P> With 22,000 members employed by Northwest, the machinists are the airline's  largest union. It was not clear Wednesday whether the airline's other unionized  workers would support the machinists' bid. Kirk Faupol, co-chairman of  Northwest's 5,000-member pilots union, said pilots are not inclined to give  concessions. "We're not looking for wage cuts, regardless of whether there's  employee ownership involved," he said.  </P> <P> The machinists union has tried to buy an airline only once before. In 1985, the  machinists, along with pilots and flight attendants, offered to buy Eastern  Airlines. But the employee group was outbid by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of  Texas Air, which acquired Eastern in 1986. Strikebound Eastern is now involved  in bankruptcy proceedings.  </P></p>

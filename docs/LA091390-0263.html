			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ROLLE RECOVERING FROM ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Actress Esther Rolle is recovering at home in Los Angeles, sifting through  script offers and thanking friends for their support one month after being  seriously injured in an auto accident, a spokeswoman says.  </P> <P> "She's doing so much better," Michelle Marx said Wednesday after visiting the  69-year-old Miss Rolle.  </P> <P> The actress was a passenger in a car that rolled over on a highway Aug. 12,  killing a 70-year-old Texas woman. Miss Rolle suffered cuts on her head and  face, broken ribs and a bruised heart. She left the hospital Saturday.  </P> <P> "She's sitting up, but her ribs are still very painful. You can't laugh. No  sneezing allowed," Marx said. "It takes six weeks to six months with ribs. She  seems to be a quick healer, though."  </P> <P> Miss Rolle's credits include the TV series "Good Times" and the movie "Driving  Miss Daisy."  </P></p>

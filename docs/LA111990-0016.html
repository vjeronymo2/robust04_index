			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Billy Sings the Blues: Billy Joel, almost a year into a 15-month world tour to  promote his triple-platinum "Storm Front" LP, says he is touring primarily to  get himself out of a sea of red ink. "The reason for the length of this tour is  financial," he told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> "Look, at this age, you don't want to go out on the road for fun and games.  When I started the tour, I was in deep financial straits . . . I was looking at  a deep, deep, deep, deep financial hole that would take two years to get out  of. So I said, 'OK,' and put my head down and went to work and I'm getting back  in the black." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

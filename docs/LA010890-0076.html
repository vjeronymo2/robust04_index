			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> PLAN SHELVED TO ADD LANE TO LAMBERT ST.  </P> <P> Plans to add third lanes on both sides of Lambert Road between Palm Street and  the eastern city limits were temporarily shelved to give property owners time  to find alternatives for curbside parking they would lose.  </P> <P> The city Traffic Commission recommended the new lanes along with prohibitions  for stopping or parking. But the City Council, after hearing from several  property owners and business operators, voted to move forward only with plans  to widen the pavement in spots and install curbs and gutters.  </P> <P> City Manager Lee Risner told the council that the additional lanes will be  needed.  </P> <P> "Sooner or later, traffic is going to require that this be done," he said.  </P> <P> Robert Zaratzian, owner of property in the 2100 block of Lambert, objected to  the prohibition on parking.  </P> <P> "You're going to destroy a number of businesses that have been in La Habra for  years," he said.  </P> <P> Chuck Overby of Overby Transportation suggested the widening might only create  a bottleneck.  </P> <P> "I just don't see where we're going to get a significant improvement in traffic  flow," he said. "Unless the road is made three lanes all the way through town,  I just don't see the benefit."  </P> <P> Philip Spear, operator of In-N-Out Burger on Lambert, said: "We enjoy parking  for five or six cars along the street. If those spaces are eliminated, our  problem will be exacerbated. The walk-up customers (who use the street parking)  will get in line at the drive-through, sometimes extending into the street."  </P> <P> Councilman Douglas Bystry voted in favor of the motion, but expressed  reservations it.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will be beneficial unless it affects the entire street," he  said. "What we're going to have is sort of a hodgepodge of widening and then  going back to two lanes and that can be worse, really."  </P> <P> Risner invited property owners to meet with city officials to develop  alternatives. He also offered to assemble experts on planning and traffic to  work with property owners.  </P> <P> The council will reconsider the matter in six months. DAVID F. BURKE  </P></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (9): A revolution etched in fine copper - How a Pounds 10m new process revived a UK-based producer of printed circuit boards / Case Study: Pressac Holdings The statement in the last annual report of Pressac Holdings was flat. 'Over the last three years the group has committed more than Pounds 10.3m to improve its production facilities, which has contributed to greater efficiency and created a competitive edge resulting in improved market share,' it said. The reality behind the investment was less routine than the careful prose implied. Indeed, Mr Geoffrey White, the chief executive, was unequivocal. 'If we hadn't done that we wouldn't have been a supplier today.' Sales to the world automotive industry account for 43 per cent of Pressac's turnover and, of that proportion, 90 per cent is circuit boards. These circuit boards, the production of which is thus the mainstay of Pressac and the subject of its investment, are like electronic instruction pads, taking the demand of the driver and telling the vehicle how to meet it. Without new investment, said Mr White, 'Pounds 12m-13m of turnover would have been in terminal decline. We would have lost contracts as models were replaced.' About four years ago, Pressac was reorganising, breaking out of a centralised corporate structure. In parallel, there was pressure for technological change. 'The method by which we manufactured circuit boards was starting to come to the end of its days,' Mr White recalled. This method was die stamping. It had enjoyed a good run. Pressac had bought a licence for the technology from the US in the late 1950s; its first circuit board in Europe had been fitted into a Ford Corsair during 1964. Die stamping is the process of stamping copper foil on to a base material to produce a circuit. By contrast, the new technology etches the copper on to the base material and it is this technique which Pressac has adopted. The great advantage of die stamping was its economy and the ease with which waste copper could be recovered. But there was a limit to how tightly the tracks and spaces could be created on the circuit board and it was difficult to create circuits on both sides of the board. Etching overcomes these problems and fits neatly into an automotive industry trend - that of packing more and more kit into less and less space. In any case, said Mr Jeffrey Cullis, Pressac's commercial director, 'die stamping is a bit of a black art - so many things to do with temperature and pressure that it was difficult to control.' It was therefore a manufacturing technique which was difficult to tie in with constantly rising demands of automotive manufacturers for assured quality and reducing prices. In some respects, the new technology was easier and quicker. It involved manufacturing a circuit board in five stages rather than nine for die stamping. The decision to adopt new manufacturing techniques for its basic product led Pressac into taking three further steps which were fundamental for the group's fortunes. First, production of the new etched circuit boards would take place in a new facility. So Pressac has been phasing down the die stamping which takes place in an old Edwardian lace mill in Long Eaton, Nottingham, and concentrating all production at a nearby factory built in the 1980s and opened originally by Mrs Margaret Thatcher on one of her periodic barnstorming trips, as prime minister, through the East Midlands. Second, its US plant at Cullmann, Alabama, would be similarly equipped and it would be the main supplier of Pressac circuit boards to GM, Ford, Chrysler and the Japanese-owned car plants in the US. In the event of trouble on one side of the Atlantic there could at least be back up from the other. The third step was the introduction of a new way of organising the manufacture. Pressac, like so many of its peers in the UK engineering industry, switched from batch manufacturing to cellular manufacturing. Linking together the different steps of production in a cell has raised quality levels: the next stage cannot be started if the preceding stage has not been completed properly, while in batch manufacturing, where processes rather than products are linked together, locating a quality problem was difficult. Mr Cullis calculated that Pressac had made productivity gains of between 40 and 50 per cent with the cellular manufacturing of the etched process. In 1989, Pressac employed 1,800 people. Now it employs 700 for a similar turnover of around Pounds 33m a year. Because higher demands are being made on each employee, much greater attention is being paid to training. On the cell notice boards at Long Eaton, alongside the photographs of the cell members, there are charts of their training accomplishments. 'The next stage is that each cell will have a self-improvement programme,' said Mr Cullis. As in-house skills widen, so does Pressac's ability to diversify the products to which the skills can be applied. This diversification has started. The circuit board technology is being applied to heated wing mirrors and to the control of air bags.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Arab delegations force delay in Mideast talks ARAB delegations to the Middle East peace negotiations have forced a week's delay in the opening of the ninth round of talks which had been due to begin in Washington tomorrow. After a weekend of intensive contacts, Arab diplomats said that a new target date of April 27 had been set for the talks, in the hope that Israel could be persuaded to ease its position on permitting home the nearly 400 Palestinian deportees who were expelled to southern Lebanon in mid-December. The Palestinian delegation has also been angered by Israel's decision three weeks ago to seal off the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, thereby denying tens of thousands the opportunity to get to their workplaces. The Israeli action was condemned by the Palestinians as another obstacle to resumption of talks. After discussing the issues in Damascus on Friday and Saturday, members of the four delegations flew to Cairo yesterday for a meeting of the Arab League. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, told Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, that the four Arab delegations would be unable to meet the April 20 date set for a resumption. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said in Tunis that he was still not certain whether the new April 27 date could be kept. Syria, Jordan and Lebanon have all expressed a desire to resume negotiations with Israel as soon as possible. But they also wish to preserve a common Arab position and accept that the Palestinians have been put in a very difficult position by Israel's actions in the occupied territories. Extremists continued efforts to sabotage the process yesterday when an Israeli lawyer was killed in the Gaza Strip. Doubts about the price of peace, Page 15</p>

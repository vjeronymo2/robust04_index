			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Suter takes stake in Wilkes SUTER, the conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, has taken a 8.9 per cent stake in James Wilkes, the engineer which last year fought off a hostile bid from Petrocon. Suter said it bought the shares for 'investment purposes' and had not decided what further action to take. A decision is 'not imminent', a company adviser said. Wilkes's shares, which had fallen from a high last year of 190p to 48p, yesterday jumped 18p to 66p on takeover speculation. The company refused to comment until Suter's intentions 'become clearer'. Suter is reknowned for taking small stakes in companies and not necessarily making a bid. Last year it built up a 7.4 per cent stake in Brown &amp; Tawse, the steel and pipeline group, again insisting the stake was for investment purposes. Yesterday's move is Suter's first since publication in January of a DTI report on share dealings by Suter and Mr Abell in the mid 1980s. The report found no evidence that these and other parties acted in concert, but strongly criticised Mr Abell and questioned the timing of his private share purchases in Suter's bid targets. Last month Suter announced Mr Abell had been cleared of insider dealing by the DTI. Petrocon's all-share bid valued Wilkes at about Pounds 35m. Since then, Wilkes' shares have tumbled, partly because of an interim loss announced in October. The company's market capitalisation, before Suter started building its stake, was only about Pounds 8m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A "draft package of measures to open the Japanese  market and expand Japan's domestic demand" that the government  is mapping out this month in a bid to break the deadlock in  Japan-U.S. economic talks, came to light on 16 March. The major  points of the draft package of measures are to 1) review the  basic plan for public investment; 2) use financial and  investment loans to promote Japan's imports and foreign  investments in Japan and 3) promote deregulation and establish  objective criteria to deal with bilateral negotiations on  individual sectors under the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. The Finance Ministry, however, disapproves of expanding  public investment, and the coordination of views within the  government will be sped up in the future.    There are two draft packages. One has been mapped out by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] with the  intentions of the private sector taken into account, and the  other has been worked out by the Prime Minister's Office. The  two packages place priority on macroeconomic policy. The  "United States is interested in bilateral negotiations on the  individual sectors rather than in macroeconomic policy," (says a  source at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo). There is a growing view  among some government officials that "even if Japan comes up  with macroeconomic policy that gives no pain to anyone, it could  not break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. The government and the private sector should work on  bilateral negotiations on the individual sectors with a resolve  to suffer pain." The government will make a political decision,  and the eleventh-hour coordination of views within the  government will be reached.    According to the draft package, the government, in line with  the macroeconomic policy, will review the basic plan for public  investment that envisions an investment of 430 trillion yen by  the year 2000, cuts income tax and residential taxes by 20  percent uniformly for one year, and studies the possibility of  setting numerical targets for reducing Japan's current account  surplus.    The review of the basic plan for public investment will  raise  the question of whether it is compatible with the current  Five-Year Plan for Economic Development that the Miyazawa  government under the Liberal Democratic Party drew up in June  1993 with the aim of building Japan into a life-style  superpower. For this reason, the government is likely to ask  the Economic Deliberation Council to discuss ways to formulate a  new five-year plan within this year. In the course of  discussing the ways, the council is likely to specifically  recommend how much should be added to the basic plan for public  investment. The draft package worked out by the Prime  Minister's Office clearly indicates that the basic plan for  public investment should be increased by 100 trillion yen. The  draft package formulated by MITI gives no specific figure. The  final package of measures to open the Japanese market that the  government will map out during March is expected to only  indicate the need for a review of the basic plan for public  investment for early legislation.    As for the tax cut issue, the government's position is that  it will wait until the ruling party Tax System Reform  Consultative Council completes its debate, but the government is  hoping for an early settlement to revamping the current tax  system. With regard to setting numerical targets to reduce  Japan's current account surplus, the draft package of the Prime  Minister's Office calls for studying the possibility of reducing  Japan's current account surplus to about 2.0 percent of the  gross domestic product (GDP) as Japan's voluntary medium-term  numerical target. The Finance Ministry and the Economic  Planning Agency have reacted strongly against setting such a  numerical target on the grounds that if Japan fails to meet the  numerical target, the United States may slap sanctions on Japan.    As steps to promote foreign investments in Japan, the Japan  Development Bank will give American firms more access to the  current low-interest loan system by using financial and  investment loan funds. As measures to promote Japan's imports,  presently under consideration are the expanded application of  the preferential tax system, the upgrading of the import  infrastructure, the construction of more port terminals, and the  use of financial resources to implement public works projects.    As to the bilateral negotiations on individual sectors under  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the draft package  provides ways to deal with three priority sectors. In the  government's procurement of telecommunications gear and medical  equipment, the government will study the possibility of setting  objective criteria to measure the trend of government  procurement which has increased in the past. As for the  insurance, automobile and auto parts sectors, the government  will deal with them by relaxing regulations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Debate" article by Transportation Minister Jan Trojborg: </F> "The Swedes Finally Made Up Their Minds"]    [Text] The Swedes finally made up their minds. But as we  know, reaching the final decision on the Oresund project was not  without its cost for the Swedish Government.    The Swedish yes gave the real starting signal for the  marketing of the whole of the Oresund region. And there should  now be room for a more visionary debate on priorities and the  exploitation of the many possibilities that the fixed link  across the Oresund brings with it.    Even though there were probably very few people who could  imagine the Swedes running away from a crystal-clear agreement,  it is at least a fact that words like "water throughflow" and  "water rights court" have surfaced more frequently than concepts  such as growth and vision when the Oresund link has been  discussed recently.    Of course it has been both necessary and important to  guarantee a zero solution out of respect for the environment.  The debate on the environment has also been extremely useful,  even though it has at times been excessively technical. But at  present what is important is to look forward. With the fixed  link, Malmo-Lund will be linked to Denmark's capital city region  in one continuous Oresund region, and this will make it possible  to take up the struggle with Europe's other big cities.    Integration and growth will not of course follow  automatically on the fixed link, but the necessary preconditions  will be in place.    The project is first and foremost an investment in a piece  of  infrastructure that will make transport time between Malmo and  Copenhagen almost insignificant. When the fixed link is  finished around the turn of the century it will be both quick  and cheap to get from one side of the sound to the other,  especially if you travel by train.    Precisely because the Oresund link represents a conscious  investment in public transportation in the Oresund region, it  will be much cheaper to chose the most environmentally friendly  way to cross the sound -- namely, taking the train.    The Oresund link will on the whole create a number of  traffic  improvements in and around the capital with particular emphasis  on the public transportation sector.    Thus the Oresund link is a conscious investment in  Copenhagen  and the capital region.    In the first instance the actual work of construction will  create hundreds of jobs in and around Copenhagen.    But it is of course more important that in the longer term  the Oresund link will hopefully also be able to give Copenhagen  a much needed boost.    I am convinced that it will be possible for Copenhagen to  exploit the combination of good infrastructure and well-sited  industrial development areas -- not least Orestaden -- to set in  motion in earnest competitive urban development.    A number of initiatives linked to the Oresund link --  chiefly  the Orestad Company, the Oresund Committee, and Copenhagen  Capacity -- have already been launched.    Now that the final decision about the link has been made,  the  various initiatives should be translated into action as soon as  possible, so that from the start the capital will be able to  exploit and fill the role of the Oresund region as the  growth-dominated center in northern Europe. Remember that the  Oresund region is a region characterized by economic prosperity,  a well-educated labor force, a high level of public services,  and a clean urban environment.    Further, the region is centrally placed between Scandinavia  and the Continent and between western and eastern Europe --  something that is underlined by the fixed link. In a large  number of fields it will therefore be natural to exploit the  possibilities that a united Oresund region brings with it.    Two obvious examples that can be mentioned are the education  and research sector and the transportation sector.    In the region there are universities and institutes of  higher  education with places for over 100,000 students.    The new transportation possibilities will make it possible  for the students to choose the best teaching from a long list of  educational establishments, and it will also be possible to make  more effective use of research and education establishments on  both sides of the sound.    In the transportation and distribution sector Denmark  already  belongs to the super league, but with a fixed link with Sweden  the Danish transportation sector will have yet another strong  card in its hand in the tough competition in Europe.    In particular Kastrup airport will of course acquire a  better  position in the competition with other European airports. Both  because the potential passenger catchment area will expand  dramatically, and because with the construction of a railroad  station in the airport a new and very smooth link with the  public transportation system will be created.    As a Dane I think that there is good reason to be happy that  with Sweden's final yes a very important step has been taken  along the road toward creating a united and dynamic Oresund  region.    It is of importance to all of Denmark that with the Oresund  link we will be creating some of the most fundamental  preconditions for increased growth in the capital.    For regardless of whether you live in Hobro, Ronne, or  Glostrup the same rules apply: Investments in and around  Copenhagen benefit the whole of Danish society more than  investments made in Hamburg.</p>

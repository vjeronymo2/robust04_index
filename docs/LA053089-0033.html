			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal authorities are conducting preliminary investigations into charges of  sexual misconduct by at least five members of the House, the Washington Times  said. It said the investigations by the Justice Department, the Capitol Police  and at least one House committee involve minors and male prostitutes. Justice  Department and Capitol Police declined to comment on the paper's report. The  Washington Times, which did not name those being probed, said the probes also  extended to current and former congressional staff members. It quoted anonymous  sources as saying the inquiries were started earlier this year. It said Ohio  Republican Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, found guilty last week on charges of  contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 16-year-old girl with whom he had  sexual relations, apparently was not among those being investigated.  </P></p>

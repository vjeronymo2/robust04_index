			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RECESSION, MOST WOULD SAY, IS ALREADY BEING FELT;  </P> <P> AUTO DEALERS FIGHTING OVER SHRINKING PIE  </P> <P> John Campbell is president of the Campbell Automotive Group, which operates  seven auto dealerships in Orange and Riverside counties. Together, the  dealerships sell 11 makes of new cars.  </P> <P>  "Business is very, very difficult. It's the most difficult I've seen it in 12  years I've been in the business. This is a function of two things. We're in the  middle of an industry recession, which is due to all the new entries in the  marketplace -- the Acuras, Saturns, Daihatsus, etc. The total number of car and  truck models (has) doubled in the past year, but the total market has not  increased. We have a pie the same size being sliced in ever smaller pieces.  </P> <P> "That has reduced margins and sales, but costs are increasing faster than usual  in our industry because of real estate and because of environmental costs. Our  industry has been hit hard by the costs of hazardous waste because we deal with  gas and oil. Profitability is very difficult.  </P> <P> "On top of that, we have a general recession, and it is making it that much  harder. We're in for as tough a period over the next 12 months as the car  industry has had since World War II.  </P> <P> "Our industry is often highly leveraged. One of the challenges will be to  reduce that leverage and be in a good capital situation going in. The other  will be keeping costs under control and doing whatever restructuring one needs  to do. And I think dealerships will have to be sold, closed or consolidated.  There's not enough market around to support all the models that exist.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are trying to hold dealerships together, staying together  hoping for the turn. But I think we're being double barrelled by a bad economy  and some structural factors in our industry that (are) going to make the turn  quite a way off." CHRIS WOODYARD  </P></p>

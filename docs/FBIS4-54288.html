			<p>BFN     [Text] In answering questions posed by Mr. Shun Oide of  the opposition Socialist Democratic Party of Japan during the 23  May session of the House of Representative Budget Committee,  Naoaki Murata, director of the Bureau of Defense Policy at the  Defense Agency, disclosed that the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF]  has been studying the "ASDF Action Program, Part 11" to prepare  Japan for a state of emergency.    During the session, Mr. Oide asked the Defense Agency  official to present the Diet with materials on the ASDF Action  Program, Part 11. In response, Mr. Murata said: "The ASDF has  not been working on the study on the premise of amending the  Self-Defense Forces Law, and I would like to refrain from  presenting to the Diet any materials which reveal military  operations." Mr. Oide refused to relent and demanded that the  question be discussed at the council meeting of the Budget  Committee.    According to a Defense Agency official, the three services  of  the Self-Defense Forces have been working on studying military  operations in anticipation of various emergency situations, but  the substance of their study has not been made public.</p>

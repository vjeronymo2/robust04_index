			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Fear on National Insurance deficit The National Insurance Fund sustained a Pounds 4.9bn deficit in the 1992-93 year because of rising payments for unemployment benefits and tax breaks for personal pension holders, says the Commons public accounts committee. As a result the fund, which is financed through National Insurance contributions, will need a Treasury grant paid out of general tax revenues of Pounds 7.6bn in 1993-94, in order to maintain an acceptable minimum working balance. Part of the deficit consists of Pounds 2.7bn in NIC rebates to personal pension holders, up from Pounds 2.5bn in the 1991-92 fiscal year. From 1997, the Department of Social Security has proposed a system of age-related rebates which will greatly reduce the generous tax breaks offered to young people to induce them to take out personal pensions. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, intends to investigate whether some portion of the large number of personal pensions consisting only of NIC rebates may have been sold to people for whom they were inappropriate. According to the PAC, the fund is likely to require subsidies from general tax receipts for 'a number of years' while receipts and payments are brought back into balance. The PAC noted that the Department of Social Security believes the fund is 'naturally buoyant' and that, depending on a number of assumptions, should no longer require additional tax subsidy by the end of this century.</p>

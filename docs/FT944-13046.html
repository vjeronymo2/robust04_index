			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Competition conundrum When speculation started over whether there would be a bid battle for VSEL, a senior Ministry of Defence official was asked what his attitude would be to offers from BAe and GEC. 'I don't think that we would have any problem with BAe buying the company,' he said. 'It would be good for competition. It would give us two strong competitors each owning warship yards.' When GEC was mentioned, however, he shook his head: 'I don't think it's on.' A month is a long time in Ministry of Defence policy planning. In the two weeks since it registered an interest in VSEL, GEC has mounted an effective campaign in Whitehall to make its bid acceptable. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, yesterday made the first move in clearing the way for the GEC bid by saying that the government would not use its 'golden share' - its right to prevent any company owning more than 15 per cent of VSEL shares - to block GEC's bid. The issue will now pass to the Office of Fair Trading. Sir Brian Carsberg, OFT director-general, must decide whether GEC's ownership of the two largest warship yards in the UK, Yarrow on the Clyde and Barrow in Cumbria, would present competition worries. In practice, the ministry will determine the issue since it is the only UK customer and its submission to the OFT will be decisive. BAe's argument is that if it takes over VSEL, there would be two competitive UK yards able to bid for naval work, each owned by different companies. 'There are no competition issues in our bid and we expect it to be cleared,' said Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive yesterday. 'But GEC's bid raises competition issues and I would expect it to be blocked. It runs counter to the MoD's policy.' GEC's case is that in practice competition difficulties do not arise. Trafalgar submarines, for instance, could only be built at Barrow, so whoever owns that yard will secure the contract even if the MoD invites bids for the work. The only other contracts available are for the last batch of Type-23 frigates, for which the prices are well defined. Only after 2000 would there be a potential problem over the next generation frigate called Horizon; as an Anglo-French joint project, there would be potential competition from French yards. Whatever the merits of the two views, the VSEL bids highlight areas of uncertainty over MoD competition policy. The UK accepts a single manufacturer of aircraft because costs are prohibitive. But it is far from clear that costs are a problem in warship yards. 'The real issue is, why should we reduce competition before we have to?' said a defence executive yesterday. 'If the MoD allows a monopoly in shipbuilding, it has a lot of explaining to do about how this fits its policy of competition.'</p>

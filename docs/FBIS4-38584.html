			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Simferopol May 31 TASS -- Crimean president's aide  Aleksey Baksheyev does not exclude the possibility that gunmen  of the so-called Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN)  are already penetrating the peninsula.    "Their threats to form special units for the Crimea are  real", the aide told TASS on Tuesday.    According to Baksheyev, neither Ukrainians nor residents of  the Crimean Republic are interested in aggravating tensions  around the peninsula. People who benefit from these tensions  are not numerous but they "stir up trouble immensely", he added.    "Kiev has nothing to wory about", he went on saying. "The  Crimea does not look for separation, it just wants to build  relations with Ukraine on a treaty basis".    On the contrary, the situation will be destabilized if  President Kravchuk imposes his direct rule on Crimea, Baksheyev  stressed.</p>

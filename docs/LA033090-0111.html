			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> CRESPI BASEBALL PLAYERS GIVE TRACK TEAM HAND  </P> <P> Gloves, bats and balls were not part of a special practice session last week  for Crespi High baseball players Mike Peters, Joe Ruggiero and Mark Venturine.  </P> <P> Instead, the outfielders sported shorts and track spikes during a lunchtime  session spent rehearsing starts and handoffs with sprinter Ken Kuras. The  hastily assembled 440-yard relay team shocked track Coach Jim Benkert, who had  arranged the practice, with a respectable 45.2-second clocking despite two  technical errors.  </P> <P> What Benkert cooked up, though, in his "melting pot" relay, has become the  fastest foursome in the area this year. In last week's meet against Loyola,  Crespi's sprint team ran a 43.6 in its competitive debut. The Valley-leading  mark converts to a 43.3 metric performance.  </P> <P> "They got out of the blocks slowly and had one poor exchange," Benkert said of  the relay team's earlier practice. "The handoffs were good. They knew what they  were doing."  </P> <P> Against Loyola, the impromptu relay team was flawless. And Ruggiero also helped  Crespi's cause with second-place finishes in the 100 meters (11.6), 220 yards  (23.4) and long jump (19 feet 6 3/4 inches).  </P> <P> Although Crespi lost, 73-54, in the meet that traditionally decides the Del Rey  League championship, Peters, Ruggiero and Venturine may run in future meets if  the baseball schedule permits.  </P> <P> Although Benkert has left the welcome mat out for the players, baseball Coach  Scott Muckey worries that two sports might be too much for the athletes.  </P> <P> "If it's not interfering with baseball, then its OK," he said. "If it starts  taking away from the (baseball) team, then I don't feel particularly good about  it.  </P> <P> "But I'll leave it up to the kids."  </P> <P> Pitching strength: Despite a .260 team batting average, Hart High is 7-1-2 and  atop the Foothill League standings with a 4-0 record.  </P> <P> How so?  </P> <P> Pitching. Led by the trio of left-hander Andrew Lorraine, and right-handers  Kevin Foderaro and Keith Halcovich, Hart is keeping opponents off the  scoreboard. The Indians have a team earned-run average of 2.13 in 72 1/3  innings.  </P> <P> Lorraine, a senior, is 3-0 with 48 strikeouts and an 0.50 ERA in 28 innings.  Foderaro, a senior, is 3-0 with 24 strikeouts and an 3.71 ERA in 28 1/3 innings  and Halcovich, a junior, is 1-1 with nine strikeouts and an 2.19 ERA in 16  innings.  </P> <P> Foderaro has two complete games, including a no-hitter, and two saves. Lorraine  has one shutout.  </P> <P> Downed Spirits: Paraclete right fielder Chuck Lang became the latest victim of  the Spirits' hard luck when he sustained a season-ending injury to his left  biceps while attempting to stop a truck that was rolling from his garage.  </P> <P> Apparently Lang's arm became pinned between the truck's door and the garage  when he attempted to jump inside and apply the brakes.  </P> <P> "It's been one of those seasons, already," Coach Andy Gavel said.  </P> <P> Lang, a three-year starter, was batting .250. Paraclete (3-5) lost its cleanup  hitter when David Yaroslaski re-injured a knee attempting to score from third  base earlier this season. As Yaroslaski crawled back to third, a throw  attempting to nab him went awry.  </P> <P> "Everybody was screaming at him to score, and he yelled for a pinch-runner,"  Gavel said. "Like I said, it's been one of those seasons."  </P> <P> Reflection correction: After 15 seasons of juggling a slew of responsibilities  as Hoover baseball coach, Bob Cooper has decided to slow down and delegate the  jobs of fund-raising and statistics-balancing to assistants.  </P> <P> Some might think Cooper relied on mirrors over the years to handle his  multitude of tasks. And the mirror theory isn't all cracked -- just check out  the wall in the Tornadoes' outfield.  </P> <P> On a sweltering day last spring, Cooper and his wife, Glenda, painted the wall  with huge logos of local sponsors. Unwittingly, the two painted the Zs in  Domino's Pizza backward.  </P> <P> True to his sport, Cooper gave a traditional baseball excuse for the miscue:  The sun was in his eyes.  </P> <P> "It was so damn hot out there, it seemed like the sun was bouncing off the wall  and right in our face," he said.  </P> <P> The error will not be saved for posterity, however. Domino's did not sponsor  the team this season.  </P> <P> "Their year is up," Cooper said, laughing. "Probably, the next game it will be  outta there."  </P> <P> Mike Glaze and staff writers Sam Farmer, Vince Kowalick and Jeff Riley  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 39 (529)] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian parliament has amended and enlarged  the law on presidential elections adopted in 1991.    According to the amended law, candidacies to the  presidential  post shall be advanced by parties, inter-party blocs and  electors' conferences. (The old law envisaged the advancement of  candidates on their own initiative, or by worker groups -  Interfax).    The advancement of candidates shall begin 3 months before  and  end 2 months before elections. A candidate that has collected  100,000 signatures shall be allowed to run an election campaign.    The new law has a provision which obliges a candidate to  collect at least 1,500 signatures in two thirds of the total  number of electoral districts. Elections shall be held in 27  electoral districts - in all regions and the cities of Kiev and  Sevastopol.    A candidate who has scored more than half of the votes shall  be considered elected to the post of president. Elections shall  be considered valid if more than 50% of the electors take  part  in them.    If none of the candidates scores the required number of  votes, a second round is held involving two candidates supported  by the largest number of electors. During the second voting, a  candidate who scores more "pros" than "cons" shall be considered  elected to the presidential post.    Presidential elections shall be held on June 26. Ukrainian  president Leonid Kravchuk announced this week that he would not  run for presidency.    Explaining his decision, Kravchuk said that presidential  elections should hardly be held just three months after  parliamentary elections, scheduled for March 27. He pointed out  that although he did not oppose the idea of presidential  elections, he believes that amid the current economic crisis  such prompt elections might overly politicize society.    The president's and Cabinet's press service circulated a  statement which clarifies Leonid Kravchuk's position.    It says, among other things, that Kravchuk's position  reflects the current situation and prospects for its development.    The president does not rule out, it goes on to say, that  elections to parliament and executive bodies may go beyond the  allotted time limit and overlap with early presidential  elections and elections to the local governments, all of which  may cause vacuum of power, whereby the old parliament would  cease to exist, while a new parliament and cabinet would not be  formed up. Given this, only president can run the state. If  the president announces early elections in such a situation, the  executive bodies may fall part and the reigns of state power  might be utterly lost.    Meanwhile, RUKH [Ukrainian People's Movement for  Perestroyka]  leader Vyachesav Chernovil (Kravchuk's rival during the  elections in December 1991 -- Interfax) qualified Kravchuk's  refusal to run for presidency as a tactical game. "This does not  mean that Kravchuk has firmly decided not to run for  presidency," he told Interfax. He also said that the press  service's statement does not say a word bout his refusal to  participate in the election campaign and that Kravchuk's moves  are aimed at undermining presidential elections, at least in  June.</p>

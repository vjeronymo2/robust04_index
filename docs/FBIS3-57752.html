			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Davos, Switzerland January 31 TASS -- The situation  in the Russian economy is not hopeless but there are many  difficulties to overcome before seeing the light at the end of  the tunnel, according to participants in the seminar on the  Russian national economy within the World Economic Forum in  Davos, Switzerland. Representatives of Russia differed greatly  in their views on the situation.    Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, was  optimistic on the whole. He cited his ministry's forecast,  according to which the situation will be held under control in  the months to come provided the tough economic policy is  maintained, the state budget revenue strengthened and  institutional transformations and the privatisation drive  continued. This will slow down the slump in 1994, and the gross  national product will dwindle by eight per cent as against 12  per cent last year. Urinson spoke in favour of supporting  specific groups of population in the hope that stabilisation of  social life will be possible this year, as well as an increase  in the labour and business activity of the middle class.    There are no political forces in Russia capable of stopping  privatisation, the seminar was told by Vice-Premier Anatoliy  Chubays, who is chairman of the State Privatisation Committee.  According to Chubays, 70 per cent of shops, stores, restaurants  and other enterprises in the same sphere had been privatised by  January 1, 1994. He stressed the need for dialogue with the  parliament concerning further privatisation. "The bulk of the  population supports reforms, and this is the source of my  optimism," Chubays stressed.    Although the political situation in Russia in 1993 was very  complicated, the market reforms continued, according to  ex-finance minister and parliament member Boris Fedorov. He  said he viewed as a success the continued deregulation of  prices, an end to import subsidies and financial infusions in  the Commonwealth member-countries, and the struggle against the  budget deficit. "Without these measures the inflation rate could  have been much higher," he said. Fedorov announced that the  rouble exchange potential against the dollar increased  three-fold last year, but this increase was too slow and too  painful. The reform objectives were not made quite clear to the  people, he said. For all that, he stressed that the term "shock  therapy" is not fully applicable to Russia's economic policy.  As concerns the short-term perspectives, Fedorov said that  recent changes in the policy and playing up to the public were  fraught with an economic disaster in the next few months. But  in the mid-term, one may reasonably be more optimistic.    According to economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, one of the high-  priority tasks is the toughening of control over the inflation  rate. He spoke against soft credits and stressed the need for  further privatisation, particularly in agriculture. He  recommended Western investors to concentrate on Russia's  regions. "I am optimistic about the future, but not about this  year," Yavlinskiy said.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> VOTERS TO BE ASKED TO OK SCHOOL BONDS  </P> <P> Property owners in the Los Alamitos Unified School District will be asked in a  special election to approve a $13-million bond issue to finance school  improvements.  </P> <P> If approved by voters on April 3, Measure K would require residential and  commercial property owners in the cities of Los Alamitos and Seal Beach and the  community of Rossmoor to pay $4.50 more in taxes a month.  </P> <P> The bonds would finance such projects as painting, replacement of floors and  roofs and other structural improvements of school buildings, said Ronald  Murrey, director of business and support services for the district.  </P> <P> "Most of the schools in the district are about 30 years old," he said. "Just as  you would need to maintain a house, these buildings need to be maintained."  </P> <P> Murrey said a decrease in state funding for schools prompted the bond measure.  </P> <P> "The state has been cutting back on these funds for the last few years," he  said. "There simply is not enough to take care of deferred maintenance and  provide all of the educational programs we currently offer."  </P> <P> Those who would be exempt from the increased tax are people 65 or older and the  disabled who receive Social Security, according to Murrey. The school board  also voted to exclude residents of Leisure World in Seal Beach from the tax.  </P> <P> "What we hope is that the community appreciates the educational system that the  Los Alamitos school district provides," Murrey said.  </P> <P> There are four elementary schools, one middle school and two high schools in  the district.  </P> <P> The bonds would be paid off in the next 20 to 25 years, Murrey said.

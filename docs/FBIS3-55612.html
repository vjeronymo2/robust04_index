			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Zlenko by an unidentified </F> reporter at the Foreign Ministry; date not given; from "Without  a Protocol" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] What, in your opinion, were the  most dramatic events in the sphere of foreign policy in 1993?  Were they the Massandra agreements, the START-I ratification  with all its provisos, the adoption of Ukrainian foreign policy  directions, or some aspects of negotiations?    [Zlenko] I want to start by pointing out that Ukraine has  been acknowledged by 145 nations of the world, and 132 have  initiated diplomatic relations with us. This is very pleasant.  This is a factor of great significance for the development of  our state. With regard to dramatic events, all the issues that  you mentioned had influenced the work of the Foreign Ministry  in some way, as well as the life of the state in general.  However, speaking of the most relevant problems that may impact  on the future, I think these were nuclear issues, in particular,  the discussion and ratification of START and the Lisbon  Protocol. I would like to underline that right at this moment,  when we are holding this interview, Ukraine is not in isolation.  It enjoys normal relations with different nations of the world  and this, too, gives me grounds to say that we will soon find a  resolution for this difficult problem. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Andrey Kozyrev is another representative of a new  generation of diplomats. You probably worked with his  predecessors. Interesting situations something occur when this  man says different things about Ukraine.    [Zlenko] I pay attention to this, and I openly criticize  Andrey Kozyrev in his and my retinue's presence. I openly speak  out at forums trying to rebut [his statements] to a maximum  extent. This, in particular, happened both in Brussels and Rome.  Speaking of who is victorious in such disputes.... We have  special relations with Russia; we are trying to treat Russia as  a special partner. Of course, a large number of unresolved,  complicated problems has piled up. We are trying to find ways  to resolve them which determines the nature of our negotiations.  One cannot say that these issues have been unresolved because  Ukraine did not try hard or because the Russian side outwitted  us. I think that the very fact that these problems still exist  does no credit to either Ukraine or Russia.    [Reporter] What are your relations with the current  legislature? One sometimes gets the impression that the Supreme  Council treats the Foreign Ministry as an office issuing  documents for lawmakers' foreign trips.    [Zlenko] I want to point out that in general, my relations  with the current legislature are good. A lot of legislative  acts drafted by the Foreign Ministry were approved by the  Supreme Council. There were difficulties in lobbying the  foreign policy concept but lawmakers finally passed it. I think  that the majority of deputies have an understanding of today's  foreign policy and the activities of the Foreign Ministry. Of  course, there have been conflicts with some of the deputies,  even overt attacks on me. But I have never descended to their  level and held debates with them. I would like the next Supreme  Council to be professional and manned with patriots of Ukraine  with an understanding of the problems of foreign policy.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What was your and your team's main accomplishment  in 1993 on the international arena?    [Zlenko] I think that the first matter worth mentioning is  the completion of the first stage of determining Ukraine's  foreign policy. Second, we have managed to create the basis for  developing international relations. Third, we have formed a  diplomatic and consular infrastructure abroad. Finally, it is  the very fact that we are now sitting in this new building with  new people arriving. The process of expanding the Foreign  Ministry is under way. However, the main issue for me is that  during the difficult year of 1993 our people displayed courage,  patience, and wisdom and that we have ended the year in peace  and accord. There were no ethnic conflicts. Perhaps, the  living standards have deteriorated but we have not stooped to  grabbing arms to resolve ethnic or other problems. I believe  that this was our main accomplishment in 1993.</p>

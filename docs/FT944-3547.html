			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / More signs of inflation pressure Further signs of inflationary pressure were revealed yesterday, with figures showing that manufacturers are increasing prices at the factory gate, while raw material costs are rising at their fastest for 18 months. The core measure of the output prices of manufacturers, which excludes volatile goods such as food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent between October and November. According to the Central Statistical Office the annual rise in the core measure of output prices was 2.6 per cent in the 12 months to November. But the pace of growth is accelerating. Prices in the three months to November were 4 per cent higher than in the previous three months, on an annualised basis. Analysts saw the strength of yesterday's producer price figures as evidence that the chancellor was right to sanction a half percentage point increase in base rates last week. But it is not yet clear whether higher producer prices would be passed on to consumers in the high street. Mr Adam Cole, UK economist at James Capel, pointed out that low wage growth, combined with strong productivity, was offsetting rising commodity prices. He said manufacturers' overall cost bill was broadly flat, so that the aim behind the factory gate price rises was to improve margins. With consumers reluctant to pay higher prices, the result was that 'retail margins are clearly getting squeezed very heavily,' he added. The overall level of output prices rose an unadjusted 0.1 per cent between October and November, for an annual rise of 2.4 per cent. There were particularly sharp jumps in the prices of pulp and paper products, chemicals and in paper and plastic products. Meanwhile, manufacturers' raw material costs are rising even faster than factory gate prices. Input prices rose an unadjusted 2.4 per cent between October and November, for an annual rise of 7.9 per cent, up from 6.9 per cent in October. This was the highest annual rate since March last year. The main component in the unadjusted rise was the winter increase in the price of electricity. The seasonally adjusted index rose just 0.7 per cent on the month, for an 8.1 per cent annual increase. Higher milk prices also played a part, contributing 0.4 percentage points of the monthly rise. The cost of many commodities rose substantially in the year to November, with coffee more than doubling in price.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fedor Yemchenko report under the "Such News" rubric: </F> "FITUR: Criticism from Left and Right"]    [Text] An all-Russia conference of trade union committee  chairmen has been held at the FITUR [Federation of Independent  Trade Unions of Russia]. Those who are directly responsible for  resolving the socioeconomic problems of labor collectives  gathered for the representative forum.    Analyzing the working people's present situation, the trade  union leaders attempted to formulate a unified strategy to  protect the working people's interests. All the speakers  emphasized that this can be achieved only by pooling the efforts  of all trade union organizations. At the conference there was  criticism of the FITUR leadership and accusations of its  excessive politeness [loyalnost] in relations with power  structures.    Representatives of Working Moscow set up their picket  outside  the FITUR building yesterday. The pickets accuse the FITUR  leadership of infringing the working people's interests with the  General Agreement between the government, employers, and trade  unions, which they signed recently.</p>

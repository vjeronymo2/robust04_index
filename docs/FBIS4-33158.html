			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Cuban newspaper  GRANMA reiterated its rejection of William Clinton's recent  statements by considering them a demonstration of U.S.  Government interest in continuing to promote an atmosphere of  confrontation with Cuba.    In a lengthy commentary entitled "Public Letter to a  President" (Clinton), GRANMA said the alleged 20 May message by  the U.S. President to Cuba is also a good example of the  ignorance of realities that have characterized Cuba's history  and its relations with the United States.    After highlighting the negative aspects of the significance  of 20 May 1902 for Cuba and clarifying the pro-independence  ideas of national hero Jose Marti, the author considered it  profane to manipulate Marti's figure and name after radio  stations that pursue objectives against those for which he  fought.    Commenting on the White House's position of repeatedly  denying visas to nationals who meet all the requirements and, on  the contrary, promoting illegal departures, the commentary warns  that "cynical and opportunistic" policies always turn against  those who create them.    "Today, they tighten the blockade to promote emigration;  they  promote emigration but your Interests Section denies thousands  of visas. They deny visas but have no problems receiving those  who are able to reach the coasts of Florida in flimsy boats or  are able to seize one," the commentary stated.    And the commentary asks: "How long do you think this winding  circle will last without exploding and turning against you?"    For the commentator, when the U.S. middle class, which  allowed Clinton to reach the presidency, learns and understands,  among other things, that Washington defines its policy toward  Cuba following the interests of the meager community of  immigrants, the Cuban American Foundation (terrorist group  founded by the CIA), the blockade, and 20 May messages will end.    According to the article [as published], the hour of honor  for the United States will come that day "because that powerful  nation, which is trying to starve those who have committed the  sole crime of struggling for their ideas and their right to be  free and independent into submission, will never be considered  complete or just."</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fly me - but do not expect an upgrade Sir, I found Michael Holman's advice in his article, 'Tradecraft of the frequent flyer' (October 24), amusing and, from what I've heard of Nigeria, well worth heeding. But there is one point which he, for obvious reasons, overlooked, and that is the other type of traveller who, in my experience, is not offered up-grades - women. I am a Silver member of BA's frequent-flyer programme, but I have yet to have the word upgrade even mentioned at check-in, let alone be offered one. This was finally brought home to me when a male colleague, who had not flown with BA for more than two years and is not known for his stylish dress sense, recently checked in for a BA flight, and the assistant immediately volunteered the likelihood that he would be upgraded. Having flown BA regularly, since the days of BOAC, I have reached the opinion that loyalty is a one-way street. Kim Fairweather, 29 High Street, Sevenoaks, Kent TN13 1JD</p>

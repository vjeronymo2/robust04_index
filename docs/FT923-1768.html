			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (9): Sleeping with strangers - Co-operation North aims to bridge the social and cultural gap A PROBABLE reaction of a Catholic teenager from Dublin being asked if he or she would like to spend a fun weekend in a Loyalist area of Belfast would be: 'Thanks. I'd rather a have week in Sarajevo.' A similar reaction might come from a Protestant youth being encouraged to spend a weekend on the Falls Road. Nonetheless, increasing numbers of teenagers, in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, are being asked to surrender the security of their own communities for a few days and live with a family in the 'enemy' camp, in a programme of school and youth exchanges promoted by an organisation known as Co-operation North. Established in 1979, by a group of leaders in business, trade unions and academic life on both sides of the border, the non-denominational body defines its mission as: 'To change attitudes by promoting practical co-operation between the people of Ireland, North and South, so that people respect each others' traditions and achieve greater levels of economic, social and cultural co-operation.' In 1986, the schools and youth exchange programmes were initiated, and 10,000 teenagers each year are now involved in sporting, school and cultural projects in which Catholics and Protestants mix and learn to overcome some of the prejudices they have grown up with. Such a programme would not seem extraordinary, or even necessary on the British mainland. But in Ulster - where Catholic neighbourhoods are often separated from Protestant neighbourhoods by high fences or corrugated iron walls and where most children go to a school of their own faith - there is an all-too-clear need for such an initiative. Co-operation North sees its role as falling into the category of 'Track-two diplomacy', a term coined by two US academics in the early 1980s in a study on diplomacy and conflict resolution. The theory is to encourage informal, unofficial contact between members of adversarial groups in a structured and systematic way. By targeting sports clubs, youth groups, schools and workplaces, a wide range of people in both communities are brought together, the ultimate aim of which is gradually to shift public opinion from being bigoted and prejudiced, to one of tolerance. This facilitates the official 'Track-one' diplomacy, carried out by the political leaders, who can be encouraged to take bolder initiatives at the negotiating table if they are aware that their constituents are more likely to be receptive to them. In Northern Ireland's case, there is still clearly a long way to go, but measurable progress has been achieved and efforts are being made to expand the scope of Co-operation North's work. An independent study commissioned recently by Co-operation North, found that, as a result of the exchanges, attitudes did change in a positive direction, but also noted that most of the teenagers participating in the school exchange schemes were primarily Catholic and from middle and upper class backgrounds. A spokeswoman for the organisation in Dublin said: 'The study has helped us to focus more clearly the groups we need to reach and we are now in the process of broadening and extending our work to the more disadvantaged communities of both denominations'. The EC, and the British and Irish governments have strongly endorsed the work of Co-operation North, and between them provide around 25 per cent of the organisation's annual Pounds 1.5m budget. In its last annual report, Co-operation North noted that 'to attain the critical mass estimated as necessary to achieve a large-scale impact on the situation, Co-operation North believes that its required annual budget would need to be Pounds 2.5m. It is quite clear that the organisation will have to move from an annual fund-raising strategy to the establishment of an endowment fund and more permanent funding arrangements with its institutional and corporate donors'. The balance of the organisation's funds presently come from donations, fund-raising activities and contributions from the International Fund for Ireland. Most of the major corporations north and south of the border are already supporting the organisation with regular donations.</p>

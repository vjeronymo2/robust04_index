			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / DTI gains Pounds 62m insolvency spin-off: Figures show rise in bankruptcies and liquidations THE government generated Pounds 62m in fees and income from interest last year from the assets of insolvent companies and individuals, the annual report of the Insolvency Service showed yesterday. The unaudited figures appear in the accounts for the year to March 31 from the Insolvency Service, an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry under the government's Next Steps initiative. Net income from interest on the proceeds of assets held in the Insolvency Services Investment Account totalling Pounds 27m was retained by the agency in 1991-92. That compared with Pounds 26m last year. The agency paid the DTI fee income of Pounds 20m generated from accounts held on behalf of insolvency practitioners and Pounds 16m from charges levied by the official receivers. That compares with Pounds 16m and Pounds 8m respectively in the previous year. Receipts into the official insolvency service account - in which all realisations of assets from bankruptcies and liquidations must be held under UK law - were Pounds 397m in 1991-92 compared with Pounds 329m in 1990-91. The agency's costs rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 56.9m last year, including a 14 per cent increase in staff costs to Pounds 30.8m. Mr Peter Joyce, inspector general and chief executive of the service, said the growing number of cases meant that the maintenance even of minimum standards of case administration had 'proved increasingly difficult'. There were 26,186 bankruptcies and 8,911 compulsory liquidations in 1991-92. That compared with 14,359 and 6,777 respectively in the previous year, and a projected estimate for bankruptcies and liquidations of 20,500. The number of cases forwarded to the courts to rule on disqualifying or prosecuting directors and bankrupts rose as a proportion of all cases considered by the service. Mr Joyce said this was the result of increased targeting and recent case law which had clarified the circumstances under which courts were prepared to take action. Four insolvency practitioners and two managers were convicted of criminal offences during the year. A further five professionals had been charged and were awaiting trial.

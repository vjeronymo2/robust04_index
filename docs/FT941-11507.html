			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Bossi's League ponders alliance with Berlusconi The populist Northern League today begins a three-day congress in Bologna to agree the party's position ahead of Italy's March 27 general elections. The central issue confronting Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, is whether to accept an electoral alliance with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who entered the political arena last month with his Forza Italia (Come On Italy) movement. Mr Berlusconi has made no secret of his desire to forge a 'Liberal Democrat' electoral alliance with the League. The League's strong presence in northern Italy, alongside the huge media resources of Mr Berlusconi, is a potentially attractive combination. The League had nearly 9 per cent of the vote nationwide in the 1992 elections with a total of 79 members of parliament in both houses. With the first-past-the-post system the League could obtain some 150 seats in the chamber of deputies alone. Mr Berlusconi is claiming his own polling organisations are giving him 30 per cent of the vote. The League has chosen Bologna for its congress as a provocation to the former-communist Party of the Democratic Left, which has always regarded the city as its stronghold. Mr Bossi has limited the number of potential allies by falling out with the centrist grouping of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader. Mr Bossi rejected a deal negotiated by a lieutenant with Mr Segni because he suspected this would lead to a broader pact with members of the discredited Christian Democrat party, now renamed Popular party. In the same way, Mr Bossi has made it clear to Mr Berlusconi that he would be an unacceptable partner if he were to bring on board the National Alliance, the recently re-baptised neo-fascist MSI. Mr Bossi regards the National Alliance and its leader, Mr Gianfranco Fini, as an electoral liability with whom there is little common ground. Mr Berlusconi is making progress on a deal with National Alliance. The other issue to be resolved between Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi is the number of seats the League is willing to let Forza Italia contest in the north - and whether Mr Berlusconi should stand in Milan.</p>

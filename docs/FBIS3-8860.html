			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 16 (CTK) -- Slovak President  Michal Kovac said tonight the new Slovak Government should prove  that Slovakia was a consolidated, stable, and democratic country  which creates conditions for cooperation with any solid  political and trade partner.    Appointing the new government, Kovac called on the new  cabinet members to carry on the processes of transformation  which have already yielded positive results. But he supported  "a search for matter-of-fact solutions where the steps taken by  the previous government were politicized."    Kovac explained Vladimir Meciar's dismissal by disagreement  with "the autocratic method (of work) of the prime minister and  some government members." He rejected their tendency to  concentrate power and defended democracy and morality in  politics. At the same time he praised Meciar's contribution to  the shaping of Slovak statehood.    Kovac said he considered the Hungarian parliamentary  parties'  support for the new government an "expression of loyalty towards  the Slovak Republic."    One of the major tasks of Moravcik's government is lessening  "the incomprehensible and dangerous hostility between various  groups of citizens," Kovac said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Our Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  held a news conference in Kiev today. Here is our correspondent  Vasyl Kukurichka with his story.    [Kukurichka] At the news conference Vitaliy Radetskyy summed  up the results of his official visit to the United States of  America. As the defense minister pointed out, the visit was very  rich in events and, in his opinion, it was fruitful for both  sides. Ukrainian Radio World Service had informed its listeners  in detail about the visit in progress, therefore, I will not  repeat what has already been said about this.    So, what was the main objective of this visit, says  Ukraine's  Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy.    [Begin Radetskyy recording] Our delegation linked the main  objective of its visit to the United States of America with the  expansion and improvement of bilateral relations between the  military departments, and also the fulfillment by the sides of  the obligations assumed earlier. In particular, this refers to  the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the  United States, and Russia; to Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and  provision of relevant assistance to it. The issue on Ukraine's  accession to the Partnership for Peace was considered rather  extensively.    During the course of the visit the delegation visited a  number of important military facilities in the United States of  America and took part in several military exercises. [sentence  as heard] Agreements were reached between the military  departments in numerous trends of military cooperation. In  connection with this, a military contacts plan was specified and  complemented. In particular, the sides agreed to establish a  direct telephone communication line between the ministries of  both countries, and to send a group of Ukrainian Armed Forces  officers to undergo studies and training at the relevant  educational centers in the United States. We also agreed on  naval forces, on the land-based grouping, and also on the  antiaircraft forces. We will send officers there for one month  or three months long training.    We agreed on a regular exchange of materials and information  on military issues, on the preparation and holding of joint  military exercises in 1995, and on other issues.    The fact that already, as of 30 May, the United States of  America retargeted its strategic missiles, earlier targeted at  Ukraine, became an outstanding event for us. We have long been  waiting for this, the more so since Ukrainian missiles underwent  such a procedure in December 1993. Dr. William Perry had an  opportunity to satisfy himself personally, during his latest  visit to Ukraine in March this year, that the process of nuclear  disarmament is going on consistently and irreversibly.    In its turn, at a missile site in South Dakota, our  delegation members had an opportunity to see several silos, used  for intercontinental missiles of the Minuteman-2 type, that were  destroyed or prepared for destruction.    The fact that we had an opportunity to immediately  participate in the destruction of one of such silos was an  important event. Deputy to Mr. William Perry, Dr. Carter and  myself pushed the launch button and the silo ceased to exist.    Very useful was our meeting with the leaders and leading  specialists of the Rand Corporation, which is one of the most  important research centers in the United States in the sphere of  national security and defense issues. In my speech there I set  out the main provisions of the national security doctrine of the  Ukrainian state within the context of new possibilities for  international cooperation.    Meetings with the Ukrainian community in Chicago made an  unforgettable impression on all the members of our delegation,  and me personally. I felt it my duty to deliver a speech there  on the general situation in Ukraine, the general problems of  building its Armed Forces, the development of military  cooperation, and then answered questions. Our compatriots  deserve high esteem. They gave us a very good reception. They  were interested in knowing everything about the developments in  Ukraine. As for nostalgia, it always remains a nostalgia.    Therefore, I believe that the visit was useful for both  sides. We reached such a level of understanding with the U.S.  side, which gives grounds to hope for a dynamic development of  mutual relations between the military departments, and for good  relations between our nations in general.    [Kukurichka] That was an official assessment of the visit by  Ukraine's military delegation to the United States made by  Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at a news  conference in Kiev on 23 June. The report was filed by Vasyl  Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World Service.</p>

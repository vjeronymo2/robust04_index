			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Precedent fears follow Inland Revenue ruling The Law Lords yesterday ruled against Matrix Securities, the investment adviser which tried to launch an Enterprise Zone Trust in the London Docklands, in a judgment with potentially wide-ranging implications for taxpayers. Five law lords agreed unanimously that the Inland Revenue was entitled to overrule the pre-clearance given on an investment scheme by an inspector not qualified to make the decision. The judgment triggered warnings from tax practitioners that it could set a dangerous precedent in the knowledge required by taxpayers seeking Revenue rulings. Mr Peter Wyman, head of tax for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said it suggested that in future the taxpayer would have an obligation to know to whom in the Revenue they had to send any proposal for clearance. He said a judgment in favour of Matrix would have been against the interests of equity, but that the implications were 'deeply worrying and a bad precedent'. The Revenue confirmed that it believed the impact of the judgment was that taxpayers seeking pre-clearance had to reveal all relevant information, indicate that they were seeking fully considered guidance, and approach the appropriate division or grade of inspector. The Matrix South Quay scheme was launched last September. According to Mr David Royds, chairman of Matrix Securities, it had almost raised its full subscription of Pounds 95m before the Revenue withdrew its clearance on October 8. The judgment in the House of Lords upheld findings in favour of the Revenue against Matrix in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Mr Royds said he was 'very disappointed and surprised' at the decision and that the company was still studying the judgment to see what further action it might take. The law lords were critical of the tax inspector who provided initial clearance, and who admitted he had not read all details of the case. The Revenue would not comment on his fate. It said last night: 'What happens to him will be an internal management matter. He came under a great deal of pressure to deal quickly with a very complicated tax avoidance scheme.'</p>

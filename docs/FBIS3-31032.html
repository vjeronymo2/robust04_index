			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president of the republic's spokesman reports  that President of the Republic Sali Berisha hailed NATO's  ultimate decision to undertake air strikes if the 10-day  deadline to withdraw heavy weapons from around Sarajevo is not  respected or if further bombardments of this city take place,  with the conviction that this decision will contribute to  accelerating the establishment of peace in the Republic of  Bosnia. Berisha also stressed that Albania reconfirms its offer  of airport facilities that NATO may need to accomplish its  missions within the UN framework.    He also considered the U.S. Administration's decision to  recognize the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as important  for stability in the region and stressed that the resolution of  the contradictions between our two neighbors, Greece and  Macedonia, regarding the name and symbols, is in the interests  not only of the bilateral relations of these countries but also  of stability in the south of the Balkans.</p>

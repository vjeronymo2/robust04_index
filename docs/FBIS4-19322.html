			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- For Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party of Germany), the dispatch of German soldiers to  territories in the former Yugoslavia is no issue. Even if a  decision by the Constitutional Court should allow the  participation of the Bundeswehr in armed blue beret missions, as  it is generally expected to do, German soldiers would not be  deployed in the former Yugoslavia, Kinkel told DPA today.    The participation of Bundeswehr soldiers would have to be  approved in every individual case by the Bundestag, the foreign  minister stressed. An approval by the Bundestag for an armed or  even unarmed German mission in the former Yugoslavia is  certainly not to be expected. Thus, this problem is not topical.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union)  expressed  a similar view at the end of last week. "In this part of  Europe, the memory of World War II is particularly present.  Thus, one must ask oneself the question whether German help --  no matter what kind -- is welcome at all," the chancellor stated  in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. The chairman of the  Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union, Wolfgang Schaeuble, basically advocated  participation in military operations in Bosnia in an interview  with the Cologne EXPRESS (Saturday edition). However, this is  only possible "if all those affected agree."</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Double trouble - Global financial trading groups must guard against inadvertently paying tax twice over Foreign companies operating in the US will have drawn little comfort from President-elect Bill Clinton's campaign boast that he could increase revenues by more than Dollars 10bn a year by 'preventing tax avoidance by foreign corporations'. The extent to which Mr Clinton intends to act on his threat remains to be seen, particularly in light of last week's better than expected third-quarter US growth figures. What seems certain is that Congress will reintroduce foreign income tax legislation early next year. Congress originally considered the legislation last May but shelved it because of the US elections. If passed, the bill would, among other things, require foreign companies to report minimum taxable income in the US regardless of the true profitabilility or otherwise of their US-affiliates; the sale of shares in US companies would also be taxed. The implications of this tax assault on foreign companies in the US could be far-reaching. Indeed, US efforts to increase tax revenues without raising taxation on individuals is already beginning to have an impact on global financial trading. According to Mr James macLachlan, a partner in the London office of the international law firm, Baker &amp; McKenzie, the risk of inadvertently becoming liable to tax in several jurisdictions for capital markets' trading profits is now 'one of the most critical issues facing global financial dealers'. Billions of dollars of financial products are traded globally daily. In the market for financial derivatives alone, Dollars 923.4bn of swaps - the trade of one form of debt for another - were written in the first half of 1991. The implications of being assessed for tax on the profits of this trade in more than one jurisdiction are far-reaching. The problem is compounded by the fact that different jurisdictions apply different rules in determining where income is properly taxable and what can be deducted against it. The US rules are particularly ambiguous. In spite of the growth in global trading in financial products in recent years, the US has not adopted a comprehensive tax regime aimed specifically at determining the geographic source of a company's income on a global deal. Instead, the US continues to tax global traders under a regime designed to levy multinationals engaged in more traditional global trade such as manufacturing. According to Baker &amp; McKenzie's US tax lawyers, applying this traditional tax regime to global trading has resulted in tax rules which are 'ambiguous, hard to comply with and which could potentially result in double taxation of income from global trading' - as Australia's Westpac Banking Corporation recently discovered to its cost. Earlier this month Westpac announced it would halve its final dividend after being hit by a previously undisclosed US tax liability of ADollars 115m (Pounds 52m). The tax charge related to interest rate and currency swaps assigned between Westpac's New York branch and other non-US branches in 1991-92. The liability came to light during preparation of the bank's 1991 tax return. Coming on top of a undersubscribed ADollars 1.2bn rights issue, the tax liability was disastrous news for Westpac. The difficulty of allocating profits and losses geographically on such transactions is widely acknowledged. Global trading is done in a 24-hour market; deals originating in New York may not be realised as profit until the contract is closed hours later in Tokyo or London. The inference drawn from the Westpac case is that there is a clear risk the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will treat a given swap, regardless of where it was done, as connected to the trade or business of a foreign dealer in the US - therefore as US income subject to US tax. It also appears that corresponding expenses or losses on the swap book incurred by offshore branches are not deductible in the US against that US income. Westpac was forced to pay US taxes on profits on which it had already paid income tax in other countries, yet was unable to offset losses on matching deals. Westpac is not alone in being exposed to this double risk. Many other financial institutions could also find themselves in the same position. So what can they do? Mr macLachlan says there are two options. First, negotiate an advance ruling with the tax authorities setting out a simple basis on which trading profits will be allocated to each country involved in a deal. Second, dealers should spend time and money restructuring their operations to minimise the risk of double taxation. This requires close back office scrutiny of where deals are done. The trouble with negotiating advanced rulings with tax authorities is that several countries, notably the UK, have long opposed giving advance rulings on the tax treatment of global financial dealings. They are also generally opposed to allocating profit by pre-determined arbitrary formulae not related to the way a group's business is actually organised. There is an additional problem in the UK. The Inland Revenue lacks the resources to provide this sort of service to taxpayers and, in the context of global financial trading, it also lacks expertise. The US has no such problems. The IRS recently introduced just such an advanced pricing agreement (APA). France, Italy and Belgium have told the US they want nothing to do with APAs, while the UK Inland Revenue's position appears to be shifting. Japan's Sumitomo Bank recently secured an APA from the IRS which was accepted by the US and the Hong Kong tax authorities. Barclays Bank is believed to have negotiated a bilateral APA for its US/UK capital market operations. A further 20-30 applications for APAs are pending with the IRS. APAs are not without difficulties and so are unlikely to satisfy everyone. APAs can take years to negotiate; they require full disclosures; not all countries are willing to participate; APAs only last three years; they create a tax result totally out of line with group commercial accounting practices (a problem still unresolved); APAs are arbitrary and might result in one country getting a bigger slice of tax than it should. The message to financial institutions from the Westpac saga and the aggressive attempts being made by the IRS to maximise tax revenues is simple: corporations need to review their global tax strategy. Companies must ask themselves whether they are exposed to double or multiple taxation and, if they are, whether they can improve their arrangements within existing tax rules, or whether it would be sensible to seek an APA. Ultimately, traders know that political realities will restrain tax authorities' pursuit of tax revenues from global trading. Even the US cannot afford to risk driving international capital markets offshore to rival money centres by being too aggressive over tax.</p>

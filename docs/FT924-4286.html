			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Singel regulatory body for accountants and auditors ONE INDEPENDENT body should set standards for and regulate both accountants and auditors, a leading accountant says today. Mr John Roques, senior partner and chief executive of Touche Ross, says in the FT's accountancy column that removing these powers from the accountants' professional bodies is the only way to restore public confidence. He says that the Financial Reporting Council, which controls the Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Reporting Review Panel, should also control audit regulation, the Auditing Practices Board and ethical guidelines for the accountancy profession.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has called on ANC [African  National Congress] members currently serving on the SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] Board to quit the ANC or  resign from the board. Welcoming the appointment of the  Independent Media Commission [IMC], DP Spokesman Peter Soal said  it is going to be very interesting to see how the IMC will react  to what he calls the increasing partiality of the SABC toward  the ANC:    [Begin Soal recording] Firstly, the chairperson of the  board,  Mrs. Matsepe-Casaburri, has said that she is a member of the  ANC, and I believe that she should resign, either from the SABC  Board or from the ANC. Senior persons at the SABC have been  nominated to be on the ANC list for election, but they remain in  their positions at the SABC. So I think that they should either  resign from the SABC, or declare that they are not ANC  candidates. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Silver lining behind Japanese economic clouds - The quickening pace of reform in the Tokyo corporate bond market WHILE Tokyo financial markets found little comfort in the Japanese government's emergency economic package unveiled on Tuesday, companies welcomed proposals that could quicken the pace of reform in the country's corporate bond market. The government indicated this week it wanted to eliminate limits on corporate bond issuance, allowing a broader range of companies to raise funds through a wider range of instruments. Currently, only companies with market capitalisation of more than Y100bn (Dollars 743m), and which have over Y100bn shares traded on the stock market annually, are allowed to issue straight bonds. These restrictions will now be relaxed. Companies will also be allowed to issue bonds with one and two-year maturity and floating rate notes. Deregulation of the corporate bond market is already underway, in line with the Ministry of Finance's dismantling of the barrier between the banking and securities industries, slated for next year. Banks are expected to enter the underwriting business, currently dominated by the big four brokerages - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities. The commission-bank system, in which every issue has a bank that acts as an agent representing investors, is also expected to be abolished. Banks will have the most to lose since they will forfeit high fee revenue as the agent bank. Also, corporate bonds with shorter maturities will compete against banking deposits, while floating rate notes are an attractive alternative to short-term bank lending. Daiwa Securities said that although it may take more than two years for legislative changes, the calls for reforms pointed to a more larger and liquid corporate bond market in Japan. In the past, Japanese companies have relied on banks for financing, and in the peak of the bull market in the late 1980s turned to cheap equity-linked financing. In the last quarter of 1989, Japanese companies raised Y9,000bn through equity-linked issues. However, with the stock market's slump, sources of financing have dried up for companies. New share issues during the fiscal year to March 1992 plunged 48 per cent from the previous year to Y243.9bn. Banks, which face increasing bad loans, need to widen profit margins, and are reluctant to lower rates despite a decline in the official discount rate. Although demand for funds has subsided briefly due to the current lull in the Japanese economy, financing needs for Japanese companies are expected to rise from the middle of this year due to repayments on the equity-linked issues. According to Daiwa Securities, Japanese companies will see a total of Y6,950bn equity-linked debt maturing in the year ending March 1993. The amount is expected to rise to Y9,000 in the year ending March 1994. Economists also predict Japanese companies will need to start financing themselves for capital investment once the economy picks up, the consensus being during the third quarter of this year. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said although the proposals were not revolutionary, and the pace of change is expected to be gradual, further restructuring of the corporate bond market would provide an option for Japanese companies.

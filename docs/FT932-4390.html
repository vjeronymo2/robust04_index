			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Microsoft and Xerox in PC link venture MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, has formed a partnership with Xerox, the office products and imaging company, to develop technology aimed at integrating copying machines and other office document products into PC networks. PCs and document products are most often unconnected or incompatible, hindering workflow and productivity. The companies said that they would work to define and develop software products that streamline processes for the creation, production and distribution of documents. Microsoft and Xerox have agreed to deliver a new generation of document products and PC software. The companies said that they were also collaborating on related unspecified business initiatives. 'This partnership, allowing the integration of document products and PCs, will result in products that change the way people work,' said Mr Bill Gates, chief executive of Microsoft. As well as jointly developing technology, the companies will co-operate in marketing, sales and promotional activities. Specific terms are subject to negotiation of a final agreement between the companies. The agreement between Microsoft and Xerox comes on the eve of a Microsoft announcement that is expected to include partnership agreements with several other office products companies including Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer, Minolta, Ricoh and Ericsson. In an audacious marketing campaign, Computer Associates International will herald its entry into the consumer PC software market by dis-tributing 1m free copies of its new personal finance software, Kiplinger's CA-Simply Money. CA will send free copies to the first 1m people in the US who request the program. The product and the marketing campaign are directed at home PC users. The software provides advice on how to manage personal finances. In a survey commissioned by CA, the Gallup organisation found that nearly 31 per cent of those contacted have a PC at home, but only 29 per cent of them use personal finance software.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valer Kalinowski: "Shushkevich on Clinton's Visit </F> to Belarus]    [Text] [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich has  described the upcoming 16 January official visit by U.S.  President Bill Clinton as an important and positive event for  Belarus. Currently, special committees are preparing and  drafting special interstate agreements. Stanislav Shushkevich  emphasized that an array of important agreements is to be signed  during the visit. In his opinion, the main goal of the visit is  to clarify positions on the main strategic objectives of our  policy and, in particular, the issue of Belarus' security. We  would like to obtain guarantees for the protection of our  neutrality -- such as Finland once received from the United  States and the USSR -- when Belarus implements its  constitutional law on neutrality and nonnuclear status, stressed  Stanislav Shushkevich. Additionally, the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet chairman noted that he does not expect that such a  statement can be voiced by the United States already on 16  January, however certain steps will undoubtedly be made.    Commenting on Bill Clinton's "Partnership for Peace"  initiative, Stanislav Shushkevich stated that he considers it  expedient to examine Belarus' official strategy in establishing  in Central Europe a belt of neutral states with certain  guarantees from great states of the world.    Additionally, Stanislav Shushkevich believes that Bill  Clinton's visit to Minsk will contribute to Belarus'  international image and encourage U.S. investment in its economy.</p>

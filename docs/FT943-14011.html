			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hoechst says it may close plants Hoechst, the German chemicals company, said yesterday it might close plants in the drive to return its west European fibres sector to profit by the end of 1995. There were no immediate plans for closures, but the company's west European fibres operations lost between DM200m-DM300m (Dollars 123m-Dollars 184m) last year, said Mr Hans Udo Wenzel, appointed a week ago as managing director of Hoechst Trevira, the fibres arm. Hoechst Trevira, a new company which will employ 5,000, is the result of a decision by the parent company to concentrate its European fibre business into a wholly-owned but separate company. It will start operations on October 1. It was created as a response to 'structural problems in western European fibres, textile and clothing industries. Traditional suppliers are facing increasing pressure on prices and cheap imports from Asia and eastern Europe,' said the company. Earlier this year Hoechst said it would cut 2,000 jobs in the fibres sector and introduce performance-related pay. Mr Wenzel said he could not rule out further job cuts to put the fibre business back on track by the end of 1995. Environmental operating costs in Germany in 1993 at Bayer were Dollars 816.2m, not Dollars 81.62m as published in a table in the Chemicals in the Environment survey (June 30). The figure in the total spending column should have read Dollars 1,102.17m and in the percentage of sales column, 4.45 per cent.</p>

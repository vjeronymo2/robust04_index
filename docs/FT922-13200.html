Restructuring continues in the European insurance sector where Skandia, Sweden's leading insurer, strengthened its Scandinavian and international position by agreeing to take over Hafnia. The deal turns the tables on Denmark's loss-making number two insurer, which bought heavily into Skandia late last year, in tandem with Uni Storebrand of Norway. Rubbing salt into the wound, Uni Storebrand is swapping most of its stake in Skandia for Skandia's reinsurance operations outside North America. Willis Corroon, the world's second-largest insurance broker, added to its European network by taking a 20 per cent stake in C Wuppesahl, a German insurance broker. Partnerships continue to develop between international airlines. The Belgian government finally approved the alliance between Sabena, the loss-making state-owned airline and French flag carrier Air France. The Government of Nauru, the guano-rich Pacific island, posted a revised takeover bid for Compass Airlines, a failed Australian carrier. The latest western luxury retailing name to be taken over by a Far Eastern concern is French shoe maker Charles Jourdan, being bought by Dickson Concepts of Hong Kong. Cadbury Schweppes is acquiring a foothold in the German confectionery market by buying 70 per cent of chocolate and sweets maker Piasten Schokoladenfabrik. Spanish dairy group Industrial Quesera agreed in principle to merge its interests with Kraft General Foods.</p>

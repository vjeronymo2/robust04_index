			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stefano Folli: "Center's Two Tendencies Play </F> Key Match"]    [Text] Rome -- "The Pact's guarantor is [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni. And if he leads the Pact it is he that must  provide the pointers, otherwise...." This remark by one of  Segni's close aides last night reflected the dramatic day  experienced by the center. In an interview with IL MESSAGGERO,  [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Deputy] Rocco Buttiglione offered  the following significant viewpoint: RAI [state radio and  television service] and Fininvest "have come to an agreement to  attack the center, but this exposes Italy to disaster."    Buttiglione's anxiety reflects the real anguish currently  pervading the moderate center of [PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli  and Segni. Mortifying election figures are circulating -- the  result of secret polls regarding whose reliability all doubts  are justified, but whose psychological repercussions are  obvious. The Pact and the PPI are in difficulty, both for  general political reasons [Forza Italia leader] (Berlusconi's  offensive) and because of the complex problem of the candidates.  On this latter point their agreement is in serious trouble, and  indeed there is a fierce conflict, as was shown by yesterday's  meeting between Segni and Martinazzoli.    The first and second aspects are more closely connected than  they may appear. [Senate Speaker] Giovanni Spadolini yesterday  went so far as to compare the present climate to that of 1948 --  "The climate described by Guareschi, with Peppone and Don  Camillo." This was a paradoxical way of indicating the same  danger as Buttiglione cited -- the disappearance of the center,  crushed like pre-war Poland by the impact of two giants.  Indeed, if Italy really does venture into the unexplored  territory of bipolarity, between Berlusconi and [Democratic  Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Occhetto, the moderates will  have too small an electoral territory to be able to guarantee  the survival of the species. On the other hand, there would be  substantial political scope after the election if parliament  failed to produce a definite majority.    Thus the center's internal balance -- that is, the  substantive relationship between the new Popular Party and the  Pact -- would become the crucial factor, both in order to  prevent the elections from proving a failure and above all in  choosing what role to perform in the next parliament. Behind  the conflict between Martinazzoli and Segni over the  investigatees, the "new faces," and the unity of the future  parliamentary group, one can perceive the outlines of a more  troublesome political problem. Segni is trying to prevent the  imprint of the new populist left from becoming decisive in the  Pact-PPI alliance. Martinazzoli is concerning himself with  defending the de facto hegemony of the Catholic-Popular Party  group over the Segni group and will not accept any vetoes that  would alter the characteristics of the relationship.    From this viewpoint, the Mattarella case is symbolic. By  attacking him, Segni is trying to bring down one of the leaders  of the PPI's internal left, even at the cost of appearing like a  "executioner," as Martinazzoli warned yesterday evening. What  is at stake is not only the image but also the political  proposal to be put to the voters. Segni can feel Berlusconi  hard on his heels, as he starts to encroach on Pact territory,  especially in the first- past-the-post constituencies of central  Italy on which the moderate centrists are pinning their last  remaining hopes. In order to withstand the increasingly tough  struggle, the Pact leader needs to expand a little to the right.  The main objective is to salvage his vote, and the subsidiary  objective is to have sufficient strength and credibility to  negotiate a possible future armistice with the expanding enemy.    But there is also the problem of the future. Depending on  the new parliamentary group's composition, on who constitutes  it, this or that policy line will enjoy credibility. Segni  still clings to his vision of a moderate rally that he can lead.  Martinazzoli, custodian of the PPI identity, is willing to  accept being confined to a small minority, but remains loyal to  his option for the center-left. The former is looking toward  the public tempted by Berlusconi, while the latter is thinking  -- like Spadolini and Amato -- about the problematic balances in  the next parliament.</p>

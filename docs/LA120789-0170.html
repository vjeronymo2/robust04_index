			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SANCTIONS OF JAPAN INEVITABLE, SENATOR SAYS;  </P> <P> TRADE: FRANK H. MURKOWSKI SAID PUNISHING THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WOULD HAVE A  'SYMBOLIC' IMPACT.  </P> <P> Sen. Frank H. Murkowski said Wednesday that he believes it inevitable that the  United States will impose retaliatory sanctions against Japan in the simmering  dispute over foreign access to Tokyo's public works construction market.  </P> <P> Murkowski (R-Alaska) told reporters here that sanctions in the construction  sector would have a "symbolic" impact and would encourage Japan to make  concessions on a range of other trade issues under dispute.  </P> <P> "I think it will have to come to a 301 because of the way the system (in Japan)  works," Murkowski said, referring to Section 301 in the U.S. Trade Law, which  provides for punitive sanctions. "They need something to come down to justify a  reaction."  </P> <P> Murkowski, co-chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee  on East Asian and Pacific affairs, said some significant progress has been made  in licensing and opening public works bidding to American construction  companies since the issue emerged three years ago. But he complained that there  has been no comparable access for U.S. architectural, engineering and design  firms.  </P> <P> "The perception in the United States is one of inequity," Murkowski said. "Our  markets are open. Why aren't yours?"  </P> <P> On the whole, Murkowski was upbeat about Japan's progress in opening its  construction market. As many as 17 major public works projects have been open  to foreign bidding, and 13 U.S. construction companies have now obtained  licenses here, obtaining about $65 million in contracts through joint venture  arrangements, he said.  </P> <P> But that falls far short of the $2.4 billion in annual business claimed by  Japanese contractors in the United States, he added.  </P> <P> Moreover, the two American design firms licensed in Japan have been unable to  find joint venture partners here and therefore remain locked out, he said. The  Japanese government and the construction industry should establish "ground  rules" that would allow such firms to tie up with local partners, Murkowski  said.  </P> <P> Last month, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills submitted a report to  Congress criticizing the pervasiveness of dango, or collusive bidding, in  Japan's construction industry. The report said an arcane system of awarding  public works contracts to insiders deprives American companies of competitive  opportunities here.  </P> <P> Hills, however, chose not to recommend that trade sanctions be imposed at this  time, recognizing that the Japanese side has made improvements in market access  for foreign competitors.  </P> <P> Murkowski, who is visiting Tokyo for talks with Japanese government and  construction industry officials, has been an outspoken advocate of a tougher  line against Japan in the construction trade dispute.  </P> <P> He conceded Wednesday that he played a key role in prodding the Justice  Department to seek about $35 million in punitive damages against a cartel of  Japanese firms that the Japan Fair Trade Commission ruled had rigged bids on  contracts at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka between 1984 and 1987.  </P> <P> "We raised hell with the Navy and went to the Justice Department and stirred  the pot," Murkowski said.  </P> <P> In an unprecedented move, a Justice Department lawyer visited Tokyo last month  and threatened cartel members with legal action in the United States unless  they paid damages in connection with the Yokosuka dango case.  </P> <P> Hours before Hills announced her findings in Washington on Nov. 22, leading  companies in the cartel agreed to pay about $32 million in an out-of-court  settlement. Murkowski said the firms feared being cut off from future Pentagon  contracts, as well as facing litigation under U.S. antitrust law.  </P></p>

Akhundlu: "There Is No Peace on the Border: </F> Notes from an Expanded Meeting of the Border Troops Directorate  of the Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security"]    [Text] The Azeri Republic Ministry of National Security  border troops serve their duty in complex operational  conditions. As was already reported, during combat actions  Armenian armed formations reached the Azeri-Iranian border and  now a significant part of Azeri territory is under their  control. Tens of thousands of refugees from regions occupied by  the enemy are also concentrated on the border. This diverts  personnel from their primary duties, and border troops are  participating in combat operations, distributing humanitarian  aid coming from the Iranian side, and conducting scheduled  activities in regions where camps for refugees in the border  zone are located.    Special difficulties in serving on the border arise from the  incompetence of personnel at the military posts of Dzhalilabad  and Yardymly, where frequent attempts are made to cross the  border and bring in contraband.    The border in the Geytepe section is not being guarded  properly. Smuggling and the driving of livestock to the  neighboring country often occur under the "patronage" of certain  associates of state and law enforcement organs and soldiers.    A difficult situation has taken shape on the northern  borders  of our republic. Last year certain leaders of the Dagestan  society Sadval intended to create tension in this zone and  resorted to direct provocation. Thus, someone with the nickname  of Alik from time to time approached the Samur post at  Yalaminskiy Checkpoint with his detachment and using firearms  tried to provoke a confrontation and threatened the Azeri border  troops. As it became clear, this group is closely linked to  associates of the militsia and GAI [State Automobile Inspection]  of Magerramkentskiy Rayon, which adjoins our republic. More than  once militsia associates on Dagestan's territory have beaten up  drivers of motor vehicles going from Azerbaijan to the Russian  Federation.    One might say the measures which our republic's leadership  is  taking to resolve the problems of the local Lezghin population  are to some extent reducing tension. But the situation on the  northern border of Azerbaijan also depends to a considerable  extent on the actions of criminal elements who are sowing  hostility among our peoples. The rayon public should take a  stand here and rebuff the provocations.    Last year about 3,000 people tried to cross the border with  Iran. They were citizens of Turkey, Ukraine, Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan, and Iran. More than 13 million rubles and about 1.5  million manats, 3 million rials, 45,000 U.S. dollars, hundreds  of head of cattle, sheep, and goats, firearms, cartridges,  narcotics, and tonnes of aluminum and copper were confiscated  from offenders. All this was discussed at the expanded meeting  of the republic Ministry of National Security's Border Troop  Directorate.    As was noted at the meeting, the benefit from the border  troops could be more appreciable if military discipline were  more carefully observed at military posts and officers and  soldiers were more vigilant, honest, and professionally trained.  The fact that during the year 100 officers and warrant officers  were discharged from the border troops for various violations is  also alarming.    And 1994 will not be a simple one for the border troops  either, and a number of proposals to step up the Directorate's  activity and raise the professional attributes of personnel were  adopted at the meeting.</p>

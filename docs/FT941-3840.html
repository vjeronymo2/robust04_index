			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK softens stance on EU vote: Compromise on blocking vote might prompt Tory backbench rebellion The British government last night prepared the ground for a possible compromise in a dispute over its power to block Brussels legislation. Downing Street officials indicated ahead of today's meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels that Britain might not veto a proposal to raise from 23 to 27 the number of votes needed to block legislation. Britain wants to avoid being blamed for jeopardising the Community's enlargement. Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, who have been opposing the proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next January. European officials said British ministers had appeared to support a Spanish proposal which would allow the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23 provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes. That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block decisions by the EU Council of Ministers, possibly until an EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 when voting weights could be renegotiated. Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on the entry of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the European Parliament and help smooth remaining obstacles to Norway's entry. However, UK government business managers are worried about possible backbench rebellions by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs and have warned ministers of the difficulty of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they agree to compromise. Their fears were highlighted last night when some backbench MPs voiced their opposition to any compromise at a meeting of the Conservative European Affairs committee. At present, the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76, distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90. But as Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading Conservative Euro-sceptics said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr William Cash, one of the leading Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not put up with 'more erosion' of its powers. Some Euro-sceptics said last night that they expected Mr Major to 'prevent the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from making any compromise in the interests of party unity'. Faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners or its Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would only pick the latter if it was confident of limiting any backbench rebellion. Mr Major's officials said he was determined to defend British interests in an enlarged Community 'and get enlargement'. The Foreign Office last night said it had not received any acceptable offer over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its commitment to enlarging the union. Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some sort will emerge'. Senior British officials in Brussels signalled more than two weeks ago that they could accept the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were yesterday insisting there was no change in London's position. Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12. Anything more binding risks being turned down by the European Parliament. EU 'rescue' from effects of de-regulation, Page 12 Observer, Page 25</p>

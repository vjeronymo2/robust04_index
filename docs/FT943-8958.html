			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Trade victory for embattled Clinton: Deal 'agreed' on fast-track negotiating ability The embattled White House yesterday scored a much needed success when it reached agreement with House Republicans on a new trade negotiating authority allowing it to pursue new trade pacts in Latin American and Asia. The 'fast-track' negotiating authority enables the executive branch to negotiate trade agreements which Congress promises not to amend. It is seen as essential to President Clinton's credibility as he seeks trade liberalisation pacts beyond the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round and the North American Free Trade Agreement. A senior administration official said last night that the two sides had also resolved a big stumbling block to passage of the Uruguay Trade Round implementing legislation by agreeing a Dollars 12bn-Dollars 14bn financing package to compensate for lost tariff revenues. Under congressional budget deficit reduction rules, all legislation which incurs costs must be paid for when it is approved. The fast-track authority will be included in the House ways and means committee implementing legislation. The Senate finance committee has refused to include it, but when the two committees meet to resolve their differences, perhaps as early as next week, the administration believes the Senate conferees will accept the deal worked out. The senior official refused to give details of the deal. It is understood, however, that the administration has been forced to give up efforts to attach a provision which included environment and labour rules as negotiating objectives. However, there is no provision actually prohibiting such negotiations. Many Democrats have said they will oppose granting a fast-track authority without worker and environment rules. But the senior official said he believed there would be majorities in both houses to pass the implementing fast track legislation. Fears have been expressed on the left and right of both parties that by joining the World Trade Organisation, which will supersede Gatt, the US will be giving up some of its sovereignty. The administration is said to have agreed a provision allowing Congress to vote to withdraw from the WTO at some time in the future. Analysts say this is fairly meaningless, since the US constitution gives Congress authority over trade, and it could withdraw from anything it wants. The official said Mr Clinton's loss on the crime bill earlier this week would help, rather than hurt the Uruguay Round vote. 'The president is going to take the issue to the country. He will gain tremendous support and we will have a crime bill,' the official said. 'It will help us. It will show that this president has the ability to turn issues around.'</p>

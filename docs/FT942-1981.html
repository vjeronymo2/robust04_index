			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / German politicians decamp to the east Bonn, the seat of government, becomes a virtual political desert over the next few days as Germany's most senior politicians decamp to the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt. Government ministers are not going there to witness the outcome of the opposition Social Democrats special party congress which opens today in Halle, the second largest city in Saxony-Anhalt, tempting though it might be. The SPD hope to use the congress to end their internal squabbling, decide on an election strategy and nominate Mr Rudolf Scharping, party leader, as candidate for Chancellor. While the SPD charts their route to the October federal elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the FDP, and Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the FDP's former foreign minister, are in Halle to win support before the Saxon-Anhalts go to the polls to elect a new state parliament next Sunday. The locals, who probably have sighted a handful of Bonn's political elite since they were wooed during the last federal elections in 1990, have already caught several glimpses of Mr Kohl. His campaign managers have had the Chancellor visiting chemical works and refineries, digging foundations for new enterprises and shaking hands. Once called Red Halle because of its traditional socialist support, it was here that Mr Genscher, who was born in Halle, received a raptuous welcome soon after the Berlin Wall was torn down. But memories are short. A crowd of about 300 turned up in early June to hear him speak. But over 3,000 turned out for Mr Gregor Gysi, the charismatic leader of the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former east German communist party. Indeed, it is the appeal of the PDS, , who did well in the recent European Parliament and local government elections, which appear to be unsettling sections of the establishment. 'They are draining votes away from us,' sighed Ms Dagmar Szabados, the SPD vice-mayor of Halle. But Mr Kohl does not want to waste all his energy on the PDS. His high profile is designed to shore up the Saxony-Anhalt's incumbent CDU/FDP coalition, and attract back disillusioned voters to the FDP.</p>

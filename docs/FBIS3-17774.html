Yeltsin's </F> wife Naina Yeltsina in Sochi by Gennadiy Bochkarev; date not  given: "Conversation With President's Wife in Ready-to-Wear  Store"]    [Text] My telephone rang, and although the caller was not  phoning long-distance, the operator for some reason asked: "Is  that...." "Yes," I replied. "Naina Iosifovna will talk to you  now."    A few days ago I sent a letter to the Russian president's  dacha in Sochi asking Naina Yeltsina to give KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA an interview. Who but his wife knows more about the  president's health than any television news broadcasts? Who if  not the closest person to the president is most concerned about  his health?    We spoke on the telephone in "purely human terms." I did not  ask her the routine questions about Boris Nikolayevich's  weaknesses, but simply listened to a woman who has grown tired  of gossip and seems to have gotten confused.    She sighed: "Boris Nikolayevich is very patient with all  these false commentaries. He says: They'll get over it; pay no  attention. But how can you help paying attention when someone  is constantly poking their nose into your home? There is no  defense against gossip, and sometimes I want to go out onto the  street and scream: `Think again. Why is that so hard to do!'"    We met with Naina Iosifovna in a Sochi fashion house's  store.  The president's wife was buying gifts for her daughters and  grandchildren. She is very fond of Sochi knitwear. As she met  me Naina Yeltsina smiled and said: "Go ahead, ask your  questions."    [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, excuse me, but I cannot wait to  ask you this: Is it true that the Yeltsin family's favorite  singer is Filipp Kirkorov? I read that somewhere.    [Yeltsina] I don't know who wrote that. Boris Nikolayevich  has hardly heard Filipp Kirkorov at all, although I know some of  his songs. But you would do better to ask us before talking  about the Yeltsin family's taste in music. I like modern music,  but there is no accounting for taste. Not everyone in our  family likes Filipp Kirkorov's songs.    [Bochkarev] The president's family recently held a  housewarming. How are things at the new home?    [Yeltsina] We have not moved in yet, but there is a host of  varied rumors about our coming move. Actually, we are changing  accommodations for security reasons. Our next-door neighbors in  our old block sold their apartment and I don't even know who  bought it. It seems to be some commercial organization.    [Bochkarev] Is it that easy to buy an apartment next door to  the president?    [Yeltsina] There seems to be no difficulty in doing so.    [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, do you personally support the  president's policy?    [Yeltsina] Tell me, has your life personally changed for the  worse?    [Bochkarev] I suppose not.    [Yeltsina] You know that we talk to our friends. Believe  me, they are not top-ranking officials; they are ordinary  people, and none of them is complaining. I was in Sverdlovsk,  now Yekaterinburg, and I cannot say that life has deteriorated  there. Some people have it hard, some people have a difficult  life. But things are no worse! In my opinion, people have  received the most important thing -- freedom. No one harasses  you now and you have an opportunity to earn as much money as you  are capable of earning. And you can buy everything you want.  Look back over the decades: When did we have such plentiful  supplies in the stores? People still say that 80 percent of  Russians are below the poverty line. Do the other 20 percent  really buy up everything? Who believes that the businessmen in  our vast country have directed their attention to only 20  percent of the population?    [Bochkarev] Are you speaking as the president's wife?    [Yeltsina] Why are we here? When you read the newspapers  you get the impression that Boris Nikolayevich does not want  people to lead a better, easier life. How can this be  accomplished for everyone at once? Who is going to find a magic  way of making millions of people millionaires at a stroke?  Regrettably, programs of that kind are not on offer.  Regrettably, no one mentions the fact that the situation in  Russia is more favorable than it is in the other republics of  the former Union. That does not fit in with the opposition's  scenario. The president would probably be far more successful  if there were not the constant confrontation in society.    [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, do you feel like Russia's first  lady?    [Yeltsina] I am the president's wife. I am by his side, and  naturally we discuss some problems at home, but I never try to  influence his decisionmaking.    [Bochkarev] As a rule presidents' wives are involved in  charity foundations.    [Yeltsina] I don't head any foundations. I think that  people have simply gotten themselves well fixed up in some of  them....    I am very worried about the lamentable state of children's  health care. If equipment for a children's hospital is offered  as a gift, for instance, during official visits abroad, it is a  sin to refuse.    [Bochkarev] Don't you think that, when these protocol gifts  are handed over, the children comed to look like an honor guard  at official meetings? We came, we gave, we forgot....    [Yeltsina] Following what you call these protocol gifts, I  know that in at least one specific hospital a doctor can save a  child's life. What difference does it make how this equipment  got there -- by protocol or otherwise?    [Bochkarev] Tell me, do you call your husband Boris  Nikolayevich at home?    [Yeltsina] Are you joking? I just call him Borya.    [Bochkarev] Does the president ask his family for the latest  news "from the people"?    [Yeltsina] Naturally, our children work in normal  collectives where they discuss politics and the economy with  their colleagues, but none of us has managed to tell Boris  Nikolayevich a piece of news that he did not know.    [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, now we come to the last and  perhaps most sensitive question: How is your husband feeling?    [Yeltsina] No country in the world speculates as much as we  do about the president's health. He is indeed healthy! He came  to Sochi, he has had a change of scene [smenil obstanovku], and  that is as good as a vacation. He has played tennis and swum in  the sea. Is that really a basis for gossip to spread around the  world? What ailments haven't they devised for the president.  If he gets the flu, that means he is seriously ill; if he's  working at home, he's ill again. Boris Nikolayevich is not the  enemy of his own health, and if he were seriously ill he would  long since have quit his job. All this talk of illness is dirty  politics. Why have they suddenly caused this sensation?  Because 1996 is approaching and they have to somehow prove that  Boris Nikolayevich is a sick man. But, believe me, any gossip  is easier to bear than lies about his health....</p>

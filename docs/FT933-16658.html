			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Pawn and a white knight Mr Michael Pawn, the member for northern Cyprus, deserves thanks. He has diverted us, and made a sunny week delightful. His participation in the muddying of the waters in the case of Mr Asil Not-here produced stunning Wednesday theatre. The futile attempts by Madam Speaker to stop him must have been music to the ears of Sir Anthony Scribbler QC. The whole performance must have confused the courts and bamboozled the public. No one would then ask how much money his client, Mr Not-here, is alleged to have pocketed before he scarpered. The plot would be perfect if, following the Americans' line on General Noriega, Mr Not-here could be brought here. Perhaps the task could be given to Group 4, the security specialists. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservatives' chairman, could demonstrate that he is unafraid of revelations by the champion donor to party funds. He could arrange for this excellent firm, to which his connection has been noted, to kidnap our fugitive and bring him to court. Even if that denouement, which I recommend, is denied us, Mr Pawn's claim to Tory gratitude is safe. For he has rendered a service to the government: he has drawn attention to his own shortcomings, and thus, for a few blessed moments, directed our gaze away from the misfortunes of Mr John Major. Could he thus become known to history as the Pawn of Fate, the sincere idiot who not only made the mistake of helping Mr Nadir broadcast the cry of the accused throughout the ages - 'I wuz framed' - but who also inadvertently bequeathed the prime minister a necessary breathing space? In mad moments, in which one entertains the proposition that Mr Major will be PM until the year 2000, this is as realistic a postulate as any. Take it further. The recovery comes to life. The buoyancy of UK share prices continues. People perceive that there are jobs to be had and that house prices are no longer falling. Interest rate reductions in Germany and France are followed by cuts in Britain. The Tokyo meeting of the G7 gives Mr Major another week's respite from the rotten cabbages and custard pies of a relentless media audience. As the long summer break approaches, accidents stop happening to the government. Ordinary business is taken seriously. The proposed restructuring of police pay and administration tops one week's political agenda, the report of the Royal Commission on the Criminal Justice system another. The final Maastricht rebellion, the one that is supposed to erupt when the bill returns to the Commons, fizzles. Lose or scrape home, the Conservatives are less humiliated in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election than expected. Whew] August, that month of civic forgetfulness, passes safely by; the anniversary of Black Wednesday is a subdued affair and the Conservative party conference in October is not the destructive shambles we saw last year. Writing it down makes it impossible to believe, but it is what Mr Major's colleagues are praying for. Someone high up, I forget who, mumbled in my ear the other evening that what the prime minister needs is some good luck, 'like a Falkland's war'. Another relevant interlocutor commented that the first Black Wednesday, last September, had disenchanted the public while the second, the occasion of Mr Norman Lamont's resignation speech, had perhaps irrevocably damaged Mr Major's standing with his colleagues, particularly in the light of his poor parliamentary response. Perhaps the prime minister could make his own luck by finding a David R Gergen. Mr Gergen is the political professional, a former counsellor to three Republican presidents, brought in by the Democratic President Bill Clinton to strengthen his support staff. Tomahawk Bill's popularity began to rise after Mr Gergen arrived. I cast no aspersions on the Downing Street staff; all I would venture is that Mr Major needs more people around him who know how to do politics. He could turn to some of Lady Thatcher's assistants, such as Sir Charles Powell, or Sir Bernard Ingham. No? Then maybe he should think about Mr Tom McNally, erstwhile adviser to Lord Callaghan. No. The prime minister is not given to such imaginative strokes. He does, however, require a chorus of articulate voices to speak on his behalf. For lead propagandist he will rely on Mr Kenneth Clarke, his bluff new chancellor. But Mr Clarke cannot do the job on his own. Mr Michael Heseltine is off sick. An eager volunteer is to be found in Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary. Mr Hunt enhanced his reputation when he stood in for the stricken Mr Heseltine in a recent debate on opposition accusations that the funding of the Tory Party is corrupt and sleaze-ridden. He put aside his nice-guy smile and slung as much mud across the despatch box as he had received. Tomorrow we shall hear from Hunt the aspirant statesman and popular philosopher. He will address the annual conference of the Tory Reform Group at Worcester College, Oxford, on 'the Conservative party and Europe - a Christian Democratic perspective'. He will sound a bit like the absent Mr Christopher Patten, who is unavoidably detained in Hong Kong. Mr Hunt is unashamedly European - albeit with a politically correct emphasis on competition - and a proponent of the social market. He says that companies should take responsibility for the welfare of their employees, and employees for the quality of their work. At the core of Conservative belief, he argues, is the concept of the individual citizen as a moral agent, responsible for his or her own actions. He is a competent sloganeer - we shall soon hear about a new apprenticeship system for the new century - and a student of the theories of John Rawls, which he believes go some way to providing a secular moral basis for the free market system. Curious: Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader of the Labour party, was wont to cite Rawls in defence of socialism. Mr Hunt's forthcoming manifesto for one-nation Toryism should nevertheless be noted. It says what Mr Major cannot find the words to say. It amplifies Mr Clarke's 'hard centre' definition of Conservatism. Whether Mr Major stays in office, rescued by Mr Michael Mates as pawn, or whether he goes, Mr Hunt is a politician to watch. Joe Rogaly's column will be resumed on September 7</p>

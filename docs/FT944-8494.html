			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sweden asks world banks for Dollars 5bn loan Sweden is asking international banks to lend it Dollars 5bn in one of the world's biggest syndicated loans in this year. The pricing on the five-year loan is extremely low, with a facility fee of Libor (London interbank offered rate) plus 4 basis points and an annual fee on the amount drawn of 4 basis points, making a total of 8 basis points over Libor. These are even keener terms than for a loan arranged by Chemical Bank for Spain in the summer which was priced at an annual interest rate of Libor plus 4.5 basis points and a facility fee of 4.25 basis points. The loan for Sweden is being handled by Citibank and JP Morgan. Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said: 'Our biggest loan was the Ecu8bn deal in September 1992. This loan is to repay maturing debt.' He does not expect the loan to be drawn on this year. Sweden, which according to Mr Crona has a borrowing requirement for calendar 1994 of SKr180bn (Dollars 24.5bn), is the world's biggest sovereign issuer on international bond markets. Bond traders yesterday estimated that a Swedish government eurobond would need to be priced to yield close to Libor. The market for syndicated loans has increased dramatically this year because prices for loans have fallen as banks, which have rebuilt their balance sheets, compete aggressively for new assets. Gencor, the South African mining conglomerate, yesterday launched a Dollars 537.5m seven-year syndicated loan to pay for the purchase of Billiton, the international resources company bought by Gencor from Shell in July for Dollars 1.3bn. UBS, the co-ordinating bank, plans to bring in banks which already have a relationship with the company.</p>

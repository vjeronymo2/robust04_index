			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] German President Richard von Weizsaecker  received Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' this afternoon.  Al-Shar' conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings to the  German president, who asked him to convey to the president his  best wishes and warmest condolences on the death of Staff Major  Basil al-Asad.    Talks dealt with regional developments and the peace  process.  In this regard, the German president emphasized Syria's  important regional role under the leadership of President Hafiz  al-Asad. He reiterated Germany's condemnation of the Hebron  massacre and hoped that this crime, which was condemned  worldwide, would not affect the peace process in the region.    Earlier this morning, the Syrian side led by Faruq al-Shar'  and the German side led by Klaus Kinkel held a session of  official talks at the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn. [passage  omitted]    The two sides exchanged views on ways to bolster and develop  bilateral relations in various areas and in a manner that serves  the interests of the two countries and peoples and contributes  to peace and stability in the region. The two ministers  reviewed relations between Syria and the European Union and  stressed the importance of developing cooperation between them  on all levels. Talks centered on the situation in the region,  particularly the developments of the peace process and its  future prospects. In this regard, Kinkel stressed Syria's  important role in achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting  peace in the region. [passage omitted]    Speaking to reporters in Bonn today, Faruq al-Shar' said:  For peace to be comprehensive and achieve security and  stability in the region, the well-known peace requirements  should be met. These are full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories and implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338, and  425 on Lebanon. Otherwise, talk about peace will be mere talk  that will not produce concrete results. On the contrary, using  hollow phrases about peace without real results will lead to new  acts of violence and terrorism similar to the massacre at the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

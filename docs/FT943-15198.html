			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Air Inter strike The French domestic airline Air Inter will cancel one third of its flights tomorrow because of a one-day strike. The airline has asked passengers to transfer bookings to today or Wednesday when it has laid on extra capacity. Air Inter unions called the strike, the fourth in recent months, to demand autonomy from the loss-making carrier Air France and access to international routes in compensation for opening the airline to foreign competition. The European Commission ordered some of Air Inter's most lucrative domestic routes to be opened to foreign airlines within six months. Earlier strikes by Air Inter unions took place on May 17, June 2 and June 7.</p>

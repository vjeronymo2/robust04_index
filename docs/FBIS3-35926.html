He told a closed conference in Tbilisi on Sunday that ways  of  settling the conflict in Abkhazia would figure prominently in  the talks during Boris Yeltsin's visit beginning February 3.    This conference was attended by members of the organizing  committee for Boris Yeltsin's visit, and details about it  reached Interfax through well-informed sources in Tbilisi.    Shevardnadze announced that the Russian delegation would  include Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev, and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy  Sobchak.    It was also announced that the guards of honor's uniforms  did  not meet the required standards and that new uniforms would be  made for them within the next couple of days. In addition, it  was indicated that the guards of honor are not properly trained  either, while the military band's professional standards leave  much to be desired, so the band of the Russian army group  stationed in the Trans-Caucasus may be asked to play.    New motorcycles have been brought to Georgia for use in the  honorary escort. Tbilisi's best hotel, Metekhi, will  accommodate a press center which will maintain international  telephone communications.    Some of Boris Yeltsin's security guards and part of the  Russian delegation (consisting of a total of 46 members) have  already arrived.    The Russian delegation is expected to have about 200  members.</p>

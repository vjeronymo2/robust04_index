Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In keeping with the Administrator's commitment to reduce the use of higher risk pesticides and provide incentives for the adoption of lower-risk pest management methods, EPA is announcing in this notice a new policy of allowing testing of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers (e.g., twist ties, plastic tapes, and ropes) on no more than 250 acres to proceed without an EUP. EPA recognizes that alternative pest control strategies, integrated pest management, and reduced risk pesticides, such as pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, are fundamental elements of an overall program to reduce risks to humans and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Insect species utilize certain volatile compounds, semiochemicals, and pheromones, to communicate with each other (e.g., to locate and attract mates or give alarm). For purposes of this notice, EPA defines a semiochemical as a chemical that transmits messages between living organisms. A pheromone, which is a type of semiochemical, is defined as a compound produced by an arthropod which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other individuals of the same species (40 CFR 152.25(b)(1)). Even very low amounts of these naturally occurring volatile compounds can confuse normal insect behavior thus interrupting mating and preventing reproduction. These chemicals may pose a relatively low risk alternative for managing insect pest populations. The use of semiochemicals, including pheromones, to attract and trap insects has been a viable pest management technology for a considerable period of time. In 1979, EPA first registered pheromones for use in traps for the purpose of mass trapping Japanese Beetles. Since then, the Agency has registered approximately 30 semiochemical pesticides with approximately 20 active ingredients being Lepidoptera pheromones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It was in the late 1970s that EPA recognized that biochemical pesticides, including pheromones, were inherently different from most broad spectrum conventional pesticides and encouraged their development and registration, considering them to be potentially lower risk alternatives to conventional synthetic products on the market. The development of reduced safety data requirements currently in place for the registration of biochemical pesticides is based on the Agency's classification of a biochemical pesticide by two criteria: (1) The compound's non-toxic mode of action on the target pest, and (2) the natural occurrence of the compound. While not criteria for biochemical classification, arthropod pheromone products also have a low use rate, usually below 20 grams per acre, and target species specificity, therefore less expected environmental impact than other pesticides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The conditions under which an EUP, the first step in the regulation process, is required and the data which is required for an EUP application are major areas of concern by researchers and producers of pheromone pesticide products. A 1987 survey of companies actively involved in the registration of pheromones and companies that have considered and rejected pheromone development indicated that industry considered data requirements for pheromones to be excessive given the relatively safe nature of these substances, their extremely low rate of application, and their short persistence. Furthermore, it was noted that the applicant must incur the costs of developing most of the data to obtain an EUP, a stage in the product's development often too early to tell whether the pheromone is viable as a pesticide product. Given the limited earning potential of pheromone products, such testing costs tend to be prohibitively expensive; this is in addition to the high initial production costs of the pheromones themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the years, industry has suggested several changes in EPA rules and procedures to aid the development and ease the regulatory standards for pheromones and similar semiochemicals. The Agency is now at a point where it believes there is a sufficient body of information in the public literature and has adequate data available on arthropod pheromones, and is now taking steps toward this end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's notice announces a new agency policy of allowing pheromones in solid matrix dispensers to be tested on acreages not exceeding 250 acres of land under the conditions specified in this notice without an EUP. This policy only applies to arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, applied at rates not to exceed 150 grams AI/acre/year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conditional relief consisting of exemption from regulation under FIFRA has previously been granted by EPA for pheromone traps in which the pheromones are the sole active ingredient(s) (See 40 CFR 152.25(b)). In addition, EPA, on its own initiative, issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in or on all raw agricultural commodities. The scope of pheromone products exempted by this tolerance proposal would be the same as the scope of products subject to this notice. EPA currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types of pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision in a future  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory and Regulatory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136c and 40 CFR part 172 provide for issuance by the Agency of EUP's for the testing of new, unregistered, pesticides or registered pesticides being tested for new uses, in which the purpose is only to determine its value for pesticide purposes or to determine its toxicity or other properties. Such permits are generally issued for large-scale testing of pesticides on more than 10 acres. Contained within the scope of the regulation, however, is the presumption that small-scale testing, i.e., on not more than 10 acres of land, does not require an EUP provided that the crops are destroyed or an appropriate tolerance is in place (40 CFR 172.3(a)). This presumption, however, is caveated not to preclude experimental testing on larger areas in certain circumstances where the purpose of the large acreage test is only to determine the substance's value for pesticidal purposes or to determine its toxicity or other properties, and no benefit from pest control is expected (40 CFR 172.3(b)). EPA issued in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5878), a proposed amendment to 40 CFR part 172. The proposed amendment would, among other things, modify &sect;172.3 to clarify that the determination of whether an EUP is required is based on risk considerations. The amendment would provide that tests conducted on not more than 10 acres of land are presumed not to involve unreasonable risks, and therefore, do not require an EUP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that pheromone products in solid matrix dispensers must be tested at acreages larger than 10 acres and as large as 250 acres to determine the products' value for pesticidal purposes. The 10 acre presumption in 40 CFR 172.3(a) is appropriate for most substances, which can be tested to determine their value for pesticidal purposes at small acreages below 10 acres. Due to the unique characteristics of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers, however, these products must be tested at much larger acreages. Most pheromone uses involve mating disruption. Unlike traditional toxicants which usually focus on killing the immature insect (which often does the most damage), pheromones act upon the adult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Insects use pheromones to locate potential mates. When pheromones are introduced over an area by man as a pest control technique, the insects become confused by the seemingly ubiquitous presence of the guiding compound and therefore cannot find a suitable mate. When successful, pheromone applications result in reduced mating, lower insemination rates, and therefore lower population densities in the next generation. The evaluation of pheromones cannot be accomplished on small acreages because the treated area must be of sufficient size to account for the natural flight range of the target pests, such that already mated females flying into the test area do not skew the results of the study. This problem does not occur for most traditional toxicant pesticides which usually target the immature stage as these earlier life stages do not possess the capability of flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An additional factor necessitating larger acreages is the volatile nature of most pheromone compounds. It is unfeasible to adequately separate treatments with small plots. For these reasons pheromones are usually tested in plot sizes ranging from 20 to 60 acres, depending upon the nature of the treated site and the pest in question. To provide scientifically sound information, it is generally conceded that four to six replications are necessary to validate the findings. Thus, the position that 250 acres should be sufficient to determine the value for pesticidal purposes of most pheromones. Moreover, as discussed in the section entitled ``Exposure and Effect,'' below, EPA believes that pheromones in solid matrix dispensers tested on no more than 250 acres and at maximum application rates of 150 grams AI/acre/year will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Exposure and Effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1986, EPA has reviewed many arthropod-active pheromone products and has extensively reviewed pheromone toxicology data from the public literature. Based on this information, discussed more fully below, EPA believes that field tests conducted with pheromones in solid matrix dispensers and under the conditions outlined in this policy, will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. This conclusion is based on a number of factors, including the generally low toxicity and high volatility of pheromones, the low environmental and human exposure expected from pheromones used in solid matrix dispensers, and the low application rates and limited acreage required by this policy. Although the natural background level of pheromones in the atmosphere has never directly been determined, atmospheric levels for some pheromones have been estimated for peak population levels based on the pheromone emission rates for individual female arthropods. These estimated values range widely since they can be based on the amount of pheromone present in extracted glands or the measured emission rate and depend on what is considered the adult population during a peak pest infestation. To safeguard for the lack of data on natural background levels, EPA has determined to set an upper limit on the total amount of active ingredient released per acre per year from solid matrix dispensers at 150 gm. The upper limit rate is necessary to ensure that pheromones used in solid matrix dispensers do not result in increased levels of pheromones beyond natural background levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current upper limit for the application of a biochemical active ingredient lacking significant toxic effects that does not require the submission of residue data is 20 grams AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)(2)(B)). To facilitate testing of pheromones for pesticidal purposes, the Agency is setting a more realistic upper limit for the amount of active ingredient released during a season before an EUP is required. The Agency has found that given the low expected toxicity and high volatility of arthropod pheromones, an upper limit of 150 grams AI/acre/year is adequate for testing a pheromone product's feasibility and efficacy while still protecting public health, nontarget organisms and the environment from unreasonable risks from compound levels which may be above ambient natural productions. These application rates encompass the majority of pheromone uses seen by the Agency to date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Human Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The study results and submitted data available to date have indicated the following: acute oral toxicity - (LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  > 5,000 mg/kg category IV (nontoxic)); acute dermal toxicity (LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  > 2,000 mg/kg category IV, (nontoxic)), acute inhalation toxicity (LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  generally > 5 mg/L- category III-IV, practically (nontoxic)); no evidence of mutagenicity (Ames Salmonella assay); and minimal eye and skin irritation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed the results of submitted mammalian toxicology studies for the pheromone products registered to date and also pheromone toxicology data from the public literature. The majority of the compounds registered to date (26 of 31) have been Lepidopteran (e.g. butterfly and moth) pheromones. These registered pheromones fall within a well defined class of chemical structures: aliphatic compounds with straight chains from 9 to 18 carbons in length and up to 3 double bonds, and ending in an acetate, alcohol, aldehyde functional group. Pheromones have been discovered with other chemical structures including compounds with ketone, epoxide, lactone, terpenoid, pyrazine, pyran, and aromatic structures. In 1983, when EPA promulgated the exemption for pheromones used in traps, the Agency did not distinguish between the rather restricted class of chemicals produced by Lepidopteran species and pheromones with different chemical structures produced by other arthropod species (e.g. beetles, flies, and mites) for use in traps. Because the proposed interpretation that the use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers at an annual rate of up to 150 gm AI/acre represents the same human risk as the use of pheromones in traps, EPA does not believe there is a reason to distinguish between chemical classes of pheromones for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the toxicology data base for pheromones with structures outside the well defined aliphatic Lepidopteran pheromones, such as aromatic compounds, is not as extensive, there is no indication of significant toxic effects to mammalian species from those compounds registered to date. The literature indicates that some aromatic pheromone compounds could be potentially toxic due to structural similarities to other aromatic compounds. The data available to date on both Lepidopteran and other arthropod pheromones, including several aromatic pheromones, however, have indicated no mammalian toxicity at the limit dose levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The volatility of these compounds also predicts that little, if any, of the released compound will actually be associated with the crop. Studies to measure the natural background levels of insect pheromones in the environment or in or on fruit indicate little or no detectable residues. When pheromone residue analyses were done on fruit treated with from 129 to 141 gm AI/acre, no residues could be found with a detection limit of 2 to 5 ppb (Refs. 1 and 2). The current regulations provide that, in the absence of any significant toxic effects, residue analysis can be required when biochemical pesticides are applied above 20 gm AI/acre (40 CFR 158.690(b)). The Agency recognizes that the 150 gm AI/acre/yr rate is well above the 20 gm/acre limit triggering a food residue analysis. However, the negligible exposure for pheromones in dispensers, the natural occurrence of these compounds, their rapid biodegradation, high volatility and low worker exposure associated with solid matrix dispensers justify raising the limit for when an EUP is required for testing these volatile biochemical pesticides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the Agency believes that an upper limit of 150 gm AI/acre/year for pheromones labeled for use in dispensers as described below does not present a significant risk of dietary exposure due to the unlikelihood of direct contact with food and the low probability of deposition on food or feed following atmospheric dilution. EPA, on its own initiative, issued a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538), which proposes to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) the residues of arthropod pheromones resulting from the use of these substances in solid matrix dispensers with an annual application rate limitation of 150 grams AI/acre/year for pest control in or on all raw agricultural commodities. However, until this exemption from the requirements of a tolerance becomes a final rule (anticipated in February 1994), a temporary tolerance and EUP application will be required if the treated crop enters channels of trade. A final rule establishing an exemption from the requirements of a tolerance for inert ingredients of retrievably sized semiochemical dispensers composed of polymeric matrix materials was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64493).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Ecological Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wildlife toxicity data indicate: high toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and moderate toxicity to fish, but practically no toxicity to birds tested. Data for one Lepidopteran pheromone indicate low toxicity to avian bobwhite quail (acute oral LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of >2,000 mg/kg of body weight and dietary LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of >5,000 mg/kg). However, this pheromone had a freshwater aquatic invertebrate (Daphnia magna) LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of between the solubility limit of 0.2 mg/l and a calculated LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of 0.58 mg/l. Observations of oily surface films at higher test concentrations confirmed the low solubility of the test material. The conclusion was that this pheromone was highly toxic to Daphnia and that the calculated LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  supported this conclusion. Whether the mortality was due to the pheromone in solution or a film on the water was not determined. Another Lepidopteran pheromone was found to be moderately toxic to both Daphnia magna (LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  8.6 mg/l) and the freshwater rainbow trout (LC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  5.9 mg/l). These results are sufficient to demonstrate the potential toxicity of Lepidopteran pheromones to nontarget aquatic organisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although pheromones may be in matrix dispensers, rates of dissociation from matrices into water are not known. Refined petroleum oils which form films at the water surface are registered by the Agency as pesticides for control of mosquito larvae and pupae. Pesticidal oils, which may comprise some of these products, kill by arresting invertebrate respiration and affect interfacial tension at the water surface upon which various arthropods depend for functions including feeding, movement, and reproduction. To minimize the potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms, the pheromone formulations in solid polymeric matrix retrievably sized dispensers should be for terrestrial use only and the experimental use should not include use in or around marshes, swamps, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, estuaries, flood plains, or drainage ditches. They should not be allowed to wash or drain into water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the toxicity to aquatic organisms from pheromones, EPA believes that risks to aquatic organisms for tests conducted under the conditions outlined in this notice are low. Pheromones in solid matrix dispensers would not be expected to be used in water. In addition, many of the solid matrix dispensers of the type covered by this policy are typically affixed to trees or plants or other fixed objects, and thus, are not likely to end up in bodies of water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Broadcast application is not included in this notice because the Agency does not have sufficient information on the levels of exposure from pheromones which are broadcast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Solid Matrix Dispensers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Solid matrix dispensers, as defined in this notice, include, but are not limited to: Rubber septa dispensers, trilaminate sheets, tapes, tags, wafers, macrocapillary devices, such as long tubes or fibers, twist ties, or ropes which are placed by hand in the field and are of such and construction that they are readily seen. This policy does not apply to the following formulations: Liquid flowables, microcapsules, microcapillary straws, granular powder, flakes, or confetti formulations which are sprayed or broadcast over an area; and cigarette filters or unprotected ropes which generally contain the active ingredient on the outer surface of the unit. The dispensers must not be of a size, odor, taste or have other characteristics making them attractive to wildlife that potentially could collect or eat them. Devices like netting, webbing, loose filaments, and adhesives capable of trapping or ensnaring nontarget organisms such as birds also would not be covered by this policy. If inadvertently eaten, these dispensers should be nontoxic and readily pass through an animal digestive system without causing blockage or puncture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Agency Determinations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has determined, pursuant to 40 CFR 172.3, to expand the land use limitation for testing for pesticidal value without the need for an EUP from 10 acres to 250 acres for arthropod pheromones in solid matrix dispensers using no more than 150 grams AI/acre/year. This determination is based both on a finding that tests conducted under the conditions outlined will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and on EPA's belief that it is necessary to test pheromones in solid matrix dispensers on large acreages (i.e., larger than 10 acres) to determine their value for pesticidal purposes. EPA retains the authority under 40 CFR 172.3 to require EUP's, on a case-by-case basis, for tests conducted on acreages smaller than 250 acres if EPA determines that the test is not being conducted only for the purpose of determining the pheromone's value for pesticidal purposes or if EPA determines that the test may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment in the absence of agency oversight in the form of an EUP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's notice only addresses EPA's policy with regard to EUP's for pheromones in solid matrix dispensers. This notice does not in any way obviate the need to obtain a tolerance under the FFDCA before using a pheromone product for food or feed use. EPA intends to address use of pheromones in solid matrix dispensers on food or feed crops with an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance under FFDCA. Such a proposed exemption was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64538). Moreover, EPA has published a final rule exempting certain inert ingredients used in solid matrix dispensers from the requirement of tolerance (December 8, 1993, 58 FR 64493).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's notice in no way affects the need to obtain an EUP for tests conducted on more than 10 acres with formulations of pheromones products other than those described in the notice (i.e., pheromone formulations which are physically smaller than solid matrix dispensers, such as sprayables). EUP's will continue to be required for tests conducted on more than 10 acres using non-solid matrix dispenser formulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA currently is considering whether to take additional actions to grant further regulatory relief for other types of pheromone products. If EPA determines that any such regulatory relief is warranted, EPA would announce such a decision in a future  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

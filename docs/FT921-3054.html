			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (6): Shrieks over Eureka - Research is a red-hot issue EUROPEAN collaborative research programmes have always generated controversy. They have been hailed by their supporters as critical to maintaining the competitiveness - if not the very existence  - of indigenous European high technology industries, and sometimes dismissed by critics as an expensive waste of mis-directed money. Although collaborative research is often viewed as a recent development, the first joint European research and development project began more than 25 years ago - into nuclear energy under the 1956 Euratom Treaty. But the real surge in joint European R&amp;D began in the early 1980s with the Community's first R&amp;D 'framework programme' (1984-87) which extended joint research activities to cover a broad range of areas, and which has been followed by three subsequent programmes. The fourth and latest was agreed early last month when the EC's 17 commissioners approved an overall Community budget for the next five years which will be worth Ecu 86bn (Pounds 61bn) annually by the time it comes up for renewal in 1997. Some Ecu6.9bn will be available for 'internal policies', including research and development. Exactly how it will be spent has yet to be decided as the Community is only just getting round to handing out the Ecu5.7bn earmarked under the third framework programme for the 1990-94 period, some 40 per cent of it for information technology. EC funding under 'framework programmes' is designed to support cross-border consortia carrying out pre-competitive research - projects with long lead times which will help underpin innovation in European high technology industries. EC funding normally covers up to 50 per cent of project costs. The fourth framework programme, which officials are now working on, will probably be divided into six strategic areas which in turn will be split into specific programmes such as information technology (Esprit) or biotechnology (Bridge). Esprit, which was launched in 1984 and is probably the best known of the EC joint research programmes, sponsors collaborative research in information technology and is itself subdivided into four areas plus basic research which aims to 'enhance the potential for future technological breakthroughs in IT'. The four areas are: microelectronics, aimed at strengthening the Community's capability to design and manufacture leading edge integrated circuits, particularly Application Specific Integrated Circuits (Asics); software engineering and information processing systems - aimed at increasing software productivity and applying software intensive systems design and engineering to user needs; advanced business and home systems and peripherals aimed at developing user-friendly systems for offices and 'intelligent' homes. computer-integrated manufacturing and engineering aimed at demonstrating how the manufacturing and engineering industries can benefit from the application and integration of IT products and processes. The EC's fourth framework programme is also likely to overlap with its predecessor, which finishes in 1994 and could prove to be the most controversial target of Community-funded research yet, with advocates of an interventionist EC industrial policy on one side and the free-marketeers on the other. Eureka, a pan-European research programme which involves the 12 EC member states, seven other European nations and the EC Commission itself, already provides a forum for the funding of more market-oriented projects. It was originally launched in 1985 by French President Francois Mitterrand as a response to President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars research. Eureka operates out of a small Brussels secretariat and is restricted to civilian research through which it hopes to improve the competitiveness and productivity of European businesses by encouraging cross-border co-operation. Since its inception Eureka has acted like a high-tech dating agency - finding research partners for companies which approach it with an idea. For funding the partners can go to their governments or to the EC, which offers financial support for the pre-competitive aspects of Eureka projects. Eureka is designed to complement rather than compete with the EC's top-down projects, encouraging products and ideas which should have a market application worldwide. Sceptics initially dismissed the Eureka initiative. However, it has helped launch more than 450 projects, with a total budget of nearly Ecu10bn. These include the Joint European Submicron Silicon investigation (Jessi) into advanced microchips, (participants included Britain's ICL until it was acquired by Japan's Fujitsu and its partners threw it out of three Jessi projects), and which may have cost more than Ecu3.8bn by the end of its seven-year span in 1996. Another is the European research project into High Definition Television (HDTV). Last year, an assessment of Eureka's first five years by a panel of industrialists, academics and civil servants praised the flexibility of the programme's approach as one of its principal advantages, but noted that 'strategic projects which would give Europe an additional competitive advantage have not materialised on a large scale'. This, says the report, should be one aim for Eureka's next five years. The panel also identified several other problems. These included confusion over the relationship with EC projects, compounded because some in Brussels would like to see funded research become more closely geared to the market. Eureka participants also complained that although applying for and obtaining Eureka approval is fairly simple, projects often get swamped in bureaucracy when it comes to arranging funding. The major difference between Eureka and the directly subsidised EC research programmes is that while Eureka projects do not conform to a set strategic plan the scale and direction of EC research funding can be assessed in advance. In addition there is a standard procedure for applications for EC research programmes which usually lasts about 18 months. Other important EC funded programmes include the Research and Development in Advanced Communications in Europe (Race) which was set up in 1985 with the aim of establishing a strong EC manufacturing industry in broadband communications and to accelerate the emergence of a competitive Community market for telecommunications equipment and services. So far, most EC funding has focused on expanding R&amp;D, emphasising mainly pre-competitive collaborative projects intended to boost European companies' technological firepower. Advocates argue that, whatever its shortcomings, this constitutes the most efficient policy instrument for the EC to promote competitiveness in European industry and they point to the figures which show that Europe's IT companies have doubled their spending as a result. They add that new technological developments today - such as the next generation of semi-conductors - are too costly for one company to do the research alone. But critics counter that EC subsidies have been too thinly spread to be effective. More fundamentally, some argue that they do not address European manufacturers' biggest traditional weakness - the belief that laboratory breakthroughs can substitute for efficient manufacturing and aggressive marketing. The sceptics point out that in spite of all the R&amp;D efforts the performance of the European IT industry has still to show any substantial improvement. Europe's IT trade deficit has continued to deteriorate in the past decade, industry profitability is poor and there are still few fast-growing product markets in which European electronics companies are world leaders. Some EC officials have argued that more time is needed for results to materialise. But another explanation is that all the attention devoted to R&amp;D may have obscured the more fundamental challenge of how to get new products to market faster.</p>

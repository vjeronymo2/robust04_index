			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Budgens' discount expansion on German model REWE, one of Germany's largest food retailers, is behind a move to open 40 discount food stores in the south-east of England over the next two years, stepping up the continental European assault on the discount end of the British market. The private German company is acting through Budgens, the small UK food retailing chain in which it already has a 29.35 per cent stake. By underwriting a Pounds 30m fund-raising exercise by Budgens, Rewe could increase its stake in the UK company to 47.1 per cent by 1995, which would require it to launch a full bid. Since April, when Rewe bought its initial 26 per cent stake, Budgens has converted seven of its stores to a discount format and will open another three by December. Guided by visiting German executives, Budgens has developed a format called Penny Market, which is modelled on Rewe's chain of 1,800 Penny Market discount stores. Budgens said the range would be price-competitive and cover the consumer's everyday shopping requirements, offering both branded and unbranded goods. The Penny Market stores will stock between 1,200 to 1,300 items - fewer than the average Budgens store, which has 6,000 to 7,000 lines. Several continental European discounters, attracted by the high profit margins in UK food retailing, have opened stores in the last three years, making discounting the fastest-growing area of the UK food market. Budgens' shares yesterday closed 1p higher at 44p, valuing the company at Pounds 71.5m. It will issue, subject to shareholders' approval, Pounds 30m of convertible unsecured loan stock through an open offer and subscription on the basis of Pounds 1 of nominal stock for every 5.424 of ordinary shares. The stock will be convertible at the price of 55p per share between 1995 and 2003. Because the conversion is set at a premium to the existing price, and the offer is being fully underwritten by Rewe, the market expects the German company will take up most of the loan stock. Budgens said the funds would go to opening new discount stores and further Budgens outlets. The group warned that sustained aggressive competition on margins had adversely affected its results in the last six months.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> STRIKES HAMSTRING BRITISH FORD  </P> <P> Strikes by thousands of auto workers protesting a 10.2% pay increase offer have  halted production at three of Ford's British plants and have led to the layoffs  of 10,500 employees, the company said today.  </P> <P> As talks resumed between union leaders and Ford Motor Co. Ltd., about 9,000  employees downed tools for 24 hours or continued indefinite strikes begun  Monday.  </P> <P> Ford said it was forced to lay off other employees as a result because work  could not continue.  </P> <P> An engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, engine and final assembly operations at  Dagenham, east London, and an assembly plant at Halewood, in northwest England,  were brought to a standstill, Ford said. Production was disrupted at other  plants.  </P> <P> The company estimated that the strikes would cut production by 2,400 vehicles,  or $15 million a day.  </P></p>

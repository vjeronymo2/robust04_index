			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / US tries to save Mideast peace talks in Moscow THE US is working to save an important Middle East peace conference in Moscow next week from the threat of a boycott by Israel's main Arab adversaries, agencies report. The two-day conference, scheduled to take place next Tuesday, is due to discuss Middle East regional issues such as arms control and economic development. It is seen as a crucial support pillar to the main bilateral peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours - Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestinians from the occupied territories. But Syria and Lebanon have already said they will boycott the meeting and the Palestinians have yet to respond to the invitation because they resent being lumped together with Jordan in a joint delegation. In a separate development, the US secretary of state, Mr James Baker, had been scheduled to inform Israel yesterday of Washington's decision on its request for Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) in housing loan guarantees. But a US spokesman said the meeting between Mr Baker and the Israeli ambassador, Mr Zalman Shoval, would be held today and indicated the US might not be ready to give Israel its decision at the meeting. The US decision on loan guarantees could have crucial implications for the peace process. Arab foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh today to co-ordinate positions on the issue and a decision on Palestinian participation was expected to follow soon after. Meanwhile, Israel yesterday revoked an expulsion order against one of 12 Palestinians facing ejection from the occupied territories following a spate of attacks on Jewish settlers. It was only the second time that the Israeli authorities have reversed an expulsion order. The last time was in 1979.</p>

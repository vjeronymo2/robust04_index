			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B3. Subpart 2 of Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 182(a)(2)(A) areas that retained a designation of nonattainment for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  under the amended CAA and that are classified as marginal or above were required to fix their pre-amendment VOC RACT SIPs. North Carolina was not required to submit VOC RACT fixups for purposes of redesignating the Raleigh/Durham area because the Raleigh/Durham area was not nonattainment before the 1990 amendments to the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 182(b), several requirements were due for moderate O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas on November 15, 1992, such as VOC RACT catch-ups, Gasoline Vapor Recovery, New Source Review, and Emission Statements. North Carolina failed to submit these measures for the Raleigh/Durham area. On January 15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit these measures by letter from Patrick M. Tobin, Acting Regional Administrator, to James B. Hunt, Jr., Governor of North Carolina. However these requirements are not applicable for purposes of considering the State's redesignation request. For purposes of redesignation, EPA must consider whether the State has met all requirements that were applicable prior to the time the state submitted the redesignation request. Since North Carolina submitted the redesignation request for Raleigh/Durham on November 13, 1992, these measures are not relevant for purposes of redesignation. Therefore, all subpart 2 requirements that were applicable at the time the State submitted its redesignation request have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended CAA, EPA has determined that the Raleigh/Durham area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several control measures have come into place since the Raleigh/Durham area violated the O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS. Of these control measures, two control measures produced the most significant decreases in VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. One control measure is a reduction of fuel volatility, as measured by the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), from 10.1 psi in 1988 to 9.0 psi in 1990 and then to 7.8 psi in the summer of 1992. As a result of the RVP reductions, there has been a reduction of emissions of VOCs of more than 25% from 1988 to 1992 from gasoline powered vehicles of all classes. The other control measure is the improvement in tailpipe emissions associated with the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP). This program reduces VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions as newer, cleaner vehicles replace older, high emitting vehicles. VOC emissions reductions are 20.9% from 1988 to 1990 and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reductions are 2.7% from 1988 to 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of North Carolina has demonstrated that actual enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the recent air quality improvement and that the VOC emissions in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this notice, EPA is approving the State of North Carolina's maintenance plan for the Raleigh/Durham area because EPA finds that the State of North Carolina's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 13, 1992, the State of North Carolina submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO emissions from the Raleigh/Durham area. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary, and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is considered representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was not violated during 1990. The 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area has been submitted to EPA in SIP Air Pollutant Inventory Management Subsystem (SAMS) format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of North Carolina submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category. This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SAMS format. Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories are shown in the following three tables. Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the base year inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Kazakov] </F>   [Text] The general-purpose fortification equipment is  design to erect various types of fortifications for protection  of personnel at troop positions in short periods of time.    The UKFS is used to erect the following: Light overhead  trench covers for protection against shell fragments and  recesses in emplacements for firing assault rifles, machineguns,  grenade launchers, and antitank missile systems; shelters for  protection against shell fragments in observation structures for  the platoon (company) commander; covered slit trenches and  dugout shelters.    The set includes six main and five supplemental components.    The components can be made from steel or duraluminum pipe 30  mm in diameter with a wall thickness of 3 mm in a regular  machine shop without using any complicated production equipment.    The grid base covered with sacking, canvas, ground sheet  fabric, reinforced polyethylene film, and so forth is used as  the cover.    Structures from the UKFS are erected by the troops manually  and do not require the use of means of mechanization. Compared  to structures made of lumber, the labor-intensiveness of  erecting them is 2-2.5 times less, and they can be erected on  any category of soil.

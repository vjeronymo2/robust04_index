			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Talks try to avert clash over right to silence STRENUOUS EFFORTS were underway yesterday to avert a head-on clash between Parliament and the judiciary over the Maxwell brothers refusal on Monday to give evidence to the Commons social security committee. Discreet behind-the-scenes talks between Mr Frank Field, the committee chairman, and party managers were understood to be seeking a formula that would satisfy the rights of committees and those of citizens to remain silent. However, in a private meeting of the all-party committee today, Mr Field is expected to seek the backing of his 10 colleagues to publish a report on their defiance that could lead to a Commons debate and the Maxwells being formally censured. While acknowledging their common law rights not to have to give evidence that might jeopardise their legal interests, the committee could ask the House to call them to the Bar of the Commons. As committee chairman and a champion of Parliament's rights, Mr Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead, is determined that the brothers are seen publicly to be subject to the legislature's authority. Nonetheless, some senior parliamentarians were cautioning last night that every effort must first be made to find a negotiated compromise that would satisfy both sides. Several MPs of both main parties said yesterday that the genuine legal difficulties of the case had to be acknowledged. Constitutional lawyers remarked that the unprecedented circumstances of a select committee inquiry running concurrently with legal actions had seriously complicated the case. The Court of Appeal is adjudicating on abid by Mr Kevin Maxwell to remain silent on the pension funds affair after the High Court ruled in December that he must answer questions put by the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management.</p>

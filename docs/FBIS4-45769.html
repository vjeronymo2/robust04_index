			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Azer Mursaliyev under the </F> heading "History": "Embargo on the Amu Darya"]    [Text] In a situation in which economic wars, energy  embargoes and blackmail are becoming virtually commonplace and a  daily occurrence throughout the entire post-Soviet space, it is  quite clear that water is also acquiring significance as a  strategic raw material. And it is unlikely that various  political forces will not want to take advantage of that fact.  Especially since water wars are not uncommon in the history of  Central Asia.    In the hot summer of 1850 a unit set out from Khiva in the  direction of Staryy Urgench: Khiva's ruler, Mukhammed-Emin, had  ordered the construction of a dam on the Sharkrauk. The Turkmen  tribes that paid the khan a "blood tribute" by sending their  young men to serve in his forces had rebelled. And  Mukhammed-Emin decided to put down the revolt by depriving the  "yomut bandits" of water. Dams were erected  everywhere to cut the yomuts off from the water of  the Amu Darya.    The yomuts took up arms. But the "water embargo"  proved a powerful weapon. The yomuts were defeated  and sued for peace. And in 1869 the khan allowed water to be  released from the Amu Darya to the Turkmen lands through the  Laudan Canal.    Yet a much more bitter and more protracted "water war"  occurred in the region after the arrival of Russia and the  massive introduction of cotton cultivation.    The 1920's. The Fergana Valley lies in smoke and blood. Red  Army units are hunting down Basmaki units. A unit of Umar Ali's  irregulars bursts into a village in Margilanskiy Rayon in the  middle of the planting season. To punish the peasants for  planting cotton the guerrillas cut down 54 people, and the rest  were told that if they planted cotton again "a holy mound would  be built with the villagers' heads." Umar Ali's "anti-cotton"  sentiments were not the exception, but more likely the rule  among the Basmaki.    Incidentally, the fight over cotton in Central Asia began  before the Bolsheviks arrived. Prior to the revolution virtually  all uprisings in Central Asia were preceded by peasants' refusal  to plant cotton. Just as soon as the fields were sown with  traditional crops alarmed czarist officials sent off secret  dispatches to the capital. These were followed by the arrival of  punitive forces...    It is a well-known fact that the Basmaki lost. For many  years  cotton was the deciding factor in the life of Soviet Central  Asia, becoming a monoculture.    The region's ecological system has simply not been able to  withstand the pressure of this monoculture. It is interesting to  note that the traditional irrigation system of Central Asia,  which according to scientists took shape in approximately the  middle of the first millennium B.C.E., existed virtually without  significant change for more than two millennia.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S EXPERIENCE STRIKES FAMILIAR CHORD  </P> <P> Bean's article reminded me of an incident that occurred recently to me and four  students. I am the principal of Mid-City Alternative School, and I took four  students to an art store to buy supplies because they were involved in the  "King Boulevard Memorial Project Poster Contest."  </P> <P> As we entered the store, the manager approached the four black boys with arms  outstretched, blocking them at the door. "Can I help you fellows," he asked. He  apparently didn't see me talking with the young men because he completely  ignored me. Of course I was dressed in a shirt and tie, and am light of skin.  Amazed, I turned to him and said, "They're with me." He responded with "Do you  have them under control?"  </P> <P> Here we had four black young men involved in a project to improve their lives  and the community who were winners: One was a first-place winner in the 1986  Water and Power Conservation Poster Contest (citywide) and has won 14 honorable  mentions in the last four years in art; one was an honorable mention in another  contest and one was a first place winner this year in the 1990 Water and Power  Poster Contest (city-wide) whose poster is illustrated in their 1990 calendar.  He also won the "Be a Winner -- Reach Out and Care Poster Contest," which he  received a trophy and other prizes.  </P> <P> This illustrates so vividly, so painfully, how black children are judged by the  color of their skin, not by the content of their character. This, no matter  what they achieve.  </P> <P> BUD CALLOWAY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

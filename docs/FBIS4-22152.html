Charushnikov, candidate of </F> military sciences]    [Text] Three main periods can be traced in the history of  creating the Navy of the People's Republic of China [PRC]. They  are distinguished by an evaluation of the role of the navy in  the country's armed forces, the orientation of their  organizational development, and the principles of combat  employment. These distinctions, associated with the evolution of  China's military doctrine, were largely the result of those  changes that occurred in the policy of the Chinese leadership  both within the country and in the international arena.    The first period, from the time the PRC was formed (1  October  1949) to the early 1960's, was characterized by the fact that  with the Soviet Union's help, armed forces were actively formed  and equipped in the country. Back in 1949, China's  military-political leadership advanced the task of creating not  only a powerful army but also a strong navy, capable of  operating in coastal waters in order to prevent aggression from  without. The lack of a corresponding economic and  scientific-technical base, as well as experienced specialists,  hindered accomplishing this task with its own forces. The Treaty  on Friendship and Mutual Assistance, concluded in 1950 with the  Soviet Union, provided a real opportunity for planned creation  of a navy, both with use of deliveries of naval equipment and  weapons and by creating, with the help of Soviet specialists,  its own shipbuilding industry. (In particular, already in the  1950's, the PRC had six major shipyards in operation, where more  than 1200 Soviet advisers supported construction of warships and  small surface craft). Thus, by the end of the first period, the  foundation of a navy was laid, the nucleus of which was ships  (up to and including destroyers) and small surface craft  supplied primarily by the Soviet Union, as well as captured  ships built in Japan, the United States, and other countries.  The PRC Navy was able, as a whole, to accomplish the missions of  protecting the coastline against invasion from the sea.    The second period (early 1960's to the late 1970's) in  foreign policy was characterized by the Chinese leadership's  departure from the course toward cooperation with socialist  countries, which ended with the complete breaking of relations  with them. Based on the new political tenets, the Soviet Union  and the United States were considered among China's main  enemies. The main efforts were directed at speeding up the  development of ground-based nuclear missile forces. The concept  of "people's war" was predominant in the area of military  strategy, which considered the popular masses as a decisive  factor of victory in war. Limiting the Navy's missions during  this period to defense of the country's coastal areas, the  Chinese leadership emphasized the extensive development of light  forces and utilization of the favorable physical and  geographical conditions for its basing and operational  deployment. In addition, due to the "continental" nature of the  military doctrine, it was considered sufficient to have antiship  missiles installed on shore in order to destroy any maritime  target. To a considerable extent, the predominance of such views  was caused by China's limited material and technical  capabilities. Organizational development of the Navy was  accomplished on the scientific-technical and production base  created in the 1950's, and the predominant tendency during that  period of "relying on one's own forces" impeded the acquisition  of modern technology abroad. Thus, creation of a large  small-tonnage fleet for conducting coastal military operations  and also shore-based missile and artillery units was the result  of the development of China's Navy.    The changes in China's policy course that occurred during  the  third period (from the second half of the 1970's to the present)  resulted in the need to re-examine the basic tenets of the  country's military doctrine. The most significant work to bring  its concepts in line with the requirements of modern warfare and  the country's real capabilities began with the appointment of  Deng Xiaoping to the post of chairman of the Military Council of  the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in July  1981 and a "strategic change in the guiding ideas of  organizational development of the armed forces."[.sup]1[/]    The result of the change in the views toward the role and  importance of the Navy for safeguarding national interests  became the abandonment of wide-scale production of obsolete  military equipment and weapons and concentration (particularly  during the initial period of reform) of attention on areas not  requiring large capital investments and immediately producing a  result. These new directions of the new phase of the Navy's  development were building ships and creating standardized  weapons, modernizing ships that are in service by equipping them  with modern armament and equipment, including that purchased  abroad, and increasing the combat capabilities of the component  forces by improving the forms and methods of operational and  combat training.    Today, a comprehensive program is being implemented for  modernizing the Navy up to the year 2000. One of its priority  directions, in particular, is development of forces capable of  operating independently, far from friendly shores.    According to western and Chinese press data, today's Navy is  charged with the following missions: Combating enemy naval  forces at sea; providing support to ground forces operating on  maritime axes; supporting an amphibious landing defense in  cooperation with other branches of the armed forces; protecting  sea lines of communication; conducting reconnaissance in the  interests of the Navy; executing amphibious assault landings.    Organization of China's Navy. The Navy is an  independent branch of the country's armed forces and is headed  by a commander who simultaneously is a deputy minister of  defense. He is responsible for the status and development of the  Navy, organizing and conducting operational and combat training  of staffs, large units, and units, manpower acquisition and  ideological work with personnel, providing weapons and military  equipment, and construction and defense of shore installations.  The organizational structure of the Navy (Figure 1) includes the  Main Staff, three fleets (Northern,  Eastern, and Southern), the Sangar River Flotilla, and also the  Coast Defense Headquarters with its subordinate districts and  coast defense areas. The fleets include warship task forces,  naval aviation large units, naval infantry large units, naval  bases, arsenals, shipyards, educational institutions, and naval  police.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-003L-31A>      Figure 1. Organizational Structure of China's Navy </FIG>     Effective Combat and Numerical Strength. According  to Jane's Fighting Ships (1992-1993), the Navy's effective  combat strength numbers about 400 ships, 1400 small surface  craft, 800 aircraft, and 100 helicopters. The table below gives  the number of warships and small surface craft, their class, and  basic specifications and performance characteristics. Personnel  strength is 260,000, with 28,000 in the coast defense troops,  25,000 in naval aviation, and 6,000 in naval infantry.    China's Navy is divided by component forces into submarine,  surface, and air forces, naval infantry, and coast artillery.    Submarine Forces. The PRC ranks third in the world  in numbers of submarines and is one of five countries possessing  nuclear-powered submarines with ballistic missiles. The Chines  leadership considers the submarine fleet to be the advance guard  of defense from the sea and also an auxiliary means of  delivering a nuclear missile strike.    Construction of diesel-electric submarines at Chinese  shipyards under Soviet projects 613 and 633 (Whiskey and Romeo  class, respectively, according to NATO classification) began in  the mid-1950's. Creation of the series of the first project (21  submarines) was halted in 1964, while submarines of the second  project were built until the mid-1980's. According to Western  press data, a total of 106 Romeo-class submarines were built;  however, taking into account those sold to other countries, the  PRC Navy has about 80 of them today.    China built its own diesel-electric submarine in the 1970's,  given the designation Ming; however, it did not begin series  production until the second half of the 1980's. These submarines  are similar in characteristics to the Project 633 (Romeo class)  submarines, have the same armament, and are distinguished by a  somewhat greater displacement. Presently, the effective combat  strength includes eight of these submarines, and construction of  this series continues.    Work is also being conducted to create submarines equipped  with antiship missiles. To this end, one of the Romeo-class  submarines was modernized (designated Wuhan), on which they  installed launchers (outside the pressure hull) for Yinji  antiship missiles (firing range up to 40 km, flight speed M=0.9,  warhead weight 165 kg, and radar homing head). Despite the  successful completion of testing back in 1986, series production  of these submarines was not begun.    One of the most important directions of development of the  Chinese Navy is the construction of nuclear-powered submarines.  After commissioning two Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in  the late 1970's, which, experts believe, served as the base for  working out design solutions and operating principle of nuclear  reactors in order to create nuclear-powered ballistic-missile  submarines [SSBN], it was resumed only in the mid-1980's. Today,  there are five Han-class nuclear-powered submarines in the  Chinese Navy. The last three submarines, whose length is 8  meters more than the lead submarine, are armed with Yinji  antiship missile systems.    The development, construction, and commissioning of the  first  SSBN, given the name Xia, is considered the greatest achievement  in Chinese shipbuilding, which marked the creation of a maritime  component of strategic nuclear forces. It was laid at the  shipyards in Huludao in 1978 and launched in 1981 (Figure 2 [not  reproduced]. After extensive testing, concluding with the  successful launch of a Jiuilang-1 ballistic missile (two-stage,  solid-propellant, firing range 2700 km, 2-megaton nuclear single  warhead) from the submerged position, the SSBN was put into  service in the Navy. Earlier published forecasts about series  production of Xia-class SSBN's have not been confirmed.  Nevertheless, western military press reports that the PRC is  presently developing a new SSBN which will be armed with a  submarine-launched ballistic missile [SLBM] with a longer range  than the Jiuilang-1.    Surface Forces. This component force of the Navy  includes destroyers, frigates, minesweepers, amphibious warfare  ships and landing craft, and also a large number of missile  boats, torpedo boats, fire-support craft, and patrol craft.    Four Anshan-class ships, built in the USSR in the early  1940's and transferred to China in 1954-1955, became the PRC  Navy's first destroyers. Later, as a result of modernization,  two Hayin-2 two-canister antiship missile launchers were  installed on each of them. Today, ships of this class are in  reserve.

Construction of this series (17 ships)  was begun in the late 1060's under the Soviet Project 56,  (Kotlin-class, NATO classification) and continued for more than  20 years. Most of these ships each have two three-canister  Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers (firing range 20 km, flight  speed M=0.9, warhead weight 513 kg, and radar or thermal homing  head). In 1987, one of them underwent a modernization, during  which it was equipped with a helicopter pad and hanger. The last  two ships of the series differ significantly in armament and  architectonics from those built earlier. Quadruple launchers for  Yinji mounts antiship missiles and an 8-rail Crotale SAM  launcher (maximum firing range 13 km, SAM flight speed M=2.4,  warhead weight 14 km), and instead of 130-mm guns, it has one  2-gun 100-mm mount. It is possible that other ships of this  series will undergo this re-equipping.    In late 1993, it is planned to commission a new destroyer,  given the designation Liuihu. The laying of its keel took place  at the Jiangnan shipyards in 1988, and its launch took place in  1991. The ship is equipped with gas-turbines, has modern  armament (four two-canister launchers for Yinji antiship  missiles, and Crotale SAM's), and can carry two antisubmarine  warfare [ASW] helicopters.    Construction of frigates (patrol escorts) in China began in  1955 by assembling finished sections and assemblies delivered  from the USSR. In 1958-1959, the first four Chengdu-class ships  (Soviet Project 50, Riga-class by NATO designation) were  commissioned into the Navy. Similar to the Anshan destroyers, in  the early 1970's they underwent modernization (Hayin-2 antiship  missile complexes were installed in place of the torpedo tubes).  The next series of ships of this type (five Jiangnan-class  ships) were built in the second half of the 1960's based on a  previous project. Their ASW capabilities were expanded by  placing two RBU-1200 depth-charge rocket launchers (firing range  1200 meters, depth-charge warhead 34 kg).    The largest series of Jianghu-class ships of this type (27  ships) has several modifications. Their development was helped  considerably by the experience gained in creating Jiangnan-class  frigates and modernizing the Chengdu-class frigates. Ships of  the first sub-group (lead ship commissioned in 1976) have a  total displacement of about 1700 tons and are armed with Hayin-2  antiship missiles (two two-canister launchers), two one- and  two-gun 100-mm mounts, six (on some four) twin 37-mm gun mounts,  and two RBU-1200 rocket launchers. Two new modifications of  Jianghu-class frigates, having a greater displacement (1820 and  1920 tons) and different armament, appeared in the second half  of the 1980's. One of the ships was equipped for basing an ASW  helicopter, in connection with which armament located in the  stern portion of the ship was dismantled (one antiship missile  launcher and one 100-mm gun mount). In addition, it was equipped  with two three-tube 324-mm torpedo tubes, and the foremost  Chinese-made 100-mm gun mount was replaced with a French  single-gun mount of the same caliber. Four ships had the two  two-canister Hayin-2 antiship missile launchers replaced by four  two-canister Yinji launchers. Several of the Jianghu-class ships  have been built for the navies of Egypt, Bangladesh, and  Thailand.    Jiangdung-class frigates (two ships), laid earlier than the  Jianghu-class, were commissioned considerably later in  connection with equipping them with the Hunxi-61 SAM system,  which was mastered over a long period of time. These ships do  not have antiship missile complexes, and their specifications  and performance characteristics are identical to the  Jianghu-class ships of the first modification.    Surface ships of this type were developed further in the new  Jiangwei project. According to foreign press reports, three  ships are to be commissioned already in late 1993. They have a  somewhat greater displacement, are armed with antiship missile  and surface-to-air missile systems, and can carry an ASW  helicopter.    (To be continued.)  Footnote    1.

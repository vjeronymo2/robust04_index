			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 31 Mar, BNS -- Participants in a rally in  front of the Estonian Foreign Ministry today declared their  support to Estonia's position at the bilateral negotiations with  Russia.    The rally, called by the Decolonization Initiative Center,  adopted a written appeal to the ministry in which the  participants demanded that also retired Russian military left  Estonia. "From the position adopted by Russia it becomes evident  that the attempt to leave the retired military in Estonia is to  be dealt with as a continuing for of expansion rather than a  humanitarian issue. Our security interests require that the  Estonian Government abstained from bending to the pressure from  Russia, but remained firm on its so far position. A compromise  at the cost of Estonia's national interests must not be  allowed," the document says.    Juri Estam, the leader of the Decolonization Initiative, in  his address to the meeting was critical of the agreement reached  between Latvia and Russia. He said Swedish Prime Minister Carl  Bildt was now trying to convince the naive that the agreement  signed between Latvia and Russia was a big achievement. "We  don't think so," Estam said.    Estam suggested that Estonia at the talks with Russia should  set additional conditions from its side rather than back down on  its earlier position.    The head of the Estonian Progressive Party, MP [member of  parliament] Ants Erm, said it was namely the big number of  retired Russian military rather than the few thousand active  service troops still in Estonia that posed a major threat to the  country's security. He called the retired military a Fifth  Column, whose presence in Estonia Russia now tries to perpetuate  by means of written agreements.    MP Mart-Olav Niklus said occupation in disguise was still  continuing in Estonia. It ends only after the last Russian  soldier leaves the country and weapons are confiscated from  non-citizens, he said.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Paraguay plans state sell-offs PARAGUAY'S new government plans a rapid resumption of its privatisation programme, officials said in Washington yesterday. Mr Enzo Debernardi, accompanying president-elect Juan Carlos Wasmosy for talks in Washington with the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank, said the new government aimed to sell Paraguay's state-owned airline, railways, merchant river fleet, rum distillery, cement factories and steel mill. It may also privatise the telephone company. Mr Debernardi, former finance minister and now Mr Wasmosy's principal counsellor, said Paraguay had no immediate need for an IMF loan, but aimed to establish a 'ghost programme' under which the IMF would monitor the country's economic policies. 'We don't need immediate assistance, but we would like a programme with the IMF,' Mr Debernardi said. Mr Wasmosy will take office next month as Paraguay's first civilian president for 40 years.</p>

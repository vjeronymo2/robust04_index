			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laporte falls 12% in difficult trading LAPORTE, the UK's second largest independent chemical group, yesterday posted pre-tax profits for the six months to July 3 down 12 per cent from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds 44.5m. Earnings per share fell 6 per cent from 20.1p to 18.8p. The interim dividend is increased from 6.8p to 7p. The result was achieved on sales up from Pounds 302.6m to Pounds 321.3m, in spite of difficult trading conditions. The company said that in spite of the continued recession, it believed prospects for growth of the business remained good. The smaller reduction in earnings per share was achieved by a lower tax rate and the reduced equity base following the restructuring of Interox, the 50-50 joint-venture with Solvay of Belgium. Solvay acquired Interox's bulk hydrogen peroxide and persalts businesses in May, and cancelled two thirds of its 25 per cent stake in Laporte. Group turnover included Pounds 74m from Interox up to that date. Interox's profits up to May 21 were Pounds 9.6m, down from Pounds 16.4m for the first six months last year. Laporte has retained the organic peroxides and persulphates specialities business which it said had put in a similar performance to last year at Pounds 5.8m. Three of Laporte's five divisions, organic speciality chemicals, construction chemicals, and hygiene and process chemicals, increased profits. The metals and electronic chemicals division maintained its operating profits. However, the absorbents division's results fell, mainly because of rationalisation of the continental businesses and weak performances in South America and south-east Asia. The company continued its investment programme, with Pounds 29m being spent on capital plant in the absorbents division. About Pounds 41m was spent on acquisitions which included Rockwood, an American building pigments company acquired in April. The company said capital expenditure and acquisitions were likely to be lower in the second half. Group debt at the period end was Pounds 70m for gearing of 30 per cent.</p>

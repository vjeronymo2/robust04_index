			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- The working group set up to  work out an agenda of the first session of the Federation  Council has completed its work, Russian First Vice-Prime  Minister Vladimir Shumeyko said.    In an interview with journalists on Tuesday, Shumeyko said  that the group has worked out a draft agenda which includes five  points, namely: the electoral procedure and election of the  chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's  new parliament, and his deputies, the approval of the list of  committees of the upper house and their formation, the  procedural regulations and life-support system.    Shumeyko added that most disputes were caused by  disagreement  among the group members over what should be discussed first:  the procedural regulations or the elections.    Shumeyko pointed out that under the constitution there  should  be no joint sessions of the State Duma, the lower house of the  Federal Assembly, and the Federation Council. However, Russian  President Boris Yeltsin is likely to address both houses after  which they will adjourn to seat separately.    As for the candidate to the post of the chairman of the  Federation Council, Shumeyko said "it is too early to speak  about that, at least until electoral procedures are defined."    He confirmed that the first session of the upper house will  be held in the building of the former House of the Russian Press  at Pushkinskaya Street 26. "By all standards this building suits  perfectly for normal work of the upper house. The president's  order should be fulfilled unswervingly," he said.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: Further fall in profits forecast by Thyssen THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, expects profits to show a further decline this financial year to September 30, 1992, Mr Heinz Kriwet, the chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting. World economic conditions had become even more difficult than last year, while west Germany was experiencing a slowdown after its longest upturn ever, he said. While there were signs of a pick-up in east Germany, where Thyssen last year achieved 3 per cent of turnover, this recovery was still very patchy. Mr Kriwet took solace in the fact that other companies in the same sectors were doing even worse than Thyssen, which last year suffered a drop of 25 per cent in net profit to DM520m (Dollars 315m) on turnover which edged up by 1 per cent to DM37bn. It is holding its dividend at DM10 a share. In the first five months of 1991-1992, Thyssen's turnover was 1 per cent higher at around DM15bn, with the order inflow 4 per cent higher. However, Mr Kriwet said these figures had been influenced by some large orders. Because of the short-term nature of the steel and special steels business, as well as some of the group's trading activities, it was not possible to give a reliable estimate of this year's profits. But he said: 'The annual result will very probably be markedly lower than in the past financial year.'</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: David Brown advances 22% - Profits of Pounds 4.7m after lower interest costs in first result since float DAVID BROWN Group, the Yorkshire-based specialist engineering company, announced a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in its first results since coming to the market in April. Profits increased from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 4.7m in the six months to July 30, although sales were flat at Pounds 37.7m, as were operating profits at Pounds 4.9m. The increase in the pre-tax line was caused by a sharp reduction in interest payable to Pounds 277,000 (Pounds 1.05m) as the flotation proceeds transformed net debt of Pounds 7m into net cash of Pounds 10.1m at the half year. David Brown said its results were much as foreshadowed in its listing particulars. An expected gap in orders for Challenger tank gearboxes reduced sales by the vehicle transmissions division. This was offset by growth in the other divisions - pumps, which supplies the oil and gas market; special products, which makes custom-built gearboxes; and Radicon, which makes smaller gear units. Mr Chris Cook, joint chief executive, said that transmission sales were 20 per cent down following the gap in orders between Challenger 1 and Challenger 2. However, Vickers had recently won an order from Oman which meant David Brown would supply 23 new gearboxes. Overall the group's order book stood at a record Pounds 59.5m. Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, said the group's longer-term prospects had been enhanced by a contract to supply Agco Corporation of the US with tractor axles, worth a minimum of Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) over three years. The group will invest Pounds 7m in a new facility near Huddersfield and working capital for the Agco contract and deliveries to the US will start in January. Radicon's sales grew by 13 per cent to to Pounds 10.5m, reflecting the impact of new products and devaluation, rather than widespread recovery in the UK. Sales of pumps grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 9.1m, but demand for higher-margin spares and services remained depressed, and operating profits were down by 12 per cent. Sales of special products were up 5 per cent at Pounds 7.6m, reflecting weak demand from UK engineering contractors, although margins were improved by a fall in costs. Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executive, said the group workforce of 1,400 had fallen by about 70 during the half year, but was likely to increase as the Agco work picked up. Pro-forma earnings per share amounted to 6.5p (6.1p) for the period. The maiden interim dividend is 2.1p.</p>

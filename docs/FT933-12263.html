			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Books: Unresolved conflict, attitudes to war - Martial fervour, fear of invasion, a gate to utopia / A C Grayling explores people's changing view of battle over the years WAR MACHINE by Daniel Pick Yale Pounds 19.95, 292 pages AT CHRISTMAS 1792 Edmund Burke attacked the French revolution in a passionate speech to the House of Commons. Pulling out a dagger and hurling it to the floor, he cried, 'It is my object to keep the French infection from this country; their principles from our minds and their daggers from our hearts]' Burke's martial fervour is reported in Daniel Pick's compelling study of attitudes to war during the last two centuries. The account of Burke's speech is given by Richard Cobden, an indefatigable opponent of war because it harms commerce and hinders progress. But as Pick shows, Cobden was one of the 19th century's few unequivocal adversaries of war. Some quite extraordinary nonsense was written on the subject by his contemporaries, extolling war's virility-promoting, racially-purifying, creativity-enhancing virtues. Pick's book explores these views, drawing on a wide variety of literary and polemical sources. And he introduces us to some aspects of our own recent past - the fear of invasion through a Channel Tunnel, for example, and the increasing prominence of mechanistic metaphors for war  - which were important factors in the shaping of recent history. The list of thinkers who saw war as necessary, desirable, or both, is a dismayingly long one. Carl von Clauswitz argued that it is war alone that gives a nation its place in the world, while simultaneously purging its people of 'effeminacy and degeneracy'. Proudhon regarded war as part of the very constitution of human identity. Engels was uncannily prescient in his vision of modern war, predicting terrible violence in which millions would be slaughtered and Europe laid waste. Like Cobden but unlike Clauswitz, he regarded war as ungovernable once begun, and unstoppable until it burns itself out; but he nevertheless thought it has a place in the dialectic of progress, because it is the way capitalism will destroy itself, thus opening the gates to utopia. Some readers will be surprised to find Thomas de Quincy and John Ruskin among those who romanticised war. It is startling to find the peaceful author of The English Mail-Coach describing war as a 'physical necessity' for man, and arguing that it 'purifies and redeems itself' by bringing greater evils than itself to an end. In this latter respect de Quincy is right; the war against Nazism was necessary in just this way. But unfortunately the 'evils' de Quincy had in mind were not of that order. He meant England slipping behind in the colonial race for raw materials, or suffering disadvantages in the jostle for world pre-eminence. Both de Quincy and Ruskin bemoaned the modern mechanisation of war. For them it meant the passing of courtly conflict, the end of chivalrous jousts between knights under fluttering banners. There is no romance, they both daintily opined, in mass extermination in the mud. Ruskin especially had a Pre-Raphaelite view of war; once, he wrote, it was a sublime enterprise, in which 'Every man put on a crown, when the band of flute-players gave the signal for attack; all the shields of the line glittered with their high polish, and mingled their splendour with the dark red of the purple mantles.' Combatants were sanctified by struggle, from which rose all that is highest in culture. 'There is no art,' said Ruskin, 'among an agricultural people, if it remains at peace. There is no great art possible to a nation but that which is based on battle.' Such nonsense was, however, harmless in comparison to eugenic theories of war. Darwinism led some to treat it as a mechanism of natural selection. A British general, Sir Reginald Hart, applauded war's 'extermination of inferior individuals and nations'. Heinrich von Treitschke argued that war is compassionate because it rescues the weak and feeble from their misery. Fortunately such notions did not go unchallenged. GF Nicolai argued that war is in fact dysgenic, because the fittest and best march off to slaughter, leaving the unfit at home to father children. All this constitutes only part of a richly absorbing book. Pick considers much besides, including British fear of invasion, as exemplified in the intense opposition which met revived proposals for a Channel Tunnel. Invasion stories proliferated, portraying the danger of cut-throat French soldiers creeping through the tunnel by night. Metaphors of rape abounded: the French, complained the fearful, wished to protrude their steel tube under England's girdle of virgin sea. The book ends with a discussion of the correspondence between Freud and Einstein on the question, 'Why war?' Einstein had pacificist yearnings; Freud in reply was pessimistic about the prospects for ending human conflict. In their somewhat stilted exchange of views the dilemma of war, and the problem of violence's deep roots in human nature, remain unresolved. If they had been able to read Pick's book, they would have been mightily helped in their deliberations.</p>

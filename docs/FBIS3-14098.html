The Jordanian-Omani military committee helping to disengage  the two sides' armies said an agreement had been reached to  withdraw troops from and around the city. A statement by the  committee said all groups around the city would return to their  bases.    Jordanian, Omani, and Yemeni officers, along with the  American and French military attaches in Yemen, formed the  committee after the country's two main political rivals signed a  reconciliation agreement in Amman on February 20th.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE FINES LYNWOOD SCHOOLS FOR OVERCROWDING  </P> <P> The Lynwood Unified School District has been fined $360,000 by the State Board  of Education for placing students in overcrowded classrooms rather than hiring  additional teachers or substitutes.  </P> <P> State education officials said the district was fined for constantly violating  the state's average limit of 30 students per classroom during the 1988-89  school year. All of the violations occurred in the elementary grades.  </P> <P> The district was criticized particularly for moving students to other  classrooms when teachers were absent.  </P> <P> In some cases, students from different grades were placed in the same  classrooms when teachers were absent, said Wade Brynelson, a state education  official. "Third-graders were being placed with sixth-graders, and so forth,"  said Brynelson, director of the Compliance and Consolidation Programs Division.  </P> <P> Joseph D. Carrabino, a member of the State Board of Education, said in an  interview that placing younger children in classrooms with older children "is  immoral. It's a sham. I've never heard of anything that crass.  </P> <P> The district is merely baby-sitting the students, rather than educating them,  said Carrabino, a professor at UCLA's Graduate School of Management.  </P> <P> District officials had argued at a board subcommittee hearing last week in  Sacramento that they had taken a number of steps to address the overcrowding,  including hiring new teachers, renting trailers and raising the pay for  substitute teachers.  </P> <P> "We asked them to waive the penalty but were turned down," said Richard  Armstrong, president of the Lynwood school board. "They thought what we were  doing was a barbaric practice.  </P> <P> "We are bursting at the seams. But we have done things to improve the  situation."  </P> <P> Other state education officials said, however, that the district did not make  timely efforts to hire substitute teachers or rent trailers.  </P> <P> "The (educational) needs of students were not adequately addressed," said Leroy  Hamm, a state education consultant. "The kids were not getting a good  education. Teachers were not happy. Parents were not happy."  </P> <P> Joanne Perkins, a veteran elementary teacher who is president-elect of the  Lynwood Teachers Assn., said this week that "mixing students together has  always been a problem in the district."  </P> <P> Perkins, a third-grade teacher, said on one occasion in the last school year  there were 57 students in her classroom -- 30 of her students and 27 first and  third graders from classes of absent teachers. Perkins said that sixth graders  also have been sent to her third-grade class at times.  </P> <P> Teachers receive extra pay when they take on additional students, she said.  </P> <P> State education officials said the fine was based on a formula showing that the  equivalent of 131 students attended classes over the 30-student limit in first  through third grades in the last school year. The number of students was  multiplied by $2,749 -- the amount of state money earmarked for each of the  district's 14,000 students -- to determine the fine.  </P> <P> The district will dip into its reserve fund, which totals about $4.8 million,  to pay the penalty, a Lynwood administrator said.  </P> <P> "They said we would not be adversely affected. They did not give us an  opportunity to reply," said Clifford Koch, assistant superintendent.  </P> <P> In an attempt to handle its excessive enrollment, the district placed 10  trailers as portable classrooms at elementary school sites and hired about 20  new teachers, Koch said.  </P> <P> He acknowledged that the district had trouble hiring substitute teachers  because surrounding districts offered more pay. But the Lynwood school board  recently raised substitute pay from $80 to $90 a day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Hardship  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), whose district covers Lynwood,  questioned the fine against the low-income, mostly Latino district.  </P> <P> "Certainly being fined will present an additional hardship in terms of having  the dollars that you need to manage and run a school district," she said in an  interview. "So, I don't like fines to say: 'I want to make you better,' when in  fact it hurts you."  </P> <P> Waters said her office is seeking to determine the accuracy of state  allegations about the transfer of students during teacher absences, and the  lack of substitute teachers.  </P> <P> Koch, the assistant superintendent, said the district, which has an enrollment  growth of about 4% a year, has reached its capacity and has no land for  expansion. The district has been attempting to build a new high school for more  than five years, but is currently in court with the owners of the land.  </P> <P> Koch said the district is renovating and expanding eight of its nine elementary  schools, which are more than 30 years old.  </P> <P> Most of the schools were built to accommodate 500 to 600 students, but  enrollment in some of the buildings now is more than double that capacity, Koch  said. For example, a total of 1,400 students attend Lindbergh Elementary School  and 1,300 students are enrolled at Roosevelt, he said.  </P></p>

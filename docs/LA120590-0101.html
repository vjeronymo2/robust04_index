			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CALARTS PLAYERS HONOR COMPOSERS  </P> <P> While 1990 has taken a frightful toll of American music's most towering  figures, it has also showered Mel Powell with belated, much-deserved honor.  </P> <P> However, the shadow of yet another death -- that of Aaron Copland on Sunday --  haunted the Powell showcase at the Japan America Theatre on Monday night, and  the management of the Green Umbrella series chose to honor Copland with three  short works at the top of the program.  </P> <P> First, pianist Bryan Pezzone gently played Copland's touching Piano Blues No. 1  and the enigmatic "Midsummer Nocturne," with its nostalgic quotes from "Our  Town." Then cellist Erika Duke offered Powell's own tribute in his spare,  angular idiom, "Invocation 1988."  </P> <P> It is most ironic that, after years of meticulously polishing his tiny atonal  gems, Powell should win the Pulitzer Prize this year with a grand gesture for  symphony orchestra like "Duplicates."  </P> <P> Yet the Monday night offering was a spellbinding reminder of the main thrust of  this genial composer's work.  </P> <P> Powell is fascinated by pinpoints of color, the most delicate shadings, the  role of silence, the general philosophy of less-is-more. He doesn't waste a  single motion; a stunning piece like "Settings" for soprano and chamber  orchestra frames the words in the most delicately crystalline terms.  </P> <P> The performances by members of the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players were  often scintillating; obviously they have lived with this music long enough to  be able to probe beyond its forbidding technical barriers.  </P> <P> With Stephen Mosko expertly directing traffic, "Modules" received an accurate,  virtuosic reading, more expansive than that of this group's March, 1988,  performance at CalArts. And Susan Narucki could match the delicacy of the  instrumentalists with her ethereal, floating soprano in "Settings." RICHARD S.  GINELL  </P></p>

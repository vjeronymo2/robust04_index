			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG AMENDMENT NEARS SHOWDOWN IN HOUSE AS IT CLEARS JUDICIARY PANEL  </P> <P> The House Judiciary Committee voted narrowly Tuesday to send a constitutional  amendment protecting the flag to the House floor for a vote.  </P> <P> The 19-17 committee vote set the stage for a showdown in the House, possibly as  early as this week.  </P> <P> "The close vote . . . indicates that it's going to be a fairly close vote on  the floor," Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), the committee chairman, said.  </P> <P> The top Democratic leadership in the House and Senate are opposed to the  amendment because it is seen as weakening the First Amendment, but a vote  against it is viewed by Democrats and Republicans alike as risky business in an  election year.  </P> <P> Last week, a Judiciary subcommittee cleared the amendment, but only by a 5-3  vote that carried a recommendation against floor passage. The full Judiciary  Committee voted Tuesday to move the amendment to the House floor but took no  stand for or against passage.  </P> <P> Earlier Tuesday, Democratic opponents failed to get an adverse recommendation  and supporters failed to get a favorable one.  </P></p>

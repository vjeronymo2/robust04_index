			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Naha, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Yoshiro Mori, secretary  general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, on Friday [7  January] called for a massive income tax reduction and  criticized the government for delaying implementation of such a  cut.    He did not refer to the precise scale of the proposed cut.    Mori told reporters that raising the consumption tax to make  up for a shortfall of government revenues would have a "negative  impact" on the economy's recuperation.    Mori said the issue of whether or not to raise the  consumption tax from the present 3 percent could even lead to  the destruction of the coalition government. The Social  Democratic Party, the largest of ruling coalition parties, is  against a consumption tax hike.    He also said a drastic easing or even a temporary freezing  of  land taxes and a zero interest rate on housing loans should be  scrutinized as ways of stimulating slumbering business.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Teslenko: Russia and De Beers Have </F> Begun Negotiations on a New Contract: A New De Beers  Representative Has Arrived in Russia"]    [Text] The  current contract between Russia and the international diamond  monopoly of De Beers (1990-1995) brings our country over one  billion dollars per year. The contract expires next year, and  both parties have started preparing a new contract for exporting  uncut diamonds. At the very onset, they agreed to maintain  strict confidentiality while the contract is being worked on.  Raymond Clark, the new director of the Moscow office of the  firm, in his first interview in Russia, told about some of the  circumstances surrounding these negotiations.    [Boxed item]    Important Parameters of the Current Contract Between  Russia and De Beers on Export of Uncut, Gem Quality, Natural  Diamonds:    --Russia's quota, based on De Beers' annual  sales--26%;    --Direct export of diamonds through De Beers--95%    --Conditions for competitive sales of control lots  (5% of  total export volume): At least eight foreign buyers are invited  to the competitive sales, which take place in Moscow; the price  of a basic lot is calculated on the basis of total sales;    --Russia is free to export industrial diamonds only after De  Beers declines to acquire them;    --Correction of the current purchase price takes place once  a  year.    [End box]  <H5>  New Acquaintanceships With Old Partners </H5>   Ray Clark announced that De Beers does not yet have a  working  copy of the agreement, the proposed duration of which would be  from 1996 to 2000. He let it be understod that the first stage  (spring and summer of this year) will consist of collecting  information and establishing contacts; the second stage (autumn  and winter) will have consultations on general principles and  the outline of the future contract; and the third stage (spring  1995) will consist of exchanges of the first drafts of the  contract.    In the very near future Mr. Clark intends to familiarize  himself with the general position held by three parties involved  in the Russian diamond business: First, the Russia-Sakha Company  (ARS), many directors of which are well-known to De Beers  because of many years of cooperation between the company and the  Yakutalmaz NPO; second, the government of the Republic of Sakha  that De Beers is acquainted with through the drafting of the  1992 agreement; and third, Roskomdragmet, which in 1993 received  supplementary authority. "In addition, I would like to go into  detail on personal positions held by important people such as  Mssrs. Bychkov, Gurevich, Kotlyar, (Roskomdragmet), Golovatyy  (Ministry of Finance), Kirillin, Ulin, Kovylin (ARS), Nikolayev,  and Shtyrov (government of Yakutiya)," said Ray Clark, "because  at present we have only a general idea about who really has  power in the Russian diamond industry." All this indicates that  the De Beers management has decided to get away from the  practice of making individual contacts with the most important  people in the country (as it did during the days of the USSR)  and is diligently trying to figure out the positions of  interested departments and the personal preferences of VIPs in  the Russian diamond business.    Referring to the oral agreement with Yevgeniy Bychkov,  chairman of Roskomdragmet, about maintaining strict  confidentiality, Mr. Clark declined to discuss possible points  being negotiated in the new agreement. Nonetheless, he mentioned  two proposals that are absolutely unacceptable to De Beers:  Increasing purchase prices by 30 percent and giving the Yakut  government the express right to sell uncut, gem-quality diamonds  abroad, amounting to 1-3 percent of the total Russian diamond  export ($10-30 million per year).    [Boxed item]    Proposed Negotiation Issues for the Next Contract:    --To increase the share of free sales from 5% to  20-25%;    --to conduct competitive sales in any world diamond center;    --to reexamine the "formula" used for recalculating prices;    --to increase the current purchase price by 10-30%;    --to give Yakutiya the right to export some of the diamonds  independently;    --to develop a unified standard for gem-quality diamonds;    --to introduce limitations on diamond cutting by Russia for  customer-supplied diamonds from abroad;    --to develop stringent measures for preventing the illegal  export of diamonds through diamond processing enterprises; and    --to obtain permission to monitor De Beers' selling prices  through inspectors' purchases of diamond lots at De Beers sites.    [End box]  <H5>  Possibilities for Loan Operations With Diamonds as Security </H5>   Turning to the subject of a possible addendum to the  contract--loans, using diamonds as security--Mr. Clark at first  expressed his satisfaction with how the current contract  (1990-1995) has been carried out for the sum of $1 billion  between Russia and De Beers. He explained that one of his tasks  was to clarify Russia's needs for these kinds of loans.  "However, this question can be discussed only if the  government of the Russian Federation requests it from the  management of De Beers." With regard to a proposal by the  American firm of Lazares-Kaplan International ("X" wrote about  this in detail on March 2nd), Ray Clark noted that banks would  hardly give money for large deals with diamonds as security  unless De Beers is a participant in these deals.  <H5>  The Status of the Diamond-Cutting Industry in Russia </H5>   De Beers experts, already working on the beginning stage of  an analysis of the Russian market for decorative jewelry, have  given a high assessment to its potential. In general, of course,  De Beers constantly monitors the status of the world diamond  market, because it is this market that is the determining factor  for the sale of uncut natural diamonds. The Company did not  ignore Russia either and is collecting information on production  volume, various specializations of plants, and the status of  diamond export. Ray Clark also announced De Beers' plans to  build a small diamond-cutting enterprise in Yakutiya, possibly  jointly with Sakhakomdragmet or the Tuymaada Diamond Company.    [Boxed item]    The new representative of De Beers in Russia is Raymond A.  Clark, born on September 28, 1949 in London, England. He  received his education at Farnham, Surrey. He began working at  De Beers in 1969 as a diamond expert. Notwithstanding his  appointment as Director of the Moscow Representative Office of  his company, he remains a member of the De Beers London Group  for Strategic Planning. Mr. Raymond Clark is married to Julia, a  native Muscovite. He likes the Compaq laptop computer and the  pocket Psion microcomputer. He is indifferent to expensive  automobiles. He is interested in music, preferring classical and  jazz, amateur photography, fishing, and tennis.    [End box]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rain and electric storms continue affecting the  Eastern Provinces, especially Guantanamo and neighboring  Santiago de Cuba and Holguin, where rainfall has been intense.  The meteorological institutes forecast there will be no major  condition changes in the next hours. From reporter Angel Leon  Cabrera in Santiago de Cuba, we have the following report on the  damages caused by the rain.    [Begin Leon recording] Intense rain continues in Santiago de  Cuba. According to information from the provincial capital  released at noon, one person was reported missing in Guama and  one person injured in Santiago. There are also reports that  1,057 homes have been affected. Of these, 43 of were completely  destroyed and 245 partially destroyed. That figure could rise. A  man showed me the roof of his house, which was about to  collapse. This situation can be seen in several homes.    Ninety-two people remain evacuated. Damages to the electric  system have increased. Because of damages to the fuel tanks,  three units of the Rente power plant are completely paralyzed.  There is also significant damage to roads and telephone lines.  That is why information from those municipalities is limited.  According to Ruben Vidaud, first secretary of the Communist  Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, the city has  taken steps in case the situation grows worse.    After approximately one week of rain in Santiago, people are  wondering how long this situation will continue. The intense  rainfall begins at night and lasts throughout the night and into  the morning. At dawn, they wake up to the images that we have  seen. [end recording]    For its part, Guantanamo Province, which was also affected  by  intense rain, suspended classes until weather conditions  improve, with the exception of mid-level classes at boarding  schools. This Provincial Defense Council measure was taken to  prevent accidents and deaths. Rosa Maria Fernandez reports from  Guantanamo.    [Begin Fernandez recording] The people of Guantanamo are  serenely confronting the adverse conditions caused by the rain  since 18 May, especially yesterday evening and morning. There  was intense rain, strong winds, and lightning throughout the day  and a total of 123 millimeters of rain fell. The province has an  average of 276 ml of rain so far this month, which is 40 percent  over the usual average for May. The dams continue to overflow.  The dam with highest capacity, (La Yaya), is releasing 525 cubic  meters per second causing floods downstream. This has affected  numerous agricultural areas.    Likewise, the dams close to the Salt mines in Caimanera are  completely full, which has caused flooding in the lower areas.  The municipalities of Yateras, Niceto Perez, El Salvador, and  Maisi are completely cut off. Serious damage to the Farola road  has rendered Baracoa completely inaccessible and has cut  communications to Maisi. Also, Guantanamo Province does not have  access to neighboring provinces by road or train.    This entire situation has brought about the evacuation of  more than 7,800 people, 3,202 of which are being sheltered by  the state. The rest of the people are receiving warm help at  private residences from solidary neighbors and relatives.    So far, 764 homes have been affected by the storm, eight of  which were completely destoyed. In that sense, the  municipalities most affected are Guantanamo, Yateras, and Imias.  It has also been necessary to evacuate more than 12,000 heads of  cattle. The Provincial Defense Council's concern as well as that  of the State's highest leadership, which has kept itself  informed on the decisions made and solutions determined  regarding each case, is constant.    There is a reason for saying water costs the people of  Guantanamo a lot: sometimes because there is too little water;  other times because there is too much. Nevertheless, we continue  our struggles against nature because life goes on. [end  recording]</p>

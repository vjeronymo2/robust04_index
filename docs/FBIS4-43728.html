			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "ban": "Scharping Reiterates His No to a </F> Statement Favoring the Greens"]    [Excerpts] Bonn, 19 Jun -- A few days before the party  congress in Halle, SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  Chairman Scharping has once again emphasized that in his view  the SPD should not make any statements favoring a coalition with  the Greens before the Bundestag elections. That is how  Scharping has responded to continued demands to that effect from  the party's left, which expressed these demands in a resolution  passed at the SPD district congress for South Hesse at the  weekend. The congress, which reelected party Deputy Chairman  Wieczorek-Zeul as district chairman (with, of course, only 69.5  percent compared to 82 percent at the previous election) came  out in favor of a statement on a red-green coalition at the  federal level. Scharping, on the other hand, warned against an  "uncritical" attitude on the part of the SPD vis- a-vis the  Greens that signaled a lack of confidence. [passage omitted]    In a whole series of conversations, SPD Deputy Chairman  Thierse said that the SPD would not pursue a "coalition election  campaign." People who want a change of government have to vote  for the SPD. Everything else will be determined by negotiations  and closeness on political matters. Thierse did, however, make  it clear that the Greens were closer to the SPD than the FDP.  He also warned against holding a discussion about Scharping's  leadership. "That would lead to political suicide." Speaking  to the WELT AM SONNTAG, Parliamentary Manager Struck of the SPD  Bundestag Group and a member of Scharping's closest team of  advisers said: "The SPD should not and will not conduct a  coalition election campaign. The party's goal must be to  prevent the formation of an opposing government."    Speaking at the party congress in South Hesse, Federal Party  Manager Verheugen sought to win support for his proposal that  Scharping should present his shadow cabinet before the end of  July. The delegates responded with applause. Verheugen said  that the SPD must quickly show that the SPD can provide a  "wealth" of politicians who can get things done, in contrast to  the Federal Government. Until now, Scharping has said that he  will make a decision by the end of August at the latest.  According to reliable sources, Scharping was not pleased about  his federal manager's excessive haste.    At a meeting of the "Seeheim Kreis," which is close to the  trade union movement, SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Klose said he  regretted that SPD statements on foreign policy made it easy for  the Federal Government "to strike a pose of being solid on  foreign policy and push us into the corner in terms of foreign  policy." The SPD must comprehend that the concept of defense  covers more than national and Alliance defense and "that, at any  rate, is the way that our Alliance partners see things." If the  party insists on maintaining its current standpoint, it will  make things difficult for itself. The SPD has unnecessarily  placed itself "in a corner" and thus given the Federal  Government a chance to divert attention from its own lack of  ideas. Klose also criticized the fact that the SPD has based  its election campaign strategy on a prolonged economic crisis  for too long. "We cast ourselves in the role of killjoys of our  own making if we deny that the economy is picking up and only  peddle bad news." This makes it easy for the Federal Government  to "paint a rosier picture of reality from its point of view."  Lower Saxon Minister-President Schroeder also said that "there  is no doubt at all that we are experiencing an upturn."</p>

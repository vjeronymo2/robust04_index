			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: SEC in plan to relax rules on capital adequacy THE US Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to publish draft regulations shortly which could ease the capital burden on US securities firms, making them more competitive with those based in countries such as the UK which require firms to hold less capital for regulatory purposes. The so-called 'concept release,' due next month, will propose minimum capital levels to cover credit risks which will be less stringent than the current rules. 'Our rules never envisaged brokers being in the long-term lending business,' said Mr Carter Beese, an SEC commissioner. The concept release will contain 'a rationalisation of the process,' he added. 'At the moment, the capital charge is 100 per cent (of the credit risk): it should be something less than this.' The SEC will also propose a portfolio approach to assessing market risks, reducing the capital required by firms which hold wide portfolios of securities. The proposals are part of an attempt by the SEC to bring its capital rules more into line with current thinking on the management of risk in the financial markets. 'Some ways of reducing risk actually have the affect of increasing regulatory capital,' said Mr Beese. The SEC's tough stance on capital adequacy for securities firms was one of the reasons why plans to develop international minimum standards were abandoned this year. The latest proposals indicate that the commission is moving further towards the position of centres such as the UK, which claim that by using sophisticated measurements of risk it is possible to cut down on capital without increasing the dangers should a securities firm collapse.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Marley ahead sharply to Pounds 26m - Improved efficiency and housebuilding recovery fuel advance The prospect of a first dividend increase for three years was offered yesterday to shareholders of Marley, the building materials group, which announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m for the six months to the end of June - its best first half performance since 1989. This compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m during the first half of 1993. The latest figures were inflated by a profit of Pounds 6.5m from the sale for Pounds 19.7m of Bisch Marley, the French clay tile producer. Earnings per share before disposals rose from 3p to 4.5p. The group said it would be paying a maintained interim dividend of 2.1p. Sir George Russell, chairman, added: 'With higher profits now being achieved some increase in the final dividend for the year will be considered.' In spite of this, Marley's share price slipped 4p to 151p reflecting profit-taking and market concerns about rising polyvinyl chloride prices and slower growth in German building materials profits. Prices of pvc - used for plastic building components - rose by about 15 per cent in the period, said Mr David Trapnell, chief executive. First half profits had been boosted by a combination of improved efficiency and increased UK and US housebuilding, which had benefited sales and prices of bricks in the US and thermalite blocks in the UK. Concrete and clay operating profits more than trebled to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 1.8m). Profits from plastic plumbing, moulding and flooring products, employed later in the development cycle as buildings approached completion, remained little changed at Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 14m). Mr Trapnell, echoing comments made yesterday by WH Smith, said it was 'surprising, puzzling and disappointing' that sales for repair, maintenance and DIY work had remained very flat. These would normally be expected to rise at this stage of a recovery. Overseas profits, up from Pounds 12.1m to Pounds 13.9m, would have been higher but for a Pounds 1m reduction in South Africa, where the market had been distracted by the national elections. UK profits had increased by 81 per cent to Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 5.3m). The company had continued to benefit from cost savings made in the early 1990s, with a further Pounds 800,000 of savings made at Marley Building Materials in the first half, said Mr Trapnell. Worldwide group operating profits had risen by 35 per cent to Pounds 23.5m. COMMENT Marley, rightly, is reaping the benefit of its improved efficiency. Concrete and clay products traditionally do better during the early stages of a building recovery, and operating margins on continuing businesses rose by a fifth in the first half. Concerns rest more with its roof tile business, where competition has been intense, and slow progress in the repair and maintenance sector, which typically benefits the 'lighter' building products. The positives, however, outweigh the negatives, and pre-tax profits of Pounds 47.5m for 1994 and Pounds 55m for 1995 would place the shares on 13.5 times and 12 times earnings respectively. The shares look fully valued given that most of Marley's virtues were already known.</p>

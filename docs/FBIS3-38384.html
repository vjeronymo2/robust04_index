This is not the case. Nevertheless, in today's Gallup  opinion poll it is a fact that once again the Center Democrats  -- as they did in November -- are succeeding in keeping their  nose above the threshold for representation in the Folketing --  this time with five deputies to boot.    On the other hand the Liberal Party has fallen from 30.5  percent in December to 27.5 percent this month. If there were a  Folketing election tomorrow, the Liberal Party would have 49  seats -- as against 57 in December.    Nevertheless, Liberal Party taxation spokesman Peter  Brixtofte has faith in a landslide when the election comes.  "Our standing is high regardless. It is still double what it  has been in the past. The other things are temporary  fluctuations. Things go up and down. But with these figures I  would like to urge the Center Democrats to return to the fold  where they belong," Brixtofte said.    Neither a Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party-Progress  Party bloc nor the present government would have an absolute  majority. The Unity List would again enter the Folketing.

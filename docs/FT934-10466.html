			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Labour alarmed at lag in exports EXPORTERS ARE losing out to companies based in other European Community states in the race to establish markets in the former communist countries of eastern Europe, according to figures produced for the Labour party by the House of Commons library. Labour said Germany, Italy and France exported substantially more than the UK to eastern Europe last year. German exports to Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union amounted to Dollars 23.9bn compared with the UK figure of Dollars 2.7bn. France achieved total sales of Dollars 4.7bn and Italy Dollars 6.4bn. The Netherlands, with a population of just 15m, sold goods and services worth Dollars 2.69bn. The figures also show that British trade with eastern Europe is increasing more slowly than that of other EC countries. UK sales last year were 49 per cent higher than in 1990, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall. German exports were up by 65 per cent, and Italian exports by 51 per cent. Dutch exports were up by 76 per cent. Ms Joyce Quin, responsible for Europe in Labour's foreign affairs team, who obtained the figures, said urgent action was needed to make sure that Britain obtained a larger share of long-term export opportunities in eastern Europe. 'The problem is that the countries that get most involved in eastern Europe in the early days are the ones most likely to win through on a long-term basis,' she said. 'The government have not got a sufficiently co-ordinated effort going across British industry to maximise the opportunities in these countries. Ministers need to talk urgently to the CBI, the chambers of commerce and trade organisations to make sure everyone understands the importance of building up this trade.' The government also seems worried about the trends. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office minister, admitted during Commons questions this week that Britain's export performance to central and eastern Europe 'must, indeed, be improved'.</p>

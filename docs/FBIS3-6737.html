(JAL) to operate a charter flight  Thursday [17 March] from Sendai, northern Japan, to Hawaii after  Washington delayed permission to JAL for regular flights on the  route, the Transport Ministry said. Washington decided to  postpone permission for JAL's weekly flights from Sendai to  Honolulu, prompting protest from the Japanese airline which had  planned to launch the new route on Thursday afternoon.    JAL immediately asked the United States to allow it to  operate a charter flight to Hawaii to carry 275 passengers who  already have booked the seats on the scheduled flight. JAL will  use an airplane of its subsidiary Japan Air Charter for the  flight to Hawaii.    Ministry officials said Wednesday that the United States has  not given an explanation for the postponement of approval for  the regular flights, but said it is probably a response to  Japan's refusal to expand "beyond rights" for U.S. airlines  flying to Japan that allow them to extend their routes to third  countries.</p>

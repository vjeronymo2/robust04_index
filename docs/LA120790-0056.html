			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE LEARNED IT'S NOT MERELY A PAPERWEIGHT  </P> <P> Former defensive tackle Merlin Olsen, the 1961 Outland Trophy winner from Utah  State who was a fixture in the Rams' Fearsome Foursome, appeared at Wednesday's  Outland Trophy ceremony at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, where he received a  special presentation and introduced each finalist.  </P> <P> Olsen, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, told the audience how the  Outland statue, a 40-pound, two-foot-high, solid cast-iron sculpture by former  NFL defensive back Jim Ridlon, embodies the quintessential lineman.  </P> <P> After handing Russell Maryland the trophy, Olsen began a short interview with  the Miami defensive tackle.  </P> <P> Said Maryland: "I'm so happy right now. I don't know what to say. I'd like to  thank my parents. . . . Let me put this thing down. . . . James and Rita  Maryland."  </P> <P> Add Outland Trophy: Maryland thanked a number of people, adding that he hoped  he hadn't missed anyone inadvertently.  </P> <P> His father, James, a district sales manager for Chrysler Corp. in the Chicago  area, was sitting in the front row. He called out: "Leo Levine."  </P> <P> Said Maryland: "My father reminds me to thank Leo Levine of Mercedes. Get that,  he's a Chrysler guy!"  </P> <P> Mercedes-Benz sponsors the Outland Trophy presentation.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which school has had the most consensus All-American football  selections?  </P> <P> Economy move: After baseball's winter meetings adjourned Wednesday, an  Associated Press story out of Houston began: "Astros Manager Art Howe says the  team is going to see if it can trade first baseman Glenn Davis during the major  league winter meetings."  </P> <P> Dial-a-ride: For the past two rodeo seasons, the Bucking Bull of the Year has  been Pacific Bell, owned by Dan Russell of Folsom, Calif.  </P> <P> The Pacific Bell we've known for years is one tough customer, but how tough is  this guy? According to the Associated Press, in 35 events last year, no rider  was able to stay on the 1,800-pounder for a full eight seconds. And Russell  expects him to three-peat as Bull of the Year this week at the National Finals  Rodeo in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Russell also said of his 7-year-old animal: "He may go until he's 12 or 13, but  when it gets to the point where they start riding him, I'm not going to let him  play the game any more. I'm going to let him quit when he's on top."  </P> <P> Rocket vs. Rocket: If Notre Dame's Raghib (Rocket) Ismail accepts an invitation  to run the 50-meter dash in the Sunkist Invitational track meet at the Sports  Arena on Jan. 18, credit Notre Dame assistant track coach John Miller with a  crafty sales pitch.  </P> <P> The meet is less than three weeks after the Rocket and the Fighting Irish take  on Colorado in the Orange Bowl.  </P> <P> Miller told meet officials that when Ismail heard about the chance to begin his  indoor track season in Los Angeles, he said: "Do I really need to start with  Ben Johnson?"  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Yale, with 100.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Champion race car driver Dale Earnhardt, who raises beef cattle and  chickens on his 300-acre spread in North Carolina: "I own a backhoe, a motor  grader, a loader, a bulldozer and several farm tractors. I enjoy running a  piece of equipment and seeing something evolve." TED BROCK  </P></p>

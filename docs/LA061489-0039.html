			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> C-SPAN, the U.S.-based cable network that carries House and Senate proceedings,  said Tuesday it will air portions of sessions at Britain's House of Commons  starting this fall. After resisting the invasion of cameras for three decades,  the House of Commons Monday night endorsed a tightly-scripted plan for live  television by a vote of 293-69. Parliament, often the scene of rowdy debates,  will be televised for nine months starting with the State Opening by the Queen  in November. Members will then decide whether to make the experiment permanent.  "Coverage should give an unvarnished account of the proceedings of the House,  free of subjective commentary and editing techniques designed to produce  entertainment rather than information," said a parliamentary committee that set  the rules. That means no cut-aways to "occasions of grave disorder" or  demonstrations from the visitors' gallery. Only head-and-shoulder shots of  members of Parliament will be permitted. House of Commons proceedings are  already broadcast on the radio. The more sedate upper chamber of Parliament,  the House of Lords, has been on television for the last four years. C-SPAN  started coverage of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979 and of the Senate  in 1986. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

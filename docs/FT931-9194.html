			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Gangsters add weight to boardroom coup JAPANESE police are investigating a boardroom coup at Joshin Denki, a leading electronics retailer, in which gangsters were apparently hired by one faction to force the resignation of the company's president. Gangsters occasionally appear at shareholders' meetings to ask awkward questions and generally embarrass a company's board, but the Joshin Denki case has stirred controversy because of the close ties between gang members and executives at a retailer listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. Police yesterday raided the Osaka headquarters of Joshin Denki and questioned the apparent victor in the boardroom showdown, Mrs Mitsuko Jogu, 54, widow of the company's founder and, for the past two years, Joshin's president. Japanese media were fascinated by Mrs Jogu's apparent role as mastermind of the coup, while police wanted to know whether she personally authorised another executive to hire five gangsters in February 1990 to coerce the then president, Mr Seishi Mano, to resign. For services rendered, the five gangsters, who reportedly cornered Mr Mano over his role in an unsuccessful property deal, received Y30m (Pounds 160,000) after his resignation in January last year. He had argued with the family over the direction of the company since taking office in May 1986. The curious case comes as the Japanese government is considering reforms to the Commercial Code that would force listed companies to provide more information to shareholders and generally be more open in their dealings. Mrs Jogu holds only 4.3 per cent of the company's shares, but apparently considered that it was still a family business and she was entitled to use whatever means necessary to force Mr Mano's resignation.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Major pushes for new law on executive pay awards Companies could be forced to secure shareholder approval for executive salary awards under proposals to be considered by a cabinet committee next week. Mr John Major is pushing strongly for a change in the law to make salary packages paid by public companies subject to an affirmative vote by shareholders at annual meetings. The proposal would dramatically strengthen shareholders' rarely used powers to question directors at annual meetings. The plan emerged from an ad hoc meeting of senior ministers convened by Mr David Hunt, the cabinet troubleshooter, after Mr Major condemned 'unjustified' pay rises in the Commons. The prime minister believes it would allay public anger about big pay rises such as the 75 per cent awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas. However, Mr Hunt referred the issue to the cabinet's industrial and consumer affairs committee, EDI, after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made clear his opposition. Mr Heseltine argued that stronger shareholder powers would make it difficult for UK companies to recruit world-class foreign executives, who often demand lucrative salary packages as compensation for relocation. He told Mr Hunt that the pool of talent available to companies would be reduced, damaging the competitiveness of British industry, if directors knew their packages would be subject to open debate and possible rejection. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, supports Mr Major's drive for change, partly because of reservations about the willingness of institutional investors to support attempts to supervise salary packages under the existing law. The proposed change would probably require primary legislation, but the government's small programme of 12 bills in the present parliamentary session means that it could be brought in quickly. The practical implications of the proposed change, including the need for legislation, are being explored by an interdepartmental working party of Treasury and DTI officials that will report to EDI next week. However, the working party is being led by Mr Heseltine's officials, suggesting that the case against the proposals is likely to be put strongly to ministers. Institutional fund managers dismissed Mr Heseltine's fears about competitiveness. 'It is not the absolute level of executive pay that shareholders object to. It is when you see shareholder wealth being dissipated by management,' one said. Others said there were better ways of curbing excessive pay, such as forcing companies to make executive contracts easily available to shareholders. 'If they were simply to go for proper disclosure, that would help a lot,' one said. The government could also set limits on favourable tax treatment for share option schemes or pension arrangements which failed to meet guidelines recommended by the UK's leading shareholder groups.

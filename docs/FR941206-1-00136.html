To carry out the provisions of the FAAct, the FAA has adopted rules requiring airport operators, air carriers, indirect air carriers, and foreign air carriers to carry out various duties for civil aviation security. Part 107 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR part 107) applies to certain airport operators; part 108 (14 CFR part 108) governs certain air carriers. Part 109 (14 CFR part 109) applies to indirect air carriers, such as freight forwarders, who engage indirectly in air transportation of property. Part 129 (14 CFR part 129) applies to the operation of foreign air carriers within the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts 107, 108, 109, and 129 contain general requirements for promoting civil aviation security. Each airport operator, air carrier, indirect air carrier, and foreign air carrier covered by these parts also has a security program that is approved or accepted by the Administrator, containing information that specifies how airport operators and air carriers perform their regulatory and statutory responsibilities. The security programs are available only to persons with the need to know, as described more fully below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each air carrier's security program is a comprehensive document that details the full range of security procedures and countermeasures that air carriers are required to perform under &sect;108.5 of the FAR. This program includes procedures for: (1) screening of passengers, carry-on baggage, checked baggage, and cargo; (2) using screening devices (such as X-ray systems and metal detectors); (3) controlling access to aircraft and air carrier facilities; (4) reporting and responding to bomb threats, hijackings, and weapons discovered during screening; (5) reporting and protecting bomb threat information; (6) identifying special procedures required at airports with special security needs; and (7) training and testing standards for crewmembers and security personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The airport security program is a comprehensive document that details the full range of security procedures and countermeasures that airport operators are required to perform under &sect;107.3. Most programs include the: (1) Description of the air operations area (AOA), each area on or adjacent to the airport that affects the security of the AOA, and air carrier exclusive areas; (2) procedures to control access to the AOA; (3) alternate security procedures for use in emergency and other unusual conditions; and (4) law enforcement support training and record maintenance programs in furtherance of part 107. Programs for some airports include a description of the law enforcement support training program and the system for maintaining records. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The indirect air carrier security program covers security procedures for cargo that is accepted for transport on air carrier aircraft. In general, it requires indirect air carriers to carry out security procedures for handling cargo that will be carried on air carrier aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

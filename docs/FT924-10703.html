			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Civil engineers' confidence is 'shot' THE CONFIDENCE of civil engineering companies is 'shot to pieces', according to a report published today which shows a further fall in the industry's workload and jobs. Hopes for new orders and employment in civil engineering had shown a 'sharp deterioration', according to the latest quarterly survey by the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors. Mr John Hackett, the federation's director-general, said the fall in confidence was due to the absence of new orders and repeated warnings of cuts in government spending on infrastructure projects. He conceded that much of the survey had been carried out before the recent switch in economic policy which put the emphasis on stimulating growth. He said, however, he doubted this 'could have made up for months of discouraging indications'. On a more positive note, the survey found costs increasingly under control. Some 77 per cent of companies reported costs unchanged or lower than 12 months ago, up from 54 per cent. This beat the record 67 per cent in July last year. For the ninth successive survey, four out of five companies said margins were lower than a year previously. Some 55 per cent, compared with 49 per cent at the time of the last quarterly survey in July, reported 'unsatisfactory levels of plant utilisation'. The short-term outlook was that order books were still shrinking, although fewer companies reported a falling number of invitations to tender. Looking ahead 12 months, companies surveyed were more pessimistic than at any time in the current recession. None of the 145 companies which responded anticipated recruiting more staff and 57 per cent expected to reduce levels. The sample covered about 9 per cent of the total construction output in the UK.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Records: Nostalgia goes pop FOR REASONS that probably will always remain unclear, the record industry has redefined 'nostalgia' as a marketing concept that is exclusively applied to the music prior to the emergence of rock 'n' roll. It is as though to have fond recollections, let alone knowledge, of Fats Domino is to have a good memory - but to remember Al Bowly is to be a dinosaur. What would Victor Meldrew think about that? The passing comet of rock 'n' roll that put paid to the dinosaurs of old, however, did not eliminate nostalgia. Indeed, nostalgia has become an important element of the re-issue market, not least because a number of companies have taken advantage of the fact that sound recordings over 50-years-old are out of copyright. Anyone can re-issue them, if they can find clean versions of the originals to copy. The trick, of course, is to do them properly. One such company is Avid which has just released a quartet of CDs featuring classic interpretations of the songs of Irving Berlin (Berlin Always AVC 517), Cole Porter (You're The Tops, 518), George and Ira Gershwin (S'Wonderful, 520) and Jerome Kern (Yesterdays], 519). All are worthwhile, particularly because the selection of performers surprises as well as touching the obvious bases. The Kern, for example, features Fred Astaire, Jessie Matthews, George Gershwin and Billie Holiday. Even better is the Gershwin, which includes Al Jolson singing 'Swanee', Coleman Hawkins performing 'Lady Be Good', Fats Waller's version of 'I Got Rhythm' and Paul Robeson's impassioned 'Summertime'. The CDs all have a discreet note to the effect that the recordings are vintage performances made prior to modern recording techniques. Nonetheless the clicks, scratches and surface noises one remembers are missing. The tapes have probably been (sympathetically) cleaned up. Certainly the recordings have an appealing brightness. Pavilion Records is another company that specialises in re-issuing vintage recordings. Recent releases on its Flapper label include Arthur Tracey's Our Favourites (PAST CD 7006), Al Bowly's Just a Bowl Of Cherries (7003), Gems of The Music Hall (7005), George Formby's Favourites (7001), Mr Music Master (7004), a selection of performances of songs by Hoagy Carmichael, and Paul Robeson (7009). The Al Bowly, a selection of rarities, is for collectors only, but the rest are of wider interest, if one is willing to endure a few crackles and hisses  -Pavilion takes the view that authenticity is preferable to tampering with recordings. Like the Avid recordings, the Carmichael set mixes the classic (Mildred Bailey singing 'Rocking Chair') with the odd (Nat Gonella's version of 'Georgia on My Mind'), while the Formby and Robeson include virtually all their major hits. Particularly interesting (but also particularly scratchy) is the Music Hall collection which features classic performances from Harry Lauder ('I Love a Lassie'), Marie Lloyd ('Every Little Movement'), Florrie Forde ('Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly') and Billy Williams ('When Father Papered The Parlour'). Of the major companies, EMI has been the most active in the nostalgia field. Its most interesting series has been the . . . By Night CDs. Built on memories of foreign travel and the growing awareness of the fact that there are non-English language popular music traditions, EMI plundered its world-wide catalogue to great effect. The earliest albums took us to Paris, Rome and Berlin and introduced us to Piaf, Tino Rossi and Dietrich. So successful were they that EMI has put out a compilation of these, The Continental Collection (7 894602). But even more exciting are the latest offerings, Buenos Aires By Night (789180 2) and Rio By Night (789036 2). The first features classic tango performances by the original recording artists (Josi Basso's La Cumparista) and the second a rich mix of the musical heritage of Rio De Janiero. Moreover, because EMI has access to the clean copies of the originals, they sound magnificent.</p>

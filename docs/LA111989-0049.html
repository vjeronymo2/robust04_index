			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH, AND ALL THAT JAZZ;  </P> <P> THE HOT JAZZ TRIO BY WILLIAM KOTZWINKLE ILLUSTRATED BY JOE SERVELLO (SEYMOUR  LAWRENCE/HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $17.95; 153 PP.; 0-39550096-6)  </P> <P> There are three stories in this slender volume. All have the word blues in  their title. All are about death. The first takes place in a nostalgically  conceived 1920s Paris of jazz and magic shows; the second in a cartoon of  ancient Egypt, and the third in some America or other of hobos and traveling  circuses. As is his habit, William Kotzwinkle has little interest in  verisimilitude. Reality, we might say, is a crutch for those who can't handle  dreams.  </P> <P> Each tale in the trio reminds me of the interior of a crystal paperweight.  Sharp edges have been banned, gravity is lenient (just watch the miniature  blizzards, slower than falling feathers), and soft luminescence is the order of  the day. Thus petted and protected from us, the inmates of the paperweight can  live out their lives: the silk handkerchiefs sweetly reeking of ambisexuality,  the wigs of great composers crawling with symphonies instead of lice, the boxes  with their stolid lusts and greeds. . . .  </P> <P> But Kotzwinkle takes every opportunity to remind us that gravity must get its  prey in the end. How could it be otherwise? After all, the snow crystals do  settle eventually to the bottom of the liquid, just as the handkerchiefs will  die of old age or might even be killed. "The penalty for taking the heavenly  silkworms back to the dimension of earth is death," says he. Magical  commutations of execution occur when the author shakes his paperweight again  and everything floats yet awhile longer, as in the last tale, when two  high-wire circus performers elude Mr. Death several times by various  stratagems, but in the end, "we tumbled on," presumably to be shattered on the  hard ground below. In every story, whether the paperweight is a giant bottle or  the Egyptian realm of dead souls, dust comes to dust at last.  </P> <P> This is Kotzwinkle's operating principle, and a very true one it is, too. Now,  how well is it expressed? In the publicity matter that slathered my proof copy  of this book, I learned that Kotzwinkle is a necromancer, a fantasist  extraordinaire, and a magician -- and this all on one page! (I wonder if he's  also a prestidigitator?). Wiping away this diarrhea (for which Kotzwinkle is  not responsible), I picked up the three paperweights one by one and looked into  them  </P> <P> The first of these, called "Django Reinhardt Played the Blues," is by far the  longest. Unfortunately, it is also the most disappointing. The sculpture within  the dream-glass is prettily crafted enough, being "the world of shadows, and  the thought of flowers, and convulsive moments." Many of its denizens, its  clock-cousins and semi-sentient umbrellas, deserve the life that Kotzwinkle has  given them. But the story itself, the account of how LeBlanc the magician goes  inside the paperweight to search for his beautiful Loli, is a series of  blunders. Loli is LeBlanc's assistant in a disappearing act. Disappear she has,  reappear she does, and so do far too many supernumeraries, with far too little  reason, until the game grows thin.  </P> <P> Kotzwinkle does not so much create character as an alloy of archetype and  stereotype. So we have the master illusionist, the whore with the heart of  gold, the sensual jazz musician, etcetera. It is not entirely a compliment to  say that Kotzwinkle's nonhuman characters are his most delightful, such as the  sweet young thing who helps LeBlanc and his cronies escape from a city of  hulking wardrobes:  </P> <P> "But then the box of chocolates under the American expatriate saxophonist's arm  spoke to the crowd, in her sweet voice, words only another box could  understand. Her bonbons poured out. . . . Bonbons bounced off the boxes below,  and there was a sound of latches creaking open in response to the little  heart-shaped creature in her dainty silver wrapping."  </P> <P> This is quite simply beautiful. Such passages are good as the best of Bradbury  and Brautigan. I wish I could say the same about descriptions of LeBlanc and  Loli.  </P> <P> For those who don't mind a flabby plot, "Django Reinhardt" may offer  considerable pleasure. There is one droll scene, for instance, in which Django  is only halfway pulled into the other dimension. " 'How can I play the guitar?  Mon dieu, Mon dieu. . . .' He hopped around on one leg. 'This is the most  uncomfortable arrangement conceivable. . . .' "  </P> <P> The second story, "Blues on the Nile," seemed to me more carefully written. I  will not say very much about it because it is a mystery parable, with an ending  that it would be unfair to reveal. Whereas death was an undercurrent inside the  liquid of the paperweight in "Django Reinhardt," it is everything in "Nile." A  Pharaoh dies, and is laid to rest, along with a few retainers conveniently  suffocated to keep him company. All these characters, while neither novel nor  individual, are nicely drawn. Kotzwinkle's depiction of Pharaoh sipping beer  through a straw as he views the progress of his tomb is perfect. (Here the  stereotype-archetype business works, because the story has a point to make.)  Soon the tomb becomes the paperweight, whose liquid is the Black Nile of the  afterworld. Instead of a slow snowstorm we have a weightless Solar Barque  skimming through the blackness -- but gravity must have its due; the reckoning  awaits. The images conveyed by the closing lines stay in the mind. (In my own  short stories I fail all too often to be concise, so I admire the tightness of  this piece.)  </P> <P> The final story, however, "Boxcar Blues," is by far the finest in the  collection. It begins with a brilliant screech: "Melrose rode his unicycle and  I followed in my clown car. It crashed and I popped out the top in a  spring-loaded seat, which is how I billed myself -- Poppo the Clown. This was  with the General Lopez Circus, that traveled all over the country, with winter  quarters in the poorhouse." And it goes on from there. If the Los Angeles Times  would let me, I'd simply quote it all. There is hardly a false note in it.  Melrose and Poppo go on the bum to flee the fishy-eyed Death who is determined  to claim them, since their necks are technically broken. The paperweight is the  life of boxcars and campfires. Again and again gravity is resisted, and Melrose  and Poppo are saved by the generosity of their fellow losers. But we know what  has to happen. There is a real sweetness to this story, as well as a sense of  honest sadness.  </P> <P> In "Django Reinhardt," there's a character in a similar fix -- a magician who  was shot in the chest by his assistant and so is trapped in the paperweight for  eternity. At the end, however, Kotzwinkle relents and lets him out -- which is  implausible and even phony. Here in "Boxcar Blues," however, the author plays  by his own rules: Gravity must win. Tramps can turn into butterflies. Tramps  can turn themselves inside out. Tramps are eternally prepared to take off any  minute. But tramps are no less doomed than anyone else.  </P> <P> So we see that "The Hot Jazz Trio" plays one theme, but the theme is big enough  for any number of paperweights. As Kotzwinkle says: "The circus of General  Lopez travels farther than we dreamed, Melrose."  </P> <P> Joe Servello's illustrations deserve mention. There are 30 of them, so they  make up a substantial proportion of the book! Speaking as someone who has had  to wrangle with publishers over the illustrations to my work (and has generally  lost the fight), I feel very strongly that more fiction should be accompanied  by pictures. So I am delighted to see Servello's line drawings, for principle's  sake, and also because they are good. The naked jugglers, balancing balls on  their heads like seals, the discombobulated boxman, Pharaoh in his sunglasses  and General Lopez's band are all there, and it is nice to see them. Servello is  faithful to letter and spirit.  </P></p>

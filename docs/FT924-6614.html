			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / British Gas hit by competition and prices cap BRITISH GAS showed yesterday how far it is coming under pressure from increased competition and a cap on domestic gas prices when it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 282m for the third quarter which was higher than many in the City had expected. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said he was disappointed with the results: 'What they demonstrate is the squeeze we're in is continuing.' In the same period last year, warmer-than-normal weather had led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 318m on an historic cost basis. The effects of colder weather this year have been more than offset by price controls and rising competition in the industrial gas market. The company said that 42 per cent of the firm contract market for gas - about half of the entire industrial market - is now supplied by rivals. British Gas has been forced to lower its prices to domestic gas consumers twice by pressure from the regulator. In the first nine months of the year, profits slipped to Pounds 633m from Pounds 989m in the previous year. Analysts have cut forecasts for full-year earnings to Pounds 850m-Pounds 950m, against Pounds 1.2bn last year. Mr Brown said he recognised the need to reduce costs, in an attempt to offset pressure from competition and lower prices, but was unable to make sweeping cutbacks or initiate any big restructuring before hearing the results of an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into British Gas's business. British Gas took the unprecedented step of submitting itself to an MMC inquiry in July after it became frustrated with its regulator. The MMC review has shrouded the company's entire UK business in uncertainty. The company is looking to its exploration and production business for future growth, although it has retreated from its goal of achieving 40 per cent of its profits from this division by the end of the decade. 'We want to achieve a better balance between the businesses', said Mr Brown, 'and our main drive is to convert proven reserves into production which will start generating earnings.' Nevertheless, the company has cut capital expenditure from Pounds 2.8bn this year to Pounds 2bn in an effort to control costs. Its shares were little changed yesterday, edging up from 279p to 279.5p.

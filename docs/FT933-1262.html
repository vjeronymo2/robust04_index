			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Norway's bond market set for record year NORWAY'S bond market is heading for a record year, driven by a sharp fall in interest rates, said Mr Erik Jarve, president of the Oslo bourse. Mr Jarve forecast 1993 turnover in bonds of NKr660bn (Dollars 93bn), up from NKr502bn last year and NKr425bn in 1991. He said the yield to maturity of Oslo's Brix bond index had fallen to 6.94 per cent by August from 11.40 per cent at the start of the year. 'Although the government has been an infrequent borrower in recent years, this situation is likely to change,' he predicted. The central bank estimates that NKr150bn is likely to be raised through domestic government bond issues in the next five years.</p>

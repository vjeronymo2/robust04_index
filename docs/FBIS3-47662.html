The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors Inc. issued  the comments in a written form after the cabinet Tuesday morning  approved the action program to make bidding for public works  more open.    In the statement, the federation said, "It is necessary for  the Japanese industry as a whole to tackle seriously the problem  of averting unfair practices." It noted that the program  includes stronger penalties for those involved in illicit deals.    Japan's construction industry has been shaken by a series of  major bribery and bid-rigging scandals in the past year.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Travel: A beautiful swamp - James Henderson enjoys the wildlife of Trinidad's Caroni mangrove It took some persuasion to convince me that a trip to a swamp would be the highlight of my visit to Trinidad. What do you do in 40 square miles of mangrove and sumptuous black mud? But James Madoo was a salesman who loved his subject, and I did not reckon with the depth of mystery and the variety of the Caroni swamp. Trinidad has an extraordinary variety of birdlife (more than 400 species) in its 1,800 square miles of coastal swamps, plains and forested mountains. 'Iere,' the old Indian name for Trinidad, meant 'Land of the Hummingbird,' and there are 16 species on the island. Aerodynamically they have about as much chance of flying as a helicopter. In their efforts to keep airborne they must beat their wings about 50 times a second. Their metabolic rate is so high that they must constantly top up with nectar. At night, hummingbirds switch off and become stiff as a wooden board. Trinidad lies on a migratory route and so, not unlike the tourists, thousands of birds flock there from the US and Canada each year to avoid the northern winter. Many other species have spilled over from South America, just seven miles away. These are truly exotic, adorned with bright tropical colours and quirks of nature that only their mates could possibly find attractive. Some are designed for perfect flying, with built-in aerofoils and spoilers; others are lumbered with ridiculous encumbrances. The poor wattled jacana has silly-looking, overlong toes and an embarrassing red splurge on its face. And just imagine having the bill of a toucan. The diminutive male white bearded mannikin spends 90 per cent of its waking hours displaying itself. It flits backwards and forwards, all to entice female mannikins to its court. Deeper in the rain forest there is a bird that strikes up chucka-chucka-chucka-chucka, like an unsuccessful starter-motor, and another that calls boing, boing . . . boing. Heaven knows what a violaceous trogon does back at the nest. Of all the mournful, sceptical, quizzical-looking birds you see on the island, the most majestic is the scarlet ibis, and it was this I went to see in Caroni swamp. I travelled by mini-bus, or, as the contrary Trinidadians prefer to call it, a maxi-taxi - more a mobile discotheque than a bus. The carnival rhythms pumped relentlessly on, but soon the bustle of Port of Spain receded and the overwhelming greens of the Trinidad countryside loomed around us. At the swamp I met Winston Nanan, a stocky and quietly-spoken man. His knowledge of Trinidadian wildlife is encyclopaedic. He began by telling us of the swamp and its fragile ecosystem, of the 168 species of bird that can be seen there and of the efforts being made to protect them. Anecdotes, including hair-raising stories of disturbing armed poachers, were drawn from 30 years of swamp life. We set off into the mangroves. James Madoo accelerated the outboard for a moment and then left the boat to cruise as we listened. Suddenly, with a splash, a spectacled cayman pushed off into the water and cruised away with lazy movements of its tail. A mangrove tree can cover whole acres. It is an endless tangle of brown roots, sprouting willy-nilly from the mud, miniature flying buttresses run riot topped with bushy leaves. As we crept into each new spot, the favoured haunt of a particular species, the peace would take a moment to return, but soon the birds would appear. With a cock of the head the guides held our attention. The swamp started to come alive. A white-necked heron stood perched on one foot in a stretch of open water, shoulders hunched and immobile, as it had been for hours (except occasionally to change legs), waiting to strike for food. Skulking around the edge, a green-backed heron preferred to stalk, holding its body horizontal over the water. A lonesome boop-boop-boop rang out - a clapper rail - and a second later a little character with a spiked haircut (called topknot) flitted past with a grating hiss: a yellow-bellied elaenia. It fled shamelessly at the appearance of a fearsome tiger heron. Suddenly, the wattled jacana's rebellious toes made sense - they were perfect for keeping balance over lilies. As evening drew in we made our way to the scarlet ibis sanctuary. Moments later the first pair breezed in, a flash of red as they flapped and landed. Scarlet ibises are gregarious creatures, and as many as 5,000 return nightly, after feeding in Venezuela, to roost in the mangroves. The ibises are impossibly red, the strongest scarlet, like a British postbox. The colour derives from the chemical carotin, which they find in the little crustaceans in the swamp. They stand about 3ft high, with wings 3ft when outstretched; their 8in bills curve downwards. For a while, as well as being Trinidad's national bird, the scarlet ibis was also something of a national dish, and in the 1960s numbers were dangerously low (they were also hunted for their feathers). Away from their own environment, or in captivity, ibis fade to a dull pink, a wan reminder of the real thing. Now that they have some protection in the sanctuary, they have returned to the swamp to roost and have started to breed again. The mating season lasts from the end of April into June, when you will see pairs flying high, descending in ever- decreasing circles before they disappear behind a curtain of mangrove leaves. Nesting lasts until August. Soon there were 50 ibis in the air at a time, gliding in above us. Momentarily a tree would burst aflame as they stretched their wings to the full, flapping and settling. In the golden evening light the mangroves, flecked white with the cattle egrets, took on a deep scarlet glow. But it faded with the dusk. The oysters on the mangrove roots snapped shut for the night and we returned home.</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW ARMS FOR NICARAGUA  </P> <P> Nicaragua is believed to have received six North Korean-made torpedo boats in a  large consignment of weapons on a Soviet freighter, Jane's Defense Weekly  reported in its latest issue. The shipment is thought to include mortars,  anti-tank weapon launchers, air-to-ground rockets, anti-personnel mines,  ammunition and vehicle spares, said Jane's, a respected journal of military  affairs. The consignment was brought by the freighter Junda in the last weeks  of 1988 and unloaded at the Atlantic port of Rama, according to the journal.  Jane's said the six fast-attack craft will make Nicaragua's navy the most  powerful in Central America.  </P></p>

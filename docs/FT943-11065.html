			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Japan unmoved and immovable - A look at a quiet confidence in the face of US sanctions threat The announcement by the US on Sunday that it was launching sanctions proceedings against Japan has sent the yen on an upward course again, much to the dismay of Japanese business, and added to the tension in relations between the two countries. Despite the threat of higher tariffs on selected Japanese goods implicit in Washington's decision to call the Japanese government's procurement practices discriminatory against foreign companies, the mood in Tokyo yesterday was confident and composed. 'It is not a US-Japan trade war yet. We are far from a collapse in the relationship,' one Japanese trade official said. Japanese officials are less threatened by the possibility of sanctions, the deadline for which decision is the end of September, than throughout most of the history of US-Japanese trade tension when the danger of retaliatory action by the US was usually enough to cow Japan into compliance. They are well aware that despite the harsh words, the US has usually been extremely cautious about resorting to sanctions and that even if they were to be imposed, restricting government procurement of Japanese-made goods, the impact on Japanese industry would not be devastating. At the same time, the self-assurance that is evident among Japanese trade negotiators reflects a conviction that on this issue at least, Japan not only needs to, but can, stand up for what it believes is both right and reasonable. 'What we are saying is reasonable and what they are saying is not,' says one. For one thing, Japanese officials are confident that their stance against US demands for objective criteria has widespread public support, not only at home but among influential academic and business circles in the west as well. The main difference that led to the breakdown of the talks over the weekend centred on the issue of what objective criteria the two sides might adopt to monitor progress in opening Japan's government procurement market to foreign products. The US has insisted that the two sides adopt certain benchmarks to measure whether there has been progress in foreign penetration. This, it says, is what was agreed in the framework agreement and cannot be compromised. 'The framework language is the bottom line for us,' a US official said yesterday. Japan, however, has been immovable in its determination to avoid agreeing to any kind of measurement that could later be construed as a guarantee that progress would be made. Japanese officials fear that any further compromise on this issue would create a dangerous precedent for the private sector issues, such as car and car parts, that are still deadlocked by the same point of contention. And on this point, they are confident that by resisting US calls for action that could lead to managed trade, Japan is seen to bear the torch of free trade not only at home but even among many of those who shape public opinion in the US. That conviction was given a strong boost in February, when failure to reach agreement with the US on the framework talks led to a temporary suspension in the negotiations that was greeted with turmoil on the currency markets. 'It was a psychological learning experience,' one Japanese official said. 'Japan had never rejected the US before,' and the firm stance it took against the US at the time taught Japanese officials that it could be done. Furthermore, Japanese officials insist that the changes it has proposed to its government procurement system makes Japan one of the most transparent markets in the world. 'Our feeling is that we do not understand why Japan should be named as discriminating in government procurement when we have introduced clear and transparent procedures that easily clears requirements under Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and makes Japan the most transparent country after the US,' moaned one Japanese official. The US claims Japan's government procurement procedures discriminate against foreign suppliers by limiting access to early information on upcoming procurements, relying on an informal network of domestic suppliers, not giving sufficient consideration to the technical merits of a tender and, in the telecom sector, developing technical specifications that favour domestic suppliers. In response, Japan has already offered to make early announcements of procurement plans, consult suppliers before determining specifications and lower the threshold of government contracts that will go to international tender. The Japanese say that if the US had studied these Japanese proposals well, it would have seen that transparency in the Japanese market was being promoted. 'Washington did not evaluate Japan's package to improve foreign access to the government procurement market sufficiently,' Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice minister for international trade and industry said yesterday. But even more fundamentally, Japanese officials contest US claims that the Japanese government procurement market is any more closed than markets in other countries. 'We are not sure whether the statistics which the US use to claim that Japan is closed are authentic,' one Japanese official noted. In the field of medical equipment, for example, the US claims that US companies' share of the EU market is 40 per cent. But if cross-border sales are included, as they are according to Gatt calculations, the US share of the EU market is 16.4 per cent, which is not that much higher than the 15.4 per cent US share of Japan's government procurement market of medical equipment. What is more, Japanese purchases of US products in telecoms and medical equipment is 10 times as much in value as US purchases of Japanese telecoms and medical equipment, an official of the ministry of international trade and industry says. If a trade surplus signifies closed markets, as the US claims, the US surplus in this case must mean its government procurement market is closed, he adds. Japan believes that it has a strong card in its offer to lower the threshold of procurement contracts much closer to US demands. But even this will not be enough unless the two sides can get over their differences regarding objective criteria which prevented discussion of all other issues at the latest round of talks. The US is crossing its fingers in the hope that as the deadline approaches, Japanese officials will change their mind and adopt a more flexible stance on criteria. The need for qualitative and quantitative measures of progress was accepted by Japan at the time the framework agreement was signed. 'At some point the political commitment is going to filter down to the bureaucracy,' says one US official. But barring any second thoughts by a political leadership that is fully occupied with shaping its own political identity and has left the trade agenda largely in the hands of a trusted bureaucracy, there are few signs that the Japanese stance will change. 'We have moved as much as we can. It all depends on the US,' a Japanese official insists.</p>

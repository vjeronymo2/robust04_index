			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the armed organizations in the jungle are  attacking passenger cars, trains, and vessels with small and  heavy weapons for no apparent reason. They are also disturbing  and hindering the local tranquility as well as secure and smooth  transportation.    Nearly 30 members of the jungle-based Karen armed  organization attacked Bo Aung Kyaw passenger car at 0730 on 2  June with small and heavy weapons near Kawlon Gyun. Due to the  callous and wicked attack, a monk and two women passengers were  killed by gunshot wounds while six others -- U An Gu, 45, of Hto  Ant Village; U Hla Shwe, 40, of Kamamaung Ward No. 6; Daw Ma  Tin, 70, of Ward No. 7; Daw Tin Sein, 45, and and Daw Win Than,  31, of Ward No. 5; and Ma Aye Mya, 9, of Pinma Village --  sustained serious wounds from heavy weapons shrapnel and shots  from small weapons.    The responsible personnel took the injured immediately from  a  village dispensary to a hospital for treatment. Local military  columns, People's Police Force, People's Militia, responsible  personnel from the respective law and order restoration  councils, and local residents are collectively searching for the  members of the jungle-based armed organization who committed  this callous and wicked attack.</p>

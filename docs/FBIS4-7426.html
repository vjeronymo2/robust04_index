			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur is asking  the government to formally ask Malaysia to grant executive  clemency for humanitarian reasons to three Filipinos who were  meted death sentences for drug trafficking in Sabah two weeks  ago.    Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday  said  the recommendation sent by Ambassador to Malaysia Alberto  Encomienda will be submitted to President Ramos who will decide  whether formal representations will be made regarding the issue.    The plea hangs in the balance, this early though, as Ramos  yesterday issued a statement that drug traffickers should not  expect any pardon from him.    At the fifth ASEAN workshop for nongovernment organizations  for the prevention of drug and substance abuse held in  Malacanang [presidential office], Ramos said, "Let me clearly  indicate that I will interpose no objection if any person, so  convicted, is sent to the electric chair or gas chamber."    Last 14 April, the Malaysian Supreme Court ordered the  hanging of Japlin Jimlok, Benny Saman, and Gan Muslimin, all  based in Kota Kinabalu, after they were convicted of drug  trafficking by the High Courts in Sabah. The three Filipinos  are now awaiting their execution at the Kapaya State Prison in  Sabah.    On the same day, nine other Filipinos, including a woman,  had  their death sentences reduced to life imprisonment for the same  offense.    Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo said Ramos has  ordered Philippine officials in Kuala Lumpur to look into  reports that a number of imprisoned Filipinos in Sandakan, Sabah  were tortured by police and prison authorities.    Last 21 April, 11 Filipinos who were deported and imprisoned  in Sandakan complained that other Filipinos currently serving  jail terms in Sabah are also subjected to various forms of  torture like having their heads banged on walls and dunked in  toilet bowls, and their skin carved off the soles of their feet.</p>

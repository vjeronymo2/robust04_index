At this meeting,  pro-reform members and those advocating taking a cautious stance  on the political reform bills engaged in heated debate for over  three hours.    Sozaburo Jimi, one of those taking a cautious stance, said  since a joint meeting of both houses is a very exceptional case,  matters cannot be left in the hands of the party executives.  Toshikatsu Matsuoka, another member taking a cautious stance,  said a joint committee of both houses is a form of closed  meeting where the public is shut out, and, therefore, it should  not be accepted so simply.    On the other hand, Senpachi Oishi, a pro-reformist, said the  currently-proposed bills are not perfect, but they must be  enacted for the LDP to regain power. Former Deputy Prime  Minister Masaharu Gotoda said efforts have been made to bring  the current bills as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as  possible, so the party should try to maintain its unity and work  out a compromise with the coalition parties.    Following the debates, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori  said if the political reform bills were to be returned to the  lower house for reapproval, the LDP would face the danger of  falling apart. He asked for the understanding of party members  on the need to agree to convene a joint committee of both  houses, provided the coalition parties agree not to return the  bills to the lower house for reapproval. The LDP General  Council thus agreed to a plan to work out a compromise with the  coalition parties.    On convening a joint committee of both houses, Sadatoshi  Ozato, chairman of LDP Diet Affairs Committee, at a news  conference this evening:    [Begin Ozato recording] Since a thorough and orderly  discussion on the bills is to be conducted at a joint committee  of both house of the Diet, I believe we can look forward to it  in all sincerity, as I have already mentioned, and hope for its  success. [end recording]    Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Gotoda, and other  members who seek enactment of the political reform bills during  the current Diet session, have also urged LDP President Yohei  Kono to try to work out a compromise that would bring the bills  as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as possible at the  joint committee of both houses. Kono said he would do his best.</p>

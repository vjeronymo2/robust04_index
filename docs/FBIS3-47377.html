			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Undisguised Collusion With </F> Former Dictators"]    [Text] According to a South Korean radio report, on 10  January, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, in the so-called  capacity of president, met with Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No  Tae-u, who were in the position of puppet president a long time  ago, and exchanged views on so-called national administration.    In the meeting, the puppet traitor explained the so-called  supreme goal of national administration and raved that he will  continue pursuing change and reform in the future, that he will  work in a fair and square manner, and so forth. Traitor Kim  Yong-sam also asked for their active cooperation.    Expressing sympathy with this, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No  Tae-u said that they will not spare active cooperation and  support and that traitor Kim Yong-sam's broad-mindedness will  contribute to new political culture, thus praising him.    This illustrates that the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has  not  parted from dictators of the Fifth and Sixth Republics but has  become the same gang member. This is unbearable mockery and  challenge to the South Korean people who demand liquidation of  the Fifth and Sixth Republics' dictatorship and realization of  social democracy.    As is known to all, the South Korean people, only if they  hear the names of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, become  tense with indignation against intolerable crimes of massacre  and fascist repressive maneuvers they committed against fellow  countrymen.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam's meeting with Chon Tu-hwan and No  Tae-u  military hooligans, who are notorious as peerlessly atrocious  murderers and fascist tyrants, itself evoked surging indignation  of the South Korean people.    The puppet traitor's criminal act again proved that the  reform drive he has been loudly talking about is a cunning trick  to deceive the South Korean people.    To carry out reform in South Korea, one should, above all,  eradicate dictators together with the military fascist rule, and  should abolish fascist evil laws including the National Security  Law, a remnant of the military fascist rule, as well as  repressive organizations including the Agency for National  Security Planning.    Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam further strengthened  them,  instead of abolishing them, and bestially oppressed the people's  just struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification by  wielding fascist evil laws and mobilizing repressive forces. Not  satisfied with supporting and protecting the Fifth and Sixth  Republic dictators, traitor Kim Yong-sam met with the rascals  and asked for their cooperation, thus acting rashly.    A South Korean broadcast reported that during the meeting  between Kim Yong-sam, No Tae-u, and Chon Tu-hwan, heart-to-heart  dialogue and jokes were exchanged between them.    The fact shows that puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam came into  collusion as one with the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators,  instead of parting from them, and again implemented the  full-scale military fascist terrorist rule in South Korea under  cooperation of former dictators from long ago.    Feeling very grateful to puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam,  traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u went so far as to talk about  his broad- mindedness.    The filthy behavior of the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam who  fondly talked with Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, objects of the  South Korean people's indignation and hatred, can be done by  only a peerless political prostitute and expert betrayer, and it  can never be tolerable.    The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam said as if he had worked for  something appreciable for the past 10 months and said he would  work in a clean and dignified manner in the future, too. This  is also a shameless deceit.    What the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has done for the past  10  months was nothing more than treachery and selling the county.  It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that has pursued the North-South  confrontation and war, not the fatherland's reunification that  all fellow countrymen earnestly desire. It is also traitor Kim  Yong-sam that cut off the life line of the six million South  Korean farmers and South Korean agriculture and has pushed its  overall economy into a catastrophic crisis by opening the rice  market, which even preceding dictators could not dare to open.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam has been frenzied to bring a nuclear  calamity to the nation, cruelly infringed upon the South Korean  people's right to live, far from protecting their freedom and  right to democracy, and pushed them into the greatest misery.  It was a nonsense that he said as if he had worked for  something and said he would work in a clean manner in the future.    Just like we cannot expect charity from a wolf, there is  nothing to expect from traitor Kim Yong-sam who makes it his  business to sell the country and the nation.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam is dashing into treachery harder and  harder as days go by.    Realities show that the South Korean people cannot avoid  their misfortune and tragedy but be driven to face a worse  slavish destiny of a colony as long as they leave traitor Kim  Yong-sam as he is.    The South Korean people will definitely deal a hard blow to  traitor Kim Yong-sam who is trying to dash into a road of  crueler fascist oppression in collusion with former dictators.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam should clearly be aware that the  superficially attractive pretense of civilian government and  honeyed words can no longer work. He had batter resign his post  of power before being given a stern trial by the people.</p>

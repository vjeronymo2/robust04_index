			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / R-R may order Mercedes engines Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers engineering group subsidiary, is discussing the purchase of V12 engines and other components from Mercedes-Benz of Germany for use in future model programmes. Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce chairman and chief executive and Vickers managing director, operations, refused to confirm the specific talks with the German carmaker, but said: 'We are in a number of discussions.' Mercedes-Benz said that Rolls-Royce had approached it a year ago for talks about engine supply for a new generation of products and said that discussions were continuing. Mr Ward said Rolls-Royce was 'looking at a number of possibilities and partners, but we are not yet close to reaching a conclusion'. An eventual move by Rolls-Royce to purchase engines from Mercedes-Benz would represent a significant departure for the company, which assembles its own 6.75 litre V8 engines at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire. The current engines used in Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are derived from an original 6.25 litre V8 engine launched by the company in 1958, although the engines have since been substantially updated. The Mercedes-Benz 6 litre V12 was launched in 1991 in its S-Class model. It produces about 8,500 V12 engines a year. Rolls-Royce and Bentley production was 1,263 last year. Technology, Page 12</p>

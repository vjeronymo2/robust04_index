Consideration of Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The implementation of either Regulatory Alternative IV, IV&hyph;Q, or IV&hyph;M is projected to result in gasoline price and consumption impacts, facility closures, and declines in employment. The national average base year increase in the retail price of motor gasoline as a result of these alternatives is estimated at $0.001 per gallon. The national base year decline in gasoline consumption is estimated at less than 100 million gallons (0.08 percent). There are a limited number of facility closures estimated to result from the regulatory alternatives. The base year facility closure estimate is nearly 650, of which more than 90 percent are projected for the service station sector. While the estimated number of service station closures is estimated to be in the hundreds, it should be noted that a total of over 380,000 stations are projected being in operation during the base year, so that the number of facilities closing would constitute less than two-tenths of one percent. Furthermore, due to a consumption-spurred projection of modest industry growth from 1993 to 1998, some closures due to the regulation may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in new facility openings rather than closures of existing facilities. Employment reductions due to reduced consumption and facility closure are estimated at just over 1,100 jobs, of which 70 percent are projected for the service station sector. However, this job loss constitutes only about 0.05 percent of the total employment attributed to the service station sector in the base year. For the same reason given for facility closures, some employment reductions may be more accurately interpreted as reductions in industry job opportunities rather than losses of existing jobs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 7. Consideration of Secondary Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As discussed earlier, there is projected to be no adverse secondary air pollution or water pollution impacts associated with standards based on implementation of any of the alternatives. In fact, there is likely to be some benefits. For example, implementation of any of the alternatives would be based in major part on an LDAR program. LDAR programs at most facilities should actually reduce the water pollution impact through detection and repair of faulty equipment in a shorter timeframe than in the past. Additional benefits may be realized through decreased intrusion of rainwater into storage tanks at both facility types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The small amount of water condensed from the air-vapor stream by refrigeration condenser systems installed at loading racks should pose no threat to the environment because the gasoline is recovered (typically in an oil-water separator) and the gasoline-water portion is collected and stored for processing off-site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Upon his arrival in Amman today, Palestinian  Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, told our correspondent that  Israel is still studying the Palestinian paper presented by the  PLO and that there is hope on the horizon.    [Begin recording] [Kamal] I can say that when I left Cairo  for beloved Amman there was a paper comprising 12 contentious  points. On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos,  it was agreed that brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and the  Israeli foreign minister should meet to try to overcome these  points, after Israel had a chance to study them, especially from  the PLO's point of view.    I was somewhat cautious when I learned yesterday about the  optimistic report that a compromise [previous word in English]  was reached, because Mr. Rabin holds the reigns and has the  final say. It became evident that, until this morning, the man  was still studying the particular issue of security at crossing  points, which is a sensitive issue to both the Palestinian and  Israeli sides, as well as to the Jordanian and Egyptian sides.    Hence, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon for another  meeting before the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan in  order to formulate the agreement. However, this must be  preceded by a meeting that solves the problems over the issue of  crossing points, especially the crossing point at Rafah. This  is after Rabin announces that he is coming to Cairo, just as he  announced earlier, to sign the final agreement on security  preparations and withdrawal within the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area.    [Reporter] Besides the issue or problem of crossing points,  are there other problems obstructing the agreement?    [Kamal] I believe that there are still stylistic issues  rather than issues that are particularly sensitive to either  side or to the Arab side, in general, especially to the Arab  cordon states.

Jackson's estimated gross  income for 1989 is $65 million, giving him a two-year total of $125 million.

Yeltsin  said on a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston that the United States or  the Soviet Union should drop its space program. Yeltsin told center director  Aaron Cohen that the two countries should join forces to explore the moon and  Mars. "We're spending more money on space exploration because we are  competing," Yeltsin said. The maverick Soviet politician has said the Soviets  should reduce their space spending and spend more on their economy, and he said  a joint space program would improve superpower relations. "I don't care who  gets to the moon sooner. Whether it's the Soviet Union or the U.S. doesn't  matter to me," Yeltsin said. "Sometimes I wish one of you would come over and  whisper in my ear which of the space programs we could easily get rid of."  </P> <P>  -- Spy novelist John Le Carre is one of the latest beneficiaries of the more  open policies in the Soviet Union. His latest best-seller, "The Russia House,"  will be published next year in that country, Tass reported. The contract signed  at the Moscow International Book Fair calls for 100,000 copies to be printed in  the Russian language.  </P> <P>  -- A publicist said singer Neneh Cherry has dropped out of a tour with the  group Fine Young Cannibals because she has Lyme disease. She had performed on  the tour's opening night but collapsed the next day after appearing as a  presenter on the MTV music video awards program. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

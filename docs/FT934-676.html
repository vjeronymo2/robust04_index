			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: P&amp;O The cynical way of looking at P&amp;O's disposal of most of its stake in Modern Terminals for Pounds 117m is that the company is conveniently realising a capital gain at the end of the year to help pay its dividend. Last year's payout was only just covered and operating profit showed only marginal growth in the first half. So the company needs exceptional gains to justify a dividend which it actually increased as profits fell at the onset of recession. Were that the whole story, the market would scarcely have been justified in pushing up P&amp;O's share price by 1 per cent in response to the sale. There are, however, mitigating considerations. Since the stake in Modern Terminals was too small to be consolidated or even equity-accounted its only contribution to profits was a meagre dividend flow. The disposal has revealed a hidden value which was not apparent at the operating profit line. If this situation is replicated elsewhere in P&amp;O's balance sheet, the market may have under-estimated its true net worth. One question, therefore, is how far investors should factor in the scope for capital gains. The answer would be easier if P&amp;O were explicit in its intention to make money out of trading assets. In that case, its dividend would also be smaller, since it would presumably be anxious to conserve resources for profitable investment deals. As it is, the group remains wedded to its cyclical property and shipping businesses, and there is limited transparency to its investment activities. Investors may take some comfort from the possibility of future capital gains. They would take more if the main businesses were generating more by way of operating profit.</p>

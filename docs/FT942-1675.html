			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charged up over competition law Why American Express's credit card promotion hit legal barriers in Germany Produce a credit card in a German shop or restaurant and it is likely that the proprietor will look at you with consternation, before explaining that plastic is strengst verboten and that D-Marks or Eurocheques are the only means of payment allowed. There are just 8.9m credit and charge cards in Germany, compared with 37m in the UK, making Germany one of the least developed plastic card markets among Europe's leading economies. Relative to the size of the economy and its 80m population, Germany is the most important plastic card market in Europe, says Colm Lorigan, senior counsel for Europe at American Express International in Frankfurt. Cracking the market is no easy matter, though, and not only because of deep-seated cultural hostility to credit and charge cards. Marketing tactics which are standard in other countries can hit legal barriers in Germany, as American Express found after launching a promotion for its product in November last year. That month, cardholders in Germany received with their monthly statement a brochure outlining American Express Membership Miles, a promotional scheme which the company has introduced in the US and other European countries. The scheme offered members bonus points for each D-Mark they spent on the card. These points could be used towards air travel with three airlines and hotel accommodation. Although the programme was successful - spending by cardmembers enrolled in the scheme rose by 50 per cent - the promotion had to be quickly halted. Within a week of the launch, American Express was sued by an organisation called the Zentrale zur Bekampfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs, the Centre for Combating Unfair Competition, a Wiesbaden-based body which has policed Germany's competition law since early this century. The company was charged with breaching the so-called Zugabeverordnung, a law which prevents the offer of free gifts in connection with the sale of goods. The Zugabeverordnung goes hand in hand with the Rabattgesetz, forbidding the offer of certain types of discounts, and is connected with the Ladenschutzgesetz, which limits shops' opening times. All three laws were introduced in the early 1930s to protect small shopkeepers from free competition, and are still popular with shopkeepers today. Last year the government unveiled plans to abolish all three as an unnecessary impediment to competition. But so great was the uproar from shopkeepers and unions that Chancellor Kohl intervened personally to ensure that Ladenschutzgesetz would remain until after this autumn's elections. Contrary to the government's original plans, the Zugabeverordnung and the Rabattgesetz were not abolished but merely amended. The amendments, passed by the German parliament last week, leave American Express 'stranded', complains Lorigan. Under the revised Rabattgesetz, service providers such as the Bundesbahn, the federal railway network, or Lufthansa, the soon-to-be-privatised German airline, can offer discounts to their own customers. But American Express is caught by the Zugabeverordnung, which still holds that the offer of another company's products (in this case, flights) is not permitted as a means to boost your own sales (in this instance, spending on the American Express card). Lorigan said that American Express introduced the product - with launch expenses of at least DM1m - knowing that there could be legal difficulties. But it had hoped that the Zugabeverordnung and the Rabattgesetz would be abolished. The legal structure of the offer was also designed to take advantage of EU legislation guaranteeing free trade of goods and services across European borders: the offer to German card-members is technically administered out of France. But recent European Court case law has gone against American Express, suggesting that foreign companies operating in a second country cannot claim that their freedom to trade is being muzzled if domestic competitors suffer the same restrictions. While American Express prepares an intensive lobbying campaign in the US and Europe to support its case, Lorigan claims that it has suffered discrimination at the hands of the Zentrale because it is a foreign company. He notes that the bonus scheme started by Lufthansa - the Miles and More promotion which has attracted 900,000 members since last year - was permitted by the Zentrale last year even when it was manifestly in breach of the Rabattgesetz. Marcel Kisseler, head of the Zentrale, dismisses the claim. He says the American Express scheme is in breach of the Zugabeverordnung. After an unsuccessful appeal against the original lawsuit, American Express is now permitted to continue with the service, but not to advertise it. This means that it is effectively dead as a promotions tool, and will remain so for years as litigation with the Zentrale continues.</p>

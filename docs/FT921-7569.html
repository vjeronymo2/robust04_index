			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Shamir retains grip on Likud party MR Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, last night retained his position at the head of the ruling Likud party as it moves towards a June 23 general election. He will face a recharged opposition Labour party under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who ousted Mr Shimon Peres as leader on Wednesday night. Mr Shamir, 76, who has led Likud since 1973, scored a comfortable victory, but it was less than crushing. He won just 46.4 per cent of the votes of the 3,000-strong Likud central committee. He failed to win an outright majority over his two challengers, even though his supporters had been striving for such a majority to underscore his authority over the party. Mr David Levy, the Moroccan-born foreign minister, came second with a creditable 31.2 per cent, while Mr Ariel Sharon, the hardline minister of housing and construction, won 22.3 per cent. The outcome was particularly satisfying for Mr Levy, a perennial rival of Mr Shamir. The prime minister's camp had been hoping Mr Levy would be badly enough beaten to cripple his hopes of eventually succeeding Mr Shamir and to undermine his claims to senior office should Likud form the next government. Instead, Mr Levy's position appeared to have been strengthened, especially given his complaints that the central committee was weighted in favour of Mr Shamir's supporters. He will go on to a ballot next week for the position of deputy leader against Mr Sharon and Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister and Shamir ally, who is confident of victory. Mr Levy immediately launched a bitter attack on Mr Arens, who seems to have suffered a setback to his ambitions eventually to overtake the foreign minister and become the Likud party's heir apparent. The result will also bolster Mr Levy's stance as the Likud minister most enthusiastic about the Middle Peace talks due to resume in Washington next week. He has consistently struck a more conciliatory tone than the recalcitrant Mr Shamir. By the same token, Mr Sharon, the government minister most hostile to the peace process, failed to register the big protest he had hoped for against the government's participation in the negotiations. Mr Sharon has been the driving force behind the big expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories carried out by Mr Shamir's government over the past two years. The settlements have brought Israel increasingly into conflict with the US, which says they are an obstacle to the Middle East peace process.</p>

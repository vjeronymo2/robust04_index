			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong gains ground as Tokyo throttles back THE NIKKEI average lost ground on small-lot profit-taking, while overall activity remained low due to the lack of fresh news, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average was finally down 51.17 at 17,281.73 after moving between 17,393.20 and 17,247.82. Selling by investment trusts outpaced buying by public fund managers in the afternoon. Volume fell to 200m shares from 322m. However, rises still led declines at the close by 492 to 457, with 188 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks gained a slight 1.12 at 1,309.59. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.26 to 1,058.98. In spite of the fall in some shares, traders said sentiment remained firm due to last week's Wall Street rise and cuts in Japanese and German interest rates. Some leading commercial banks announced a reduction in short-term lending rates, encouraging hopes of a boost in money supply. Semiconductor-related issues were bought on hopes of a recovery in the US market. Advantest, a semiconductor testing device maker, rose Y180 to Y2,550 and Tokyo Seimitsu, a semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker, climbed Y35 to Y905. NGK Spark Plug, a ceramic package maker, put on Y5 at Y955. Recent reports that Tonen, an oil refiner affiliated with Exxon and Mobil Oil, was under pressure to raise dividends after claims from the US oil companies, pushed up General Sekiyu (47 per cent owned by Exxon) by Y11 to Y976. Tokyo Electric Power gained Y20 at Y2,580. Traders said some investors found the company's 1.9 per cent dividend yield attractive. Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, dipped Y6 to Y381 on profit-taking by dealers who had bought the stock on the restructuring theme. Oki Electric, also seen as a beneficiary of corporate restructuring, eased Y1 to Y410. Sasebo Heavy Industries, also bought by dealers on hopes of higher sales due to proposed requirements of double hulls for tankers, receded Y13 to Y510 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 11.45 to 18,661.53 in volume of 28.1m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's clothing discounter, strengthened Y130 to Y8,300 on brisk sales in spite of a recent fall in consumer spending. Roundup WALL Street's record close on Friday supported the region. HONG KONG recovered from early losses and the Hang Seng index finished a net 39.44 ahead at 5,786.65 after touching 5,706.61. Turnover was low at HKDollars 1.43bn. HSBC Holdings was the most active stock of the day in turnover of HKDollars 121m but ended steady at HKDollars 61. AUSTRALIA responded to the announcement that the federal election will be held on March 13 with a 16.10 gain in the All Ordinaries index to 1,559.40. Turnover was ADollars 552m. Westpac's sale of stakes in ANZ and Bank of Melbourne, to local and overseas institutions and by tender, saw ANZ slip 6 cents to ADollars 2.99 while Westpac was steady at ADollars 3.03. National Australia Bank advanced 9 cents to ADollars 7.74 and Commonwealth Bank was 3 cents higher at ADollars 6.07. Elsewhere, BHP appreciated 16 cents to ADollars 13.84. MANILA registered its biggest one-day rise since the beginning of the year, the composite index gaining 37.88, or 2.8 per cent, at 1,379.89. Turnover fell to 389.7m pesos from Friday's 445.9m pesos. PLDT added 10 pesos at 915 pesos. SINGAPORE lost ground as profit-taking continued from Friday. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 2.91 to 1,615.73 in volume of 63.7m shares. UOB Foreign fell 35 cents to SDollars 8.80 and SIA Foreign declined 20 cents to SDollars 9.40. TAIWAN saw some profit-taking after last week's gains but the weighted index managed to add 3.34 at 3,648.75 in turnover of TDollars 21.8bn. KUALA LUMPUR weakened slightly as Tenaga lost 20 cents to MDollars 9.25 and Telekom dipped 10 cents to MDollars 13.20. The composite index ended 3.23 off at 641.60 in turnover of MDollars 348m. NEW ZEALAND put in a strong performance, the NZSE index rising 15.40 to 1,569.95. Fletcher Challenge improved 5 cents to NZDollars 2.45 and Telecom gained 4 cents at NZDollars 2.57. SEOUL saw late institutional buying in Kepco, up Won500 at Won186,000, help to lift the composite index 0.76 to 672.18 in an otherwise uneventful day.

BANGKOK closed off the day's high on late profit-taking but gains in some large-capitalisation issues helped the SET index up 0.88 to 980.93 in turnover of Bt8.1bn.</p>

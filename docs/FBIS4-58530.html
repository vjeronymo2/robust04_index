			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Awn Expresses Willingness To Hold </F> Direct Dialogue With Syria"]    [Text] Paris, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Former Lebanese Prime  Minister General Michel 'Awn yesterday expressed willingness to  hold a direct dialogue with Syria with no Lebanese intermediary  but on condition that "Damascus state its position clearly and  in advance on a number of basic points which are not negotiable."    'Awn, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his  residence  in La Hutte Maison in the outskirts of Paris, said: "I hope  that what I am saying will not be interpreted as appeasement."    'Awn added: "I do not agree to talk to the Lebanese regime.  I prefer to talk to the party directly responsible on the  ground. That party should, before the dialogue starts, make a  number of commitments on two main issues, namely sovereignty and  independence."    'Awn believes that "a practical demonstration of these two  issues can be made by scheduling withdrawal of the Syrian Army  from all Lebanese territory."    He described the claims made every now and then about  attempts to open a dialogue with him as mere maneuvers. He  added that "serious dialogue cannot be done through the press."  'Awn asked: "What has become of the investigation into the  crime of blowing up Sayyidat al-Najah church?"    He said that that case should be urgently dealt with because  "it is a special case, independent of any other case." He said  that "that incident was fabricated and opened the way to other  crimes."</p>

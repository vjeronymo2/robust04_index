			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> 20TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT;  </P> <P> 'CONSERVATIVE' THOMAS CHALLENGED BY CANDIDATE FROM FARTHER RIGHT  </P> <P> At one point during last winter's Republican state convention, a group of  well-dressed members of the ultraconservative Young Americans for Freedom booed  loudly as a middle-aged congressman from Bakersfield spoke from the convention  podium.  </P> <P> The congressman, William M. Thomas, was explaining details of a bill he helped  write to make it easier for citizens to register to vote. But the bill has  raised the hackles of some Republicans, particularly those on the right, who  fear it may damage recent GOP registration gains.  </P> <P> Thomas' convention speech wasn't the first time he has offended the right.  Though considered generally conservative, Thomas supports abortion rights, an  issue that has become a litmus test for many conservative activists.  </P> <P> Now Thomas, running for his seventh term in the sprawling, four-county 20th  Congressional District, faces a challenger from the right in Tuesday's GOP  primary election -- a Santa Clarita abortion foe and former Los Angeles  sheriff's deputy, Rod Gregory.  </P> <P> It is only the second primary opponent Thomas, 48, has run against since his  1978 election in the sprawling district, which corkscrews across 22,000 square  miles of California's abdomen, from the ranching country of San Luis Obispo  County to the desert wastes of Inyo County. It also covers a portion of the  Antelope Valley in northern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> But the district's political center of gravity is Kern County, where Thomas --  who launched his political career from the obscurity of a job teaching American  government at a Bakersfield community college -- is well-entrenched.  </P> <P> Political observers give Gregory, 33, little chance of upsetting Thomas,  considered one of the GOP's wiliest tacticians. Gregory, who owns a firm that  services swimming pools, is making his first run for public office and has  raised about $15,000 for the race.  </P> <P> The GOP nominee will face the winner of the Democratic primary in the November  general election. But the Republican nominee is likely to prevail in the  district, where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by 49% to 41%.  </P> <P> The Democrats on the primary ballot are Lita Reid, a free-lance journalist from  Ridgecrest, and Michael A. Thomas, a Grover City businessman. In the 1988  general election, William Thomas trounced Reid by 71% to 27%.  </P> <P> The most interesting political fallout in the race so far is the refusal of two  influential Kern County-area Republicans, Assemblyman Phil Wyman and state Sen.  Don Rogers, to endorse Thomas.  </P> <P> Thomas criticized the two lawmakers -- both of them staunch conservatives he  has tangled with -- for not backing him in the interest of party unity, angrily  charging that Wyman "wimped out" when Thomas asked for his endorsement.  </P> <P> The congressman charged that Gregory is an extremist who is staging a  "one-issue contest" centered on abortion. Gregory, who has been arrested twice  while protesting outside abortion clinics, helped found a Newhall counseling  center that urges pregnant woman not to have abortions.  </P> <P> "He wants to take government and use it to enforce his opinions on others,"  Thomas said. "Ironically, I don't find that very conservative."  </P> <P> Gregory rejected the notion that he is an extremist, saying Thomas is out of  step with the district on the abortion-rights issue.  </P> <P> "The pro-family vote out there is very dissatisfied, and they're ready to  change," he said.  </P> <P> Gregory attacked Thomas for co-sponsoring the national voter-registration bill  with Rep. Al Swift (D-Washington). Under one provision, citizens could  re-register when they renewed their driver's license, prompting wags to dub it  the "motor voter" bill.  </P> <P> Gregory charged that the bill, which has passed the House of Representatives,  would encourage voter fraud. He said it would also result in three times as  many Democrats being signed up as Republicans.  </P> <P> But Thomas said polls show that a majority of unregistered voters "have  Republican tendencies," and making it easier to register will actually add to  GOP membership.  </P> <P> Few political observers believe Gregory represents any real threat to Thomas,  who has carefully built up his political muscle in the district by actively  supporting local candidates.  </P> <P> "There's not a chance" of Thomas losing, said Los Angeles-based political  consultant Tim Carey, a one-time Thomas field representative. "Thomas is a big  machine up there."  </P> <P> A professional political scientist, Thomas is the California GOP congressional  delegation's leading strategist on redistricting and was recently described by  a national political journal as "an aggressive political maneuverer."  </P> <P> In his first term, he managed to land a seat on the House Agriculture  Committee, a plum assignment for a lawmaker from farm-rich Kern County. He has  since won a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.  </P></p>

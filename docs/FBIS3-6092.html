While Japan, which is suffering from sluggish prices of  ships, called on the ROK to curb the buildup of its facilities,  the ROK refused by saying, "Japan's demand is against the move  toward liberalization." Thus, they failed to reach an accord.    Another meeting of shipbuilders of Japan, the ROK, and  European countries is scheduled for 14 and 15 March.    Several ROK builders, including the Samsung Heavy Industrial  Company, have so far announced plans to build new docks for very  large crude carriers (VLCC). With regard to their plans,  Japanese representatives led by Shigeru Aida, chairman of the  Shipbuilders Association of Japan, (chairman of Sumitomo Heavy  Industries Ltd.), urged self-restraint on the buildup of  facilities, insisting: "There is already a surplus in  shipbuilding facilities in the world. Building more facilities  will cause excessive competition for contracts."    However, ROK Shipbuilders Association Chairman Song Yong-su,  (president of the Hanchin Heavy Industrial Company), and other  participants insisted on difficulties in curbing the buildup of  facilities, explaining: "We would like Japan to understand our  circumstances. After the change of political regime, everything  is moving toward liberalization."    Thanks to the increase in the yen's value against the won,  the number of orders received by the ROK has been increasing in  recent years, becoming number one in the world in 1993,  exceeding that of Japan.</p>

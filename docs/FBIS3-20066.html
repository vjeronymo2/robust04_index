In the  process, 14 people were killed, as Angelika Beer, a member of  the party's Executive Committee, reported on Sunday [27 March]  from Diyarbakir. A press release further says that the Turkish  Government has done everything over the past few days to prevent  foreign observers from watching the local elections in Kurdistan.    The Greens called on the Federal Government to make it  unambiguously clear to Ankara that any further cooperation is  linked with observing human rights in Turkey. This, for its  part, can currently mean only that all military and economic  support must be ceased immediately.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT, LINKED TO PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, ARRESTED IN PROBE OF ASSAULT ON COUPLE  </P> <P> A suspect in the brutal assault last October of Aissa Wayne, daughter of the  late actor John Wayne, and her financier boyfriend, Roger Luby, has been  arrested, it was learned Sunday.  </P> <P> Orange County Jail records showed that Jerrel L. Hintergardt, 37, was arrested  Friday by Newport Beach police for investigation of criminal conspiracy,  assault with a deadly weapon, assault on a person with a firearm, and force or  violence on a witness. He was jailed in lieu of $1-million bail set by a  Municipal judge, pending formal arraignment, probably today.  </P> <P> A police spokesman Sunday refused to provide further information, saying  official statements would be issued today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incident Recalled  </P> <P> Wayne, 32, and Luby, 52, were confronted at his $3-million Newport Beach home  Oct. 3, 1988, by two armed men who bound the couple, pistol-whipped them and  warned them their life was in danger. One of the men slashed the Achilles'  tendon in Luby's right leg.  </P> <P> Investigators said one of the assailants, matching the description of the man  in custody, warned Luby and Wayne: "You're (messing) with the wrong people. If  you screw up again, you're dead."  </P> <P> In search warrants and affidavits filed Feb. 27 in Orange County Superior  Court, Newport Beach police said they were seeking a "Jerry Hintergardt" for  questioning in the case. Police said Hintergardt was an employee of O. Daniel  Gal, a Los Angeles private investigator hired by Aissa Wayne's ex-husband,  Pomona orthopedic surgeon Dr. Thomas A. Gionis.  </P> <P> The court documents said the police had learned that Gal was seen in a car  parked on the street near Luby's walled estate on the morning of the attack.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Description Provided  </P> <P> The court papers also said that an employee of Gal's, identified as  Hintergardt, fit an eyewitness' description of one of the two men involved in  the assault. According to the witness, Glenn Torrez, one of the men he saw  leaving the Luby home walked with a pronounced limp, was blond, and was about 6  feet, 2 inches tall.  </P> <P> Hintergardt fits the description, according to an anonymous source who claimed  to be a friend of the Hintergardt family. The source said he and Hintergardt  family members were angry and concerned because of the "secrecy" surrounding  the arrest and because the man was given such a high bail.  </P> <P> An Orange County deputy district attorney, who asked not to be quoted by name,  said on Sunday, "A million dollars bail is very, very unusual in an assault  case unless it's a VIP involved."  </P> <P> Wayne, in an interview Sunday at her Corona Del Mar home, said police had not  told her of an arrest.  </P> <P> "I'm very upset I have not been notified," she said.  </P> <P> Luby could not be reached, but a relative at his residence said Luby also had  not been informed,  </P> <P> Gal's private investigative firm was hired by Gionis during a child-custody  battle involving the couple's divorce last summer, according to court records.  The records said police found that Gal made seven telephone calls to  Hintergardt on the day of the Wayne-Luby attack.  </P> <P> Gionis, on Jan. 30, won custody of his and Wayne's young daughter, Anastasia.  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge denied Wayne custody, calling her  "emotionally immature," but allowed visitation rights every other weekend.  </P> <P> Neither Gal nor Gionis could be reached for comment on Sunday.  </P></p>

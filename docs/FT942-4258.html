			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting behind 25% rise at Chubb to Pounds 77.14m Cost cutting at Chubb Security enabled the electronic alarm and locks group to achieve a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 77.14m for the year to end-March. The improvement in profits, from last year's Pounds 61.75m, was scored from a turnover just 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 701m (Pounds 688m). The shares fell 25p to 335p, reflecting concerns over the level of sales growth. The UK and Asia Pacific markets produced strong growth, but the US and Europe were affected by a downturn in sales, primarily in their fire systems business. The figures were affected by currency movements and an accounting policy change on currency translation. This reduced turnover by Pounds 12m and pre-tax profits by Pounds 1m. Mr David Peacock, chief executive, said sales for the first two months of the current year were on target, and were 'meaningfully ahead' of the previous year. Since the company demerged from Racal in October 1992, management has focused on boosting both market share and reducing costs. Last year, the company made around 500 redundancies worldwide but overall redundancy and reorganisation costs fell Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.9m, and the pace of restructuring should slow. Operating profits from the group's electronic security division rose 13 per cent to Pounds 41.78m, with profit margins improving from 10.8 per cent to 11.8 per cent. On the physical security side, profits grew 21 per cent to Pounds 36.57m and margins from 8.8 per cent to 10.5 per cent. Chubb is investing Pounds 8m in plant equipment in the current year, and plans to introduce 16 new product ranges and expand its sales force in a push to increase market share. It is also developing in emerging markets. Sales in China grew to Pounds 34m last year, and Chubb is expanding its sales presence there. This should help make up for continuing weakness in the US and European markets, where sales fell Pounds 7.7m last year. At the year end, Chubb had built up a net cash position of Pounds 35.3m. A recommended final dividend of 4.25p makes a 6.25p (4.75p) total. Earnings amounted to 16.4p (12.47p). COMMENT Chubb came out with a good set of results, but the problem it now faces is how to deliver more. It has relatively mature markets, and a level of efficiency which is getting harder to improve. The push into new markets, combined with the upturn in western economies, should help it achieve pre-tax profits of about Pounds 90m in the current year. This puts the shares on a p/e ratio of 17.3, even after today's fall. On those expectations, it seems unlikely to continue outperforming the market.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1120 GMT on 24 April carries the  40-minute "Live Dialogue" program featuring an interview with  Russian Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and  Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin by correspondent Yuliy  Semenov.    Semenov introduces Rybkin and Shumeyko and says the topic of  discussion will be the agreement on civil accord to be signed on  28 April. He begins by asking why the civil peace accord is  needed.    Shumeyko explains that the Constitution was the basis for  the  '94 election of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. He says:  "We must do a lot in Russia now, and without agreement it will  be impossible. The Duma has nine factions that unite various  political parties, but many parties have been left outside these  bodies of state power. There are more than 100 parties all  together. There are also many public movements, groups, and  public organizations in the provinces. We would like to unite  all of them around one goal, the goal of building. Russia needs  calm today; Russia must work."    Rybkin suggests that Russia is in the middle of a crisis and  accord is needed as soon as possible. He adds that there should  be cooperation between all forces in society. He says that the  State Duma has already released its own memorandum on accord,  and the new document is absolutely necessary.    Shumeyko continues by saying that the people who worked on  the new constitution have also contributed to the new agreement  on accord, but the new document is less important than the act  of signing it. He adds: "The signing of this accord means that  every politician takes upon himself the responsibility for this  accord. He undertakes to suspend all political battles, thus  enabling Russia to work for at least two years, leaving aside  the power struggle and the struggle for predomination in various  social movements. This is an accord on the politicians'  responsibility to find peace and a common language."    Rybkin says that there are also internal, interethnic  problems facing Russia and cites relations with Chechnya as an  example. He says he hopes that the agreement on accord will  help to resolve these problems.    Semenov asks Shumeyko whether Chechnya is a constituent part  of the Russian Federation. Shumeyko replies: "The Chechen  Republic has been and still is a constituent part of the Russian  Federation. The only difference is the politicians' view on this  matter. As you know, President Dudayev has been the leader of  the Chechen Republic for the last two years. He has been  elected by the Chechen people. There is only one document, a  decision by the former Congress of People's Deputies, declaring  these elections void. And so, on the basis of this single  document, as well as on the basis of various declarations--some  harsh, others less so--issued by President Dudayev, everyone  seems to have decided that Chechnya has separated from Russia.  So this nation of 1 million, which is part of Russia, finds  itself in a temporary, self-imposed isolation. The Federation  Council will continue to work very consistently, but calmly, in  order to fully reintegrate the Chechen Republic into Russia."    Shumeyko and Rybkin then discuss the Federation Council and  the State Duma's future work on the civil accord and other  pending matters.    Semenov asks Shumeyko about the fate of the Black Sea Fleet.  Shumeyko replies: "Well, first of all, the fleet certainly must  be retained. Russia, as you know, will very soon be celebrating  the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet. The Russian fleet  is a Russian creation. The fleet is Russia itself. It is  simply impossible to imagine Russia without it. Therefore, it  is perfectly clear that it should be retained.    "The decisions that the presidents made--I mean, at the last  CIS summit.... [pauses] Representatives of Ukraine and Russia  stayed on after the summit. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin had  talks with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, and the two presidents  made a decision to divide up the Black Sea Fleet with a ratio of  20 per cent to 80 percent. You see what happened afterwards,  when talks began at lower levels of authority.    "I believe that the process will stabilize, but what I would  like to see and what I would like to say by way of warning is  that decisions here should not be made rashly. Things should be  done more calmly. We all know this. Both the Ukrainians and  ourselves know that the fleet should remain, and the Black Sea  Fleet will remain and will exist forever. As to what form it  should take, I would prefer it to remain as a complete fleet. I  believe that this is what will happen eventually--however much  the politicians are insisting on their short-term gains today.  Short-term gains are very dear to certain politicians. A  little time will pass, and the people will have forgotten about  today's politicians, but the fleet will be remembered."    Semenov then asks Rybkin about possible trouble on 1 May.  Rybkin replies: "I am convinced that on 1 May, the day of  spring and labor--our official holiday but also the Orthodox  Easter day--the streets in Russia will be calm. People are  beginning to understand that there is a need for the accord that  we have been talking about for a whole hour today."    Rybkin then adds: "I am sure that we will be both  intellectually and emotionally strong enough to understand that  we must find a way out of the crisis through joint efforts. As  they say, Russia has always been strong through its team spirit,  and is famous around the world for its great good deeds rather  than for its meanness."    Semenov thanks the listeners and says he hopes to see the  chairmen in the Kremlin on 28 April to sign the agreement on  public accord.</p>

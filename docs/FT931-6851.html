			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Scottish yard cuts most of its workforce McDERMOTT, the US owner of the Ardersier offshore fabrication yard near Inverness, one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, is to make most of its remaining 500 workers redundant, Andrew Taylor writes. The yard, which employed 3,500 workers 18 months ago, will run out of work on Monday when it is due to complete a contract for part of a North Sea production platform. McDermott says that Ardersier will then move to 'little more than care and maintenance'. The yard is expected to employ only about 75 people by the beginning of April. More than half of the jobs are to go next week. The redundancies are the latest in a series in yards in Scotland and north-east England. This month the Offshore Manufacturers' and Constructors' Association estimated that the number of workers employed by offshore fabricators, including sub-contractors, had halved to 10,000 since September. Manufacturers are forecasting a further 3,000 job losses in the next few months as investment in North Sea exploration continues to dwindle. McDermott insisted it was maintaining its commitment to the yard in which it invested Pounds 25m in 1986.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Remy Leveau, professor at the Institute of </F> Political Studies in Paris and expert on the Algerian Army, by  Farid Aichoune and Henri Guirchoun; date, place not given:  "Islamic Salvation Front: Army Wants To Negotiate"]    [Text] [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Following the failure of  the National Conference and the appointment of General Zeroual  as head of the Algerian state, is there deadlock once again?    [Leveau] I do not think so. There was a suspicion that a  secret dialogue has been going on for a long time in the secrecy  of the El-Boulaida (formerly Blida) military prison. But  negotiations are now openly being conducted between the army and  the political elements of the Islamic movement. Moreover, we  have learned that the officials of the FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] at one point went directly from their cells to the  conference table. That proves that they are recognized as real  partners. I would even say that the army now seems to regard  them as the only interlocutors on its level, to the detriment of  the other political parties. Obviously, what we do not yet know  is why those negotiations did not succeed.    [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] After having fought the FIS, does  this army not now have its back to the wall and have no choice  but to roll out the red carpet for it?    [Leveau] Many officers have probably reached the conclusion  that it was no longer possible to get rid of the FIS and that it  will be increasingly difficult for them to develop in a country  which has been rendered hostile by repression. But from there  to thinking that the Algerian army is preparing to capitulate in  mid-campaign.... No, despite two years of a vicious circle of  guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and repression, the military corps  has not collapsed, as the Islamic movement may have hoped. It  has remained completely coherent and united. Furthermore, there  is a hard core of 25,000 to 30,000 men in the elite troops who  will remain completely loyal to the general staff whatever  happens.    [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Are there not some soldiers who have  been won over to the Islamic cause?    [Leveau] There have in fact been a few desertions at a  junior level. The army attributes them to mistakes made in the  days of President Bendjedid, who encouraged the integration of  students through lengthy periods of military service. But when  this creeping Islamic fundamentalism led to the desertion of a  few officers, the punishments were harsh. Military Security  still exits, and reprisals are apparently taken against the  families. The message had to be very clearly understood.  [passage omitted]    [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In the framework of the dialogue  with the FIS which you mentioned, what can these modernist  officers have in common with the Islamic fundamentalists?    [Leveau] If you make a quick sociological analysis of this  group of young officers, you discover that they are mainly  scientists with rational minds. When you look at their  libraries, you realize that they read both history and science  fiction. They are often married to teachers. But, at the same  time, they are very austere people who do not drink alcohol and  who observe their religion. Some have even gone on pilgrimage  to Mecca. They are the same age, have followed the same  educational careers: So their profile is not so far removed  from that of the so-called second-generation FIS members.  Furthermore, these officers share a number of nationalist  values with the Islamic fundamentalists. When the Islamic  fundamentalists refer to the FLN [National Liberation Front] of  the war of independence, they adopt the nationalist statements  of the past, so dear to the military. Moreover, in the future,  the military and the Islamic fundamentalists may find that they  have the same line with regard to the Sahara, which is likely to  become a pretext for upping the stakes and launching a  confrontation with Morocco with the aim of repairing Algerian  national unity.    [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Even if such a convergence took  place, would the army's interests be reconcilable with the  Islamic fundamentalists' political objectives?    [Leveau] If it is guaranteed a pact on impunity with regard  to the corruption scandals in which a number of general officers  are implicated; if its resources are maintained; and, above all,  if its administrative autonomy is not affected--the promotion  scale, recruitment by military academies, housing, pensions--the  army might ultimately agree to allow the FIS to run the  country's affairs.    This is the hypothesis of a change like the one which took  place in Chile, in which the army abandoned power without giving  up its privileges and in which, above all, the democratic  government agreed not to put Pinochet on trial. In this spirit,  it is even possible to imagine that the young officers I  mentioned above might no longer feel complete solidarity with  their elders and might agree to sacrifice some of them on the  altar of morality. Provided, of course, the edifice of the army  in general was not excessively undermined. Also provided that  the Islamic fundamentalists, for their part, were prepared to  neutralize their most radical elements.    Another, possibly more plausible hypothesis is that of an  army which played a greater part in a pluralist political  system. In that case, it would have the position of arbiter  between the FIS, the moderate Islamic movement, the Republicans,  the Berbers, and civilian society. That would presuppose the  FIS agreeing to be limited to a popular role--that of the  defense of the poor and disinherited. But, in both hypotheses,  the army would do all it could to maintain its autonomy.</p>

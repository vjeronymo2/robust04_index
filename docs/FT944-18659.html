			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Portillo disdains minimum wage The Conservatives last night launched a renewed onslaught on Labour's plans for a national minimum wage as unions signalled their determination to ensure that the party fixes a specific rate before the next election. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, anticipated today's Labour conference debate on the issue by releasing a long dossier of independent analyses which he said reinforced the Tories' case that a minimum wage would destroy jobs. Advocacy of a minimum wage demonstrated that Labour's modernisation claims were fraudulent, he continued. Such a measure would 'drive up inflation and could cost up to 2m jobs, harming the very people we should be trying to help'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will reaffirm during the debate the party's commitment to the principle of a minimum wage. But at the insistence of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, the motions supported by the leadership make no mention of a specific figure. Mr Blair has made clear that he wants to wait until much closer to the election before making any specific commitment and has refused to endorse the formula favoured by the unions of a rate fixed to half median male earnings. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union with 825,000 affiliated votes at the conference, said his union wanted to reaffirm the existing position as laid out in policy documents published before the 1992 general election. 'On today's figures this would amount to a statutory minimum wage of Pounds 4.05 an hour,' he said. Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general union's general secretary, said the party's existing minimum-wage policy would stand 'until it is changed'. He added that the party's Economic Commission would decide on a new target figure for the minimum wage by the next party conference, but it would be based on the formula of half median male earnings. Mr Edmonds also said that Labour must also agree to a precise target for the achievement of full employment by the time of the next general election. He added: 'We have to say where the new jobs will come from, how many there will be and how quickly they will come.' Support for a more flexible approach to the issue came yesterday from Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union, who said: 'There needs to be further discussion before the drawing up of Labour's election manifesto.'</p>

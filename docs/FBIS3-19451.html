			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Yaman Toruner, the director of the Central Bank,  has said there are deposits in every kind of foreign currency in  the banks in Turkey. He also said that the parity of the U.S.  dollar will be established in accordance with supply and demand  in the money markets. Stressing that the Central Bank must not  be weakened, Toruner asserted: "The Central Bank is one of  Turkey's most unique establishments. It must not be weakened,  even for the sake of elections." [passage omitted]    Toruner described as unfounded rumors that bank deposits in  foreign currency will be placed under control and revealed the  amount of foreign currency reserves in the Central Bank. He  said foreign currency reserves total around $4.640 billion. He  also said that $3.549 billion of that amount can be used "in 15  minutes." Toruner noted that accounts in the Dersdner Bank are  not included in the amount.    Toruner asserted: "Any other figure that may be mentioned  will be wrong. The amount of foreign currency the banks hold is  enough to meet 80 percent of their commitments. They have moved  to increase the amount to 100 percent. The banks have the  equivalent to every deposit account in foreign currency."</p>

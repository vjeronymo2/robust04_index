This amendment is prompted by reports of failures of these attach bolts due to stress corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the attach bolts, which could reduce the fail-safe capability of the attachment assembly. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective March 24, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracking in the No. 2 engine pylon lower spar forward mount and thrust link fitting attach bolts, replacement of cracked bolts, and the eventual replacement of all bolts made of H&hyph;11 material with bolts made of Inconel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supports the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time for the inspections be extended to coincide with normally scheduled maintenance intervals. These commenters suggest that if the compliance times were extended to 24 months, the confusion and expense of special scheduling could be avoided. The FAA does not concur. In developing the proposed compliance time, the FAA primarily considered analyses of the mode of failure of the subject bolts due to stress corrosion, as well as the service history of the fleet. Based on this data and the safety implications presented by loss of fail-safe capability of the attachment assembly should the bolts fail, the FAA has determined that the proposed compliance times of 12 months for the initial inspection and 18 months for the repetitive inspection interval are both appropriate and warranted. Further, the FAA took into account the average utilization rate of the affected fleet, the practical aspects of an orderly inspection of the fleet during regular maintenance periods, and the availability of required replacement parts. The compliance times as proposed should allow ample time for the inspections to be conducted concurrently with scheduled maintenance, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. In light of all of these factors, the FAA considers that any extension of the compliance intervals to be unacceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 354 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 206 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inspections required by this AD will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspections requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $90,640, or $440 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The replacement actions required by this AD will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,700 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the replacement actions of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $646,840, or $3,140 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

He made this announcement during a visit  to General Jose Sampaio Maia, the Amazonas military commander.  According to Lula's advisers, the PT candidate's first formal  meeting with a military commander lasted 105 minutes, and  addressed "problems of the Amazonas."    Lula said he intends to expedite the meetings with the  military sector in order to become better acquainted with the  situation of the military, and to complete the program of  government proposed by the PT. After his meeting with the  Amazonas military commander, Lula was enthusiastic about the  receptivity he found within the military. In exchange for this,  he advocated a stronger military presence in the Amazonas: "It  is necessary to give the Armed Forces a good structure to  maintain the security of our borders and continue with their  positive policy of presence in the area," he said.</p>

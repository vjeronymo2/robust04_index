			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Kim Chang-yong] </F>   [Text] No country in the world but Korea has fallen victim  to Section 301 of the U.S. omnibus trade bill even before  Washington designated it as the target of comprehensive  retaliation, a state- run think tank said in a report yesterday.    The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy [KIEP]  advised the administration not to be scared by the invocation of  the bill, which is originally a domestic law and contradicts the  freer world trade order under the Uruguay Round accord.    Washington, which recently revived the section, popularly  called Super 301 provision, is pressing Seoul to reduce what it  describes as barriers in the auto market and threatening to  designate Korea's auto import regulations as a "priority foreign  country practice" otherwise.    Korea and the United States held two-day working-level trade  talks in Washington yesterday which focused on the auto issue.    The Bush administration designated Japan, India and Brazil  as  priority foreign countries under the Section 301 in May 1989,  putting six import practices of the three countries in its  sights for urgent improvement.    What Americans called unfair trade practices concerned the  Japanese government's procurement of supercomputers, India's  purchase of artificial satellites and Indonesia's allegedly  technical barriers in forestry development.    The three countries all turned down negotiations with the  United States roundly as far as the talks entailed retaliation,  ultimately escaping any retaliatory step, the KIEP said.    Actually, Japan agreed with the United States to comply with  the latter's demand for economic restructuring that could  facilitate U.S. access to the Japanese market on condition  Washington excluded Tokyo from the list of priority foreign  countries and reserved retaliation.    Washington got little tangible outcome from its talks with  Tokyo on restructuring.    Brazil also led the United States to reverse its earlier  designation by reducing import restrictions on some products  through subsequent negotiations.    India was solely put on the list but was given no  substantial  retaliation.    Korea, for its part, expanded the farm market opening wider  and committed itself to reducing tariffs on seven products while  the United States was just reviewing its import practices with a  threat of retaliation.    "Korea was the only country that yielded to the shadow of  the  Section Super 301 and made great concessions to the United  States all ahead of the application of the provision," the  report said.    The research body said that Korea does not have to be  concerned too much over the Section Super 301 to lose core  interests before negotiations.    "Many countries point out that the U.S. provision will be  contradictory with the Uruguay Round of the new international  trade regime which will set forth the World Trade Organization,"  it added.</p>

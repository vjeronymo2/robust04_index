			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: HAWAIIAN GARDENS;  </P> <P> COUNCIL VOTES TO RECOGNIZE UNION FOR CITY EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> As of this week, employees of Hawaiian Gardens are being represented by a labor  union. The City Council voted at a special meeting Monday to recognize the  American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees as the bargaining  agency for city workers.  </P> <P> "We've never had a union here before," City Manager Ron Downing said. "I think  it's a positive step in the right direction in terms of improving  employee-employer relations."  </P> <P> The city has 31 full-time employees, although those in management positions  will not be union members. There are no fire and police employees in the city.  Those services, as well as some building inspection and health services, are  provided under a contract with Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The first negotiating session between the city and the union, Downing said, is  expected to be next week. A pay increase is likely to be at the top of the  agenda. "I would expect they will expect one," Downing said.  </P> <P> Because the city experienced a severe budget crunch last year, employee  salaries have been frozen.  </P></p>

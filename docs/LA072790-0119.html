			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO REIMPOSE CABLE CONTROLS;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: A CONTROVERSIAL AMENDMENT TO ALLOW TELEPHONE COMPANIES INTO THE  INDUSTRY FAILS, HOWEVER.  </P> <P> In a major step toward re-regulating cable television, a House committee  Thursday unanimously approved legislation to control the industry, after  removing a controversial amendment that would have allowed phone companies into  the business.  </P> <P> Similar legislation is already before the full Senate, and both chambers may  vote as early as next week, with approval expected. The Bush Administration has  expressed staunch opposition to regulating cable, but it is unclear whether it  will risk during an election year a veto of a bill designed to answer consumer  complaints about high cable prices and poor service.  </P> <P> The effort to reimpose some regulatory control over the cable industry, which  Congress freed of all regulation in 1984, has taken on rare political velocity.  Congressmen have found that few issues seem to compel citizen response,  particularly in certain rural areas, as quickly as the variety of choices and  service on the American family's TV set.  </P> <P> The bill, which was reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, also  seemed to get a boost Thursday from the Federal Communications Commission,  which issued a long-awaited report on the effects of six years of deregulation  in the cable industry. While the FCC cautioned that it thought competition, not  re-regulation, was the answer to problems in cable in the long run, it deferred  to Congress on short-term regulatory measures of the sort contained in the  legislation.  </P> <P> "Some cable operators have betrayed the trust placed in them by the Congress,"  said Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), one of the bill's principal sponsors. This  measure would "rein in these sorts of renegades," he said.  </P> <P> The legislation's approval in committee became assured, and its ultimate  passage greatly enhanced, when proponents of the most controversial element in  the cable question admitted Thursday that they lacked the votes they needed to  amend the legislation.  </P> <P> Rep. Frederick Boucher (D-Va.) had proposed an amendment to allow telephone  companies into the cable television business, a way of encouraging competition.  Proponents argued that allowing them in would speed the development of  fiber-optic telecommunications networks that could carry voice, data and video  in one wire.  </P> <P> Critics have argued that the phone companies are so big and would enjoy such  competitive advantages that they would quickly monopolize the industry.  </P> <P> Support for the phone company amendment is so weak that Boucher also promised  not to introduce it when the legislation comes before the House. However, he  vowed to introduce the bill again next year, contending that it is the best  hope for competition in the cable industry.  </P> <P> A similar phone company bill is expected to go before the Senate Commerce  Committee next week, but its failure in the House weakens its chances.  </P> <P> National Cable Television Assn. lobbyist James Mooney complained that "the bill  goes too far," although he is not actively opposing it.  </P> <P> Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Assn. of Broadcasters, said he was  "very pleased" that the telephone entry was defeated. He called the bill "real  relief from abusive cable practices."  </P> <P> Overall, the House bill is "modest" regulation, said W. J. (Billy) Tauzin  (D-La.).  </P> <P> But "it is the best we can do . . . substantively and politically" this year,  said Matthew J. Rinaldo (D-N.J.). It is "a pragmatic approach that will solve  the problems that consumers have thrown in our lap."  </P> <P> Specifically, the House bill orders:  </P> <P> * The FCC to set rates for a "basic tier" of service for over-the-air stations,  plus public TV and government channels.  </P> <P> * State or local authorities to appeal to the FCC if they think rates in their  areas "unreasonable or abusive" for premium programming. This provision also  would apply to existing rates, meaning that current cable prices could be  rolled back.  </P> <P> * Cable programmers to provide their signals to back-yard satellite-dish owners  at fair rates and to require cable systems to carry public and commercial  stations, mainly on their existing channel assignments.  </P> <P> The bill, however, continues to allow cable operators to sign "exclusive  contracts" with programmers, forbidding them from selling their programming to  potential rivals, as long as it does not "significantly impede competition."  </P> <P> The Senate version has weaker language on what kinds of rates could be rolled  back, but does not protect the so-called exclusivity clauses that cable  programmers want.  </P></p>

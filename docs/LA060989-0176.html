			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> TRUCK SPILLS PESTICIDES IN VALENCIA, CAUSING MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM ON I-5  </P> <P> Traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for miles in each direction in  Valencia this morning after a pickup truck overturned and spilled possibly  dangerous liquid and powder pesticides on the roadway.  </P> <P> The accident, which closed six of the eight lanes of the freeway, occurred  about 3 a.m. a mile north of Valencia Boulevard. A northbound pickup driven by  Anthony Roy Canton, 24, of Hollywood went out of control and overturned, the  California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> The truck was carrying several types of industrial pesticides. Four containers  spilled onto the roadway before the truck came to a rest on the center divider,  CHP Officer Ralph Elvira said.  </P> <P> The CHP closed three lanes on each side of the freeway while a hazardous  materials team from the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded. Traffic  slowed to a crawl in the one lane left open in each direction.  </P> <P> An additional lane was opened in each direction shortly after 7 a.m., but  thousands of commuters were caught in a traffic jam that stretched north toward  Castaic and south to Lyons Avenue. The remaining closed lanes of the freeway  were being reopened at about noon.  </P></p>

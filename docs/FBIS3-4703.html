The decision is in accordance with the policy that  government  will make the Team Spirit suspension announcement on condition  that the inter-Korean dialogue is resumed and that an  International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team arrives in  Pyongyang.    Proposing to North Korea on Monday that the working-level  meeting be held on Tuesday, the government decided to make the  Team Spirit suspension announcement at the Defense Ministry on  Tuesday.</p>

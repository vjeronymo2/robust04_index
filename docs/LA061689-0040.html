			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE, HAYDEN INCH TOWARD RACE;  </P> <P> BOTH TAKE STEPS TO BECOME FIRST ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Taking her most definite steps yet toward running for state insurance  commissioner when it becomes an elective post next year, Insurance Commissioner  Roxani Gillespie has filed a "candidate intention statement" with the  California Fair Political Practices Commission and scheduled at least three  fund-raisers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a spokesman for Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said  Thursday that Hayden is forming an exploratory committee "to take a good  serious look at the insurance commissioner's position."  </P> <P> Although Gillespie, a Republican, and Hayden, a Democrat, are probably the most  widely known of the prospective candidates for the state's newest elective  office, several others have been making political noises as the opening moves  are made in the developing race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others in the Race  </P> <P> Among these are State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis, television  commentator Bill Press, tort reform activist Tom Skornia, trial attorney Ray  Bourhis and insurance agent Frank Thomas. All except Skornia are Democrats.  </P> <P> Neither Gillespie nor Hayden said Thursday that they are committed at this  point to being candidates, and neither set a date for finally making a  decision. But in separate interviews both said they are seriously exploring the  possibility of running.  </P> <P> Gillespie, who until recently had disavowed any intention of being a candidate,  has been Gov. George Deukmejian's appointed insurance commissioner since June,  1986, and recently, as a result of the passage of Proposition 103 and her  responsibility for deciding which insurance companies will be subject to rate  rollbacks, has been much in the public limelight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State of Campaign Organization  </P> <P> She said in an interview that she has scheduled an initial Southern California  fund-raising event June 28 under the leadership of Peter Caloyeras, president  of Axios, a Greek-American association. Gillespie was born in Greece and has  been making a number of calls in California's Greek community in recent weeks  to form a base of support.  </P> <P> The commissioner noted that state election laws require that a candidate  intention statement be filed before any money is raised. She also this week  filed a statement of campaign organization with California Secretary of State  March Fong Eu.  </P> <P> "In my case, running would be a big step," Gillespie said. "I have to think  about it. I don't know enough about the process."  </P> <P> Hayden declared, "On the recommendation of some of my long-time friends and  advisers, I've agreed to explore the question of running for commissioner more  formally, although I still have a lot of reservations about doing it.  </P> <P> "I will not speak out on insurance issues until I've made a decision to run. If  I start speaking out, it'll look like I'm running . . . and that would only  create momentum."  </P> <P> Hayden aide Bill Schulz said that while an exploratory committee of five to 10  people is being organized, Hayden is not filing a candidate intention statement  at this point because he does not intend to be raising any money during the  exploratory period.  </P> <P> Schulz said Hayden had been contacted by "people within the insurance industry"  and would be meeting with them as well as with consumer representatives during  his exploration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Skirmishing  </P> <P> Already, meanwhile, there is some political skirmishing between prospective  contenders.  </P> <P> Collis, for example, took credit Thursday for prodding Gillespie into a  somewhat more flexible position on the standards she will use in judging  whether insurance companies will be forced to give their customers rate  rollbacks and rebates as called for in Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Gillespie, until recently, had said she would reach these judgments separately  for each line of insurance sold by each company. Then, after an exchange of  correspondence between her department and Collis, she indicated that in some  cases she might make a collective judgment based on all of a company's lines  affected by Proposition 103.  </P> <P> The insurance commissioner said she has not made up her mind yet about a change  of standards and is not even sure such a change would benefit consumers. But  Collis said Thursday that he is convinced she will begin bending more toward  consumers now that she is thinking of becoming a candidate.  </P> <P> "Her tactics will be to grant 20% rollbacks and then have companies come in and  sue her," Collis said. "Then, it will seem she's not in their corner anymore.  That's sure to be her tactic. She's unquestionably doing that for political  reasons, but I don't care. What's important is that consumers obtain their  rollbacks."  </P> <P> Told of Collis' remarks, Gillespie shot back, "Conway Collis has not prodded me  to do anything.  </P> <P> "I'm going to try to be as professional as I possibly can about this. Whatever  I do, I want it to be upheld by the courts, if it comes to that. The whole  nation is going to be watching what we do here in California, and I want to do  the right thing, not the political thing."  </P> <P> Press, meanwhile, said he has gone farther toward running than any of the other  prospective candidates, hiring both a campaign manager, David Mixner, and a  fund-raising consultant, Joann Ruden.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised there are not even more candidates yet, because I believe this  is a very important post," he said. "It's a unique opportunity to create a  consumer advocate for Californians. That's why I'm interested in it."  </P> <P> Press earlier in the week had accused Gillespie of contacting Greek diplomatic  representatives in California for help in raising money for a race. Gillespie  denied doing so.  </P></p>

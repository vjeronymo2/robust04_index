			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Job changers may lose a few years - Transfers / Personal Pensions RECENT CONCERN over mis-selling of personal pensions for transfers from occupational schemes has highlighted the plight of thousands of employees who change jobs every year, little realising that each move can jeopardise the value of their pension fund. Those who have been in a company pension scheme for less than two years are entitled to a cash refund of contributions, less a deduction for tax and back-payments to the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). After two years, you can leave the pension benefit in the former employer's scheme or take a transfer value to the new employer's scheme or to an Inland Revenue-approved private individual plan such as a personal pension or a Section 32 buy-out bond (introduced under Section 32 of the Finance Act of 1981). Each option has its merits and drawbacks, and should be analysed carefully in the light of individual circumstances. The first option is to take a deferred pension - that is, to leave leave the benefits in the old scheme until retirement. By law, schemes must pay limited price indexation (LPI) of 5 per cent a year (or retail prices, if less) on benefits in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP). The GMP is the element of an occupational scheme that replaces the Serps pension. While LPI, at a maximum of 5 per cent, represents an improvement in the law, many would argue that it does not go far enough, given the fact that average earnings inflation historically is about 8 per cent. Larger schemes may award higher increases, often on a regular discretionary basis. Schemes may also offer good death benefits and pensions for widows and dependants. If some or all of these features are present, the job-changer's best bet is likely to be a deferred pension. Due to pending legal changes, there are other factors that could affect the value of the deferred pension or transfer value. These include the application of LPI to pensions in payment, the retrospective application of equal pension benefits for men and women, and the uses of any pension scheme surplus. Employees or their advisers certainly should consider these factors before taking the decision to transfer out; but, according to Ian Sigston, director of technical research at Noble Lowndes &amp; Partners, it is unwise to attempt to 'double guess' which way the legislation will go and to delay making an important decision. The second main option - transferring to the new employer's scheme - often leaves the employee feeling cheated. Before looking at this process, it is important to understand how transfer values are calculated. Most company pensions in Britain operate on a final-salary basis. Under a typical scheme, the pension builds up at a rate of 1/60th of final salary for each year's service. After 40 years' scheme membership, the employee should qualify for the maximum pension permitted by the Inland Revenue of 40/60ths or two-thirds final salary. Employees caught by the 'earnings cap' are further restricted to a maximum pension of Pounds 50,000 for the current tax year. Employees usually pay contributions to their company schemes of 5 or 6 per cent per annum, while the employer's contribution will vary according to age. There are two schemes involved in an inter-company transfer - the ceding scheme, and the receiving scheme. A typical transfer might reduce 10 'years' in the old scheme to just five in the new scheme. This is because the ceding scheme actuary turns the accrued number of 'years' into a cash value based on the value of the deferred pension plus any increases to retirement. Due to the 5 per cent annual LPI cap on deferred pensions, this immediately limits the growth assumption to less than average earnings. The receiving scheme actuary then calculates the number of 'years' this transfer value will buy in the new employer's scheme, taking into account any increases in salary to retirement and the level of benefits offered by the scheme. Clearly, a higher salary and better pension scheme benefits will 'cost' more, and so reduce the number of years the transfer buys. Only when the above options have been considered and found wanting should the employee consider a transfer to a private plan. There are two options here, namely a personal pension or Section 32 buy-out bond. The bulk of current transfers to date have been to personal pensions, but there are cases where a buy-out bond may be preferable. Personal pensions are available from life offices, unit trust groups, banks and friendly societies. Section 32 buy-out bonds are only available from about 18 life offices. Both products operate on a money-purchase basis. This means that your fund builds up to purchase an annuity at retirement. There is no final-salary link, which makes it notoriously difficult to compare company scheme benefits with these products. While both products invest the transfer on your behalf, in order to provide a fund at retirement to purchase an annuity, there are important differences. For example, the buy-out bond can only accept the transfer value, whereas it is possible to pay regular or additional single premiums into a personal pension. Furthermore, the buy-out bond cannot be used to contract out of Serps and is more restrictive in terms of retirement date and investment scope. However, the buy-out bond does offer important guarantees by retaining the GMP, and for this reason the merits of this product should always be considered alongside a personal pension for transfer purposes.</p>

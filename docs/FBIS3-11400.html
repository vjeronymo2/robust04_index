"An inferiority complex has been created regarding the OAS,  and it is necessary to overcome it," Burelli said. He  challenged the other candidates, Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, to a  television debate -- possibly over the U.S. CNN Channel.    Regarding the acceptance of his initiative, the Venezuelan  foreign minister told EFE that "the ball is in their court."    Burelli is participating in Brasilia in a 48-hour meeting of  the foreign ministers and government delegates of the 13  countries of the Rio Group, the main mechanism for political and  economic agreement within Latin America.    The ambassadors of OAS member countries will elect a  successor of the Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares, who has  occupied the post of OAS secretary general for two consecutive  5-year periods since 1984.    Referring to Gaviria, Burelli said that never -- during the  history of the organization -- has the United States ever  proposed a candidate on its own initiative.    Gaviria's candidacy is supported by several Rio Group  countries including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and  Argentina.    Burelli highlighted the OAS system of organization, which  has  a developed administrative apparatus and a democratic hue  because each nation, no matter how large or small, has one vote.    The Venezuelan foreign minister -- who was Venezuelan  ambassador to Washington, London, and Bogota -- added that he  will not campaign during the Rio Group meeting. He said: "I  have come to the meeting and that is all."    Burelli said that "there are new factors" to evaluate  regarding the Cuban situation. "The Cuban people have suffered  a lot. There cannot be the same confrontation of ideas now as  in bygone days."    Baena Soares said he believes it is necessary to consider  the  reintegration of Cuba into the OAS because "the 1990's are not  the 1960's."    Burelli complained to EFE about the interpretation by the  international media of the Venezuelan situation following the  December 1993 elections in which Rafael Caldera became president.    "The international press is not convinced that ethical  standards are being changed" in Venezuela, he explained.    Burelli said President Caldera is willing to "completely  reorganize the family" of his country, by offering pardons to  all military officers who rose up in arms against the government  of then President Carlos Andres Perez.    He added that those who found refuge in Peru are now  returning, adding that five officers being held the San Carlos  Garrison in Caracas will be released "at any moment."</p>

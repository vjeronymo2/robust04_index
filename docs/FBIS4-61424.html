			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Frolov report under the "Atom" rubric: "No </F> Accident Has Occurred at Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant. But the  Region's Electric Power Supply System Is Under Threat"]    [Text] The report about an emergency shutdown of the  fourth power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant, which was  carried by news agencies and Russian television on 4 May, is not  true. At any rate this is what Georgiy Kaurov, chief of the  Atomic Energy Ministry information administration, said. In a  conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent, he explained that  the planned shutdown of the power bloc to replace spent fuel  cells occurred much earlier -- on 29 April -- and did not have  any bearing on any emergency situation.    Nonetheless, this interest in the shutdown of yet another  power unit at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant has been aroused  not only by the Chernobyl syndrome. The power plant produces  60-70 percent of the Kola peninsula's electric power. The  second and third power units were shut down for emergency repair  even earlier. Presently, only the first power unit -- the  oldest one, which was put into operation back in 1973 -- is  operating at its design capacity (440 megawatts). This power  unit was involved in what was probably the most serious accident  at the Kolskaya Nuclear Power Plant: on 2 February 1993, a  hurricane broke the supply of external electric energy; two  emergency diesels units that powered cooling system pumps were  also put out of action. For two and a half hours the reactor  was cooled by the natural circulation of water in the circuits.    In terms of security, the current situation at the power  plant is not comparable with that one, but not so in terms of  the threat posed to the region's electric power potential. The  situation has been exacerbated by perennial failures of  consumers to repay debts. Last September they nearly caused a  shutdown of the nuclear power plant and a disconnection of  debtors from their power supply.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the past year, however, many exporters have begun to move animals by air or sea from the United States to Mexico or Canada. This practice has raised a concern that animals could be moved directly into the interior of these two countries without a final veterinary inspection prior to that movement, thus circumventing the inspection system that helps prevent the exportation of diseased animals or animals that may have been exposed to disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the disease status of any animals that are moved from the United States other than by land to Mexico or Canada, we are proposing that animals intended for exportation by air or sea to either of these two countries meet the same requirements as animals exported to other foreign countries under &sect;&sect;91.3(a) and (b), 91.14(a), and 91.15(a). We, therefore, are proposing to amend the regulations to limit the exception for animals exported to Mexico or Canada to those animals intended for export to those countries by land. Such exportations would not have to meet the requirements in the above-cited regulations for the reasons already discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would require a final inspection at an export inspection facility at a designated port of embarkation for all animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada by air or sea. Animals intended for export to Mexico and Canada by air or sea would first be inspected by an APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian in the State of origin. The APHIS representative or an accredited veterinarian would issue an origin health certificate, which an authorized APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin would endorse. At the port of embarkation, the animals would receive a final inspection by an APHIS veterinarian before they would be allowed to leave the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exporter would be charged a user fee ($33.50 an hour plus reimbursable overtime when applicable) for the final inspection as provided in 9 CFR part 130. This inspection could require 6 to 8 hours of work for one or two veterinarians. The total cost of inspection for an air shipment from Miami ranges from about $200 to $600 a shipment. The total cost of inspection for a sea shipment from Hawaii ranges from $1,000 to $2,000 a shipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These costs are very small compared to the value of the animals being shipped. For example, gilts (young, female pigs or immature sows) may be valued at $500 to $1,000 or more a head, depending upon breed. Heifers (young cows that have not borne calves) may be worth $2,000 a head. One air shipment may contain as many as 240 gilts or 80 heifers. One sea shipment from Hawaii may contain 1,000 to 2,000 heifers. Clearly, the costs of inspection are relatively minor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the exporting entities involved generally are not small (defined as having 100 or fewer employees). They are large companies, often with worldwide operations that handle large volumes of traded animals. For example, about 14,000 swine were exported by air from Miami last year, all by a few large companies. There are now only two exporting companies operating out of Hawaii, one of which is a ``small'' entity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to the Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

If this proposed rule is adopted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) No retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements.

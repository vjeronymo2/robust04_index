Institutions, armed forces units, and  military academies throughout the Army provided the seminar with  several hundred theses. Authors of 85 good theses attended the  seminar. The following is a summary of the seminar.  <H3>  1. The Historic Position and Great Significance of the  Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>   During discussions, the participants unanimously pointed out  that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics upholds the combination of the basic  theories of Marxism-Leninism with China's actual conditions and  the characteristics of the era. This is a creative theory that  has taken shape gradually and has developed into the great  practice of China's reform, opening up, and modernization. This  theory has inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong  Thought and is a banner guiding China's modernization toward  success.    On the inherent relations between the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and Mao Zedong Thought,  some comrades pointed out: There were two historic leaps in the  party's ideology and theory. The first was in the democratic  revolutionary period, which saw the emergence of a revolutionary  road with Chinese characteristics, unveiled the logic of the  Chinese revolution, gave rise to Mao Zedong Thought, and guided  the Chinese revolution to victory. The second took place after  the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  during which the road to building socialism with Chinese  characteristics was found, the logic of Chinese modernization  was unveiled, and the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics took shape -- a theory that will lead China's  modernization to success. The common points and inherent  relations of the two leaps were "combined" and the theoretical  essence of the two roads was emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from facts, though the content, natures, and missions of  the two leaps greatly differed from each other. In his  remaining years, Comrade Mao Zedong tried to unveil the logic of  Chinese modernization and made initial achievements in this  respect, but because this historical mission was difficult and  complicated, and because Comrade Mao Zedong committed a mistake  of subjectivism -- a mistake of an ideological nature -- we can  say that this historical mission basically remained incomplete.  The second-generation leading collective of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core conscientiously  studied and summed up the experiences and lessons since the  founding of the PRC, and in their new practice established the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This  theory carried forward and corrected Comrade Mao Zedong's  explorations, while a more important point was putting forward  and developing new ideas.    The participants pointed out: We should study and master the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  use this theory to guide our thinking and work, and this should  permeate the entire process of socialist modernization. This is  a matter of priority importance which involves the country's  prosperity and prolonged stability. In new historical  conditions, only by arming cadres and soldiers throughout the  armed forces with this theory can we ensure absolute party  leadership over the Army, ensure that the Army will adhere  firmly to the party's basic line for 100 years, ensure that the  nature of the people's Army will not change, and ensure the  smooth carrying out of all construction and reform projects in  the Army.  <H3>  2. The Basic Content and Scientific Structure of the Theory  of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics </H3>   The participants said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a scientific  system with rich and profound content, strict logic, and a  complete structure. This system originated in  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, but bears the strong nature  of creation, practice, and the era. It does not simply copy or  fragmentarily supplement Marxism or its principles, but is a  major development of Marxism and its principles. Both in form  and content, it is a scientific system of modern Chinese Marxism  with special characteristics.    We say that this theory is a scientific system because, like  other scientific theories, it has the basic scope, basic  viewpoints, basic theory, completeness, its own systematizm, and  profoundness. Completeness means that the theory comprehensively  explains a number of basic questions, such as what socialism is  and how to build socialism in an economically and culturally  backward country like China. Systematizm means that there are  strict logical relations between these basic questions.  Profoundness refers to its theoretical summation of a number of  fundamental questions concerning socialism; it is a theoretical  manifestation of modern Chinese socialist development law.    The participants were very much interested in discussing  the scientific system of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. They had this consensus view: The  theory that socialism is in the initial period is the basis of  this theoretical system. The productive forces criterion and  the three favorable's are the main theme of this system. The  socialist market economy is something newly developed by this  system. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are  the essence of this system. "One central task, two basic  points" are the core and specific manifestation of this system.    The participants also unanimously pointed out: The 14th CPC  National Congress report has summed up Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in  nine points, and has comprehensively and systematically  expounded the basic ideas and basic views of this theory. This  is very important for us in thoroughly understanding this theory  and its scientific system. The theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is an organic scientific system  comprising a series of viewpoints and principles. Only by  completely and accurately studying and understanding it can we  truly master its essence.  <H3>  3. Seriously Studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Thought on  Army Building in the New Period and Building the Army Into a  Modernized, Regularized, and Revolutionary Army </H3>   Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the general architect of China's  reform, opening up, and modernization. He is also the general  architect of Army building in the new period. Through  discussions, the participants further understood that Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period has  inherited the fundamental point of Mao Zedong's military  thinking. On the other hand, this thought also has put forward  a number of new viewpoints. One of its basic points is that the  Chinese Army must focus on modernization; comprehensively carry  out revolutionization, modernization, and regularization; build  the Army into a fine army with Chinese characteristics; improve  China's national defense capacity; and provide a powerful  guarantee of safety for China's reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Many participating comrades pointed out: We  should study and implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on  Army building in light of the actual conditions of our armed  forces units, maintain a "firm grip" on the central task of  modernization, and speed up our Army building and reform.  Efforts should be made to improve the quality of our Army.  Education and training should be put in a strategic position.  Strict training should be given to the armed forces according  to actual combat, so as to improve their combat effectiveness.    Comrades present at the seminar also profoundly discussed  how  to strengthen and improve the Army's ideological work under the  conditions of the socialist market economy. Following the  development of China's reform and opening up and the  establishment of the socialist market economy structure,  interest relations are being adjusted, causing a profound change  in the concept of value, in standards of conduct, and in  life-styles. Thus we are required to inherit and develop the  Army's fine tradition of ideological and political work, to cope  with the development of the era, and to strengthen and improve  the Army's ideological and political work. It is necessary to  correctly appraise the positive influence of the socialist  market economy on officers' and soldiers' minds, to pay  attention to this main aspect, and to turn disadvantages into  advantages. It is necessary to propagate the "five kinds of  spirit" initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character  enterprising spirit" summed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, so  as to encourage officers and soldiers to cultivate a correct  concept of life, a correct concept of value, and the spirit of  selfless dedication, and to resolutely resist money worship,  pleasure seeking, and extreme individualism. It is necessary to  meet the Army's demand for modernization, as well as the  officers' and soldiers' demands for knowledge; to make  ideological and political work permeate education and training;  to improve the Army's scientific and cultural quality; and to  strengthen its coherent force and combat effectiveness. We  should be good at resolving ideological and actual problems;  really care for cadres' and soldiers' study, training, work, and  lives; and carry out profound, meticulous, and down-to-earth  ideological and political work. In short, ideological and  political work is the fine tradition and unique strong point of  our Army. As long as we use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought  on Army building to arm the minds of cadres and soldiers  throughout the armed forces, work in a down-to-earth manner,  make bold explorations, and are good at summing up experience,  we will be able to blaze a new trail in the Army's ideological  and political work, and in its modernization drive.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Both sides 'out of ideas' in rail deadlock: CBI condemns 'colossal inconvenience' as 12th strike day starts - BR says one-third of trains will run Most of the rail network will be shut down for a 12th day today as a result of the 10-week-old rail dispute, with both sides claiming they had done all they could to break the deadlock. 'I can't think of anything else we can do,' said Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT transport union's chief negotiator and senior assistant general secretary. 'We have provided a number of ways in which Railtrack could restart negotiations by meeting our interim claim. Coming up with any more now would be a waste of time.' Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, said the company had made 'all the offers we can make' and that it was up to the union to respond more favourably. Railtrack was adamant that both sides had to talk about restructuring and not purely about the union's interim pay claim. 'Our offer to sit down and throw away the key and talk about restructuring until we reach a settlement still stands, but we've made all the offers we can make. We are not prepared to pay to open negotiations.' The RMT expects Railtrack to try to 'sell' its latest offer to individual signalmen and women, bypassing the union. 'They cannot get any takers because it is such a poor deal. We are back exactly where we were when the dispute started,' the union said. British Rail estimated that about 5,000 trains, roughly one-third of the normal total, would run during the 48-hour shutdown, which ends at midnight tonight. Frequencies are much reduced although several weeks of strike procedures have meant most train operators are able to run to set timetables. Travellers now had sufficient faith in the timetables to make use of the train services for commuting, cross-country journeys and leisure travel, Railtrack said. It said it had agreed timetables with British Rail for this stoppage. No additional services ran yesterday but new routes were opened on Friday between London and Edinburgh via Sheffield and in the Glasgow commuter belt. Despite the gradual build-up of services on strike days, many commuters into London chose to use their cars yesterday and road traffic into the capital was very heavy. A Confederation of British Industry spokesman said: 'It's just a colossal inconvenience to the travelling public and it does nothing to help our reputation for competitiveness abroad.' British Rail estimated the impact of the strike on revenues at Pounds 10m a day on passenger services and Pounds 1m a day on freight services, though many freight shipments can be held back to run on working days. Another 24-hour strike will be held next Monday and the prospects for a settlement look as far away as ever. A passenger and a railway guard were slightly injured yesterday when a North London Railways train crashed into buffers at London Euston. The train, from Northampton, was coming to a halt. North London Railways said an internal inquiry would be held.</p>

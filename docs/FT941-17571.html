			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Belgrade stock market struggles against odds Amid the Serbian nightmare of hyperinflation, sanctions and war, Mr Branislav Cosic struggles to keep open the Belgrade stock exchange. No stocks have changed hands for more than a year, explains Mr Cosic, the exchange's director. In fact, there are only two companies listed on the exchange because war scuppered the country's privatisation plans. Instead, between 400 and 500 companies each day try to beat rising prices by trading commercial paper denominated in dinars, the national currency. But Mr Cosic fears that with inflation at 1m per cent last month, they face an impossible task. 'By the middle of January we will have to stop operations. There will be no more point in trading in dinars,' he says. The economic chaos, brought on by nearly three years of war and 21 months of United Nations sanctions, has forced the stock market to adapt to such an extent, jokes Mr Cosic, that 'we are planning to sell our know-how to the west'. The stock market has been tailored to cope with the inflation rate of 25 per cent an hour; trading, for example, takes place on Saturdays. 'People invest in securities to protect their money from inflation, even for a couple of days,' says Mr Branislav Jorgic who, with Mr Cosic, was one of the founders of the exchange, which opened in 1989. Annual turnover last year amounted to DM110m (Pounds 42.9m), down from DM175m in 1992, while the number of transactions soared to 9,000, from 1,600. However, daily turnover is falling, hovering below DM20,000 in December. Some companies use their dinars to buy hard currency at the black market rate, selling it later at the higher official rate. A fraction of the population of Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise the rump Yugoslavia, has grown rich from war profiteering and by violating sanctions, which include an oil embargo. Last year Mr Jorgic opened his own brokerage firm, switching sides to join about a dozen traders at the banks of computers and telephones in the gleaming offices of the exchange, or Berza. 'You can earn more money here than in western countries. But you are facing great risks,' he says. In addition to 'wrong government policies', Mr Cosic blames UN sanctions for the market's woes as they mean ties are severed with international financial organisations. Mr Cosic and his team hope the government will swiftly implement a stabilisation programme. But Mr Jorgic puts it bluntly. 'If the war continues, I cannot see any future for the stock exchange. But if it stops, and the UN lifts sanctions, then the exchange and my company have a chance. . . otherwise I'll change jobs and start trading in petrol or other goods.'</p>

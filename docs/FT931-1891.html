			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / French Elections: Business looks for swift interest rate cuts - This would aid the new government in implementing its privatisation plans THE HEADLINE emblazoned across yesterday's La Tribune Desfosses, the French financial newspaper, was short and to the point: 'New government - the business community expects swift, spectacular policies'. The chief concern of French financiers and industrialists is how quickly the conservatives, now set to return to power after a resounding victory in the first round of the parliamentary elections, will be able to reduce interest rates. They are keen for the new government to implement the privatisation programme outlined in its election manifesto. There is also feverish speculation as to whether the right will continue the Gallic political tradition of dismissing the Socialist chairmen of France's state-controlled companies. However, the immediate priority for the corporate sector is interest rates. The Socialists refused to reduce rates for fear of imperilling the French franc, preferring to wait for German rates to fall so that France could follow suit without jeopardising the currency. As a result, French companies face the parallel problems of high interest rates depressing domestic demand and the strong franc impeding their export efforts. The conservatives claimed to be committed to continuing the franc fort policy in their election manifesto. However, rogue voices in both parties - Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe Seguin in the RPR and Mr Alain Madelin in the UDF - have argued for devaluation. 'The markets are still waiting for a firm commitment that the new government will adhere to the franc fort,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'There is also concern that, if German rates have not come down significantly by the summer, the calls for devaluation from the conservatives will grow louder.' A reduction in interest rates is also essential if the conservatives are to implement their privatisation plans. High rates will make it more difficult to encourage private investors to buy equities. The new administration also faces the problem that the Paris stock market is now far less buoyant than in 1986, when the right last took power. The conservatives hope to stimulate equity investment by introducing tax breaks, possibly for long-term investments of up to FFr50,000 (Pounds 6,273). James Capel in Paris calculates that this could bring FFr50bn of new private investment into the stock market each year. The new government may also consider abolishing the Bourse tax on equity investment. 'Although market conditions are less favourable than in 1986, there is no reason that the first tranche of privatisations should not start in early summer,' said Mr David Harrington, French market strategist at James Capel. 'It is partly a question of pragmatics. The conservatives need to raise money to plug the budget deficit.' The critical question is which companies will go first. Some candidates are too sickly to be privatised at present, notably Credit Lyonnais, the bank which last year produced its worst performance for two decades, and Bull, the computer group that has for four years been in the red. Analysts suspect that the new government will start with more robust businesses such as Assurances Generales de France in insurance and Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals. The conservatives may also adopt a different approach to the management of the remaining state companies, by encouraging them to float off subsidiaries and being more relaxed about job losses. There is also speculation that they might renegotiate the recent acquisition of Yves Saint-Laurent, the fashion house headed by Mr Pierre Berge, a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand, by part of Elf-Aquitaine, the public sector oil group. The deal, due to be completed in May, has been fiercely criticised by the right. One of the first tasks of the new administration will be to scrutinise the heads of the state-controlled companies. Mr Loi Le Floch-Prigent of Elf-Aquitaine, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer of Credit Lyonnais and Mr Gilles Menage of Electricite de France are all seen as vulnerable. They may yet be safe. Mr Edouard Balladur, favourite for prime minister, has already said he does not relish the prospect of a corporate witch-hunt.</p>

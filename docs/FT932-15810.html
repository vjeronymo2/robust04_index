			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: Struggle to maintain cutting edge - Problems in Germany's machine-tool industry WHEN Traub and Maho, two of Germany's biggest machine tool companies, announced a global strategic alliance last year, rivals faced the prospect of an important new force operating in the recession-battered European market. The deal took effect on January 1, and appeared sound. The marketing tie-up between Traub, a big producer of turning centres or lathes, and Maho, which makes milling machines, would help them both fend off Japanese competition. 'We had to increase our product range to offer a complete package,' says Mr Paul Maynard, managing director of Traub UK and a member of the Traub management board. Little more than two months later, however, the co-operation agreement has been dissolved. On the rebound, Traub has announced a new alliance with Hermle, a specialist German milling machine producer that depends on Germany for nearly 80 per cent of its sales. The chain of events would be extraordinary for any industry. For German machine tool companies, always reticent to co-operate with each other and even more cautious about announcing anything, it is unprecedented and deeply embarrassing. It underlines with particular force the problems of the German machine tool industry, which is by far the largest in Europe. As the British machine tool industry perceives better times ahead, domestic orders in Germany are running at about half the level of a year ago, producers say. After years of growth which many German machine tool companies believed would continue unabated, the market - second biggest in the world after Japan - has dropped in about nine months as far as its UK counterpart did in two years. According to American Machinist figures, consumption of machine tools fell nearly 17 per cent last year to Dollars 5.03bn. Confidence among domestic customers has fallen dramatically, and the machine tool makers are saddled with high labour costs and gearing. Overseas, the east European market, where Germany dominated western imports, has virtually dried up. The problem that has bedevilled the UK machine tool industry during the past two years of recession is now beginning to surface in Germany: withdrawal of financial support as banks lose their patience. In March, Hahn und Kolb, the big Stuttgart-based machine tool sales and service company, was forced to apply for protection from its creditors because of liquidity bottlenecks caused by lower turnover. To make things worse, German machine tool companies have found it much harder to cut jobs than have their UK counterparts. Traub began retrenching relatively early, but even so its workforce has been cut from about 3,000 in 1991 to about 2,000. Hermle has cut its staff by one-third to 500. Traub, family-controlled but publicly-quoted, is relatively strong outside Germany, deriving 45 to 50 per cent of sales abroad, but its managing board chairman, Mr Hans-Dieter Potsch, decided 18 months ago that it needed to be internationally stronger, to compete with Japanese rivals. 'We needed to attack the Pacific basin market, where the Japanese are selling machines for 10 to 20 per cent more than in Europe and the US,' says Mr Maynard. After talks with a number of companies, including Hermle and, it is believed, some foreign companies, Traub publicised its deal with Maho in December. A merger was never likely because of Maho's financial condition; it lost DM159m in 1991-92. German banks took effective control of the company last year, and its former chairman and moving force, Mr Werner Babel, has seen his family's majority shareholding cut to a minority stake. It appears that Maho was not meeting its financial targets, although details about the collapse of the deal have not been divulged. A further loss of DM45m is expected this year and Maho told Traub that the need for more restructuring may harm the co-operation agreement. Mr Maynard says Traub is sorry about the decision, but he is putting a on brave face. Some of Hermle's specialist machines are better than Maho's, he says, although they will require heavier marketing. The new deal appears to make sense for both companies. Hermle, which went public in 1990, will benefit from Traub's international marketing muscle. Traub gets access to a new range of milling machines to add to its recent acquisitions in France and Italy. As for Maho, rumours continue regarding a link-up with its rival Deckel. The companies are known to have been discussing co-operating in manufacturing, but recent speculation suggests they may be contemplating a full merger. German machine tool companies have traditionally considered that a step too far. But then they have never had to cope with conditions like today's.</p>

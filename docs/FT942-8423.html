			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Heseltine concedes ground on Post Office sell-off The government is to test public opinion over its plans to privatise the Post Office by publishing a green paper containing its favoured option of selling 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. But in issuing a consultative document ministers were acknowledging that they may have to dilute their preferred sell-off option or even drop it. Backbenchers opposed to privatisation said they would use the 'breathing space' to try to persuade the government to abandon the flotation plan, or to stop it from selling a majority stake. The cabinet's so-called consolidators, who oppose further radical legislation, are understood to have won important concessions from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Heseltine had wanted to privatise the whole of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. But the consolidators made it clear they would only give the go-ahead to privatisation if the government continued to hold at least 49 per cent of the shares and allowed a further period of consultation. Mr Heseltine said the green paper would be published within weeks. He is still confident of bringing forward a bill in November to privatise the Royal Mail and Parcelforce after a consultation period of several months. In a bid to allay backbenchers' fears, he committed the government to a universal tariff and said stamps would continue to be exempt from value added tax. The government also obtained the Queen's permission for the depiction of her head on postage stamps, the use of Royal emblems and permission to register a privatised Royal Mail at Companies House. The green paper is likely to spell out the government's desire to give employees 'a significant holding of shares', which one minister said could be as much as 15 per cent. Post Office Counters has secured the freedom it wanted to increase the scale of its activities. The Treasury has agreed that rural post offices will continue to be subsidised by about Pounds 25m. Only a quarter of Counters' turnover comes from the Royal Mail, but the government would still require the letters division to continue to use post offices. However, backbenchers continue to oppose the privatisation. Mr Patrick Cormack, Conservative MP for Staffordshire South, said: 'There are many old fashioned Tories, of whom I am proud to be one, who view the prospect of Royal Mail plc about as favourably as they would view your old regiment being replaced by Group 4 at Buckingham Palace.'

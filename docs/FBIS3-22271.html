			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Lin Minzhong (2651 3046 1813)] </F>   [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The 19th  conference of the International Union for the Protection of  Nature and Natural Resources closed here on 26 January after 10  days of intensive discussions on protecting the diversification  of living things on earth and the rational use of natural  resources, as well as environmental protection and sustained  developments.    This was another important international conference on  global  environmental protection after the UN-sponsored conference in  Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to discuss environment and development.  The theme of the conference was ``caring for the earth and its  residents.'' The 1,300 or so representatives from 118 countries  and regions presented and adopted over 100 motions about  protecting the environment and promoting sustained development.    Unlike previous international conferences on the  environment,  experts attending the just-concluded meeting showed greater  concern for conditions which people depend on for development as  well as for the rational use of the earth's natural resources.  They pointed out that the industrial powers' destruction and  waste of large amounts of resources during their development  processes must not be repeated.    The three-year strategy the conference has drawn up for the  union consists primarily of urging and assisting countries to  protect the integrity and diversification of the environment so  as to ensure the rational use of natural resources, and  encouraging government and nongovernment organizations to  continue their cooperation in protecting natural resources.    On 25 January the conference, by a majority of votes, vetoed  a motion sponsored by some members that vilifies the Chinese  Government for destroying Tibet's natural environment and  resources. Taking the floor at the conference, the Chinese  representative condemned the motion, saying that it was a  political motion intended to incite ``Tibet independence.'' He  pointed out that the motion's accusation that the Chinese  Government has ravaged Tibet's environment is ``totally  groundless.'' [passage omitted on election of union president]</p>

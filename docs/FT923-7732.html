			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Nato rules out large-scale troop deployment to Bosnia THE US and its Nato allies yesterday ruled out sending tens of thousands of troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina in a move confirming the reluctance of western governments to become militarily involved in the former Yugoslav republic. Instead, Mr Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, said the organisation was 'studying a range of options which involved different numbers'. Nato officials will report back within 10 days. 'We have not yet decided on any action,' he told a news conference after a meeting of the 16-member organisation. Nato diplomats said some western governments were not prepared to commit any troops, let alone large contingents of ground forces, to protect humanitarian aid convoys to towns and cities throughout Bosnia besieged by Serb irregulars for the past four months. However, France offered to provide a contingent of 1,100 men, Turkey a 480-strong battalion and Spain an unspecified number of soldiers. Earlier this week, Nato diplomats said small numbers would go nowhere towards protecting the corridors international aid agencies wanted to establish in Bosnia. A Nato diplomat said: 'Either we go in and saturate the place or we stay out. There is no room for half-baked measures. In any case, it is probably too late because the Serbs have gotten what they want. They are likely to allow aid convoys in now.' The continuing war and the future status of Bosnia will be discussed today in Brussels under the aegis of the European Community-sponsored talks. This is expected to be the EC's final session before handing over to a much wider international conference involving the United Nations and the 52-member Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. A plenary session of the EC conference, chaired by Lord Carrington, was held yesterday with the aim of finalising arrangements for the enlarged conference. It was attended by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and his Montenegrin counterpart, Mr Momir Bulatovic, refused to attend. Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the unrecognised rump Yugoslavia, tried to represent them but he was not admitted into the formal talks. 'I am not so sure Milosevic did not attend yesterday's session because he was embarrassed about all the international criticism of Serbia's ethnic cleansing policy in Bosnia and the detention camps,' a US diplomat said. 'I think it is because he has contempt for the EC because he knows it has no clout,' he added. In his bilateral talks with the leaders, Lord Carrington stressed the need for each of the republics to recognise the rights of minorities on their territory. 'There is an urgent need for Serbia to accept the principle of special status within Croatia for the (Serb-inhabited) Krajina and to persuade the Krajina Serbs to accept this,' he said. EC negotiators said they were worried that another flashpoint would be created if Serbs within Croatia declared independence or allied themselves with Serbia. UN Bosnia probe, Page 2</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Management: Share options for all If you are an executive in a British company you can expect to be given share options. If you are a mere employee the best you can hope for is the chance to save up for them through a sharesave scheme. However, some companies are trying to narrow the gap. A small handful is starting to introduce share option schemes for everyone modelled on the schemes usually only available to executives. The most recent example is Alpha Airports, which joined the stock market last week. Alpha has decided to give each of its 6,500 employees the option to buy 350 shares in three years' time at the issue price of 140p. So far each one is showing a paper profit of around Pounds 100. While the scheme makes no distinction between the lowliest employee and senior middle management, a separate (more generous) option scheme also exists for senior directors. New Bridge Street Consultants, which advised Alpha on the all-employee 'executive-style' scheme, argues that it is more democratic than usual sharesave schemes. Most of these are only taken up by 30-40 per cent of the workforce, as the bulk of employees cannot afford the monthly contribution. By contrast, the option scheme costs nothing until the options are exercised (in three to 10 years' time). Such schemes are likely to please institutional investors, which have become increasingly concerned about executive option schemes. Last week, the Pensions and Investment Research Consultants told its clients to vote down new schemes that were not open to all. However, employees offered share options are not necessarily being given a ticket to the stars. In 1992, Wellcome granted all of its UK workers the option to buy 500 shares each. From next year they will have the right to take them up at Pounds 7.72, but at today's share price of Pounds 6.48, they are hardly holding their breath.</p>

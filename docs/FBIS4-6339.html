			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodia has promised to stop publicly accusing  Thailand of continuing to aid the Khmer Rouge [KR] according to  Sakthip Krairiksh, Thailand's Ambassador to Cambodia.    "(Cambodian Foreign Minister) Prince (Norodom) Sirivudh  assured me that Cambodia will no longer speak of such things to  the press so that the situation gets better," Sakthip said in a  telephone interview.    Sakthip visited Sirivudh on Monday to lodge a formal protest  over Cambodia's allegations that Thailand provided refuge to a  Khmer Rouge leader and allowed the Maoist faction's troops into  its territory.    According to the Ambassador, the six-point protest tells of  Thailand's stance on the intemal affairs of Cambodia and its  dissatisfaction over allegations made by some Cambodian leaders  that Thailand assisted the faction in fighting against Phnom  Penh government troops.    It also urged Cambodia to take measures to ensure that  fighting there will not seriously affect Thais living along the  border.    The protest also called for evidence for every allegation  made by Cambodia, Sakthip said.    "I informed the (foreign) minister that he could call me any  time for explanation and discussion when questions of such kind  arose. It is better to solve this sort of problem through  diplomatic channels." Sakthip said, adding that the situation  could return to normal as soon as the two parties stopped  speaking through the media.    Sakthip said that Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen had  been due to visit Thailand after Cambodia's traditional New Year  day (April 13) but said no official contact over the trip had  been made between the two governments.    "Therefore, this cannot be called a cancellation since we  never had it officially confirmed," he said.    "Besides, we will not be ready to receive Hun Sen since  Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai will be in Malaysia and Foreign Minister  Prasong Sunsiri in Burma at the time (of the visit)," he said.    Meanwhile, Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak said the  military was ready to protect the country from future attacks by  Cambodian government forces. "The Army is prepared to maintain  security along the border," he told reporters.    Vijit insisted that Thailand has been sincere in dealing  with  Cambodia and the Army has followed government policy of not  getting involved in the internal affairs of the war-torn country.    He also said that as neighbours the two countries should  solve this problem as soon as possible.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday said  Thailand and Cambodia are becoming aware that public slanging  matches concerning the Khmer Rouge are counter-productive and  should stop forthwith.    Surin said civilians of both countries living along the  border have to shoulder the effects of misunderstanding between  both countries. The effects include fighting spilling over from  western Cambodia.    "Thai Ambassador to Phnom Penh Sakthip Krairiksh has  submitted a protest note to Prince Norodom Sirivudh, the foreign  minister. So far Cambodia has not responded, which indicates  that Cambodia doesn't want to prolong the issue," he said.    According to Surin, the country is still waiting for  evidence  from Cambodia to support Prince Ranariddh's claim that he has  photographic evidence proving Thailand's support for the Khmer  Rouge.    The dispute should be a good lesson for both countries that  criticism made publicly cannot solve bilateral  misunderstandings, he said.    An informed source said U.S. Ambassador Designate to  Cambodia  Charles Twining, recently informed a hearing organized by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Thai government  genuinely wants to support the legitimate government of Cambodia.</p>

			<p>Santa   Cruz Detailed   <F P=102> PY3105224194 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish  1700 GMT 31 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY3105224194 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Television Nacional Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Amalia Pando has a report for us from Santa Cruz on  a recent operation against drug trafficking involving customs  and Army personnel.    [Being recording] [Pando] Military and customs personnel  have  been involved in allowing stolen cars in Brazil and Paraguay to  enter the country. The vehicles were exchanged for cocaine at  the border. This ring was discovered during an operation named  Trebol. Santa Cruz District Prosecutor Francisco Bornstein has a  report on this case.    [Bornstein] More than 20 people have been arrested, 15  vehicles confiscated, and two car sales lots have been closed  down. The investigation continues because the ring is very  large.    [Pando] Has the size of the drug trafficking organization  been established?    [Bornstein] This is a ring that even has links with the  United States and Europe, which is where the drugs are  definitely sent. This discovery will allow customs authorities  and Army and police officials to take the necessary measures, as  some of their personnel are involved, because otherwise it would  be impossible to bring a vehicle from the Paraguayan or  Brazilian borders. These vehicles would have to cover certain  roads where they cannot be found. Those under investigation  said they handed over sums of money to customs and Army  personnel.    [Pando] This drug trafficking ring has used practically all  the border posts, and the smaller the post the better for them.    [Bornstein] Customs will have to make some corrections in  the  control system. It will have to carry out an appropriate  investigation and control of its personnel. The Army will have  to do the same, as the vehicles enter the country from Pedro  Juan Caballero, (Joe), and Eugenio Garay in Paraguay at the  Bolivian border, where the Army has personnel for carrying out  control operations.    [Pando] The stolen vehicles that were exchanged for cocaine  were mainly Mitsubishi and Toyota vehicles, and were exhibited  for sale until last week in two car sales lots in Santa Cruz.  The two businesses were closed down. Bornstein regretted that  military officials at the border points were not cooperating as  they should to identify the military personnel who cooperated  with this ring of cocaine and stolen car traffickers. He added  that despite this situation, the names of all the members of  this ring will soon be known. [end recording]</p>

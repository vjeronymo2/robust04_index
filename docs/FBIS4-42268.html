			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "PKK's Plan on Northern Iraq"] </F>   [Text] Ankara--The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has  drawn up a new plan for northern Iraq. It has been ascertained  that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has suffered significantly  from the consecutive blows by the Turkish security forces to his  organization, has put into effect an insidious plan to "cause  new problems for Turkey" in northern Iraq by cooperating with  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] leader Jalal Talabani. The  PKK has persuaded many pro-PKK families in the Sirnak region to  emigrate to northern Iraq. Some 20,000 people have crossed  Turkey's border thus far. The emigrants moved from Isikveren  and Sinath to areas known as the Seranish Fala and Seranish  Islam, which are between Zakho, Kasrog, and Parak. They have  established three settlements in the two areas.    It has been ascertained that the majority of the emigrants  are from the Guyam tribe. The officials have said that half of  the tribe supports the government and many men serve as village  guards. However, many of the remaining families are sympathetic  to the PKK.  <H5>  Emigration </H5>   Turkey is carefully watching the wave of emigration, which  began in the latter half of February. The officials have  established that several UN officials visit the three settlement  every day to register the emigrants and supply them with food  and clothing.    The intelligence sevices have drawn up a report to inform  the  prime minister of the new situation. The report, which has  already been submitted to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, describes  the PKK's new strategy as follows:    1. The PKK wishes to create a significant wave of emigration  in order to persuade international organizations, the UN  organization in particular, to take action.    2. The PKK wishes to create the impression that the  operations the security forces carry out in Turkey are organized  against innocent people and not the PKK.    3. Considering the fact that it has been unable to establish  a foothold in areas close to Turkey's border as a result of the  Turkish cross-border operations, the PKK wishes to establish  safe areas for itself in the interior of northern Iraq. The PKK  is aware that Turkey will not bomb the settlements in which  thousands of women and children will live, so they will provide  adequate shelter for the militants.    4. The PKK will move to cooperate with PUK Leader Jalal  Talabani when the pro-PKK population increases in northern Iraq.  The two sides will then take joint action against Democratic  Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani.    5. The number of settlements will be increased in time.  Later, all of them will be joined together. That will create  an opportunity for the PKK to place a large area under its  control. Naturally, that will be the first of the steps the PKK  will take to establish a Kurdish state.  <H5>  The DPK Is Careful </H5>   The dangerous developments that have taken place during the  past three months have moved the DPK into action. Mas'ud  Barzani has warned the emigrants that he will "force them to  return to Turkey if they cooperate with the PKK." That  indicates his sensitive approach to the matter. Meanwhile,  Turkish officials have explained to Barzani the objective behind  the wave of emigration and urged him to help them.  <H5>  Ocalan's Instructions </H5>   Abdullah Ocalan sent a message on 29 March ordering the  establishment of settlements in various parts of northern Iraq.  He also instructed his militants to put pressure on the local  authorities to force them to agree that the PKK will be  responsible for the defense of the settlements. Ocalan said  that "the settlements will be rear bases, which the PKK will use  as safe havens." He also explained that this action was to have  been taken in 1990, but it was frustrated by the Gulf War.    It has been established that Jalal Talabani has played a  very  important part in the new design. He has supported PKK's plan  since securing its assurance that the emigrants in northern Iraq  will vote in for the PUK in the elections of October 1994.  <H5>  Democracy Party's Role </H5>   The PKK has achieved a certain degree of success through  forcing the people in southeastern Turkey to emigrate to  northern Iraq. It has been ascertained that a group of  parliamentarians from the German Bundestag's Human Rights  Subcommittee visited the settlements to study the situation on  4-10 May. Three Democracy Party deputies visited northern Iraq  shortly after the German visit to try to convince the DPK and  PUK to agree to a cease-fire. Officials in Ankara have  described their visit as meaningful. It has been reported that  the three deputies, accompanied by several correspondents, will  also visit the three settlements. The officials are convinced  that the Democracy Party has launched an initiative to draw  attention in Turkey to the situation in northern Iraq.</p>

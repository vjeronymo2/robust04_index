			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The date and place of the cleaning, repairing, and testing shall be recorded on Form FRA 6180&hyph;49A, and the person performing the work and that person's supervisor shall sign the form. A record of the parts of the air brake system that are cleaned, repaired, and tested shall be kept in the railroad's files or in the cab of the locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) At its option, a railroad may fragment the work required by paragraph (f) of this section. In that event, a separate air brake record shall be maintained under a transparent cover in the cab. The air brake record should include the locomotive number, a list of the air brake components, and the date and place of the inspection and test of each component. The signature of the person performing the work and the signature of that person's supervisor shall be included for each component. A duplicate record shall be maintained in the railroad's files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Leakage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Leakage from the main reservoir and related piping may not exceed an average of 3 psi per minute for 3 minutes after the pressure has been reduced to 60 percent of the maximum pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Brake pipe leakage may not exceed 5 psi per minute after a reduction of 20 psi has been made from brake pipe air pressure of not less than 80 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) With a 20-psi brake pipe reduction at maximum brake pipe pressure and with communication to the brake cylinders closed, the brakes shall remain applied at least 5 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Handbrakes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  On locomotives so equipped, handbrakes, parts, and connections shall be inspected every 368 days, and necessary repairs made.

At a minimum, these procedures shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Instructions for performing the tasks contained in &sect;232.303(e) regarding locomotive brake inspection and tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Instructions for performing the tasks contained in &sect;232.309(a) regarding Class 1 brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Instructions for performing the tasks contained in &sect;232.315(a) regarding Class 2 brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Instructions for performing the tasks contained in &sect;232.317 regarding transfer brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Instructions for performing the tasks contained in &sect;232.319 regarding running tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The steps outlined in &sect;232.905(d) for equipment that includes new brake system technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The procedures for maintaining records of brake system tests aboard the trains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.307  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Events requiring the performance of a Class 1 train brake system test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All conventional freight trains shall receive a Class 1 brake system test as described in &sect;232.309 prior to departing any initial terminal point for that train. Initial terminal points include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The point of origin of the train; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A point where the train is required to have a new Class 1 test because the train has travelled the maximum permissible distance since its last Class 1 train brake system test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All cars added to a train that have not had a Class 1 test as a block or have been disconnected from a charging device (a source of compressed air) for more than four hours shall be subjected to a Class 1 test when added to the train. A Class 2 test shall then be performed on the entire new train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The following criteria shall be used to determine when the next new Class 1 test is required for a train:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a railroad does not maintain adequate records to determine the most stringent criteria that apply to a train, the train shall not travel more than 500 miles between required Class 1 tests. To be ``adequate,'' these records shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) When and where each block of cars is added to the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) When and where the last Class 1 brake system test was performed on each block of cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The name and qualifications of the brake system inspector performing the most recent Class 1 brake system test on each block of cars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The distance each block of cars has travelled since its last Class 1 test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The limitations each block of cars places on the distance the train may travel until its next Class 1 brake system test is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the configuration of the train changes, the most stringent criteria that applies to a subset of the cars comprising the train shall apply to the train as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The criteria given in &sect;232.311(a) shall be used to determine if a train is eligible to travel only 500 miles between Class 1 train brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The criteria given in &sect;232.311(b) shall be used to determine if a train is eligible to travel up to 1,500 miles between Class 1 train brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The criteria given in &sect;232.311(c) shall be used to determine if a train is eligible to travel up to 2,500 miles between Class 1 train brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The criteria given in &sect;232.311(d) shall be used to determine if a train is eligible to travel up to 3,500 miles between Class 1 train brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.309  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Required tasks of Class 1 train brake system test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Class 1 brake tests of conventional freight train air brake systems shall be conducted at locations described in &sect;232.305, and shall at a minimum consist of the following tasks and requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute or air flow greater than 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The brake pipe leakage test shall be conducted as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Charge the air brake system to within 15 psi of the setting of the feed or regulating valve on the locomotive, but to not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or end-of-train device at the rear end of train;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

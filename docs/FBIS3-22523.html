Of those cases, 115 have been confirmed, and  31 of the victims have unfortunately died.    In almost half the cases, according to ministry sources,  victims were between ages 10 and 20 and either not vaccinated at  all or not fully vaccinated against the disease. The number of  deaths, rather high at the outset, has declined considerably,  and the situation is now under control, despite constraints  related to the unavailability of large quantities of vaccine and  antidiphtheria medicine.    At this point, with outbreaks confined to isolated cases and  small-scale epidemic flare-ups, health authorities say the  percentage of the populace enjoying vaccinal protection -- now  that vaccination is mandatory -- is easily large enough to  prevent outbreak of a major epidemic.    A recent nationwide assessment of the epidemiological  situation for diphtheria showed that centers of contagion are  still persisting, even increasing, in the wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou,  and there has been a major new outbreak in Ghardaia. However,  diphtheria has died down at least temporarily in Bouira,  Tamanrasset, El Oued, and Ouargia, the assessment showed.    In Ouargia the situation has been brought almost fully under  control, and the isolation unit has closed down. In Tizi-Ouzou,  all health sectors are affected, with a total of 87 reported  cases, 34 of them bacteriologically confirmed, and six deaths.  In the same wilaya, health officials have treated 46 healthy  carriers identified by analysis of throat cultures.    In Ghardaia, 79 persons have been hospitalized with 49 cases  confirmed, but there have been no deaths. Finally, the Ministry  of Health and Population Affairs reiterates that the large-scale  population movements seen in recent years across our borders,  especially in the south, have contributed to propagation of the  infection and were probably responsible for the virulent form it  assumed when the epidemic first broke out.</p>

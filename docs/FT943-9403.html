			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G to reveal new plans to share Pounds 1.8bn bid cash A revised scheme for sharing out the Pounds 1.8bn cash offered by Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society will be announced today. The agreed bid suffered a setback in June when the original scheme was found by the High Court to be unlawful. The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, had argued that it contravened the 1986 Building Societies Act. C&amp;G, the UK's sixth-largest society, had planned to split the Pounds 1.8bn among its 1.4m borrowing and investing members, with most receiving a minimum of Pounds 500 and a maximum of Pounds 10,000 per investment account. The Act does not allow cash payments to investing members of less than two years' standing as a way of trying to prevent speculative flows of money between societies on takeover rumours. Since C&amp;G said last month that it did not intend to appeal against the judgment, attention has focused on the setting of a new date at which the two-year period starts, the most likely way of making the scheme lawful while still attractive enough to achieve the high levels of member approval needed. Borrowers are unlikely to receive payments under the new scheme. The Commission is expected today to say only that it will consider the new scheme, but that will be taken as a sign that it does not intend to challenge it in court.</p>

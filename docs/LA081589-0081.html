			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Construction resumed Monday at the San Diego Convention Center after a  settlement was reached with striking union workers.  </P> <P> The center's labor force returned to work and halted a 2 1/2-day walkout, said  Billy Crockett, the center's construction manager. Union laborers left their  jobs last Wednesday in protest over the employment of nonunion workers by a  subcontractor, Crockett said.  </P> <P> The nonunion laborers were hired to install resin flooring in the kitchens. A  union contract stipulated that subcontractors could only use union workers. The  issue was resolved when the nonunion workers agreed Friday afternoon to join  the union, at least until the project's completion, scheduled for Nov. 1.  </P> <P> "The immediate problem is put to bed," Crockett said, adding that he was unsure  whether the work stoppage would affect the completion deadline. The contractor,  Tutor-Saliba-Perini, already faces the problem of repairing a faulty sprinkler  system because it failed a Fire Department inspection.  </P></p>

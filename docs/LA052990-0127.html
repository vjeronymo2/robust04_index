			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> REAGANS, GORBACHEVS TO MEET  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, who once called the Soviet Union an evil empire  and challenged President Mikhail S. Gorbachev three years ago to tear down the  Berlin Wall, will meet the Soviet leader in San Francisco next Monday, Reagan's  office said today.  </P> <P> Reagan's wife, Nancy, and Raisa Gorbachev, wife of Gorbachev, will also attend  the breakfast meeting, to be held at the home of the Soviet consul general in  San Francisco, Reagan's office said.  </P> <P> The meeting between the Reagans and the Gorbachevs was at first expected to  take place in the Soviet Consulate itself.  </P> <P> Soviet officials visited Reagan aides in Los Angeles two weeks ago and  suggested the site for a meeting. But Reagan aides were said to have regarded  the Consulate, technically Soviet territory, as not an ideal meeting place.  </P> <P> The meeting at the residence is apparently a compromise, local diplomatic  sources said.  </P></p>

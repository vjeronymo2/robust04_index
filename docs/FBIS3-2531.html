This meeting is convened at a crucial time in China's  reform,  opening up, and socialist modernization drive. Since the First  Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, people  of all nationalities across the country, under the leadership of  the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  nucleus, and persistently taking as their guidance Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as well as the basic line of the party, have  implemented the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress in a  comprehensive manner; they have seized the opportunity to  intensify reform and speed up development. The CPC Central  Committee and State Council took the major step of macroeconomic  regulation and control to solve the contradictions and problems  in the march forward with noticeable success. The national  economy has seen sustained, rapid, and healthy growth [chi xu  kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099  1455]; heartening progress has been made in all undertakings of  socialist construction with Chinese characteristics. With the  adoption at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some  Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure" as the hallmark, the reform of China's  economic structure has entered a crucial phase of combining  package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. Several major  reform measures were simultaneously announced earlier this year,  and efforts have been increased over the past two months or so  to implement these reform plans. Ensuring the faithful  implementation of these reform plans with all manner of support  represents a gigantic and formidable task. The government work  report, as well as other reports to be examined at the current  session, will contain specific plans for attaining this year's  tasks. Therefore, the success of this session is of great  significance for reform and development in 1994 and thereafter.    Over the past year, China has made remarkable progress in  promoting socialist democracy and legality. New progress has  been made in the work of the NPC and local people's congresses  at all levels. Taking the theory of socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line as its guidance, and  the reinforcement of socialist democracy and the socialist legal  system as its fundamental tasks, the NPC Standing Committee has  focused on the central task of economic development and has  conscientiously performed the functions vested in it by the  Constitution. It has done a great deal of fruitful work in  strengthening legislative work, in improving the supervisory  mechanism, in promoting reform and development, in safeguarding  social stability, and so forth. It was a year in which more  laws were adopted by the NPC Standing Committee than any other  year. Especially noteworthy is the fact that economic  legislation has been given top priority in the legislative  agenda. A slew of major laws designed to standardize market  practices, safeguard order in the marketplace, and increase  macroeconomic regulation and control have been promulgated in  good time; these laws include the Company Law, the Law Against  Unethical Competition, and the Law on Protecting the Rights and  Interests of Consumers. These laws have played, and will  continue to play, an important function in pushing forward and  safeguarding the healthy development of a socialist market  economy. A market economy cries for development of the legal  system; the legal system safeguards the market economy. As the  reform of China's economic structure enters a new stage,  development of a socialist democracy and the socialist legal  system will also usher in a new phase.    The people's congress system is China's fundamental  political system. From the first session of the first NPC in  1954 up until now, China has practiced this system for exactly  40 years. During those 40 years, the NPC has undertaken an  unforgettable journey. Since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC--the supreme organ of state  power--has been playing an increasingly important role on the  political scene of the state. Practice has shown that the  people's congress system was established in line with China's  reality; it is a system rooted deeply in China's reality with a  long life-force and is a vital component of the socialist  political system with Chinese characteristics. In the  transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economic  structure, the people's congress will play a still greater role  as the organ for people to exercise the power of state.    Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to  the outside world, expediting development, and ensuring  stability are requirements of overall importance for 1994 set by  the entire party and the entire country by the CPC Central  Committee. We are faced with formidable tasks of reform and  development this year; meanwhile, preserving social and  political stability requires us to bring into fuller play under  the CPC leadership the role of people's congresses, government,  and CPPCC committees at all levels, and to mobilize, unite, and  coordinate the efforts of hundreds upon millions of people to  ensure the smooth accomplishment of the various tasks. The NPC  and people's congresses at all levels will certainly play an  important role in properly handling the relationship between  reform, development, and stability.    Our forefathers said: "A right moment is hard to come by but  easy to let slip. A right moment quickly seized is an  opportunity. For this reason, the sage moves at the right  moment, and the wise man springs into action at the opportune  time." Today, China's socialist modernization drive is faced by  a rare, excellent opportunity. Seizing the opportunity, "moving  at the right moment," and "springing into action at the  opportune time" are crucial to the accomplishment of our goals  of struggle. By conscientiously exercising the power entrusted  them by the people during the current session, and by speaking  their minds freely in discussing matters of vital importance at  the current session, the deputies will certainly make important  contributions to the accomplishment of the session's agenda.    We wish the NPC session complete success.</p>

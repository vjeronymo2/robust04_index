			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Cabinet reshuffle may save hospitals The government yesterday faced growing pressure to slow down its shake-up of London hospitals amid signs of concern in 10 Downing Street about the public backlash. Ministers suggested last night that the impending Cabinet reshuffle could provide the opportunity for a rethink of proposals in the Tomlinson report to slim down radically the capital's hospitals. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is widely expected to move to a new department in a reshuffle which could come as soon as next Monday. Her successor would be in a much stronger position to announce a review of the planned hospital closures and mergers. Mr John Major is said to be particularly concerned about the decision to close in-patient services at Guy's hospital, one of the most advanced research and teaching units in Britain. Sir Philip Harris, a substantial benefactor to the hospital and a deputy treasurer at Conservative Central Office, is among a number of influential figures lobbying the prime minister to change Mrs Bottomley's decision. An all-party group of MPs is leading a campaign to prevent the effective closure of Guy's as part of its merger with St Thomas'. The merger is still the subject of public consultation and opponents of the plan have threatened a legal challenge. Downing Street also appears uncertain of the financial calculations in the original plan to close a number a leading teaching hospitals and cut the number of beds in London by up to 2,500. The British Medical Association yesterday angrily condemned the closure plans. It voted unanimously at its annual conference for a reappraisal of the 'disastrous' recommendations in the Tomlinson report.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOMPERS TEACHER TO BE CHARGED WITH CHILD MOLESTATION, D.A.'S OFFICE SAYS  </P> <P> A veteran teacher at Gompers Secondary School will be charged with one count of  misdemeanor child molestation involving several female students from September,  1989, to April, 1990, the San Diego County district attorney's office announced  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sidney J. Loveless Jr., an English teacher at the controversial Southeast San  Diego school, will surrender for arraignment by next week and be released on  his own recognizance, based on an arrangement made with Loveless' attorney,  Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A well-informed source told The Times on Tuesday that the agreement involves  Loveless pleading guilty to a single molestation count, forgoing a trial, and  that he will be required to register as a sex offender under state law.  Loveless would also be fired by the San Diego Unified School District and face  loss of his state teaching credential.  </P> <P> Kenneth W. Brooks, the attorney representing Loveless, declined comment on the  case Tuesday other than to say that he has not yet talked with Elias regarding  a specific date for Loveless to appear for legal proceedings.  </P> <P> Elias said Tuesday that his department's monthlong review of evidence presented  him by San Diego police child abuse detectives persuaded him that a single  count incorporating alleged molestation of several students is the most  appropriate charge to file.  </P> <P> Elias said he will also review police evidence regarding violations of state  law by Gompers Principal Marie Thornton in allegedly failing to properly report  the allegations against Loveless when first brought to her by two students in  late March.  </P> <P> "I'm going to review those reports beginning tonight," Elias said. Police have  recommended that Thornton be cited on a misdemeanor charge for failing to  immediately notify both school police and the county Integrated Child  Protective Services and to follow up with a written report within 36 hours as  required under state law.  </P> <P> Thornton has been under frequent fire this year for purported management  shortcomings in her handling of teacher assignments and complaints and of a  February student demonstration at Gompers. Gompers, an award-winning,  high-powered math-science-computer magnet school, has been embroiled in efforts  to expand its long-limited curriculum to more nonwhite neighborhood students.  </P> <P> Tina Dyer, attorney for the San Diego Unified School District, said Tuesday  that Loveless will be suspended immediately from the district without pay until  his case is concluded. Should he plead guilty or decide to go to trial and be  convicted, he would be immediately fired because the state education code  requires termination for conviction under the misdemeanor provision that  Loveless is charged with.  </P> <P> Dyer said the district in such a case also informs California's Commission on  Teacher Credentialing, which conducts its own review before deciding whether to  strip the teacher of his state teaching credential.  </P> <P> Loveless was removed from his classroom at Gompers and has been working at a  non-classroom job at the district's Instructional Media Center in Linda Vista  since police began looking into his case in early April.  </P> <P> Police investigators found that as many as 30 victims over several years may  have been involved with Loveless, sources told The Times last month. Loveless  was also counseled several years ago at Gompers by Thornton in connection with  a previous case of suspected abuse, sources said.  </P> <P> Thornton is under investigation for not immediately reporting the accusations  when she received them in late March, even though state law says that a  principal or other staff member "must report" suspected child abuse "by  telephone immediately, or as soon as practically possible," and follow up with  a written report within 36 hours.  </P> <P> Another source told The Times in April that, before contacting police, Thornton  confronted Loveless during a meeting at which the two students were present.  The education code states, in underlined passages, that "school personnel must  keep in mind that investigation and suspected child abuse is the responsibility  of the child welfare unit and, when appropriate, assesment is made by the Nurse  Intervention Task Force; it is not the responsibility of school personnel."  </P> <P> Although Thornton reportedly notified the Gompers school police officer the  following day, Child Protective Services, which intervenes to make sure that  students are adequately counseled after suspected child abuse, was not notified  until almost a week later, by an assistant principal, sources said.  </P> <P> Thornton has declined all comment on the investigation and has retained an  attorney.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial people's government sponsored an  enlarged plenum on the afternoon of 18 April to hear the report  on the economic situation prevailing in the first quarter and to  make work arrangements for the next period.    During the plenum, Governor Zhao Zhihao delivered a speech  in  which he contended: The general situation prevailing in the  first quarter was good and main manifestations were that the  measures for reform were issued in an associated way, these  measures were enforced more smoothly, the economic operation was  basically normal, a faster economic growth was maintained, some  social contradictions were dissolved, social stability was  maintained, and the work style of organs improved obviously.  The province made a good start in various areas thanks to the  positive efforts made by units at all levels and various  departments and the province can still maintain a higher speed  in economic development in the second quarter. However, the  economic environment will tend to be strained.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: In conducting work in the second  quarter, we should give priority to grasping reform and  stability to promote the healthy development of the economy. By  no means should we contend for speed, open enterprises, and new  projects blindly. Efforts should be made to realistically orient  the guiding ideology of economic work onto the track of  readjusting structure, making technical progress, enhancing  management, and increasing economic results.    In his speech Governor Zhao emphatically put forward demands  in the following five aspects:    1. We should earnestly implement the spirit of the rural  work  conference sponsored by the central authorities; vigorously  realize the stable increase in the output of grains, cotton, and  oil-bearing seeds; enable the rural economy to achieve  development in an overall way; and increase peasants' income on  a large scale.    2. A good job should be done in directing enterprises,  particularly large and medium-sized enterprises, and enterprises  encountering difficulties to improve their production and  operation and to conduct technical renovations. Efforts should  be made to accelerate the merger, association, auction, rent,  and reform in share-holding systems among the enterprises that  are encountering particular difficulties. We should find a way  out from conducting reform and enable them to get rid of their  difficulties as soon as possible.    3. We should give priority to key projects and further  deepen  the reform in an overall way. Units at provincial, prefectural,  and county levels should give priority to reform and push the  reform forward in an overall way. State-owned,  collectively-owned, and township enterprises should shift their  business mechanism in an overall way. Problems cropping up in  the reform in the financial and tax systems should be dealt with  as quickly as possible. We should make great progress in  establishing the systems of social security this year. In line  with the practical situation, reform in the housing systems  should be gradually carried out in stages and by group. We have  no problems related to going too far and too fast in opening up,  so should take faster steps and adopt more effective measures in  this regard.    4. A good job should be done in enlivening the financial  affairs and expanding the channels of raising funds to relieve  the contradiction of fund shortage.    5. Various industries, trades, and departments should  closely  coordinate with one another to vigorously maintain social  stability.</p>

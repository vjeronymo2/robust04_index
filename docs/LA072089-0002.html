			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING FOR A BREAK;  </P> <P> CONTEST DRAWS FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS AMATEUR SURFERS GO FOR BIG TIME  </P> <P> At the innocent age of 16, Heidi Jacobs is already a surfing widow, another  casualty of those crazy board wars.  </P> <P> With her luxurious blond hair and California tan, the Seal Beach teen-ager is  the kind of girl most young football lettermen would kill for. But Wednesday  morning, she was sitting on a North County beach being ignored again, playing  spectator to her boyfriend one more time.  </P> <P> Out in the surf, 15-year-old Ryan Simmons was zig-zagging his short board like  a teen possessed, grabbing all the attention, as if he were the beauty queen.  </P> <P> "He practices five hours every day, sometimes 10, depending on whether he has  any competitions coming up," Jacobs said, sighing. "When other guys are taking  their girlfriends to the movies, Ryan's hitting the surf."  </P> <P> But doesn't that crash a wave onto their budding relationship?  </P> <P> "Naw," she said, bashfully digging her foot into the sand.  </P> <P> "Oh, yes it does," interrupted 16-year-old Bridget Carey. "In fact, they're  fighting right now. Ryan doesn't appreciate the fact that Heidi came all the  way down here just to watch him. He says it breaks his concentration."  </P> <P> Simmons is a top-seeded entrant in the U. S. Amateur Surfing Championships  being held this week in Oceanside. Like 500 other aspirants, he wants badly to  win, to ride the wave all the way to the rarefied professional surfing ranks.  </P> <P> Right now, though, this amateur tournament is the big time for guys like  Simmons. All of the surfing magazines will be there for stories and pictures.  And the weekend finals will be broadcast over ESPN to a national audience.  </P> <P> Until then, amateur surfers from New Jersey to Hawaii will be on the water,  pulling the most radical maneuvers from their pouch of tricks -- moves with  names like "the flyaway," "the roundhouse cutback" and "the floater."  </P> <P> Through Sunday, the contest will transform Oceanside's north jetty into a  regular Southern California happening, a scene of darkly  </P> <P> suntanned bodies, surfboards, colorful bandannas over blond heads, beach  thongs, big straw hats -- and more outrageously suntanned bodies.  </P> <P> On Wednesday morning, still early in the scheme of things, more than 100  spectators had taken the day off to loll in the sand and catch the action.  There were surfers' moms and dads, aunts and uncles, and girlfriends, along  with a North County surf club composed of watchful pre-teens.  </P> <P> There were brothers and sisters, high school surfing coaches and a curious  breed of surfing tumbleweed -- down-and-outers who rolled into the nearby  parking lot with a three-day beard growth, their belongings stored in the back  seats of cars that belched blue smoke. They were men who claimed to be "close  personal friends with Tommy Curren," the three-time professional surfing  champion.  </P> <P> For Mike Wilkins, a spokesman for the tournament, the turnout proves at least  one thing: Amateur surfing is on a roll.  </P> <P> "The surf-wear industry may be in decline; kids in Iowa aren't rushing to the  stores to buy surf shorts and tops anymore," he said. "But, on the coast, young  people are taking up the sport more than ever. There's no shortage of young  surfers, that's for sure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> High School Teams  </P> <P> There are other vital signs for the health of the sport. Coastal high schools  throughout the country are starting surfing teams to compete with other  schools.  </P> <P> In California, there is a move to have high school surf teams sanctioned by the  California Interscholastic Federation, which would establish governing rules  and a playoff schedule -- in effect, giving the sport more legitimacy, Wilkins  said.  </P> <P> "There's also a move to make surfing a sanctioned Olympic sport," he said.  "And, if that occurs, these amateur tournaments will be the next best thing to  Olympic trials."  </P> <P> The success of the sport makes Wilkins worry that some youngsters are being  swept up in their dedication to it -- and all that it has come to stand for.  </P> <P> "There's a bumper sticker you see on a lot of cars these days that reads 'Real  Surfers Don't Work.' And that idea worries me," said Wilkins, who grew up  catching the waves off Huntington Beach in the 1960s.  </P> <P> "The idea is that, to be a successful surfer, you have to drop out of society,  collect all those free surfboards and wet suits from sponsors, and never have  to work a day in your life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grades Plus Waves  </P> <P> So Wilkins is making sure that the new generation of surfers doesn't drop out.  His 14-year-old daughter, an amateur surfer who competes on a San Clemente high  school team, doesn't hit the water unless her grades are above sea level.  </P> <P> "Some kids focus so much on the sport to the point that they're not plugging  into what the rest of life is all about," he said. "Some perspective needs to  be established."  </P> <P> For young athletes with the proper goals in mind, Wilkins said, the amateur  surfing competitions are the ticket to success.  </P> <P> "They're the way to use the beach scene in a positive way -- as opposed to just  hanging out," he said. "It's like the old days when I grew up. There's just  good, clean-cut, hard-core surfing. The only people you're going to see smoking  out here are the parents."  </P> <P> For the surfer with an eye on a professional break, the U.S. Amateur Surfing  Championship is a must-win. To get to this point, the surfers must have scored  the most points in yearlong competitions sponsored by any one of the seven  associations that make up the U.S. Surfing Federation.  </P> <P> "That's when you find out how good you are," he said. "The kids who make it  here are the best in the U.S."  </P> <P> Next, winners vie for a spot on the U.S. Amateur Surfing Team, which competes  internationally. From there, many go on to professional sponsorships and a life  style of world travel that most young surfers can only dream about.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Age 10 to 55  </P> <P> But, before the pro ranks, come the amateur contests. On Wednesday, surfers  from 10 to 55 competed in a series of daylong heats on 2- to 3-foot waves.  </P> <P> At the blare of a foghorn, the seven entrants of each heat raced out into the  water, paddling their boards furiously toward the surf.  </P> <P> "That's why I don't use binoculars to watch the action, you miss too much of  the real competition," said 23-year-old John O'Connor of Laguna Beach. "You  know, watching the guys lying on their stomachs, paddling out to see who gets  priority on the waves.  </P> <P> "That's the real battle. You don't have to be a surfer to appreciate that."  </P> <P> For the judges, excellence is judged by a surfer's best three waves in a  15-minute period. "The judges are looking to see who gets the biggest waves,  the longest ride and who does the most radical maneuvers," Wilkins said.  </P> <P> As the surfers raced toward shore, an emcee described the action for the crowd,  his voice booming from two loudspeakers perched atop folding chairs, which  leaned precariously in the sand.  </P> <P> The surfers carved wide turns, went airborne and gracefully played on the  breaking waves.  </P> <P> The crowd applauded often. But they weren't the only ones enjoying the action.  </P> <P> "We love this stuff, it makes the beach not so touristy like it usually is,"  said 17-year-old Sean Connor, a concessionaire at the North Jetty Sandwich  Shop, a Frisbee's throw from the sand. "Usually, you see lots of moms and dads,  old guys with beer bellies. This week, you're seeing the little surfer dudes  and their girlfriends. It's kicked back."  </P> <P> Heather Aird, another sandwich saleswoman, said the shop's business increases  fivefold during such competitions. "It's just funner," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Running From Sun  </P> <P> And there is another difference along the north jetty beach this week. People  are running from the sun.  </P> <P> "These surfers are out in the sun, day in and day out, maybe too much," Wilkins  said. "They're aware of things like sun damage and skin cancer.  </P> <P> "So when the sun pops out, you'll see the surfers heading for the shade. That  doesn't happen on a normal day at the beach."  </P> <P> For the amateur surfers Wednesday, the thrill of victory came often. So did the  pain of elimination.  </P> <P> At a snack bar away from the crashing waves, 15-year-old Rob Machado and his  friend, Frankie Hejduk, shared a candy bar and a couple packages of chocolate  doughnuts. It was sort of a consolation prize.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missing the Big Ones  </P> <P> The 14-year-old Hejduk had lost out in his preliminary heat. Machado, on the  other hand, had advanced.  </P> <P> "I just didn't catch any good waves," Hejduk explained with his head down, his  braces bared as he popped another doughnut into his mouth. "You usually know  when you're out there whether you've won or lost."  </P> <P> Both boys had spent long hours polishing their techniques off the Encinitas  shoreline, dreaming of one day becoming award-winning surfers. Now, for this  tournament anyway, the hopes of only one remained.  </P> <P> But Hejduk said he would be back today -- not in the water, though, but on the  beach, cheering on his best buddy.  </P> <P> "That's what friends are for," he said.  </P></p>

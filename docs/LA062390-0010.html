			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA CLARA RIVER;  </P> <P> BIRD WATCHERS HELP TERNS NEST IN PEACE  </P> <P> Armed with signs, two-way radios and portable fences, Ventura County  bird-watchers are helping safeguard a small gray-and-white bird species that  faces extinction.  </P> <P> The California least tern, listed as being at risk since 1970, nests along the  California coastline between the months of May and August. Nesting sites in  Ventura County include a section of the Santa Clara River estuary in Ventura,  Point Mugu and Ormond Beach in Oxnard.  </P> <P> The birds lay their purple-and-brown speckled eggs near the water and must be  protected from beach-goers, who could easily trample them, said Don Davis, vice  president of the western Ventura County chapter of the Audubon Society.  </P> <P> The birds scrape a spot in the sand and lay their eggs, which are well  camouflaged.  </P> <P> The birds are protected at their breeding grounds at Point Mugu because the  Navy property is off-limits to most people. And the Ormond Beach nesting area,  a favorite for off-road vehicles, has been partially sealed off and is  patrolled by the Oxnard Police Department.  </P> <P> But at the Santa Clara River estuary, the terns nest in an increasingly popular  area. So for the past five years, the Audubon Society -- with help from the  city of Ventura, the Ventura Port District, the state Fish and Game Commission  and McGrath State Beach rangers -- fences a 500-by-200-foot area of beach as a  breeding ground from late April to late August.  </P> <P> The four-foot-high chain-link fence cuts the area off to foot traffic and is  surrounded by signs informing people that it is a nesting area.  </P> <P> On weekends, about 45 Audubon Society members rotate shifts from noon until  dark, answering questions and keeping people at a distance from the birds, who  make a distinctive sound like a Kewpie doll squeaking, Davis said.  </P> <P> "People are understanding and cooperative," said monitor Bobbe Dorsey of  Ventura.  </P> <P> But unleashed dogs have to be chased away, she said.  </P> <P> Monitors carry two-way radios to notify rangers or police if they need help but  have not had to use them, Dorsey said.  </P> <P> The fence also protects the terns from wild cats, foxes and weasels that live  nearby.  </P> <P> The terns themselves handle threats from aerial predators.  </P> <P> When a sea gull flies over the nesting area, the colony of about 45 terns takes  flight and harasses it.  </P> <P> "Terns are very agile and can fly loops around a poor old lumbering gull,"  Davis said.  </P> <P> This season, the colony is larger than usual, in part because the Point Mugu  nesting ground was washed out by a storm Memorial Day weekend.  </P> <P> It is now mating season for the gray-and-white birds, which are about nine  inches long with a 20-inch wing span. In the birds' mating ritual, the male  first presents the female with a fish and bobs his head repeatedly. After they  mate, the female lays one to four eggs within a couple of days. Incubation  lasts 3 1/2 weeks with parents taking turns on the nest.  </P> <P> Within a day of breaking from the shell, the speckled chicks can scurry to hide  under the short dune plants.  </P> <P> Both parents catch minnows and sticklebacks from nearby ponds or smelt from the  ocean to feed their hungry brood.  </P> <P> As chicks grow feathers, the family leaves the nest to live by various ponds in  the county, including those at golf courses.  </P> <P> In the fall, the terns fly south to winter in southern Baja California and  Central America.  </P> <P> In 1989, about 1,233 pairs of least terns bred at 28 sites between San Diego  and the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a field study by the state  Department of Fish and Game.

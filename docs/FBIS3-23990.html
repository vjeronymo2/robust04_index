Matrosov, Minister of the Government of </F> Moscow and head of the Department for Engineering Support, by  Albert Kozlov and Vladimir Naumov: "With An Accuracy Of Up To  One Square Meter; Commencing 1 March, Muscovites Await An  Increase In Payments For Housing And Muncipal Services"]    [Text] The Minister of Government for Moscow and head of  the department for Engineering Support, A. Matrosov, comments  upon an increase in rental payments in the capital.    [Matrosov] This is not simply a compulsory measure -- it is  long overdue. The municipal-housing economy has operated at a  loss since 1976. In 1993, the population paid only 0.24 percent  of the expenditures for the maintenance and repair of housing  and at the present time this proportion may decline to three  percent. More budgetary appropriations are needed: in 1994,  according to very modest estimates, 715 billion rubles will be  required for the maintenance of available housing and for  thermal energy -- more than one trillion rubles. Roughly 2.3  trillion rubles will be needed for capital repair work. The city  cannot endure such expenditures. Only an increase in payments by  the population can save the housing fund from inevitable  collapse. This is borne out in Decree No. 41 of the government  of Moscow, dated 11 January 1994. In accordance with this  decree, a new system of payments for housing and municipal  services will be introduced commencing 1 March.    [Kozlov/Naumov] What will be the new rates for apartment  rentals?    [Matrosov] The maximum rate called for commencing 1 March --  24 rubles for one square meter of overall apartment space, with  all municipal conveniences in an apartment house having an  elevator and rubbish chute and not located in the outskirts of  Moscow.    [Kozlov/Naumov] And indeed have the prices for all municipal  services increased sharply at the same time?    [Matrosov] Yes, the charge for heating each square meter of  apartment space will increase from three to 25 rubles. Hot water  supply -- from 53 to 455 rubles per person. And gas, for which  we are today collecting from 17 to 27 rubles, will be increased  to 25-49 rubles. At the present time, each individual is paying  an average of 44 rubles for water and sewerage service and in  the future -- from 115 to 300 rubles.    Thus, a family of three individuals occupying an apartment  of  54 square meters of space and enjoying all conveniences will pay  5,055 rubles per month.    [Kozlov/Naumov] This is a very painful price increase,  especially for low income families.    [Matrosov] I agree that this is a very serious step. Thus  the  decree calls for measures which will lessen the severity of this  price shock for poor people. First of all, the plans call for a  program of subsidies, with 11 billion rubles to be allocated for  this purpose. The subsidies will be issued in a manner such that  a family's rental expenditures for 1994 will not exceed 10  percent of its overall family income. According to our  estimates, commencing in March one out of every hundred families  will receive a housing allowance.    [Kozlov/Naumov] And how will these needy families be found?    [Matrosov] It is expected that territorial services will be  established for the handling of housing subsidies. Residents  will provide them with a statement, an extract from their  housing register and information on the income of family  members. The subsidy amount, in accordance with which the  apartment rent will be reduced, will be computed for them based  upon these documents.    [Kozlov/Naumov] But will the March increase in apartment  rent  be the last one?    [Matrosov] The plans call for a second one in June. In  accordance with the decree, the maximum payment for a square  meter of housing space during the second half of the year will  be 117 rubles. And subsequently there will be new price  increases. These will be aimed at softening the impact of the  raised prices. At least in the beginning, the payment for rent  will not be 10 percent of a family's budget but rather less.  Obviously, there will also be other corrections. But on the  whole, I am confident that the document will be adopted. As the  saying goes, there is no retreating.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   And here is the opinion of the prefect of the capital's  central district, Aleksandr Muzykantskiy.    "Aleksandr Ilich, apartments in Moscow are planned and  arranged according to several categories depending upon the  degree of conveniences. Thus the costs for operational expenses  must vary. Is this not so?"    [Matrosov] This goes without saying. They are higher in  prestigious apartment buildings: here there is more space,  hallways and, it follows, greater heating expenses.    [Kozlov/Naumov] Is there no fear that growth in apartment  rent will bring about an increase in the number of those who  fall behind in their payments?    [Matrosov] Today the obligations for apartment rent amount  to  a miserly figure and it is much more expensive to have a system  for monitoring those who fall behind in their payments.  Moreover, there are justifiable methods for guarding against  such individuals. There is no problem here.    In accordance with existing practice, we are aware that  regardless of the level at which decrees are adopted, they  almost always suffer from one shortcoming: the social protection  for people that is specified in them is constantly being  violated. By way of justifying this fact, governmental  representatives complain that a "good" decree is unable to  create an effective mechanism for implementation. Will this not  also be the case for the above-mentioned document of the Moscow  government?</p>

The chairman of the presidency of the parliament, Pjeter  Arbnori, the vice-premier, Bashkim Kopliku, the chairman of the  DP parliamentary group, Ali Spahia, and the DP Secretary General  Tritan Shehu took part in the meeting.    1994, underlined Mr. Selami, will be marked as the year of  coalition of the left extreme forces directed by the Socialist  Party. The Democratic Alliance Party is taking part openly into  it unfortunately, he said. Shkoder became one of the arenas of  the political tension which is a result of the coordination  between left extremes.    Speaking abut the killing of Gjovalin Cekini, during an  incident on January 14, he said that the Democratic Party has  condemned the crime and holds that he was a victim of the  unnecessary tensions. Regarding accusations against the DP for  the killing are groundless, Mr. Selami said adding that the  Democratic Party has no relations with the crime. "We will wait  until the verdict is taken and then we shall give our opinion  about these accusations."    "We will answer the unbridled antidemocratic propaganda,  which has in its focus the Democratic Party at all its levels,  with the promotion of the reform," Mr. Selami said.    Mr. Pjeter Arbnori spoke about the reorganization and  consolidation of the commission of the constitution. He said  that the constitution "belongs neither to the Democratic Party  nor to the Socialist Party, it belongs to Albania, so we should  compile it together through understanding."    Mr. Bashkim Kopliku spoke about the economic reform in  Albania, the achievements and the difficulties which have been  encountered as well as about the opinions of the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund with regard to the reform in Albania.</p>

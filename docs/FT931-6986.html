			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting rises by 20% to Pounds 18m THE EXPANSION of its international network helped London Forfaiting, the specialist trade finance house, report a near 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 18.1m, in 1992. Forfaiting is the provision of trade finance through fixed rate loans, which are sold at a discount to banks and international companies. The company increased its presence in the US and Far East, and last month opened an office in the Czech Republic. Some 80 per cent of its revenue is generated overseas. Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said the international base would continue to be widened. The final dividend is increased to 5.5p for a total of 8.4p (7.625p). Earnings per share rose to 13.75p (11.52p). Because of his increasing executive commitments with Caledonia Investments, Mr Buckley is standing down as chairman in favour of Mr Jack Wilson, chief executive. Mr Stathis Papoutes, managing director, is to become chief executive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Farm Income To Decline if China Stops Buying" -- </F> XINHUA headline]    [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. farm income will  decline by nearly 100 million U.S. dollars a year if China, the  buyer of one-fifth of American wheat exports, stops doing so, a  congressional report said today.    By 1996, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said, the  U.S. would experience export losses of 250 million bushels of  wheat if China retaliates the withdrawal of its most favored  nation (MFN) trade status.    The resulting weaker demand and larger U.S. stocks will  depress U.S. wheat prices by about 15 cents per bushel by 1996,  the report said.    President Clinton will decide by June 3 whether to renew  China's MFN status, which makes China, like most other nations  in the world, enjoy the lowest possible tariffs in its exports  to the U.S..    "The psychological effect of losing a major foreign wheat  market might tend to push U.S. prices down even further in the  future," the CRS said in its report to the House Committee on  Agriculture.    The CRS stressed, meanwhile, that China will continue to be  "a significant buyer" of American wheat assuming that China's  MFN status will be extended.    China became a major U.S. farm export market in 1987, when  it  broke into the ranks of the top 20 importers of farm products.  Wheat has amounted to between 60 and 92 percent of China's farm  imports from the U.S..    Since 1989, however, China's rank in wheat imports has  slipped, with the purchase of 376 million dollars of U.S. wheat  last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.    According to the department, the Chinese typically prefer to  buy high quality, high protein wheats, such as hard red spring  or winter wheat, which they mill for flour for bread and other  baked goods.    "Other wheat exporting countries," the report said, "hold  enough wheat stocks to fill China's lost supplies from the U.S.,  should China choose to reject U.S. wheat exports altogether" in  the next three years.    In addition to wheat, China purchases a broad array of U.S.  farm products, including grains, soybeans, cotton, livestock,  horticultural products and even wine and tobacco.    Wheat accounted for half of the value of U.S. exports to  China in 1992. A major proportion of U.S. wheat exports to  China have been subsidized by the U.S. Government.</p>

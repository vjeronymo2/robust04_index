SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting with labor  leaders Monday that he received an informal call for a summit  between him and Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP). In the meeting, Murayama indicated that the SDP  alone cannot strike a compromise over the matter noting the  party is one of seven partners in the coalition, SDP officials  said.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori earlier proposed holding  talks between Kono and Murayama.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported Monday that Kono and Murayama  should have summit talks and agree to consider legislating an  antigraft law separate from election reform bills. The national  daily said if the country's two largest parties agree on placing  priority on anticorruption measures, it will have a significant  impact in resolving the impasse over political reform.    Last week, the House of Councillors voted down a package of  four government-sponsored political reform bills which had  passed the House of Representatives in November.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ruling coalition  are  seeking to establish a joint panel of the two houses in a  last-ditch effort to achieve political reform by Saturday, when  the current session of the Diet ends. The political reform  package is designed to introduce a combination of single-seat  and proportional representation seats for lower house general  elections, replacing the current multiseat district system, as  well as stepping up controls on political fund-raising  activities.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "President Yeltsin Presents Ultimatum </F> to Bosnian Serbs"]    [Text] The change in Russia's stance on the Bosnian  crisis, which emerged after the Serbs violated the commitments  they had given to Moscow and mounted the determined storming of  the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, has been confirmed in a special  statement by Boris Yeltsin.    The Russian president has demanded that the Bosnian Serbs  immediately withdraw their forces from the besieged city, allow  the peacemaking forces to enter, and lift the blockade on the UN  personnel. Yeltsin confirmed his proposal to hold a meeting of  the leaders of Russia, the United States, France, and Britain to  elaborate a common position.    Moscow has put forward such an initiative in the past but  the  West responded coolly to it. This time the reaction was  different -- the Europeans welcomed Yeltsin's proposal and U.S.  President Bill Clinton called it "worthy of serious discussion."    A few hours after the Russian president's statement the  Bosnian Serbs agreed to release the captured UN peacemakers and  allow the blue helmets to enter Gorazde -- but only on the left  bank of the Drina River. As for the right bank, which had been  captured by the Serbs during recent fighting, they have no  intention of leaving there, as Radovan Karadzic has  unambiguously stated. Meanwhile, Yeltsin has demanded the  withdrawal of Serb forces from all Gorazde's territory without  dividing it into right and left banks.    The Russian authorities dedicated the morning of 20 April to  the elaboration of a clear and coordinated position on Bosnia.  According to information from reliable sources on Smolensk  Square, there are serious differences of opinion in the  president's entourage. Not everyone agrees with the Foreign  Ministry's position, which considers further contacts with the  Bosnian Serb leadership pointless.    It is understood that it was largely due to the efforts of  the "pro-Serb lobby" that the original text of Yeltsin's  statement, prepared by the Foreign Ministry and couched in  extremely harsh tones, was ultimately changed. The reference to  aggression and genocide by the Serbs disappeared, as did the  assertion that "compulsion to peace" (for which read: military  measures) is the only way of rectfiying the situation. Even in  its final form, however, the document leaves no doubt about the  direction in which the Russian approach is evolving.    Even the State Duma, which is well known for its virtually  unconditional support for the Serbs, showed restraint this time  and did not adopt a resolution on the results of the morning  session dedicated to the situation in the Balkans. In order to  clarify the situation it was decided to send a delegation to  Belgrade consisting of the leaders of various parliamentary  factions.    The announcement of the recall of the Russian ambassador in  Belgrade for consultations, which appeared in the press, has not  been confirmed. "No decision has been made on that score," a  high-ranking Russian diplomat said. And he added, highly  significantly: "Yet."    The Foreign Ministry pins the main hopes for a way out of  the  Bosnian deadlock on the holding of the summit meeting proposed  by Yeltsin. "The permanent members of the UN Security Council  must present a united front," Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's  political adviser, believes. "It is necessary to elaborate a  joint position and implement it resolutely. It is time to  review the concept of `special interests' and `special  influence,' in Russia's case on the Serbs, in the U.S. case on  the Muslims,, in Germany's case on the Croats, and so on.... As  practice has shown, each of the warring sides has tried to prove  to its theoretical allies that it is right and enlist their full  support. As a result, differences of opinion have surfaced  between the great powers, the united front was splitting up, but  meanwhile the war went on."</p>

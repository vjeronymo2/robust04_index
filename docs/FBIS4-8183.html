			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- I have to say that NATO  bombarded the center of Gorazde, its Muslim part, with horrible  consequences -- a large number of people were killed in this  attack, Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic said this  morning following his talks with Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin.    I am going to visit Gorazde to find out as to how we can  help  the Muslim civilians in a most effective way since NATO is  bombing both sides, Karadzic said as he was setting off for  Gorazde.    The president of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  met Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy minister for foreign  affairs late last night following the latter's visit to the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command in Sarajevo. The talks  continued this morning, although no major success has been  achieved.    Churkin's idea was to organize a meeting of Karadzic,  Yasushi  Akashi, and Charles Redman, the U.S. President's special envoy  for the former Yugoslavia, but this initiative was met with no  enthusiasm on the part of the leadership of the Srpska republic,  TANJUG has learned from reliable sources.    The question of what to discuss, and how, with those  officials who had taken an active part in taking the decision to  bomb Serb territories remains the main obstacle.</p>

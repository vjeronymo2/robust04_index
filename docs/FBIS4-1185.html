			<p>BFN     [Text] Taxi commuters in Germiston are still shaken after a  massive bomb went off at a taxi rank this morning. Ken Daniels  went to the scene. He spoke to Manana Makanya:    [Begin recording] [Daniels] The scene around the area is  totally devastated. There's wreckages of minibus taxis, there  are bits of bodies lying about, some bits of bodies have been  thrown as far as a 100 meters from the scene, and windows are  broken for several blocks around the area.    [Makanya] Do you have any idea how many people have been  killed?    [Daniels] Well, the police said at this stage two have been  confirmed, and 30 people injured, but just as we were leaving  the scene a few minutes ago they said that another body had been  found, so the death toll is three, but it could even be more by  the time the morning's over because several people have been  very badly injured.    [Makanya] Any clues yet about the kind of explosive used?    [Daniels] No the police don't know yet. The bomb disposal  people are still going through the area. It's being cordoned  off, we haven't been allowed to the area where the bomb blast  took place, in case there is another bomb there, so they're  looking through it, and the explosive experts are trying to  establish exactly what the cause of the explosion was.

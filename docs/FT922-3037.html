			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: A scary ride for the high rollers - Wall Street MANY US investors were left with a rather queasy feeling as the equity markets closed yesterday, the result of a roller-coaster ride of Coney Island dimensions. The swings in the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which lost a fulsome 61 points between Tuesday and Wednesday before beginning to regain lost ground on Thursday - says a great deal about the jittery nature of market sentiment these days. The uncertainty stems from a raft of conflicting data on the patchy US economic recovery, puzzlement about the US presidential sweepstakes and a gradual realisation that parts of the market may be dangerously overvalued. Some encouragement for buyers came from the release of seasonally adjusted consumer price figures yesterday morning. These showed a less-than-expected 0.1 per cent rise for May. The figures imply an average annual inflation rate of just 1.7 per cent, well below the 3 per cent average annual rise in the consumer price index since the start of calendar 1992. James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, called the inflation figure 'a fairly decent number' while other analysts noted that the market could now be priming itself for more attempts at a rally. 'Investors are still jittery about the strength of the economy and of corporate profits, and the Fed is showing no inclination to lower interest rates further,' Solloway said, adding there was thus little to power the market on a sustained basis. The May inflation number will not, on its own, persuade the Federal Reserve to abandon its wait-and-see stance toward a cut in interest rates. But it should help to improve prospects for a Fed easing, possibly in the next four to six weeks. Until this week's Dow Jones index gyrations, the New York equity market had moved relatively little over the previous three weeks. Investors had been - and remain - both nervous and confused about the near-term trend in prices. The problem is that recent economic data have suggested the US recovery is continuing, but very slowly. The underlying market sentiment is therefore quite negative and as the market lacks any fundamental support it has become susceptible to the kind of sudden sell-offs that occurred in the middle of this week. Add to this equation a Dow Jones Industrial Average of nearly 3,400 and it is not hard to see why the market looks even more overvalued than it did during the exaggerated bull run at the start of this year. The issue investors should be considering is whether all of this points to mere corrections in prices, downward blips of 20 to 40 points or the risk of a more substantial and damaging sell-off. An example of this fragile market psychology came on Wednesday, a day after the Dow Jones index had dropped more than 34 points. The announcement late on Tuesday of a 6.3 per cent decline in consumer borrowing in April unsettled traders and investors; this was, after all, the largest monthly drop in more than a decade. Since a lack of consumer confidence threatens the US recovery, so does the indication that consumers are still trying to reduce their personal debt burdens. The increasingly surreal nature of the 1992 presidential campaign only adds to market unease. President George Bush, warts and all, may still be the candidate of choice for many Wall Street investors. But he seems to stumble on a nearly daily basis. Ross Perot, no matter how adept he has shown himself to be in using tabloid television chat shows, is so far a demagogue with few detailed policy positions. The equity market hates uncertainty, has no idea what Perot might really do on the economic front and has been confronted this week by the spectacle of grown men in Washington engaging in supposedly high-minded debate about whether a constitutional amendment is needed to balance the budget. The result of this cloudy outlook can be read in the index tables. Three weeks ago the Dow Jones index stood at 3,386.77. By June 5 the index had risen to 3,398.69. At its low point this week - on Wednesday  - the index was down to 3,343.22. And at lunch-time yesterday, grasping at the inflation numbers for reassurance, the index had recovered to a level of 3,372. A more realistic level for the index might be back in the 3,200 to 3,250 range. But that implies a fairly substantial drop - of more than 100 points. It could yet happen.  ---------------------------------- Monday       3404.13  +  5.44 Tuesday      3369.92  -  34.21 Wednesday    3343.22  -  26.70 Thursday     3351.51  +  26.70 Friday       3354.36  +  2.85  ----------------------------------</p>

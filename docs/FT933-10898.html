			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Seguin poised to be political winner IF THERE is one Frenchman who might stand to gain politically from a change in the franc fort policy it is Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president who has made no secret of his desire to see France unhook its currency from the D-Mark and reflate its economy with lower interest rates. If such a change is forced on France in the near future it could make Mr Seguin a contender for the presidency in 1995, according to Mr Dominique Mosi, deputy director of France's Institute for International Relations. 'Seguin has put his entire weight behind France devaluing the franc and following a British-style economic policy,' he says. The leading Gaullist opponent of the Maastricht treaty in last September's referendum campaign, Mr Seguin got his present job, in which he presides over parliament but does not lead its conservative majority, because the Balladur government wanted to park him in a largely honorary post. But outside parliament Mr Seguin has refused to let his views be sidelined. He has hammered away at the need for government to worry less about its budget deficit and more about unemployment, while attacking Gatt and calling for more trade protection. He has recently soft-pedalled his views on European monetary matters, but these have not changed markedly since his call last December for France to 'cut the franc's link with the D-Mark - and quick'. When Gaullist ministers called last week for 'unity behind the franc,' their clear target was Mr Seguin. But it is significant that Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullists' leader and still the party's most likely presidential contender, has been laconic in his comments on the franc, aware that monetary events may be moving in Mr Seguin's favour.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Corp. agreed on 12  May to investigate forming a corporation to begin production of  auto parts such as engines in China in a joint venture with a  corporate group from Malaysia. President Hirokazu Nakamura of  Mitsubishi Motors, Vice President Naoyasu Kuroki of Mitsubishi  Corp., and Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia signed a  memorandum in Beijing on the same day. Mitsubishi Motors has not  had a production base for finished cars in China, but hopes to  secure a base for the future production of passenger cars by  taking the form of a trinational joint venture with Malaysia,  which has deep connections with the Chinese government.    China is adding the obligation to have the local parts  procurement rate over 40 percent when foreign affiliated firms  enter passenger car production as a pillar of their new auto  policy beginning in 1996. For this reason, "Proton," the  joint-venture passenger car production company between  Mitsubishi Motors and Malaysia made a proposal to the Chinese  Government of market entry after local production of parts. The  joint-venture parts plant will study export of parts to Malaysia  also along with supply of auto parts in China. The location of  the plant and production scale await conclusion of the  investigation on forming a corporation and will be decided  within the year. Joint-venture production by Japanese and Asian  firms in China is an exceptional case.    According to a Chinese Government source, there also is a  proposal to build a joint-venture auto plant in Huizhou and to  produce small passenger cars with a displacement of 1500 cc.    Among Japanese auto makers, Suzuki has joint venture  production of light autos in China, but Mitsubishi Motors will  be the first major finished car maker to embark on joint-venture  production of auto parts.</p>

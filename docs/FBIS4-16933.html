			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F> 94]    [Text] Experts with the Economics Agency under the Cabinet  of Ministers of Ukraine compiled a composite report about  Ukraine's economic performance in the first quarter of 1994.    According to it, national income dropped by 36 per cent  versus the January-March period of 1993. While January's  production drop versus January 1993 was by 32.7 per cent, it  amounted to 35.7 per cent during the January-February period and  rose to 38.4 per cent for the entire first quarter.    The consolidated budget's revenues amounted to 35 trillion  krb. in the January-February period (i.e. only 8.4. per cent  of the approved budget's figure). The consolidated budget's  expenditures exceeded 40 trillion krb. [karbovanets] with  welfare having consumed 6.6 trillion krb. (16.4 per cent of  total expenditures), financing the societal-cultural sector  having accounted for 9.8 trillion krb. (24.4 per cent), and the  national economy, having attracted 18.38 per cent of total  financing.    Besides, 6.5 trillion krb. credits by NBU [National Bank of  Ukraine] and other banks were drawn to offset the budget's  deficit and cover some other outlays.    Reduced production resulted in budgetary revenues' losses  through underpaid VAT to the tune of 2.8 trillion krb. and  excise to the tune of 1.8 trillion krb. Ukraine's payment  crisis led to underpaid taxes, which reduced by 4.4 times, and  the aggregate loss reached 1.5 trillion krb. as of 1 March.    The first quarter's subsidies to the tune of 6 trillion krb.  were involved in the state's price regulation and channeled to  the population's social of protection (foods, medicines, solid  fuels, livestock, milk, housing, public amenities), to the tune  of 2.7 trillion krb. and to offset the coal price difference to  the tune of 3.3 trillion krb.    The aggregate amount of credit investments (credit  indebtedness) of Ukraine's banks in economy amounted to 70.7  trillion krb., as of 1 March, including NBU's 22.5 trillion krb.  credits, commercial banks' 48.2 trillion krb. credits and the  former Union nations' bank affiliates' 98 billion krb. credits.    The average weighted rate for commercial bank credits  amounted to 385 per cent versus January's 310 per cent. It  varied from the maximal value of 900 per cent to the minimal 1  per cent rate.    The debit-credit indebtedness of Ukraine's enterprises and  organisations continued to accumulate. Credit indebtedness grew  by 35.3 per cent during January and February to amount to 172.3  trillion krb. in early March. Debit indebtedness grew by 32  per cent and equalled 131.5 trillion krb. The share of  unprofitable enterprises in Ukraine's national economy grew from  16 per cent in 1993's first quarter to 24.1 per cent in the  January-February period of 1994.    Ukraine's coal-mining industry extracted 27.7 million tons  of  coal, or by 16.1 per cent less than in the January-March period  of 1993. A third of engineering enterprises had to shift to a  reduced work-week. The Luganskteplovoz production association  was idling for almost two month, though it is Ukraine's sole  enterprise, which manufactures diesel locomotives. While it  manufactured as many as 63 diesel locomotives in the  January-March of 1993 period, this year it produced only five of  these. The underlying reason is loss of former markets, as  Russia used to be the Ukrainian manufacturers' major customer.    Ukraine's collective and state farms have embarked on spring  crop sowing. 936,000 ha of perished winter crop areas have been  resown with spring crops out of 2 million ha.    Ukraine's foreign trade turn-over with the "near abroad"  (that is former Union) nations amounted to 50.2 trillion krb.  in the 1st quarter of 1994 including 27 trillion krb. exports  and 23.2 trillion krb. imports. Foreign trade turn-over with  "far abroad" nations totalled 1,214 million USD including 726  million USD exports and 488 million USD imports. Ukraine's  favorable balance thus amounted to 238 million USD.    Ukraine's metallurgical engineering somewhat improved its  performance in March. Averaged daily manufacture of ready  rolled metal and steel piping increased by respectively 2.8 per  cent and 2.3 per cent versus February and by 7.3 pr cent and  23.4 per cent versus January. However, their production fell  short of the target plan figures by 2.9 million tons of rolled  metal and 750,000 tons of steel piping.    Fuel and raw material shortages remained chronic. Gas  supplies to metallurgical works amounted to 72 per cent of what  was supplied to them in the January-March period of 1993.  Similarly, supplies of scrap, metallurgical coal and electric  power were respectively at 56 per cent, 78 per cent and 72 per  cent marks versus 1993's first quarter. Ukraine's coal miners  supplied metallurgical coal in amounts, which were by 350,000  tons less than what the plan provided for. Ukraine's coal  imports amounted to about 200,000 tons, or about a tenth of  Ukraine's demand. Undersupplies of scrap amounted to 620,000  tons, which resulted in eleven blast-furnaces (20 per cent of  the total amount) and 23 Siemens-Martin open-hearth furnaces (30  per cent of the total) idling in March.    The averaged monthly wages of workers engaged in the  state-owned sector of Ukraine's national economy amounted to  760,100 krb. in February. Workers engaged in housing,  household services, public amenities, public catering,  agriculture, social welfare, education and culture, were among  the lowest-paid bracket with wages and salaries ranging from  380,900 to 451,000 karbovanets per month.    As of late February, the number of jobless persons  registered  by the employment service amounted to 138,000. 93,100 persons  were granted the unemployed status, which was 0.4 per cent of  the economically active and able-bodied population. The state's  relief per unemployed individual amounted to 147,800 krb. in  February.

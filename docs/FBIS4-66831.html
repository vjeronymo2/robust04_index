			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Catherine Simon: "Deceptive Calm of Spring in </F> Algeria"; first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction]    [Text] The murder of two French religious in Algiers  seems to have brought a brief and artificial period of euphoria  to an end.    Algiers--The emotion aroused by the murder of two French  religious--killed in the Casbah district on Sunday 8 May--should  induce foreigners "whose presence in Algeria is not essential,"  as the diplomats put it, to leave the country as quickly as  possible. The face of the capital has not changed, however. For  the past three weeks, blood and sun have been coexisting,  tragedy rubbing shoulders with ordinary routine at intervals of  only a few hours or a few kilometers.    While death was doing its work in an alley in old Algiers on  Sunday, life was in full swing in the port district, which was  full of kids, sunlight, and heat. On flowery hillsides and along  the highways, families were picnicking on the grass and old  people were taking siestas without a glance at the young people  flirting not far away.    Around Ain Benian west of the capital, the seedy bars in  Madrague were crowded again. The mountains of grilled red mullet  and swordfish on paper tablecloths were being washed down with  rose wine. The nearby beach at Club des Pins was also swarming  with girls and boys together.    Although the good weather has a lot to do with that  springtime exuberance, the security forces have also done their  part. The particularly "hot" Islamist fiefs in the Mitidja  region--Lakhdaria, Medea, Blida, and Dellys--received a forceful  visit from elite units in March and April. Thanks to often  ferocious repression, a semblance of calm was restored. Several  guerrilla chiefs were reportedly killed and their gangs  dismantled.    It is true that many questions remain. The insidious warfare  between armed Islamist groups and the police remains invisible  to ordinary observers. Journalists and diplomats alike generally  have no choice but to feel their way in the fog of official  communiques, anonymous tracts, personal accounts, and rumors.  But the recent "clean-up" operations by the Army have apparently  had noticeable results not only in the capital but throughout  the Algiers region. In Blida and Medea, not a few women who were  still subject to fundamentalist edicts just recently have now  decided to put away their "hijab" (veils).    How long will the calm last? No one knows. "That is why we  must make the most of it: if we're going to die tomorrow anyway,  we may as well breathe today," said one Algiers woman with a  brave smile. And with the sun as encouragement, foreigners would  almost be doing the same. Since the murder of an employee of the  Russian Embassy in Algiers on 28 March, none of them had felt  the terrorist wrath. Even the death threats were becoming less  frequent. That happy period was to be of short duration.  Suddenly brought back down to earth by the murder of Sister  Helene Saint Raymond and Brother Henri Verges, foreign  nationals, especially the French, are again on the alert.    The first wave of departures took place last November  following the kidnapping of three employees of the French  General Consulate in Algiers. The All Saints holiday had  provided a good pretext to avoid calling that hasty exodus a  "repatriation." The Christmas holidays, preceded by a stream of  murderous attacks on foreigners, gave the signal for a second  wave of departures.    As an indication of that mass exodus, the 1,400 students  enrolled in French-language schools last September are now down  to a little less than 300 at the Algiers lycee, the other  schools having closed their doors in April. For security  reasons, the six French cultural centers (in Algiers, Oran,  Annaba, Constantine, Tlemcen, and Tizi-Ouzou) have done the  same. Their activities have been "suspended" for several weeks  now.    The political uncertainties weighing on Algeria's future  have  hardly any chance of reversing that situation. The march by the  "reconcilers," which was supposed to rally all the  fundamentalist groups, attracted only a few participants. The  FLN [National Liberation Front] and the moderate fundamentalists  in Hamas [Islamic Society Movement] and Ennahdha were not really  able to mobilize anyone besides their own troops. Those who were  predicting participation by the former Islamic Salvation Front  (FIS) were wasting their breath.    The murder of the two French religious, having been  perpetrated less than two hours after the demonstration ended,  seems to indicate that the terrorist groups, being hostile to  all dialogue, are disinclined to drop their guard. Speaking  through Rabah Kebir, president of its executive body abroad, the  FIS "condemned with the greatest firmness" that double murder,  calling it "contrary to Islamic teaching," while Henri Tessier,  archbishop of Algiers, stated that despite that "absurd crime,"  "it was more essential than ever to increase the number of  places where Christians and Muslims cooperate in getting to know  and respect each other."    Are the sorcerer's apprentices to be found exclusively in  the  Islamist nebula? Common sense would say so. But common sense is  not exactly one of the most widely distributed virtues in this  bruised country, where the vehemence of passions and the  parochial spirit--or perhaps we should say the spirit of the  minaret--all too often take the place of a political program.</p>

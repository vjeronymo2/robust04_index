			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASUALTIES OF WAR;  </P> <P> GANG MEMBERS HERE FOLLOW THE SAME CODE AS GANG MEMBERS ALL OVER, AND OFTEN DIE  IN THE SAME WAY TOO.  </P> <P> Shadow and Peewee were just two of the largely unknown 8,000 gang members who  ply their trade on the Westside of Los Angeles defending their turf, their  honor and, mostly, themselves.  </P> <P> But in one night, at a festival in Culver City this summer, they went from  quiet anonymity to gang immortality. All it took was an unexpected run-in with  a rival gang armed with knives, a 2-by-4 and a longstanding vendetta.  </P> <P> To their own gang, they are heroes, remembered in "rest in peace" writings  alongside their gang's graffiti. To the detectives, they are two of the 13  gang-related homicides that have occurred in the Westside so far this year, and  are remembered through grisly police photos as casualties of war.  </P> <P> The only difference between their deaths and most of the nearly 500  gang-related killings that police estimate will occur in Los Angeles County  this year is the location. Although the Westside is known for its exclusive  neighborhoods, upscale shops and general excesses, it is not known for its  gangs. But as Shadow and Peewee's "homeboys" can attest, Westside gangs are  very real. Their members live by the same code as gang members in the Eastside  or South-Central Los Angeles, and often die in the same brutal fashion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vast Scale of Problem  </P> <P> The murders of Shadow and Peewee, known to their families as Eric Aquino, 19,  and Mario Isaac, 17, as well as a recent highly publicized gang killing in  Pacific Palisades, point out the vast scale of the county's gang problem.  Although Westside gangs constitute just a small portion of the county's gang  population, with less than 15% of the estimated 70,000 gang members and their  associates, they contribute to the same growth industry. Police investigators  estimate that the number of gang members has tripled in the area in the last  decade. In the last year alone, they say, gang-related crimes are up 37%.  </P> <P> Police and gang experts are quick to add, however, that the Westside is  probably as safe as any area in Los Angeles County, with only a tiny portion of  the gang members truly hard-core criminals. But they admit that gang activity  is creeping into million-dollar neighborhoods along the beach and in the  hillsides.  </P> <P> Some of the Westside gangs are among the oldest in the county, dating back  close to 40 years. But as is the case with gangs everywhere, things are  different today. Gangs are more violent, they are more transient and they are  less focused on turf than they are on drugs and money.  </P> <P> Although the Westside gangs continue to thrive in the pockets of poverty that  often border streets of great affluence, police say the things that attract  home buyers and tourists to the Westside -- the beach, the weather, the public  parks -- are the same things that attract gang members, increasing the  potential for trouble.  </P> <P> A weekend stroll at the beach is all that is needed to confirm it. Roving gangs  from Venice, Santa Monica and West Los Angeles, most in their middle to late  teens, can usually be found strutting their stuff on the boardwalk, "dressed  down" in their club colors, the blue and white of the Venice Shoreline Crips or  the black and white of the Little Locos. But the gangs also come from Compton,  Pomona, Inglewood and Lennox, causing enough concern that gang patrols have  been beefed up along the beach recently.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still 'Pretty Safe'  </P> <P> "Overall, the Westside is still a pretty safe place, as safe as any," said Sgt.  Al Thatcher, of member of the West Los Angeles Police bureau's anti-gang unit,  Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH). "But there are certain  areas here that are as dangerous as any in South-Central L.A."  </P> <P> Westside gang investigators insist that the gang activity is limited almost  exclusively to poorer areas, noting that Bel-Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills,  Malibu and other exclusive communities are virtually untouched by gangs. But  affluent areas such as Pacific Palisades, which were little affected by gangs  until recently, are now occasionally the site of isolated gang battles, such as  the ones that led to the recent murder of Efigenio Vital on July 29 and the  slaying in Westwood Village of an innocent bystander, 27-year-old Karen  Toshima, last year.  </P> <P> Gary Fowler, a Del Amo Hospital drug counselor who lives in Pacific Palisades,  says the Santa Ynez Canyon Trail, part of the state park system near Palisades  Highlands, has become a popular hangout for numerous Westside gangs.  </P> <P> The hiking trail is filled with gang graffiti, and a main hangout for the gangs  is located just a few hundred yards from a private colony of  multimillion-dollar homes in the Highlands where such celebrities as Chevy  Chase live.  </P> <P> "I tell people up there that there are armed gangs hanging out there, drinking  and doing drugs, and they look at me as if I'm crazy," Fowler said. "They say  things like, 'in the Palisades?' But all you have to do is go there at night or  look at the graffiti. The entire trail is turfed out."  </P> <P> Police say they are not surprised. Sometimes, they say, it seems as if the  gangs are everywhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trying to Plug Dam  </P> <P> "We've just got our finger in an overflowing dam right now," said CRASH Sgt.  Wayne DeBord. "And all we can do is to keep trying to plug it."  </P> <P> On a recent night, there was barely a trickle, and that made the 12 officers in  the six CRASH patrol cars cruising Oakwood extremely anxious. If the gangs  weren't at their regular hangouts, where were they?  </P> <P> Oakwood is the historically poor and notoriously crime-ridden section of  Venice, about 15 blocks in area, that police say is the site of some of the  most conspicuous drug-dealing and drive-by shootings in all of the Westside.  </P> <P> A surprise sweep of an apartment building at 5th and Broadway that afternoon  had resulted in five arrests in five minutes, with police confiscating 20  "rocks" of cocaine and nearly $900 in cash from the suspected street dealers.  </P> <P> But an early evening return produced only a few more arrests, including a  surprise bust of four junkies for stealing a car.  </P> <P> As two CRASH officers held guns over the junkies, two young men watched from a  neighboring porch, drinking beer and watching the street scene unfold. It  turned out to be a bad view: One of the CRASH officers went over and grabbed  the two young men.  </P> <P> "When did you get out of prison?" the police officer asked.  </P> <P> "Couple weeks ago,," the man replied, his speech slurred. His partner remained  silent. The officer put them up against a fence and patted them down for  weapons. "Aw, man, I wasn't doing nothing. I don't do no (gang)banging here any  more."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numerous Tattoos  </P> <P> The officer raised the man's shirt, revealing numerous tattoos, including a  woman's name and figure, a skull and the logo of the Venice 13 gang. The other  man had a similar tattoo scrawled across his stomach.  </P> <P> "You know you shouldn't be hanging out here," the cop said. "You're just  looking for trouble."  </P> <P> The two men were handcuffed and arrested for a parole violation: hanging out  with known gang members. It is done without protest and with little fanfare, a  routine for both the gang members and the police. It is likely they will meet  again.  </P> <P> "I know this guy with the tattoos," Thatcher said. "But something must have  happened to his head from the way he was talking. Might have been a bullet or  angel dust (PCP), but he's just not the same."  </P> <P> A few more circles around the neighborhood ended with the units converging on  the Oakwood Recreation Center, where the officers searched for a gang member  who had assaulted a retarded boy who was riding his bike to the beach. They  detained five members of the Venice Shoreline Crips, then released them after a  20-minute interrogation and a warrant check.  </P> <P> "I think we sent everybody underground for the night," Thatcher said.  </P> <P> As have other units of the LAPD throughout the city, the CRASH unit has been  engaging in sweeps of gang territories and arresting hundreds of suspected gang  members. But they are just a small band attacking a monstrous problem, and  police admit that the sweeps do little to combat the underlying social and  economic factors that contribute to the gang proliferation throughout Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gang-Related Homicides Up  </P> <P> Law-enforcement officials estimate that there are at least 15 more gangs  operating in the Westside than there are officers in the CRASH unit, which has  had the same number of officers, 30, that it had when the unit was created in  1981.  </P> <P> Lt. Ron Dina, head of the CRASH unit that covers four LAPD divisions,  Hollywood, Pacific, West Los Angeles and Wilshire, said the 13 gang-related  homicides are up from 12 at the same time last year. There were 21 gang  killings in each of the previous two years, prompting Dina to note that "right  now we're ahead of schedule."  </P> <P> Dina said the jump in the number of crimes reported is due in part to an  increased awareness of the Westside's gang problem and more expertise among  police in dealing with the gang underworld. He said with the exception of  certain areas, such as Oakwood and the Mar Vista Gardens housing project,  residents are cooperating with police in spotting and reporting gang crimes.  </P> <P> "The reason some people are hesitant to report crimes is because of the  potential for retaliation," said Salvatore Grammatico, president of the Del Rey  Homeowners Assn., which represents residents near Mar Vista Gardens. "We've had  more than seven different gangs operating out of Mar Vista Gardens over the  years, but the violence is getting worse because now there's more competition  for the drug sales."  </P> <P> Some nights, neighbors say, the area resembles a scene from "Apocalypse Now,"  with police helicopters swooping over the projects, looking for shooting  suspects and parole violators on the run. But some residents offer another  reason for their reluctance to help police in highly visible drug-dealing areas  like Mar Vista Gardens and Oakwood. They say that the police target everyone --  not just gang members and drug dealers -- in the sweeps, and that law-abiding  citizens are often rounded up with the gangs and the pushers.  </P> <P> "Almost every youth they have out here, they affiliate with being in a gang,"  said Melvyn Hayward, a youth counselor at the Didi Hirsch Community Mental  Health Center in Venice. "The good are just thrown in with the bad. When CRASH  comes out here, they go crazy on everybody.  </P> <P> "The problem is we don't have the type of relationship with the police that we  should have out here. They're not involved in the actions of the community and  they should be. What they really need to do is to (sensitize) the Police  Department. They just get too big a kick out of all of it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Activities Not Separated  </P> <P> Al Ortiz, a Venice drug counselor, agreed. He said any individuals who deal  drugs in Venice are immediately labeled as gang members, which creates more  conflict in the community. Gang investigators say that although many gangs,  particularly Latino gangs, still operate as traditional turf-defending rogues,  most black gangs, such as the Venice Shoreline Crips, focus primarily on drug  sales.  </P> <P> "The police out here believe that if they look like a duck and walk like a  duck, then they must be a duck," Ortiz said. "But they don't separate drug  activity from gang activity, and I believe that an apple is an apple and an  orange is an orange . . . and that you've got to treat them differently."  </P> <P> For their part, members of the CRASH unit say they feel as if they are under  siege. CRASH officers cover a 122-square-mile area that includes numerous gang  hot spots. And they say there have been 10 sniper incidents on police in the  Oakwood area alone in the last year.  </P> <P> "The whole gang thing is out of control," said CRASH Detective Bill Humphry.  "Almost on a nightly basis you hear shots fired."  </P> <P> Over the years, the gang wars have taken a toll. At the CRASH headquarters in  West Los Angeles, a grim photo display of all the gang members killed in the  unit's coverage area during the last nine years hangs on the wall. There are  103 pictures on the wall, and officers are running out of room.  </P> <P> Santa Monica police have a similar board, which, paralleling the city's gang  problem is much smaller in size. Keeping such grim lists helps gang  investigators do their job, for knowing which gang had the last pay-back will  help them figure out which gang is due for the next hit.  </P> <P> But even with the aid of the board, Santa Monica gang investigator Errol  Southers can't remember what the score is.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ill-Prepared for Random Acts  </P> <P> "All I know is that the last person who was killed was on our side," Southers  said. Usually he and his partner know. Southers and Hector Cavazos, are the  only two gang coordinators for the Santa Monica Police Department and they make  it their primary mission to get to know all the gang members in the  eight-square-mile city, usually on a first-name basis.  </P> <P> But as with all gang investigators, they are ill-prepared to deal with the  random acts of violence that are a staple of gang life.  </P> <P> Robert Parga, 17, of Venice was stabbed to death in a midday attack across from  Santa Monica College in April. Police said it was a pay-back for an earlier  attack by Santa Monica gang members on Venice rivals. The attack was  photographed by a passer-by, but rarely do the police receive such compelling  evidence. Usually, they must sort through mounds of information on various  gangs and their members while searching for suspects. They also try to track  release dates for imprisoned gang members.  </P> <P> "Any time we make a stop, we take names, get as much information as we can and  we always seize any gang paraphernalia," Southers said. "If the gang members  want it back, we tell them that they have to come in with their parents so we  can have a talk."  </P> <P> If they decide to return for their belongings, Southers and Cavazos advise the  youths and their parents of the dangers of gang life and strongly urge them  never to don their gang colors again.  </P> <P> "We explain to them that if they want to wear their colors, they might as well  just be wearing a target on their back, because it has the same effect,"  Southers said.  </P> <P> The two officers spend most of their days checking the regular gang hangouts,  talking to gang members and checking the latest changes in gang graffiti, which  serve almost as billboards for a gang's size, movement and attitude toward  rival factions.  </P> <P> Usually, they know the targets. The Santa Monica Gang has been battling the  Venice 13 and a West Los Angeles gang for more than a decade, but deadly  flare-ups during unexpected gang encounters are a staple of the life style.  </P> <P> "The gangs do have their priorities," said Cavazos.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easier Ten Years Ago  </P> <P> Ten years ago, when there were fewer gangs, fewer weapons and defense of  neighborhood turf was the primary mission, it was much easier to know which  gangs were at war.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge John Ouderkirk, who was a Santa Monica patrol  officer in the '70s and later joined the district attorney's Hardcore Gang  Unit, which prosecuted cases involving the most dangerous gang members, said he  can remember when gangs were not even an issue.  </P> <P> "There were always drive-bys and such, but it wasn't that big a deal and it  wasn't nearly as violent," he said. "Back in those days, there was an ongoing  shooting war between the Venice and Culver City gang, but that was primarily  it."  </P> <P> The gangs remain primarily an outlet for bored youth, looking to join with a  group, any group. "These kids are 'wannabes,' like any kids," said Southers,  who, with help from Santa Monica city officials, is attempting to divert some  of the youths from gangs through a series of classes and sports programs  offered by the Police Activities League. "In this day and age, you have to join  something. You're either a gang member, a jock or an outstanding student."  </P> <P> All three of these pursuits offer the prospect of recognition. Jocks and honor  students just rarely have to die for it.  </P> <P> "If you can find a picture of Shadow and Peewee together, it's like having an  original Babe Ruth baseball card," Southers said.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tribune cuts deficit to IPounds 463,000 Tribune Newspapers, the Dublin-based printing and publishing group, returned to profit at the operating level in the year to June 30. Operating profit amounted to IPounds 56,000 (Pounds 54,085), including a contribution of IPounds 12,000 from Tribune Publications. Charges of IPounds 519,000 (IPounds 259,000) emanating from the group's substantial debt burden, however, resulted in a reduced pre-tax deficit of IPounds 463,000 (IPounds 1.15m). Taking in IPounds 526,000 from the acquisition, turnover was ahead at IPounds 6.43m (IPounds 6.29m). Losses per share narrowed from 43.84p to 16.2p.</p>

Brazil first established diplomatic relations with the  Kingdom of Cambodia in 1961, establishing representation in  Phnom Penh concurrent with the Brazilian Embassy in New Delhi,  India. Afterward that representation became concurrent with the  Brazilian Embassy in Bangkok. According to the Brazilian  Foreign Ministry, the representation in Phnom Penh was closed  down in 1966, but not because relations had been broken between  the two countries. Following the internal pacification of  Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which  was endorsed by Brazilian diplomacy, the Brazilian Government  suggested the normalization of bilateral relations, which was  confirmed on 25 March with the joint communique. Brazil will  open an embassy in Phnom Penh concurrent with the embassy in  Bangkok.</p>

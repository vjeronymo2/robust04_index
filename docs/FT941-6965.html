			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: The lunch-box revival Nathalie Hambro felt it was time to revive the old-fashioned lunch-box, the western answer, if you like, to the Indian tiffin box. Instead of wasteful cling-film and polystyrene unattractively cluttering up the desk, she thinks it would be more elegant to use a sleek container which could be used time and time again with pleasure. She therefore designed this understated box, made from silver-glow finished steel. It would be perfect for conveying a bruschetta or grilled zucchini to your office-desk. Not that it is only a lunch-box. She, for instance, uses it to convey all her daily needs (you and I might call it a hand-bag but Nathalie is not fond of the term). It is stocked by discerning shops such as David Mellor, No 4 Sloane Square, London SW1, Jerry's Home Store, 163-167 Fulham Road, London SW3 and Liberty of Regent Street, London W1. The price is about Pounds 11.50.</p>

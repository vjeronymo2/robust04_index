			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): The good times roll on - The economic slowdown has helped create favourable conditions for international capital markets by encouraging governments to lower interest rates. But the main worry is what will happen when the market turns round FINANCIAL institutions active in the international capital markets have never had it so good. The fixed income businesses of many banks and securities houses reported record first-half profits, and are on course to post record gains for the full year. The bull run in the world's bond markets has persisted beyond everyone's expectations and financial markets have remained sufficiently volatile, thanks in large part to continued machinations over the exchange rate mechanism, to fuel derivatives business. The economic slowdown has helped create favourable market conditions by encouraging governments to lower interest rates. At the same time, governments have needed to borrow more money to bridge their widening deficits, ensuring lucrative underwriting business for financial institutions. Underwriting revenues have also been boosted by a spate of refinancings by companies keen to lock in the lower interest rates that have become available. As a result, in the US and Eurobond markets, new issue volume in the first nine months of the year has already exceeded last year's total. In the Eurobond market, more than Dollars 300bn of debt was issued in the first nine months of the year, compared with Dollars 269bn last year, according to IFR Securities Data. (These figures include an increasing number of global bond offerings.) In the US corporate bond market, the nine-month total is Dollars 330bn, compared with Dollars 302bn last year. It would be hard to paint a rosier picture for investment bankers. But there is one worry: what happens when the market turns round? The industry is notoriously cyclical, and there are fears that on the other side of the coin is a particularly prolonged bear market. As a result, there have been efforts by the firms involved in the market to build up more consistent revenue-earners such as asset management. Still, there could be difficult times ahead. The capital markets are already highly competitive. The new opportunities offered by the growth of derivative markets requires substantial investment in technology and manpower. The business requires a strong capital base at a time when capital is in short supply. A turnaround in the bull market could cause a shake-out of smaller players, which have been sustained by easy trading profits during the good times. As is the case with a growing number of industries, it is increasingly necessary to have a global strategy to compete at the top level in the 1990s. A chasm is opening up between banks and securities houses with a global reach and those which are effectively niche players, based in their own domestic market, even though they may have operations overseas, or with a single area of specialisation. In the international capital markets, the large US houses have become increasingly dominant. At the heart of their success has been their ability to keep up with the rapid pace of development. The Japanese have lost ground since the 1980s, distracted by problems in their domestic market. The weakness of the Japanese stock market also undermined their profitable business in Japanese equity-linked bonds, which had provided the securities houses with a base from which to launch other businesses. Among European houses, the big three Swiss banks have shown themselves to be among the most internationally minded participants, and a few other European powerhouses, such as Deutsche Bank, have also made a strong showing in the Eurobond market. But European financial institutions have had little success in the highly competitive US market, and a relatively small number have made inroads into the Japanese market. The need for a strong derivatives capacity to establish a leading position in the international capital markets is becoming widely recognised as the most important trend of the decade. In stock and bond markets, prices are frequently driven by futures trading rather than by dealing in the cash market. If financial institutions are to make markets and trade effectively on their own accounts, they must have command of the futures markets. Most have already reached this level of sophistication, as futures exchanges have been on the scene, and growing in importance, for the past 20 years. A more difficult market to enter is the highly complex and innovative over-the-counter market in swaps and options. These products now represent a vital service to clients, and can be highly profitable. However, they not only require a high degree of expertise in design and execution, they also create new risk management problems for the financial institution concerned. The rapid growth of the market in the past five years  -the notional amount outstanding in the market has reached Dollars 4,600bn, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association - has created concern among regulators about the potential for systemic risk to the banking system. The more immediate worry for some financial institutions is that they may have left it rather late to enter the market. These days it is hard to find any financial institution with international ambitions which does not claim to have embraced derivatives. Yet, in practice the market is dominated by relatively few participants. In the battle to reach the top tier, banks and securities houses rated less than double-A are at a competitive disadvantage, since some counterparties refuse to deal with them. In an effort to regain this ground, several institutions, led by Merrill Lynch, have set up separately capitalised derivatives units, with double-A or triple-A ratings. The most recent addition to the field is Goldman Sachs, which set up a joint venture with Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance earlier this month. 'The world may be moving so that we need this to stay competitive,' said Mr Jacob Goldfield, a Goldman partner and president of the joint venture. More financial institutions are expected to follow suit, though some have decided to focus on improving their own credit ratings instead. While the steady decline in interest rates worldwide has favoured companies and financial intermediaries, it has left investors hungry for yield, and has created a strong impetus for investors to diversify their asset base. In particular, US investment institutions, which have tended in the past to concentrate on the wide range of domestic instruments available, have become much more adventurous. According to research by management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, large US institutional investors have increased their appetite for non-dollar products by a factor of three in the past five years. The appetite for yield has created strong demand for emerging market debt, a category which covers the domestic bond markets of emerging countries and bond offerings by borrowers from these countries in the Eurobond or other foreign bond markets, such as the Yankee bond market. Such borrowers generally pay a high premium, and also offer investors the possibility of capital gains, since these borrowers are often perceived as improving credits, so that spreads tighten, or yields fall, over time. A similar phenomenon has occurred in the stock markets. While economic growth in OECD countries has been sluggish, economic expansion has been maintained in the emerging markets, which consequently offer potentially higher gains. Again, there has been a surge of investment in domestic stock markets and in offerings by emerging market companies in the international market. One area of keen interest is the developing economies of Asia, where stock markets in Thailand and Hong Kong have been the star performers this year. The strong economic growth in the region has also led to a rapid increase in the amount of funds under management in the region, as well as in the need for financing among expanding companies. This has led to the creation of the Dragon bond market, or regional Asian bond market, to provide a local capital market for Asian borrowers and investors. Although it is not yet clear whether the concept will take off, many international banks and securities houses have already built up their trading and sales forces in Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree in Singapore. Some have transferred certain activities from Tokyo, which remains a very expensive business centre, to Hong Kong. Even if Asia does not become a 'fourth time zone', its financial markets are set to become increasingly important in the next few years, particularly given the expected opening of China to foreign investment. While a turnaround in the bull run for bond markets could prove a setback, there are a number of areas of expansion which will help fill the void. As well as the continuing growth of the derivatives market and the emerging markets, a turnaround in the bond market prompted by stronger economic growth could also spell good news for equity markets.</p>

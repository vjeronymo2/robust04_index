			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS SHIFT TOWARD HIGH-PROFILE ROLE AS PEACEMAKER IN LATIN AMERICA;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE KREMLIN IS TIRED OF PROPPING UP LEFTIST NICARAGUA AND WANTS  BETTER RELATIONS WITH NATIONS IN THE REGION.  </P> <P> After helping persuade the U.S. Congress to stop arming the Contras and "give  peace a chance," President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica penned an  audacious proposal to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev early last year.  </P> <P> "I pointed out to him that if he did not do what the Congress had done and stop  sending weapons to Central America, he would be responsible for many years of  sterile warfare," the Nobel Peace Prize winner said at the time.  </P> <P> What he got was a disheartening rebuff. It came not from Gorbachev but from the  Soviet ambassador. It said Moscow could not stop aiding Nicaragua's Sandinista  army unless Washington withheld military aid from El Salvador, Guatemala and  Honduras. It denied that the Soviet Union supports leftist guerrillas fighting  those U.S.-backed governments. The letter was "full of cynicism," Arias said.  </P> <P> But today, after years of discreet involvement as an arms supplier to  revolutionary forces in the region, the Soviet Union is shifting to a  high-profile role as Central American peace broker. While moving unilaterally  to stem the flow of East Bloc weapons, it has offered to help the United States  design and supervise a regional treaty reducing weapons stockpiles and national  armies.  </P> <P> Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze unveiled the initiative here earlier  this month as the highest Soviet official ever to visit Central America. He  proposed a withdrawal of all foreign military bases and advisers from the  region, offered to mediate between the Salvadoran government and guerrillas and  said Moscow wants diplomatic relations with all countries in the region.  </P> <P> Behind Moscow's peace offensive is a mix of motives: a weariness at home with  the growing economic burden of propping up Nicaragua, a desire for superpower  collaboration on more important matters and a reluctance to abandon its  Sandinista allies altogether.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, having appealed for Soviet cooperation in pacifying  Central America, now finds itself cautioning that Moscow might be seeking too  active a role in the traditionally American-dominated region.  </P> <P> "We do not believe it is a serious basis for negotiation to assert that the  Soviet Union and the United States have equivalent security interests in  Central America," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.  </P> <P> But officials in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras, while not disputing  Washington on that point, have welcomed Shevardnadze's initiative as a belated  acknowledgment of Kremlin responsibility for what they view, in part, as an  East-West conflict.  </P> <P> Addressing the U.N. General Assembly during Shevardnadze's visit here, Arias  hailed Moscow's embrace of the Central American peace agreement that he forged  two years ago. The five-nation accord calls for internal democratic reforms and  a halt to outside military aid.  </P> <P> Until the Sandinista takeover here a decade ago, the Soviet Union had minimal  interest in Central America. After the Sandinistas first came under attack by  the U.S.-backed Contras in 1981, the Soviets became Managua's main benefactor,  providing up to $1 billion in military and economic assistance a year.  </P> <P> The 70,000-member Sandinista People's Army, the largest in the region, came to  be feared by its neighbors as a Soviet-made monster and widely suspected of  funneling arms to the Salvadoran guerrillas.  </P> <P> But now the Sandinista revolution's ideological value has diminished under  Gorbachev's "new thinking," which is reorienting Soviet foreign policy toward  economic priorities.  </P> <P> Still, not until the Contras collapsed as a military threat late last year, and  the Sandinistas felt secure, did Soviet policy begin to shift.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, more than Arias, has extracted Soviet concessions by  putting settlement of regional conflicts high on the superpower agenda. Early  this year, the Kremlin stopped shipping arms to Nicaragua, but the gesture was  undermined by a stepped-up flow of light weapons from Cuba and Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> In Wyoming last month, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told  Shevardnadze that Moscow should persuade its allies to cut off such weapons and  move to stop arms traffic to the Salvadoran rebels.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze came here primarily to engineer a suspension of all arms  deliveries to Nicaragua, according to two diplomats who were briefed by  participants in the talks. But they said he did not press the issue of aid to  the Salvadorans, apparently leaving it as a "bargaining chip" for future  American concessions.  </P> <P> In separate statements after his two-day visit, Shevardnadze and his hosts said  the embargo on arms from the Soviet Union will extend through Nicaragua's  election next Feb. 25. In the meantime, he said, weapons obtained by Nicaragua  from any other source will be listed publicly.  </P> <P> The diplomats said this was the Sandinistas' way of agreeing to renounce all  military aid for the next 4 1/2 months -- until new negotiations in the  post-election period. According to the Soviet press, Shevardnadze got Cuban  President Fidel Castro to accept the moratorium during a stop in Havana on his  way home.  </P> <P> "The United States is getting what it wants, at least temporarily," said an  Asian diplomat. "If there is a trade-off for Moscow, it must be in Afghanistan.  The Soviets are extremely anxious for the United States to cut off military aid  to the Afghan rebels and respect the Soviet-backed regime."  </P> <P> Nicaragua's economy is so shattered after a decade of war and mismanagement  that the Sandinistas had no choice but to accept the arms suspension, the  diplomats said.  </P> <P> In return, they reported, President Daniel Ortega won a reluctant pledge from  Shevardnadze to maintain Nicaragua's current level of Soviet economic aid --  about $300 million a year -- into the next five-year plan, starting in 1991.  The Soviets had been trying to avoid a new aid commitment until next year.  </P> <P> "The message from Moscow is clear," a Honduran official said. "The way to  advance socialism is not by military force or monopoly of state power."  </P> <P> Officials in the region say they believe that message has reached the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador. Last month, the Marxist  guerrilla movement made a peace proposal and opened talks with the country's  new rightist government.  </P> <P> "The Sandinistas must have told (the guerrillas), 'Look, we have done all we  can for you. We have our own problems. Now you are on your own,' " said a  non-American diplomat with access to the Sandinista leadership.  </P> <P> The diplomat said he believes that Managua has stepped up arms shipments to the  rebels in recent months, knowing it will soon have to renounce such aid under  U.S. and Soviet pressure.  </P> <P> In private remarks repeated by a Central American diplomat, Shevardnadze said  the nine-year-old Salvadoran conflict "serves no interest of Soviet foreign  policy." Soviet sources say Moscow prefers an internal settlement that  guarantees a "balance of interests" with no winners and no losers.  </P> <P> Still, U.S. regional allies are skeptical of the Soviet initiative. Salvadoran  officials say they are not ready to open diplomatic ties with Moscow, accept  its mediation or put much faith in a temporary cut-off of arms to Nicaragua.  Insisting that it is too early to judge the Shevardnadze mission, U.S.  officials said the flow of arms in Central America will continue to be  monitored closely.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Michael Parks in Moscow and Robert Toth in Washington  contributed to this report.  </P></p>

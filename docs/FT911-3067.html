			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Motors poised to take stake in Volvo Car MITSUBISHI Motors and Volvo of Sweden are expected to announce shortly a preliminary agreement which could lead to the Japanese car maker taking a substantial minority stake in Volvo Car BV, the Dutch car producer. Volvo Car BV, which produces Volvo's medium-sized 400 series, is currently owned 30 per cent by Volvo of Sweden and 70 per cent by Dutch state interests. Politicians in The Hague said that Mitsubishi, Volvo and the Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry were hoping to sign a letter of intent at the end of next week setting out the basis for further negotiations. Final agreement on the transaction is expected later in the year. The option being explored most intensively is a construction whereby each of the three partners would get a one-third stake in the enlarged share capital of Volvo Car BV. As part of the deal, the partners would commit themselves to investing more than Fl 2.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in the development and production of a new medium-sized car. Government officials, who stressed that the negotiations were highly complex and still far from over, declined to say how much the Dutch state would receive for its Volvo shares. Among the most contentious issues is the type and quality of the jobs at Volvo Car BV, the Netherlands' only car producer. Dutch unions have consistently argued that the company must be more than a simple assembly unit and must continue to be involved in research and development. Government officials said that although the parties were making progress, the outstanding issues were too complicated to allow final agreement to be reached quickly. Mr Hiroshi Ninomiya, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors Europe, said that several issues in the negotiations were still unresolved. 'We need some more time for detailed discussions. It is too early to make an official contract.' Mitsubishi Motors has been in negotiation with Volvo and the Dutch government for more than a year. Its entry into car production in the Netherlands would further strengthen the rapidly growing Japanese car making presence in Europe. The three leading Japanese car makers, Toyota, Nissan and Honda are already developing car plants in Europe, all three in the UK. Mitsubishi Motors and Mazda have been seeking to follow in their wake, but are seeking partners for a joint venture. Mazda is seeking a collaborative venture in Europe with Ford of the US, which holds a 25 per cent equity stake in Mazda. Earlier this week Suzuki announced that it would begin car assembly in Hungary at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.K.: "Anniversary of 114th Brigade of Croatian </F> Armed Forces"]    [Text] The Croatian Armed Forces [HV] has not  completed its mission until we have returned the dead to their  graves and the living to their homes, said Corps General Janko  Bobetko.    Split--The third anniversary of the founding of the 114th  Brigade of the Croatian Armed Forces--the first reserve brigade  of the HV--was celebrated Sunday with a ceremony at the Croatian  National Theater in Split in the presence of numerous guests,  led by the chief of the HV General Staff, Brigadier General  Janko Bobetko. Besides the soldiers, officers, and NCO's of the  114th Brigade, the ceremony was attended by the families of the  fallen members of that brigade and by disabled veterans of the  homeland war.    On that occasion, Gen. Janko Bobetko conferred 18 old-style  flint pistols on the most prominent members of the 114th  Brigade, and the names of the fighters in this brigade who have  earned the praise of the president of the republic, the chief of  the HV Main Staff, and the commander of the Split Corps Region  were read aloud before the entire audience.    Addressing the honored soldiers and guests, Gen. Bobetko  emphasized the leading role played by the 114th Brigade in the  homeland war. "If it had not done what it did on the southern  front, and in the Neretva valley, together with other HV units,  we would not have Dubrovnik today," Bobetko said. He  specifically addressed the families of the fallen fighters and  the disabled veterans of the homeland war, stressing that they  owe Croatia nothing, but that Croatia owes them everything. He  also told the members of the 114th Brigade that the Croatian  Armed Forces has not completed its mission "until we have  returned the dead to their graves and the living to their homes."    The 114th Brigade of the HV was founded on 1 June 1991, and  its first commander was now-retired Brigadier Ante Catlak. It  was established to defend the people of Split, Omis, Trogir,  Solin, and Kastel. Its military missions took it through  Svilaja, Kijevo, and Vrlika to the Neretva valley and Dubrovnik.  Its current commander, Major Slaven Zdilar, gave special  emphasis to the brigade's role is halting Mladic's hordes in  January 1992, when they attempted to penetrate all the way to  Split. Among the 114th Brigade's important operations was the  maritime landing of 104 soldiers at besieged Dubrovnik in  October 1991 and that battle of Bosanci above Grad, which  defined the defense of Dubrovnik.    Over the past three years, nearly 6,000 soldiers have passed  through the 114th Brigade; 70 of them have given their lives for  a free Croatia, and 200 of them have been wounded.    At the afternoon ceremony in the "Split" Hotel, the families  of fallen Croatian defenders from the Split-Dalmatian Zupanija  were given "Zrinski i Frankopan" medals.</p>

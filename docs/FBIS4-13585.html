			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--Jordan is not aware of any plan to  resettle Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon and insists on  their right to return to their homeland or receive compensation  as stipulated in United Nations Security Council resolutions and  international law, senior officials said Wednesday [20 April].    Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Minister of  Information Jawad al-'Anani and former minister Marwan Dudin,  head of the Kingdom's delegation to talks on refugees and  displaced persons, said they were not aware of the reported  Lebanese plan.    In an interview with Beirut's AL-SAFIR daily on Monday,  Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz was quoted as saying that  the purported four-point plan was under "international  consideration." The Associated Press carried a report on the  interview. [passage omitted]    Both Dr. al-'Anani and Dr. Dudin said that they were not  aware of any such plan, and if indeed there was one, Jordan was  not among the countries considering it.    "Our position is very clear in all bilateral and  multilateral  negotiations on the refugee problem," said Dr. al-'Anani. "We  insist on the implementation of the relevant U.N. Security  Council resolutions which give the refugees their right to  return or receive compensation." [passage omitted]</p>

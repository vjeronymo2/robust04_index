			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Money Markets: Long rates soften RATES at the longer end of the UK money markets softened on Thursday, the last day of trading before the Easter holiday. One year money fell  1/16 of a point to 10 3/16 - 1/8 per cent. However, the key three-month interbank rate remained unchanged at 10 3/8 per cent, reflecting the market's view of no immediate change in base rates. Dealers suggested that better-than-expected unemployment figures for March had been offset by slightly worse than forecast average earnings growth. This was interpreted to support the view that UK authorities believe inflationary pressures are still evident, hindering prospects of a rate cut. 'Today is the first day in a couple of weeks that economic reality has set into interest rate expectations,' said Mr Nick Parsons of CIBC. The June short sterling contract eased from an opening of 89.87 to 89.80 by the London close, and continued to decline in after-hours trading. The London closing rate implied an interest rate of 10.2 per cent, compared with 10.12 per cent on Wednesday's close. As expected, money market players queued up to offer paper ahead of the long weekend, pushing overnight rates as low as 8 per cent. 'Everyone got their money fairly cheaply over the weekend,' said one trader. The Bank of England, having forecast a Pounds 1.75bn shortage on Thursday morning, was able to wipe out the majority of the shortfall in the early round. Some Pounds 1.585bn was injected in early operations, with a Pounds 229m purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and a Pounds 1.356bn repurchase agreement falling due on May 7 at 10 7/16 per cent. The noon round saw a further Pounds 199m purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The main factors putting pressure on liquidity were treasury bills and maturing assistance of Pounds 1.497bn and an Pounds 810m rise in note circulation. These factors were offset by exchequer transactions, which brought in Pounds 400m, and bankers' balances Pounds 150m above target. In Germany, call rates finished unchanged at 9.60/65 per cent in a quiet market. In the US, the Federal Reserve added liquidity through a Dollars 2bn repurchase agreement. Funds traded at about 3 3/4 per cent, the presumed Fed target.</p>

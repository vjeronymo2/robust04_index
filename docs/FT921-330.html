			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Lower second half hits Relyon Profits of Relyon, the bedding and cabinet furniture manufacturer, fell from Pounds 3.24m to Pounds 2.67m pre-tax for 1991. Turnover was static at Pounds 42.54m. First half profitability had been maintained but recessionaryinfluences together with exceptional costs of product development resulted in a sharp profits erosion in the second half. A proposed final dividend of 3.15p makes a same-again 4.9p total. Earnings amounted to 8.37p (9.28p). The Trident subsidiary continued to suffer from weak demand and was currently in talks that may lead to its management taking over the company for a nominal sum. That would result in a write-off of some Pounds 2m in the group's balance sheet.</p>

Leonid Makarovych explained his decision as follows: Given  that it looks like the elections to the Supreme Council may  require a second round [s pervogo zakhoda mogut i ne  sostoyatsya], the "handing over of affairs" from the old  parliament to the new threatens to drag on until May, and "then  all structures would have to switch straight away to the  presidential elections." The situation in Ukraine by this time,  in Leonid Kravchuk's view, may be severely exacerbated. So is it  worth getting bogged down in the presidential elections so soon?  A complex situation, Leonid Kravchuk continued, can be  rationalized, but to agree to participate in the elections would  mean defending "that position -- economic and social -- which  exists today." That is, trying to prove that it is normal.  And, of course, those who run for the post of president will  make every effort to prove that "I failed in my duties. I would  then provide them with much room for political maneuver and all  kinds of accusations." In answer to a question from "Liberty"  journalists on whether it is possible that he is simply afraid  of domestic strife, Leonid Kravchuk replied: "I am not  afraid...." He added: "In principle, the concept of fear does  not concern me as an individual."    It is, indeed, possible to agree with Leonid Makarovych's  final point. His decision was most probably dictated not by  fear, but by calculation. The number of battles he had to  withstand last year when the miners were demanding a referendum  on confidence in the president are still fresh in the memory.  At that time Leonid Makarovych made considerable efforts, and  even agreed to early elections -- provided that there was no  referendum. The situation now is such that Kravchuk may not  receive a vote of confidence at the upcoming elections. And  does he really want to suffer "ignominious defeat" -- he who  only recently proudly boasted that he had been party to the  collapse of the Soviet Union? Especially as one of the  "Belovezhskiy old guard" -- Stanislav Shushkevich -- has been  ousted from office by the Belarusian Parliament. Nor, as some  independent politicians and mass media sources assert, is Boris  Yeltsin's position particularly firm. Here again, Leonid  Makarovych has obviously weighed things up: It is better to  jump from that runaway train by the name of "Ukraine" of one's  own volition, than to fail at the presidential elections.    However, it is for Leonid Kravchuk to decide his own fate.  It is only a pity that after such ardent words about respect  for the people of Ukraine, the sovereignty of the people, and  love for Ukraine, that the people themselves and Ukraine should  have to learn of the president's decision from Radio  "Liberty"....</p>

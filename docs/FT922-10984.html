			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Observer: Genscher's last laugh It has been a tempestuous few months for Irmgard Schwaetzer, Germany's next foreign minister in succession to her erstwhile mentor, Hans-Dietrich Genscher. In that time she changed her name (from Adam-Schwaetzer), remarried (to TV presenter Udo Philipp), celebrated her 50th birthday (on 5 April), and now becomes the first woman in the history of the Federal Republic to hold such an elevated ministerial office. A pharmacist by training, and an economic free marketeer by conviction, she has inevitably been called the 'German Maggie Thatcher', although she is condemned by the size of her party never to have a real crack at the chancellorship. Nor did she quite make it to the leadership of her party, and now has apparently agreed not to try - in exchange for the foreign ministry. She hails from Munster in Westfalia - like her great rival in the new generation of Free Democrats, Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, who is putting a brave face on not getting the job. Always a protegee of Genscher's, she was for a long time his state secretary for European affairs, well-regarded in Brussels for her capacity to negotiate through the night after her boss had flown off to the next round of engagements. As foreign minister, she must tread softly for some time to come - coping both with the indelible Genscher stamp left on the foreign ministry, not to mention a Chancellor increasingly calling the foreign policy shots himself. The real question is whether she can hang on to the post after the 1994 elections if the coalition wins again; Volker Ruhe, ex-secretary-general of the Christian Democrats, just appointed as defence minister, has always wanted her job. Indeed, the fact that Genscher has chosen to quit now, when Ruhe is otherwise engaged, could be seen as a neat revenge by the wily old campaigner.</p>

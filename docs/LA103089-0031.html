			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PASADENA SYMPHONY OPENS 62ND SEASON  </P> <P> Showoff programs sometimes materialize toward the middle or at the end of  symphonic seasons. To begin the 62nd year of the Pasadena Symphony, however,  Jorge Mester jumped right in with a bold agenda: Stravinsky's "Petrushka," the  Fifth Violin Concerto of Vieuxtemps, and Ravel's "La Valse."  </P> <P> In the event, Saturday night in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the orchestra's  music director -- who recently signed a contract extending his leadership in  Pasadena through 1993 -- made it work, and rather effortlessly. The orchestra  played superbly well, in near-perfect wind-string balances and with brilliant  solo contributions from the first-desk players.  </P> <P> "La Valse" closed the proceedings with an illuminating clarity of instrumental  textures and a Ravelian kaleidoscope of colors; this is the kind of playing  Pasadena Civic does not always hear when famous orchestras from far away occupy  its stage.  </P> <P> "Petrushka," too, profited from a well-wrought, transparent fabric of sound and  from the high energy produced by genuinely confident, virtuosic players.  </P> <P> In between, Anne Akiko Meyers, the 19-year-old, California- and  Juilliard-trained violinist, brought vigorous mastery, unflinching technical  skills and stylish elegance to the still-viable Romantic requirements of  Vieuxtemps' quirky but lovable A-minor Concerto. She made the old-fashioned  rhetoric seem compelling, and faltered never in the apparently unending  mechanical hurdles the work presents. Affectionately, Mester &amp; Co. followed  suit.

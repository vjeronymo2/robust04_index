			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Somalia firefight a deadly omen for US troops A FATAL firefight erupted yesterday between United Nations troops and a band of gunmen at the international airport in Mogadishu in a foretaste of the anarchic violence that US troops will have to face when they intervene in Somalia. Pakistani troops in UN blue helmets let off bursts of machine gunfire at gunmen in a 'Mad Max' customised truck which careered across the runway, disrupting the airport's operation. One Somali gunman was killed in the incident. Securing the airport will be the first military objective of the 1,800-strong advance party of US Marines waiting offshore to advance into the war-blasted capital to begin one of the biggest military interventions undertaken in Africa and the biggest humanitarian operation launched since the Iraqi-Kurdish initiative. There are an estimated 1.5 million Somalis facing death from starvation. The Marine operation will begin with a helicopter and amphibious landing in Mogadishu from a US flotilla which was sighted for the first time yesterday off the Somali coast. The first Marine landing is expected early next week, preparing the way for a much larger force. US military officials now concede it could grow to between 28,000 and 35,000 soldiers and support staff because of Somalia's nightmarish logistics. Sporadic shots rang out across the rubble-strewn capital last night but observers say heavy fighting has stopped as the anxious Somali nation awaits the US intervention with a mixture of resignation and relief. Even excitement was apparent among some Somalis, who believe that there are large sums of money to be extracted from the US operation. Aid workers and others in Mogadishu yesterday continued to express deep reservation about the optimistic assessments of US officials about the speed with which they expect to secure the airport and port and establish safe corridors for food aid. 'If the Yanks think they can dash in here like the cavalry and clean this mess up in a matter of weeks, we are all in for deep trouble,' said a long-serving UN officer. Experts say that, even without any large-scale military resistance, getting food to the worst-affected areas of the Jubba Valley and the towns of Bardera and Baidoa is going to require a big logistics operation and a long-term commitment. General Mohamed Aideed, Somalia's fiercest warlord, was still said to be massing an assortment of vehicles and a ragtag army of gunmen in Baidoa yesterday to launch an offensive aimed at retaking Bardera which he lost to forces loyal to former President Siad Barre. Many Somalis believe the general is desperate to seize the town before US troops arrive. A final foreign fray, Page 7 Bush orders troops in, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will  permit tax-exempt write-offs of some bad loans by Japanese banks  and other financial institutions, ministry officials said Friday  [4 February].    The move, beginning in the current fiscal year ending March  31, is intended to speed up the liquidation of bad loans to  housing loan companies and other debt-ridden nonbank financial  institutions, the officials said.    Under present plans, financial institutions will create new  companies to buy their interest-exempted loans to nonbanks.    The institutions, which have exempted interest payments on  some loans to help bail out debt-ridden loan recipients, will be  allowed to make tax-free write-offs of losses from the selling  of loans. Write-offs of interest-exempted loans, tax-free or  otherwise, have not been allowed since they are intended to help  the bailout of loan recipients.</p>

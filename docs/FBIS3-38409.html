He was received at Ankara's  Esenboga Airport by President Suleyman Demirel. Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin was also present.    An official reception for President Mubarak was held at the  Cankaya Mansion. After the national anthems of both countries  were played, the two presidents inspected the honor guard.    Present at the ceremony were Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of  the Turkish Grand National Assembly; General Dogan Gures, chief  of the General Staff; Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland  Party; and other officials.    Speaking at the ceremony, Demirel said that this visit,  which  is taking place at a time of important developments in the  region, will constitute an opportunity for a beneficial exchange  of views between the two countries on regional and international  issues of concern. He pointed out that there Turkey and Egypt  have deep-rooted ties based on a common history and cultural  heritage, adding: There are many similarities between Turkey  and Egypt. They have coasts on the Mediterranean. They are  trying to further their social and economic development on one  hand and to establish peace and stability in their region on the  other. Consequently, Turkey and Egypt constitute factors of  balance and stability in the Middle East.    Demirel stressed that Egypt plays an important and effective  role in the efforts being made to establish peace and stability  in the Middle East. We appreciate Egypt's efforts in this  regard, he said, adding that there are many things Turkey and  Egypt can do together in the political and economic fields in  the Middle East, which is being reshaped.    In turn, Mubarak said that both countries carry weight in  the  Islamic world and that they pursue a common policy on  international issues. Both countries are determined to make  every effort to help establish a just and lasting peace in the  Middle East.    The two presidents then conferred for some time, after which  the talks between the delegations began.    Accompanying President Mubarak are Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa; Electricity and Energy Minister Muhammad Abazah; Sulayman  Tantawi, minister of defense and war production; Information  Minister Muhammad Safwat al-Sharif; and Mahmud Muhammad Bayyumi,  minister of economy and foreign trade.    Demirel is now giving a luncheon in honor of the visiting  president at the Cankaya Mansion.    President Mubarak is expected to leave Turkey this evening.</p>

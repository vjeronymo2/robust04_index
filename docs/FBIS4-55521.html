			<p>BFN     [Text] The attitude of the DPS [Movement for Rights and  Freedoms] toward the Berov government has become clear from a  report that we have just received from BTA. After touring the  Kurdzhali region for four days, Ahmed Dogan declared that the  DPS central leadership and its electorate share a common view  concerning the cabinet's fate. The DPS supports a  left-of-center model for the economy, if the social cost of the  transition is determined. It will be difficult for the cabinet  to fall, he said, and if any of the other parliamentary groups  receive a mandate to form a cabinet, none of them will be able  to form either a one-party or coalition government. Dogan said  that the alternative of a caretaker cabinet is dangerous;  according to him, such a cabinet could only operate for 2 to 6  months and would supplant the parliamentary form of government,  delay the agreement on the foreign debt, and lead to  hyperinflation.</p>

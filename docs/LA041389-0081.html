			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME STARTS FAST TO FINISH HARVARD  </P> <P> The temperature is not all that has cooled since last weekend. Less than a week  after upsetting highly-rated Arcadia, Harvard High was cold cocked by Notre  Dame in a San Fernando Valley League baseball game Wednesday at Balboa Park.  </P> <P> The Knights scored six runs in the first three innings on their way to an 8-2  victory in the league opener for both teams. Notre Dame (14-1 overall) had six  hits, including two doubles, in the first three innings.  </P> <P> "They've got a heck of an offensive lineup," Harvard Coach Jim Brink said of  Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Said Notre Dame outfielder Chris Lohman, who has a team-high 22 runs batted in:  "We have a great hitting lineup. We'll get the hits, there's no doubt about  it."  </P> <P> The Knights wasted no time Wednesday. Kevin Crosby doubled to the left-field  gap on the first pitch and came around to score on Lohman's sacrifice fly two  batters later.  </P> <P> Bobby Hughes followed with a walk, then scored on Kevin Milligan's double.  </P> <P> "We started the game well," Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville said. "Crosby set  the tone for our offense."  </P> <P> Crosby also started the Knights' four-run third inning with a walk. Chad  Ratliff singled, Crosby and Ratliff each stole a base and Lohman singled both  runners home.  </P> <P> A sacrifice fly and an error accounted for Notre Dame's two other runs in the  inning.  </P> <P> Lohman also knocked in the Knights' final run in the sixth inning, giving the  senior outfielder two hits, two walks and four RBIs for the game.  </P> <P> "He's a clutch hitter," Mandeville said of Lohman. "When he's going good, it's  hard to find a guy with a better stroke than his."  </P> <P> Notre Dame pitcher Cary Wichmann shut down the Saracens to benefit from the  offensive support. The sophomore right-hander struck out four of the first six  batters he faced and allowed only four hits and one run in five innings.  </P> <P> "He was overpowering us for a little while," Brink said of Wichmann. "We've  seen some good pitching, but day in and day out, we don't see that kind of  pitching."  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-0, Harvard (6-9) scored a run in the fourth inning on a double by  Robby Thayer and an RBI single by Marty Holly. But Wichmann struck out two  batters to get out of the inning.  </P></p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Inchcape's Pounds 125m convertible performs strongly ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market picked up yesterday, after a quiet start to the week. In the sterling convertible bond market, a Pounds 125m issue for Inchcape, the UK-based motor and business services group, performed strongly, reflecting enthusiastic demand from continental European investors. The latest in a steady flow of sterling convertible offerings, the more aggressive pricing on the Inchcape deal proved acceptable to the market, reflecting the strength of interest among equity, rather than bond, investors. The coupon on the 15-year bonds was set at 6 1/4 per cent, half a point less than for recent convertible offerings, while the conversion premium was set at a fairly hefty 18 per cent. Lead-manager Credit Suisse First Boston said that demand from continental European investors for UK equity products reflected positive sentiment on sterling, as well as on the UK economy. The timing of the deal took advantage of the group's strong results, including a 28 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, announced on Monday. Meanwhile, a Pounds 218m deal for the European Investment Bank in the sterling fixed-rate bond market met a tougher reception. The five-year deal was considered aggressively priced, although the nominal spread of 20 basis points over the five-year gilt yield did not look unreasonable. The deal was the latest in a series of issues in the sector to take advantage of the shape of the gilt yield curve, by pricing a new issue which matures at the end of 1998 over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due March 1998. Because of the shape of the yield curve, the discrepancy in maturity effectively adds 10 basis points to the yield spread. However, retail investors have often proved not to be sensitive to such devises. However, in this case, the deal was widely felt to be too aggressively priced, and the timing ahead of today's gilt auction was felt to be rather risky. Lead-manager J P Morgan admitted the pricing was on the tight side, but said the deal offered value compared with other issues, such as the World Bank's five-year bonds, trading at 17 basis points over the comparable gilt. Electrolux, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, was yesterday downgraded by Moody's, the US ratings agency, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The senior debt rating is cut to Baa2 from A3, The move, which affects Dollars 1.3bn of long-term debt, reflects concern about Electrolux's high debt levels, its long-term competitive position, and its prospects for achieving improved financial results when its key European markets are going into decline.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Myths exposed by AT&amp;T trial When AT&amp;T sent a video crew on to the streets of Manhattan to ask people what they thought of the information superhighway, one asked: 'What's that?' Another said: 'Is it a toll road?' A third thought it was like 'one of those telephone games where a message is passed on and on until it all gets screwed up.' AT&amp;T, one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, is anxious to discover how the public will react to the new services it will be able to deliver because of the convergence of its telecoms business with the information technology and entertainment industries. One of its top priorities is the development of an interactive television service. AT&amp;T is now in the throes of a long-term research project to find out what the public wants from interactive TV. The results so far have disproved almost all its original assumptions. 'Our initial research told us that people would use interactive TV as a source of information and that it was something they would use on their own, like a personal computer rather than a TV,' Vincent Grosso, director of interactive service at AT&amp;T, told a conference organised last week by the Netherlands Design Institute in Amsterdam. 'We were looking for the 'killer' application - the one thing which was so powerful that it would make people really want to have interactive TV in their homes.' Yet when AT&amp;T began its research two years ago by running a nine-month trial in the homes of 50 employees in the Chicago area, it discovered that the most popular channels delivered entertainment, not information. The trial also revealed that people prefered to use interactive TV as a communal activity - with the family playing an interactive game, for instance - just as they do with traditional TV. 'We realised that we shouldn't have been looking for a killer application but for killer attributes,' said Grosso. 'The service worked best when all the attributes - information, entertainment, communication and transactions  -were integrated.' And the service had to be easy to use. At the end, AT&amp;T found that the instruction books were still in their shrink-wrapped covers in 40 per cent of homes. In half those homes, people said their children had taught them how to use the service. The rest had muddled through. AT&amp;T is now finalising plans for two more trials which will start next year. These trials will be bigger and more sophisticated than the Chicago pilot. However, Grosso is convinced that AT&amp;T learnt some valuable pointers from that project. 'One of the most important lessons was to check everything the participants told us. We'd listen to people talking about how they had used the service for news and information. But their records showed that they'd spent most of their time playing games.'</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN NOW IN PEERAGE GUIDE  </P> <P> The names of illegitimate children of British aristocrats have been printed for  the first time in a famous guide to bluebloods.  </P> <P> It's something of a revolution for "Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage," the  weighty reference book that first came out in 1769 and appears every five  years.  </P> <P> "We have put them in at the request of those families who wanted the names of  natural children to appear," said editor Charles Kidd at the launch of the  latest edition Thursday night.  </P> <P> "Across the country, about one in every four children is born out of wedlock.  If parents agree, we believe that Debrett's should record illegitimate issue to  ensure the book is comprehensive, although these children still cannot inherit  a title," he said.  </P> <P> Kidd said about 200 names have entered the huge book as a result of changing  social attitudes.  </P></p>

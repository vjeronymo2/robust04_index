			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CITIZENS ABOVE SUSPICION, PLEASE  </P> <P> The questions raised concerning the way in which federal regulators treated  President Bush's son Neil during their investigation of his conduct as a  director of the failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. differ in  degree, though not in kind, from those that must be answered if the thrift  debacle ever is to be resolved satisfactorily.  </P> <P> The American financial system has suffered nothing like the collapse of the  savings and loan industry since the Depression. That it has occurred without  triggering panic is testimony to the wisdom of the federal deposit insurance  programs adopted in the wake of that last great economic upheaval. However,  confidence has its price and, in this case, it may reach a staggering half a  trillion dollars in public liability.  </P> <P> The American people, whose taxes will have to cover that debt, deserve clear  answers to two questions: How did deregulation go so badly awry that the thrift  industry was turned from a reliable source of home mortgages into a kind of  floating crap game? Does the federal government have the will to pursue those  individuals who took this catastrophic failure of public policy as an  opportunity to behave irresponsibly or criminally, even though many of them are  wealthy and politically influential?  </P> <P> The issues raised in Neil Bush's case speak directly to the latter question.  Much about the Silverado failure -- whose cost to taxpayers will exceed $1  billion -- is curious. In October, 1988, when Colorado state officials moved to  close down the insolvent institution for which the younger Bush had served as  an outside director for three years, regional federal regulators -- acting on  instructions from Washington -- intervened. They kept Silverado open until Nov.  9, the day after George Bush won election. Earlier this year, the enforcement  staff of the Office of Thrift Supervision recommended that Neil Bush be banned  from the industry because he had engaged in "personal dishonesty" and had  "willfully breached" his fiduciary duties while serving as a Silverado  director. Four of the institution's executives subsequently signed consent  orders accepting such a prohibition. However, federal regulators, citing the  lack of evidence against Bush, sought a lesser penalty for him -- a  cease-and-desist order directing that he refrain from violating disclosure  rules. Neil Bush denies any wrongdoing and is contesting even that order.  </P> <P> All of this may reflect nothing more than the normal coincidence and  uncertainty that are part of any complex investigation. It also is possible  that it reflects the official favoritism, influence-peddling and insider  arrogance that have been part of the thrift problem from the beginning. That is  an ambiguity every bit as intolerable as the S&amp;L crisis itself.  </P></p>

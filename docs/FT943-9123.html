			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Taiwan, Singapore plan satellite link Taiwan is to co-operate with Singapore in the manufacture and launch of a commercial satellite at a cost of USDollars 215m, the head of Taiwan's Telecommunications Ministry said yesterday, Laura Tyson writes from Taipei. Mr Steven Chen said contracts would be signed in October and the satellite would be launched in three to four years. Because Taiwan is not a member of the International Telecommunications Union, Singapore's orbit will be used. The satellite would cover east and south-east Asia and China, he said. It would have 24 transponders, shared equally between the two countries. The aim is to meet fast-rising demand for satellites from local broadcasters, television stations, defence and cable television. Seven transponders have already been booked.</p>

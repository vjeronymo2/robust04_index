			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Hard evidence of recovery eludes northern professionals IN A PRIVATE dining room at Worsley Old Hall, Greater Manchester, an informal luncheon club of a dozen members of various professions was searching for tangible reasons to believe recovery is under way. Among these people, who included lawyers, actuaries, accountants and consultants, faith was in short supply. A generally agreed perspective was provided by Mr Len Collinson, chairman of Collinson Grant, a local management consultancy. He said: 'We have a number of clients who are doing better, but it's against very bad results last year and the year before. Things can only get better because they could hardly have got worse, short of people going out of business.' Times are tougher than they look in professional services, which experienced remarkable growth in Manchester and Leeds during the latter half of the 1980s. Professionals have been putting up a good front but Mr Graeme Jump, partner in charge of the Manchester office of Mace &amp; Jones, said what many of his fellow solicitors have kept quiet about. 'Three or four years ago, corporate lawyers used to boast about how much they could charge for their time,' he said. 'They pushed prices up and clients hardly ever protested. Not now. Prices are negotiable downwards. Real fee levels are probably down 30 to 40 per cent on two years ago.' Mr Jump added that job prospects are poor in corporate legal services: 'For the first time since the 1960s there are trainees coming to the end of their articles who are unable to find jobs.' Mr Dennis Wright, a director of Reeves Brown Associates, a firm of actuaries, echoed this: 'The very idea of an unemployed actuary used to be unthinkable. Now there are very many.' Nor are professional groups particularly buoyant on Humberside, where the Humber's four large ports and myriad smaller wharves have been growing with export trade to Europe during the recession. Mr Roger King, a partner in Kidsons Impey accountants of Hull, told the luncheon club last week: 'My clients say any recovery is extremely slow. In the construction industry, it's non-existent. The accountancy profession is suffering redundancies all over the country. There are many newly qualified accountants who have completed their training but cannot be kept on.' There are some hopeful signs, however. North West Business Insider, the regional business magazine, has surveyed Manchester advertising agencies and found this year's budgets were 25 per cent up on last year. Corporate finance activity was also up as medium-sized companies turned to professionals in this field for advice on how to prepare themselves for economic recovery.</p>

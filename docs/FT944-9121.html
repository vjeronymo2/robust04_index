			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Rexrodt likely to keep job Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, will retain his post in the new cabinet to be announced today, according to officials from his Free Democrat party. The FDP is junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition. Mr Klaus Kinkel, FDP leader, will remain foreign minister, and Ms Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, also from the FDP, is expected to keep the justice portfolio. Mr Rexrodt, a supporter of greater liberalisation and privatisation, has suffered a string of recent failures to push through structural changes. These include his inability to reach consensus among industry and local councils to deregulate the energy sector, his failure to scrap a law restricting the ability of high-street department stores to lower prices, and his unsuccessful attempts at relaxing the country's inflexible shopping hours.</p>

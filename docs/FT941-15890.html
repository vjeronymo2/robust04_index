			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Yeltsin backer fails to win vote for speaker Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a key aide of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, yesterday failed to become speaker of the upper house of parliament by a few votes, as regional leaders snubbed the head of state by giving almost equal support to an ultra-nationalist factory director. Mr Shumeiko sought to woo the regional leaders who sit in the Federation Council by promising them more powers, as well as a shift in economic policy, and less interference from the president. But Mr Pyotr Romanov, manager of a Siberian oil refinery who stressed his patriotism and the importance of state power, picked up 79 votes against Mr Shumeiko's 81. According to a colleague from St Petersburg, Mr Romanov is a member of the Russian National Assembly, a right-wing organisation headed by a hardline KGB general. The victor in a repeat vote needs to obtain support of at least half the 171-strong Federation Council. The election of Mr Shumeiko, a first deputy prime minister and close associate of Mr Yeltsin, would confirm the upper chamber, or Federation Council, as the more co-operative of the two parliamentary chambers. Fresh squabbling broke out yesterday among deputies of the lower chamber, the State Duma, even though it was not in session, when Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, insisted that he should become speaker. A meeting of faction leaders broke up after members representing Russia's Choice, Russian Unity, Accord, and Women of Russia walked out in protest over his attempt to renege on a deal to give the job to a candidate from the women's party. They later reconvened to try to pick a speaker, with all factions agreeing to block his Liberal Democratic party should Mr Zhirinovsky try to take over proceedings without their agreement. Mr Shumeiko, who got himself elected to the Federation Council from the Russian-speaking enclave of Kaliningrad, had earlier proposed that if the State Duma blocked legislation, the new Federation Council could take on new functions - say approving the budget - not foreseen for it by the constitution. He also promised a vigorous defence of the interests of Russia's restless regions. He suggested the abolition of the system of presidential representatives in the regions, who he said duplicated the functions of the governors. Mr Shumeiko reiterated plans for a shift in economic policy 'which would turn our face to producers'. This shift in priorities, away from those desired by radical reformers such as the deputy prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, has already been set out by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. Meanwhile, Democratic Russia, the anti-communist movement that has been an important source of support for Mr Yeltsin, yesterday warned that it would go into opposition against him if he removed radical reformers from the government, as expected in a reshuffle next week.</p>

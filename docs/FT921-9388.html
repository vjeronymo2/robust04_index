			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Donors agree Sri Lanka aid SRI LANKA'S donors and the World Bank have pledged Dollars 825m (Pounds 456m) in aid for 1992. 'We requested Dollars 800m,' said Mr D G Wijetunge, the prime minister, after his return from the annual Paris meeting of donors. Japan led the league of donors, followed by the World Bank and the US. Three EC countries and Canada in particular were critical of the government's human rights record.

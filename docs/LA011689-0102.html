			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BAKKERS TIME SHOW TO HIGH NOTES  </P> <P> Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker moved their television show to a new time slot today  -- the same time their old PTL show runs -- because their previous, earlier  hour made it impossible for Tammy's voice to hit high notes.  </P> <P> The "Jim and Tammy Show" returned to the airwaves two weeks ago at 9 a.m. But  today, it was filmed from their home at 11 a.m. Tammy Faye had told viewers for  the last two weeks that her diaphragm did not expand the way it should early in  the morning, making it difficult to inhale enough air to hit the high notes.  </P></p>

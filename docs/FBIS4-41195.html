			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of North Ossetia and Ingushetia have  both turned down options for the return of refugees to their  former homes, which had been put to both sides. The RIA news  agency was informed of this today by negotiators representing  the interim administration in the state of emergency zone.    The interim administration has drawn up its own proposals,  which are now being worked on by state structures in both  republics. The details of the plan have not been divulged so  far. However, RIA has learned from reliable sources that the  interim administration intends to abide by the timetable and  principles for the return of refugees set out in the Russian  president's decree of 30 May this year.</p>

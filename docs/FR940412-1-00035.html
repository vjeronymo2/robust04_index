			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This NPRM proposes that profit and loss accounts be reported semiannually in accordance with the charter of accounts proposed in Appendix B to part 403.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM proposes standardized reporting, by account number, for financial data now submitted in summarized, unnumbered fashion. The proposed revisions and additions to the reporting requirements are necessary to examine selected costs for reasonableness (lease and interest costs, etc.); to specifically list expenses that would be included in pilot compensation costs (e.g., pension and health costs, etc.); and to provide identification for costs not currently listed as incurred in some districts (e.g., pilot insurance, FICA, retirement).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For ratemaking purposes, more detailed information is needed than that supplied in the current financial statements to determine the reasonableness of capital lease agreements and the depreciable lives and residual value of selected assets. This NPRM proposes that all matters which may materially influence interpretations or conclusions drawn from the financial statements of pilot associations with regard to the financial condition or earnings position of the association would have to be clearly and completely stated as footnotes to the financial statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM proposes to continue the requirement that all financial records, including information on lease transactions, be maintained and be readily available to the Director's auditors for 10 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NPRM does not propose any significant changes to the form of Inter-Association Settlement Statements. However, comments on whether it is necessary to retain this section, or any other suggested changes, are specifically requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard considers this proposed regulation to be significant because a rulemaking affecting the setting of pilotage rates is controversial and of significant interest to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary purpose of this rulemaking is to standardize the financial reporting of Great Lakes pilot associations and to clarify the methodology to be used in future ratemakings. The methodology proposed is expected to have a minimal impact on pilotage rates. Since the effect of the rulemaking on pilotage rates is expected to be minimal, a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because this proposal does not affect the overall level of pilotage rates, this proposal should have little or no impact on small entities which pay pilotage rates, or receive income from pilotage rates. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection of information requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection of information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal contains collection of information requirements in the additions to 46 CFR part 403. The following particulars apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOT No.:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2115.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> OMB Control No.:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2115&hyph;0022.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administration:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Coast Guard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Great Lakes Pilotage Rate Methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Need for Information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information is necessary for ratemaking calculations and for the proper financial oversight of the Great Lakes pilot associations. However, pilot associations currently report financial information as required by 46 CFR part 403. This proposal merely amends the existing reporting requirements by separating several existing summary accounts into their individual components, and requiring that the financial reporting of all accounts be done in a standardized format.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Use of Information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reported data would be used in Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking calculations, and for the proper financial oversight of the Great Lakes pilot associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Frequency of Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Balance Sheet, and the Profit and Loss Statement, which are currently required quarterly, would be required semiannually. Revenue and Traffic Statements would be required monthly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Burden Estimate:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No change from the current burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Respondents:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each Great Lakes pilot association (there are currently three).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Form(s):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designated by the Director, Great Lakes Pilotage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Average Burden Hours Per Respondent:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No change to the current burden hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Under 49 CFR 1.46(a) the Secretary delegates to the Commandant of the Coast Guard the authority to carry out the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, as amended, except the authority to enter into, revise, or amend arrangements with Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, since vessel traffic in the Great Lakes tends to move between U.S. ports in the national marketplace, pilotage regulations for the Great Lakes is a matter for which regulations should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. State action addressing the same subject matter is preempted by 46 U.S.C. 9306, which provides that a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate or impose any requirement on pilotage on the Great Lakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this NPRM and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The rule is procedural in nature because it deals exclusively with ratemaking and accounting procedures. Therefore, this is included in the categorical exclusion in subsection 2.B.2.1_Administrative actions or procedural regulations and policies which clearly do not have any environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

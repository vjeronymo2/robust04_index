With a big rise of 15.17 percent over the previous year, the  export volume from the light industrial sector took up one-third  of the total export volume for the whole country.    And 64.9 percent of the export volume was achieved by the  export of 14 major light industrial products, which yielded  19.46 billion U.S. dollars.    The export volume of timepieces, household appliances,  leather shoes, toys and plastic products surpassed 1.3 billion  U.S. dollars each.    The export volume of machinery and electronics products  registered a sharp rise of 27.2 percent over the previous year.    Yu Zhen, head of the China Council of Light Industry (CCLI),  said that as a pillar of China's national economy, light  industry has established a production network which can not only  fulfill domestic demands, but also wield a certain competitive  edge on the world market.    As Yu put it, China's light industry will expand  international cooperation, introduce advanced overseas  technology and facilities, and further improve the quality of  products.    About 218 representatives from China's famous light  industrial enterprises today signed a declaration here, to mark  the "International Consumers Day", which was set to be March 15.    The declaration pledged their determination to contribute to  providing more famous-brand products.</p>

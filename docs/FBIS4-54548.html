			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer by </F> Gabor Moricz; place and date not given: "We Are Following Our  Own Road"]    [Text] There is a political party in Hungary today that is  not one of the many parties, but a single such party. However,  this party is no longer that party. This party cannot be called  "the party." This is only a party that can make it into  Parliament if it is successful in the elections. It seems that  it has all the chances to make it into Parliament. We spoke  about this with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer.    [Moricz] Only 0.32 percent separated your party from  parliamentary membership in the 1990 elections. If you had  presented a Pest county list at the time, you would have made it  into Parliament. Now, you have presented 156 individual  candidates and you also have all the district lists. What  percentage are you counting on at the elections?    [Thurmer] Even on the basis of mathematical logic, one can  presume that the Workers Party will make it into Parliament.  With a realistic optimism, I am hoping for 7-8 percent of the  votes.    [Moricz] You mentioned 5 percent in February. Does that  mean there has been an increase in support for the Workers Party?    [Thurmer] There is definitely an increase in support for our  party. We hope to be successful in the first round. I think we  can justifiably hope for 5-8 percent of the votes; of course,  miracles can also happen.  <H5>  A Formal Freedom of the Press </H5>   [Moricz] According to a survey carried out by the Szonda  Ipsos in January this year, 8 percent of the people surveyed  thought that Gyula Thurmer was the chairman of the Hungarian  Socialist Party [MSZP]....    [Thurmer] I suspect the pollers are not so much interested  in the people's opinions; they are much more interested in  influencing them. Fortunately, the pollers themselves refrain  from suggesting that the Workers Party will not make it into  Parliament. Thanks to the brainwashing carried out by the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], freedom of the press in  Hungary is only formally present. We are only beginning to  receive the amount of radio and television time we deserve now  on the eve of the elections.    [Moricz] So you do not accept the fact that many of your  voters do not even know whom to vote for.    [Thurmer] That is possible, but these people mostly vote for  the left; at most, they hesitate between the MSZP and the  Workers Party.    [Moricz] In your opinion, what is the difference between  these two parties?    [Thurmer] The MSZP accepts capitalism, while the Workers  Party does not. I also welcome the success of the MSZP.    [Moricz] On your visit to Salgotarjan in connection with the  news of the arrest of two former policemen, you again called for  a halt on political trials and for immunity to the future  deputies. Does that mean that there are former members of the  III/III department and former policemen among you?    [Thurmer] This is not the point. There is no sense in  political trials because their goal is to threaten people and  show power. Instead of the district commissioner, a 15-20  member action group took an unfortunate pensioner in Nograd to  the police, although he would have gone to the police alone.    [Moricz] In other words, you agree with the moral  administration of justice and you only disagree with its  implementation.    [Thurmer] No, I do not agree with this. The law on the  administration of justice itself is bad. The issue of the 1956  uprising should be left alone because no justice can be done  here. There were two sides on the barricades, and the one who  stood on one side of the barricade will never see events the way  the one who stood on the other side sees them. As for the  members of the III/III department and the former police, they  are not among us but among the deputies of parliamentary parties.    [Moricz] You often said that the Kadar regime was more  honest and better than the current one. What is your opinion on  Kadar's declaration in the course of the retaliations following  the 1956 revolution, according to which the  counterrevolutionaries should be hanged en masse.    [Thurmer] I do not know whether Janos Kadar said this.    [Moricz] There are written documents attesting to this,  Hungarian Television presented these documents, and one can read  them in the report of the Kahler committee.    [Thurmer] The Kahler committee is not a source for me.    [Moricz] A protocol was prepared on this declaration.    [Thurmer] This has no importance today. Obviously, many  people said many things about 1956 at the time. We should not  deal with this. I do not understand the timeliness of this  issue. After 38 years, why is it interesting for MAGYAR NEMZET  to ask the chairman of a party about what the chairman of a  former party said?    [Moricz] Because the chairman of this party said the Kadar  regime was more honest and better than the current regime.    [Thurmer] I continue to claim that the Kadar regime was more  honest and better. This does not depend on a quotation but on  the way people lived then.    [Moricz] A considerable number of people fled the country  and many people were imprisoned.    [Thurmer] That is not true. The Kadar regime gave most  people more and better chances than the current regime.    [Moricz] In other words, the Workers Party is conducting a  policy that does not take into consideration how certain parts  of society are living.    [Thurmer] This is more characteristic of the current regime.  We do not want to repeat Kadar's policy, but the results  achieved in the past decades must be preserved.  <H5>  Yes to Socialism </H5>   [Moricz] One of the pet subjects of the Workers Party is  that it does not want the Boross-type Christian national  capitalism, or the Horn-Nagy-Bekesi-type of rose capitalism, or  Kuncze's liberal capitalists either. At the same time, your  party says that Sandor Nagy is only a rival and not an enemy,  and the party has signed an agreement with Nagy's National  Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ].    [Thurmer] We signed an agreement with the workers' platform  of the MSZOSZ, and not with Sandor Nagy. The fact that such a  platform could emerge shows that there are many left-wing people  in the trade unions who are seeking the policy of the Workers  Party. We do not want any type of capitalism.    [Moricz] Is socialism your distant goal?    [Thurmer] Of course.    [Moricz] However, you said you were not in favor of  restoration.    [Thurmer] When socialism is created in Hungary, this will be  a historical progress, rather than restoration.    [Moricz] You nevertheless supported the forces representing  the restoration of the old regime during the coup attempt in  Russia.    [Thurmer] I do not know whether these forces supported  restoration. On thing is certain: Even the U.S. President  would pray for the united Soviet Union that we too support, but  it is too late.    [Moricz] You said earlier that joining the Partnership for  Peace program would have Hungary drifting into the Yugoslav  conflict. Do you continue to believe this now that Hungary has  joined the program and after meeting President Milosevic?    [Thurmer] Hungary does not have to drift into the Yugoslav  conflict: We are already in it. We take part in the economic  sanctions directed against Yugoslavia. The Hungarian Government  also rejected the latest idea of the Romanian, Greek, and  Bulgarian governments to lift the sanctions. Except for its  steps coordinated with the West, the Hungarian Government has  not taken any individual foreign policy initiatives. This is  the policy of the last ally, and this has never led to anything  positive in Hungarian history.  <H5>  Hypocritical Law </H5>   [Moricz] To the disapproval of the West, Peter Boross  demanded that AWACS aircraft refrain from directing military  attacks from Hungarian airspace.    [Thurmer] Peter Boross' declaration had no importance  whatsoever, because it is not the Hungarian Government that  decides on the deployment of these aircraft. Besides, the  positive things achieved in Hungarian-Yugoslav relations are  being spoiled on the other side: [Foreign Minister Geza]  Jeszenszky goes to Belgrade, but one month later he celebrates  the anniversary of 15 March in Vojvodina, and he also takes  short trips to Bosnia and Croatia.    [Moricz] Does that mean that one should not go to Vojvodina  after Belgrade?    [Thurmer] After Belgrade yes, but not on a separate  occasion, and not on 15 March, and particularly not on this 15  March. The ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders should  not be involved in the election campaign. The question is much  more complex. The Hungarians are able to celebrate the  anniversary of 15 March perfectly without Mr. Jeszenszky.    [Moricz] You also criticize this government's national  minority policy within our borders. You recently apologized to  the national minorities in Hungary for this government's  mistakes. You claim that this government's national minority  policy is bad because it encourages the national minorities to  create efficient organizations. In reality, it wants to hinder  their unity with this. Do you seriously believe this?    [Thurmer] Everything that is good in the situation of  national minorities in Hungary has already been good so far, and  the new things are bad. The general situation is worse in areas  and counties with national minorities. The national minorities  have more rights in the sense that they can set up  self-government bodies, but no one knows what will happen to  these bodies and whether there is the money for them. The law  is hypocritical from the outset, because the law that was  eventually adopted is not the one sent to the European  Parliament.    [Moricz] In your opinion, the national minorities also think  that the Kadar regime was better for them. Did your talks with  these people convince you of this?    [Thurmer] Of course.    [Moricz] Whom do you regard as a personal example among the  major leaders of the workers' movement?    [Thurmer] I do not have models.    [Moricz] ??? [punctuation as published]    [Thurmer] I follow my own road and we follow our own road.  That is the most reliable one.</p>

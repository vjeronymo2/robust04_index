			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Observer: AMP points the way If Britain can hire Aussie Bill McLennan to run its Central Statistical Office, it is only right that Australia can pinch a top British fund manager to show it how to invest. Even so, putting the Postel's Andrew Threadgold in charge of all the Australian and overseas investment operations of AMP, Australia's equivalent of the Prudential, is a surprisingly adventurous move. The 48-year-old Threadgold's sole previous connection with Australia was a four-year stint in Melbourne while he earned a doctorate. Admittedly, Threadgold is not a typical life company fund manager. He worked at the International Wool Secretariat and the Bank of England before joining Postel, where he's responsible for Pounds 19bn of funds. That said, giving him charge of AMP's Pounds 25bn must have put quite a few Australian fund managers' noses out of joint. AMP may have outgrown Australia and be keen to centralise its international fund management in London, but 60 per cent of its money is still in Australia, and Threadgold will be in London. It will be interesting to see whether Threadgold, an outspoken advocate of shareholder activism, will continue to shake the corporate governance tree. There are plenty of easy targets in Australia.</p>

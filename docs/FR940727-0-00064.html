			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. The SJA or legal adviser will assist the DOJ or DA attorney responsible for the litigation. Installation attorneys or support personnel should begin accumulating relevant documentary evidence and identifying witnesses. If requested, installation attorneys will prepare a legal memorandum concerning the motion, giving particular attention to the following issues relevant to a court granting injunctive relief: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief is not granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Harm to defendant and other parties if injunctive relief is granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.20  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Habeas Corpus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. A soldier may file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his continued custody (usually in a post court-martial situation) or retention in the Army. As is the case with injunctive relief in the preceding paragraph, installation SJAs and legal advisers must take immediate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notification to Litigation Division and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will notify Litigation Division and the responsible U.S. Attorney's Office immediately upon learning that a petition for writ of habeas corpus has been filed. All relevant documentary evidence supporting the challenged action should be assembled immediately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Procedures in habeas corpus. Upon the filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court will dismiss the petition, issue the writ, or order the respondent to show cause why it should not be granted. If a writ or order to show cause is issued, the SJA or legal adviser should be prepared to assist the responsible Litigation Division or DOJ attorney in preparing a return and answer. If so directed, the SJA will also prepare a memorandum of points and authorities to accompany the return and answer. The government's response should cover the following: whether the Army has custody of petitioner; whether respondent and petitioner are within the judicial district; and, whether appellate or administrative remedies have been exhausted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Writs or orders issued by state courts. No state court, after being judicially informed that a petitioner is in custody under the authority of the United States, should interfere with that custody or require that petitioner be brought before the state court. A deserter, apprehended by any civil officer having authority to apprehend offenders under the laws of the United States or of any state, district, territory, or possession of the United States, is in custody by authority of the United States. If a writ of habeas corpus is issued by a state court, the SJA or legal adviser will seek guidance from Litigation Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Foreign court orders. A foreign court should not inquire into the legality of restraint of a person held by U.S. military authority. If a foreign court issues any process in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, the SJA or legal adviser will immediately report the matter to the appropriate U.S. forces commander and to Litigation Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.21  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Litigation against government contractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. A contract might require that the government reimburse a contractor (or subcontractor) for adverse judgments or litigation expenses. Unless a contractor or subcontractor facing a lawsuit requests representation by DOJ, the Army presumes the contractor will obtain private counsel to defend the case. If the contract so allows, however, the contractor may request and HQDA may recommend that DOJ represent the contractor if it is in the best interests of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Actions by SJA or legal adviser. If a contractor or subcontractor faces litigation and the underlying contract with the government requires reimbursement for adverse judgments or costs of the litigation, the SJA or legal adviser, through the contracting officer, should determine if the contractor desires representation by DOJ. If so, the contractor or authorized agent will sign a request for representation. (See Figure D&hyph;3, Appendix G, of this part.) The SJA or legal adviser will determine whether, in his opinion, representation by DOJ should be granted. He will prepare a memorandum to support his recommendation, especially concerning any issue regarding the government's obligation to reimburse the contractor under the contract. The SJA or legal adviser will forward his memorandum, along with the contractor's request, to Litigation Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Actions by Litigation Division. The Chief, Litigation Division, will evaluate the submission and decide if it is in the Army's best interest that the request be granted. He will prepare a memorandum supporting his decision and send the packet to DOJ. The Chief's decision constitutes the final DA position on the matter. If DOJ grants the contractor's request, the Chief, Litigation Division, will ensure that the contractor is notified through the SJA or legal adviser and the contracting officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Private Counsel. A contractor represented by DOJ may ask that private counsel assist the DOJ attorney in the litigation. The DOJ attorney will remain in control of the litigation, and the fees for private counsel will not be reimbursable except under unusual circumstances. The contractor must seek both DOJ and DA approval to employ private counsel when DOJ representation has been granted. Even if DOJ and DA grant authority to employ private counsel, the contracting officer will determine whether a contractor will be reimbursed under the contract for private counsel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Settlement. The contractor, unless the contract specifies otherwise, will ultimately decide whether to compromise a suit. Reimbursement under the contract is determined by the contracting officer, with the advice of his attorney. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous reporting requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SJAs or legal advisers will comply with the directives cited below concerning actual or prospective litigation involving the following types of cases: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Taxation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Contractor transactions. (FAR and DFARS, 48 CFR parts 29 and 229). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) activities. (AR 60&hyph;20). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Purchase or sale of alcoholic beverages. (AR 215&hyph;2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

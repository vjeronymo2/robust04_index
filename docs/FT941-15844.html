			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Headteachers 'snub inner cities' Inner city secondary schools are having difficulty attracting headteachers, a survey by Oxford Brookes University reveals today. The finding adds to fears of an inner city 'cycle' of social deprivation and demoralised teachers, raised by Ofsted, the education watchdog, in a report published last year. Mr John Howson, the author of the Oxford Brookes survey, said 25 per cent of headships advertised in England and Wales last year had to be re-advertised. In Tower Hamlets, all nine vacancies had to be readvertised. Inner city schools also find it difficult to retain headteachers, according to Oxford Brookes. Over the last 10 years, nine of the 12 inner London boroughs have replaced more than 80 per cent of their secondary headteachers, with Hackney replacing all of them. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said the results were not surprising. It demonstrated the increased pressures on inner city schools since exam league tables and the Ofsted inspection service had been introduced.</p>

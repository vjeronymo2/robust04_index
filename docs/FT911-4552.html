			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Michelin announces Pounds 524m losses MICHELIN, the world's largest and most indebted tyre maker, yesterday announced a FFr5.27bn (Pounds 524m) net loss for last year and warned that the full benefits of its cost-cutting drive would not show until 1993. The loss, caused by a plunge in tyre demand, a rise in finance charges and the dollar's fall, compares with a FFr2.65bn net profit the previous year and is slightly smaller than the group had earlier forecast. It includes a FFr3.36bn exceptional charge for the cost of more than 16,000 job reductions - 15 per cent of the total - to be made worldwide in the two years to the end of 1992. The job cuts will be equally split between the US and Europe, where Michelin last week announced 4,900 job losses. It has also announced job cuts in the US, but warns that it has not yet reached its target. No jobs cuts are planned in Asia and Japan, the group's only growth market. Michelin expects to make another loss this year, forecast at FFr1bn to FFr2bn by securities analysts, but estimates that it will start to break even towards the end of 1991, assuming an upturn in the US market, which absorbs 40 per cent of sales. Turnover rose 13.6 per cent from FFr55.25bn in 1989 to FFr67.73bn last year, mainly because of the first contribution from Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre maker which Michelin bought at the end of 1989. Sales fell an average 5.6 per cent in the first three months of this year, with the North American market declining twice as fast as Europe. Michelin says it is not losing market share - slightly more than 20 per cent of the world total. The cost of the Dollars 1.5bn Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition drove debts up from FFr22bn to FFr28.5bn last year, with gearing up from 116 per cent to 161 per cent of shareholders' funds. Michelin warns that debts will rise in 1991, as it pays for its restructuring, but will turn down next year. Gearing rises to an estimated 280 per cent if FFr5.5bn of subordinated loans are counted as debt, estimated Mr Bob Barber, analyst at James Capel in London. At that level, it is hard to see how Michelin can turn the corner without reconstructing its capital or selling a large part of the business, he said. However, Michelin has no plans to sell industrial activities and said it did not wish to consider issuing fresh capital until it had convinced investors that it was on the road to profitability.

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / French assembly split on Maastricht THE French debate on ratifying the Maastricht Treaty on European Union heated up yesterday after the French national assembly voted down two procedural attempts to have the whole exercise thrown out as being unconstitutional. Both these fundamentally anti-Maastricht moves, one from the Gaullist right-wing and one from the communists, were rejected by wide margins. The motion tabled by Mr Philippe Seguin, a standard-bearer of the nationalist wing of the Gaullist Party, was defeated by 396 to 101; while the communist motion was defeated by 411 to 54. The votes against the Maastricht Treaty were much larger than the government had been expecting, and suggest that the necessary constitutional reform and ratification of the Treaty could after all turn out to be closely-run. As it is, the government has already been forced to give ground to opposition protests that it tried to ram through the constitutional revision at unreasonable speed during the preliminary committee stage. As a result the full national assembly debate, which was to have been concluded tonight, is being extended with an additional day's discussion next Tuesday, and will then be wound up with a vote. But if the size of the two anti-Maastricht votes in the national assembly is moderately worrying for the Socialist government, it is deeply disturbing for the right-wing Gaullist party, because it has again opened up the deep split over the issue of Europe which has traditionally run right down the middle of the party. Before the debate, Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the Gaullists, attempted a compromise with tepid support for the Treaty and modest criticism of the constitutional revision, which he hoped would satisfy both the pro- and anti-Europeans in the party. But his attempt to forge a facade of unity in the party has now been blown apart by the fiercest debate on France's European destiny since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Nearly half the Gaullist contingent in the national assembly (58 out of 126 members) voted for the Seguin motion, and 16 Gaullists even voted for the communist motion. Some commentators play down the operational significance of yesterday's votes. The Gaullists knew the anti-European motions would be defeated, so they could afford a display of anti-European and anti-government ill-temper; but next Tuesday the more prudent members may fall back into line behind the leadership. As a potential candidate in the next presidential elections, Mr Chirac will find it more difficult to pose as a constructive if prudent European statesman when nearly half his parliamentary party appears implacably opposed to the whole enterprise.</p>

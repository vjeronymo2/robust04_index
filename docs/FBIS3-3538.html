Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen's transport and telecom  industry has kept up with the pace of its fast-increasing  economy.    In 1993, the city planned 224 major projects for  transportation and telecommunications, with a total investment  of 2.43 billion yuan plus 72.8 million U.S. dollars.    The gross volume for freight transportation handled in 1993  topped 7.4 billion tons/km, and over 4.7 billion persons/km for  passenger transport, sturdy rises of 36.3 percent and 16.6  percent from the previous year, respectively. The transit of  passengers by air hit 2.55 million people, an increase of 53.5  percent.    The total output value of the posts and telecommunications  sector jumped by 47.5 percent to 1.74 billion yuan.    Shenzhen also gained ground in infrastructural construction,  including the building of an airport, seaports, highways and  railways.    Port construction such as that on Yantian Port also gained  momentum last year. The first phase of the Yantian Port  construction, an overseas-funded project with a total investment  of nearly four billion yuan, is now in its final stage. And the  contract for the second phase also has been signed.    So far, the roadbed for the Meilin-Guanlan Expressway has  been completed, and the northern section of the district's fast  ring road has been opened to traffic. The construction of  another expressway from Shenzhen airport to Heao is expected to  be started soon, while that of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway  is in its final stage.    The city also set up five new district telephone exchange  branches and about 10 post offices in 1993. It also built and  expanded 31 wireless telephone stations last year.    Now in Shenzhen, there are 38 bus-lines, over one thousand  buses and some 20,000 taxi cabs.    The city airport has opened 47 air routes to 46 big cities.    According to a city transportation official, the city  government is planning to build Shenzhen into an international  passenger and freight transportation hub.    He says the focus will be on establishment of some trans-  professional, trans-regional and transnational transport and  telecommunications group companies to boost the booming industry.    The official predicts that the passenger and freight  transportation this year will rise to 112.3 million people and  23 million tons respectively. The port throughput in 1994 will  double the figure of 25.4 million tons last year.    The total output value in the posts and telecommunications  sector is expected to hit over two billion yuan this year, says  the official.</p>

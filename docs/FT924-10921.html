			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper mining projects attract big spenders SOME VERY high prices are being paid for copper mining projects, according to Mr Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge, the world's second-biggest producer of the metal. He quotes three examples: Lac Minerals of Canada is to pay USDollars 70m for 52.5 per cent of the Lisheen copper project in Ireland which Phelps values at Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m; Minorco, part of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is to pay Dollars 185m for a one-third stake in the Colahausi project in Chile which Phelps believes is worth Dollars 100m; Placer Dome, another Canadian group, is to pay Dollars 100m for a 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar project, also in Chile, which Phelps values at less than Dollars 50m. Mr Yearley is also concerned about the number of newcomers to copper mining, particularly those gold companies switching to the base metal. At a private meeting with analysts during London Metals Week he described these gold companies as 'amateurs' because copper was 'not their natural business'. His remarks were so aggressive they were bound to be repeated and become a big talking point in the metals markets. He told the analysts Phelps would not become involved in bidding up the price of mineral properties. It was better to explore for properties than to buy at present - Phelps was spending Dollars 35m a year on exploration. Discussing the Colahausi project, where Billiton, the Royal Dutch/Shell mining and metals business, and Falconbridge, the Canadian company jointly owned by Norada of Canada and Sweden's Trelleborg, are also involved, Mr Yearley pointed out that copper had never been mined at such a height - the deposit is about 15,000 feet above sea level - and it was on the wrong side of the Andes mountains. Whereas Chile's successful Escondida copper mine was sending ore for processing in a slurry via pipelines down to the sea, Colahausi could not use this cost-saving technique. The price paid for the Zaldivar stake, acquired by Placer Dome from Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group which retains the other 50 per cent, could be justified only if the copper price stayed at Dollars 1.15 a lb for the long term. Phelps, always conservative, used a long-term copper price of 85 cents a lb for its valuations he said, while RTZ Corporation of the UK, another big copper producer, used 91 cents. Mr Eliseo Gonzalez-Urien, Placer Dome's vice-president, exploration, yesterday vigorously defended his company's proposed purchase of the Zaldivar stake. Placer Dome did not make long-term price forecasts but looked at production costs. If Zaldivar performed 'as advertised,' its production costs would be among the lowest in the world at 35 US cents to 55 cents a lb. Copper at Zaldivar was near the surface and could be recovered by the low-cost solvent extraction-electro winning process for the first several years. The Dollars 500m investment would be paid back to the joint venturer company in three years, Placer would be paid back in about five years while the mine was expected to have a very long life, perhaps 50 years. 'Buying a copper mine is not like shopping for a pair of shoes where you can walk up the high street comparing prices in several stores,' said Mr Gonzalez-Urien. 'You pay what you think it is worth to you. Phelps Dodge, as an established copper company, obviously has a different view to us.' At his presentation, Mr Yearley said Phelps expected a copper supply surplus of about 100,000 tonnes this year and next. Even so, prices next year should range between 90 cents and Dollars 1.10 a lb. He suggested 1994 would be a good year for the copper producers because production would stabilise while consumption by then should be receiving a boost from a recovery in world economic activity.</p>

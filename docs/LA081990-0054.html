			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN WHO KILL;  </P> <P> BOY, 9, LIVES WITH HORROR OF KILLING FATHER  </P> <P> The boy was 8 years old when he killed his father, plunging a kitchen knife  into the back of the man who had taken him fishing and taught him how to play  baseball.  </P> <P> He is 9 years old now, and though he remembers every moment of that horrible  night -- how his father attacked his mother, how he went to the kitchen to get  the knife, how his father cried out when he was stabbed -- the child does not  quite believe that his father is dead.  </P> <P> "He kept repeating recently he's not coming back like he was hoping he might,"  said his psychiatrist, Dr. Marianne Krouk.  </P> <P> "He's not emotionally ready to come to terms with the loss. He still has  fantasies about going to reunions with his dad. He's trying to step back from  that by saying he was a no-good alcoholic and should have been gone."  </P> <P> At a time when he should be accumulating childhood memories of school days and  favorite pets, this light-haired, slightly built boy -- his name is being  withheld because of his age -- is saddled with memories of patricide that will  scar him for life.  </P> <P> "I think there are great consequences for the future even if he . . . manages  to . . . do well in his daily life," Krouk said. "I think he's at risk for  suicide, just by overwhelming guilt and coming to terms that he took his  father's life and maybe he doesn't deserve to live."  </P> <P> It happened on March 31. The boy's mother, Monica Jones, 36, testified before a  coroner's inquest that her 59-year-old husband, William, choked her in bed  while accusing her of "running around." She denied it.  </P> <P> "I'm going to kill you tonight," he told her.  </P> <P> They drove to the home of a man who, the husband said, had told him he was  being cuckolded. The man denied saying it, and before the Joneses left, Monica  Jones told the man her husband was going to kill her.  </P> <P> "We went home," Monica Jones said. "He threw the keys at me, wanted me to put  the key in the lock and I wouldn't. He choked me. He said: 'You want to put the  key in,' and I shook my head yes. He let me up. I screamed hard and he grabbed  me again and we were on the glider and he choked me again."  </P> <P> His mother's screams awakened the boy from a couch in the living room.  </P> <P> He told police he thought that "she was going to get hurt or something. I  thought he was going to get the gun like he did last time," when Jones pointed  a rifle at his wife's head last September while the boy watched.  </P> <P> The boy said he did not look outside to see what was happening but ran into the  kitchen and got an 8 1/2-inch filet knife.  </P> <P> "My mom was sitting on the glider and my dad was about to choke her when I put  the knife in his back." He said he feared for his own safety as well as his  mother's: "I didn't want him to hurt me."  </P> <P> "He said: 'Ow.' He said: 'Mom, he put a knife in my back,' " the boy told  police in a taped statement.  </P> <P> Monica Jones recalled that she looked up and told her son to get help. She  picked up a baseball bat and hit her husband across the shoulders so he  couldn't go after the boy. "He was going to get up," she said.  </P> <P> The boy ran to a neighbor's house. "I ran because I didn't want him to come  after me. I saw the light over there so I went there and said: 'My dad was  beating up my mom,' and they let me in so I could call the police. I didn't  want to go back outside because I thought he still might be out there."  </P> <P> Jones was dead at the scene.  </P> <P> The coroner's jury cleared the boy in the stabbing; authorities urged a finding  of justifiable homicide, and the stories told by the boy and his mother were  corroborated by a pathologist's testimony that Jones was legally intoxicated  and by the fact that Monica Jones had bruises on her neck and chin.  </P> <P> Seeing his father in death at the funeral home, the boy said he looked as he  did all the time. Krouk recalled that the boy "kept saying: 'He just looked  like he was sleeping,' like he was wishing he would get up."  </P> <P> That the boy would grieve for such a father might be surprising to some. But  there is evidence that William Jones was not always a monster; Monica Jones  testified that her marriage had gone downhill just in the last two years, when  her husband's drinking had increased.  </P> <P> Baseball tied father and son together. They had planned for the father to coach  his son's Little League team this season, and the boy still regrets that it  never came to pass.  </P> <P> But he also remembers the time he tried to explain to his father how to play a  Nintendo game. Apparently threatened by his son's facility with the game, the  father did not want to hear about it. He slapped the boy.  </P> <P> "He can't understand why he would hurt him," Krouk said.  </P> <P> The killing and its aftermath have been especially hard for this little boy  because he wants most of all to do well. His third-grade teacher, Vada Damaska,  says he is an avid reader who loves baseball and football stories, a  well-liked, clean-cut boy who made all A's and Bs.  </P> <P> "I used to tease him that he could take over for me," she said. "He knew what  was going on in the classroom because he always paid close attention."  </P> <P> "He's very concerned about getting A's, doing well, and he doesn't enjoy being  perceived as a bad kid . . . " Krouk said. "He has a well-developed conscience"  and "is going to suffer, I think, with recurring depression."  </P> <P> After his father's death, the boy acted up in ways he had never done before. He  screamed at his mother and was unwilling to do daily chores.  </P> <P> "He does have a lot of anger that borders on rage," Krouk said.  </P> <P> Eventually, the doctor says, he may revile his mother because she did not  shield him from a "situation where he was forced to witness abuse and violence  and hear a lot of things that a kid his age shouldn't have to deal with."  </P> <P> And eventually, Krouk says, the boy will ask himself: "How could I take another  life?" He is at risk for suicidal depression on the one hand, and alcoholism  and antisocial behavior on the other, Krouk says.  </P> <P> For now, he is trying to get on with his life. He joined that Little League  team that his father had intended to coach; his new coach told the other kids  that he was there to play ball and that was all they were going to talk to him  about. Talk of the stabbing would mean dismissal from the team.  </P></p>

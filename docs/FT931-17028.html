			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Skiing: Hidden menace of summer meadows JUST BEFORE the snows came in Switzerland's picturesque Grisons region, the farmers of Davos and Klosters brought their herds of cattle down from the Alpine pastures in a ceremony known locally as die Schwiegermutter begraben  -'burying the mother-in-law'. The mother-in-law, in this slightly uncomfortable analogy, is the symbol of the barren and empty alp. The arrival of snow changes the whole personality of a ski resort. Most skiers rarely worry about what lies beneath the snow they are skiing on. But it is often useful for high-mountain guides to 'walk' off-piste terrain during the summer or early autumn months to complement the understanding of snow conditions, depths and hidden hazards they may encounter with skiers during the winter. It is especially useful in glacier regions to gauge the extent and drift of crevasses. Seeing a ski resort without snow can be a fascinating experience. The universally-feared Streiff run on Kitzbuhel's Hahnenkamm looks almost idyllic without the layer of sheet-ice deliberately engineered to prevent racers breaking through and catching a potentially-disastrous edge. Zermatt's steep slopes are awash with colour as wild flowers delight the eye and scent the breeze. Like a steep-sided meadow, the dreaded Gotschnawang area in Klosters - where five years ago an avalanche killed Major Hugh Lindsay and came close to engulfing his friend, the Prince of Wales - looked extraordinarily bland and innocent as the late afternoon sun lingered lazily on its leafy banks. It is dangerous because it is prone to avalanche rather than because it is technically difficult. We walked up and over the great Grisons alps between Davos and Arosa, a tour undertaken over a century ago by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the first Briton to accomplish this route on skis. His wife was being treated for tuberculosis at a clinic in Davos, a town that acquired a name as a centre where TB sufferers could convalesce. In Conan Doyle's day, Davos was just beginning to earn its reputation as one of Europe's classic winter sports regions, a natural progression from its earlier fame as a health resort. The walk is long and arduous but the scenery, wild flowers and plants are sufficiently stirring to compensate. Occasionally we glimpsed giant ski-lift pylons in the distance which seemed out of place without snow on the ground. Conan Doyle made light of his epic tour in an article he wrote for Strand Magazine 100 years ago. 'You adjust your body for a rapid slide', he wrote, 'but your 'ski' stick motionless and over you go upon your face. Or you stop for an instant to tell a group how well you are getting on and they suddenly find that their congratulations are addressed to the soles of your 'ski' tied tightly round your neck]' His ski tour de force was only one of many 'firsts' at Europe's highest town (5,118ft) and Switzerland's largest ski resort. The first English ski club was formed here in 1903 and the world's first tow bar was built by a young German engineer, Gerhard Mueller, with the help of some old motor cycle parts. In 1931, the first funicular railway specifically for skiers was installed up to the Weissfluhjoch and three years later Erich Constam installed the world's first 'proper' drag lift. Some of Europe's first recreational skis were tried out here, too. A pair found their way to Davos from Norway and the village carpenter set out to try to make duplicates. Some of the local youths tried them out and struggled manfully to control them, in spite of their vast length and lack of edges. Although it is famous principally for its Parsenn mountain (skiing up to 9,300 ft), the long run down to Kublis and beyond (14 km) and the exhilarating Derby run down to Kublis or Klosters, Davos has a wealth of skiing spread in almost all directions. There are five main ski areas - Parsenn, Jakobshorn, Rinerhorn, Schatzalp/Strelpass and Pischa, with almost 90 runs between them totalling 320 kilometres of pistes. The Madrissa side of Klosters provides gentler skiing and an opportunity to make moderately easy tours into Austria's Silvretta region. The Parsenn/Weissfluh slopes provide the heart of the Davos skiing, linking with Strela above Davos Platz and the Gotschna area above Klosters. There are long, picturesque and not particularly difficult runs fanning out in almost all directions. Some of the north-facing runs down to Klosters are testing, particularly Drostobel. And, of course, there is always the Wang. If it is open, ski it. If it is closed, stay well away. As for the tour to Arosa, it is doubtless easier, cheaper and safer in summer than winter. After all, climbing on skins is much more difficult than bounding up in decent walking boots. Arnold Wilson travelled up and down the mountains between Davos and Arosa on skis in winter and on foot in summer as a guest of the Swiss Travel Service, Bridge House, Ware, Hertfordshire SG12 9DE.

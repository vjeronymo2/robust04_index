			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: UN need for a disaster relief office Sir, Julian Ozanne writes (Personal View, August 10) that 'for several years there has been a suggestion that a well-funded disaster relief office be set up at the UN.' As a consultant to the secretary-general in 1987 I made such a proposal, intended as a first step in the establishment of a permanent, powerful body, under the authority of the secretary-general, to lead the world's action on disasters. I made other suggestions on how the UN could be ahead of emergencies, as far as possible, abandoning the method of ad hoc response after the event which had been standard procedure, and sadly still is. My proposal was hardly novel, being based on the UN experience of humanitarian operations, gained over many years, and not least through my friend, the late Sir Robert Jackson, probably the greatest leader in humanitarian emergencies the UN, and indeed the world, has ever had. There were also the remarkable achievements of Maurice Strong and Bradford Morse, organisers of the widely acclaimed UN office for emergency operations in Africa. The secretary-general did not adopt my main recommendations, no doubt because he considered that the member governments were not ready to face up to the implications for international organisations. Julian Ozanne's many other proposals have already been put forward by experts over the years. The actions required have long been understood. What we do not have are decisions, which must be by member governments through the UN. If governments will not act, the secretary-general can try to persuade. An ironic footnote to Mr Ozanne's main suggestion is that the new secretary-general did indeed appoint a disaster relief co-ordinator, Mr Jan Eliasson, on March 1 this year, as part of the re-organisation of the UN. Given the problem I describe, Mr Eliasson has hardly been heard from, not surprisingly since he will not have had an opportunity to play a significant role in the terrible problem of Somalia.

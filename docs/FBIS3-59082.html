This involves weapons and ammunition worth 450 million  Finnish Marks granted in a supplementary budget last year.  Finland is to receive portable anti-aircraft missiles, among  other things. The deliveries will be specified in a couple of  weeks, the Defense Ministry says. The total Russian debt to  Finland is just over 6 billion Finnish Marks.</p>

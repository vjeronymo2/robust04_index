			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Missile bid believed near for Northrop NORTHROP, the US defence contractor, is believed to be close to joining French state-owned arms maker Thomson-CSF in its Dollars 300m bid for the missile business of LTV Corporation, the US steel company. Thomson has been hurriedly talking with three US companies - Northrop, Raytheon and Loral - in an attempt to find a US partner before a government committee advising President George Bush on the security implications of the French bid hands over its recommendations next month. Sources close to the negotiations said yesterday that if Thomson clinched a deal with a US partner it was most likely to be with Northrop, which has already agreed to buy 49 per cent of LTV's aircraft business from Thomson's partner, the Washington-based Carlyle Group of investors. If a deal is struck, it will be announced in the next few days. Thomson has been forced to seek US participation in its acquisition of the LTV missile division because of US government concern that foreign ownership of a US defence contractor might compromise national security. US defence chiefs are particularly unhappy about allowing LTV's missile operations to fall into the hands of a company controlled by a foreign government. Thomson is 58 per cent owned by the French state. Thomson hopes that if it can persuade a US partner to take over the management of the missile operations, leaving the French group as a passive investor, US fears about national security will be assuaged. If Thomson failed to find a partner, however, the Dollars 300m deal could be scrapped. Northrop and Thomson CSF would not confirm that they were nearing a deal yesterday. Both companies said that they were 'exploring opportunities' with each other, and declined to comment on the progress of the discussions or on when they were likely to be concluded. Thomson stressed its regret at 'the disproportion between what for us was a simple business opportunity and the row that has blown up in US political circles'. Congressmen in Washington have recently expressed their opposition to Thomson's proposed acquisition of LTV's missile division. Last month the House armed services committee cited reports that the sale of arms to Iraq by the French group may have breached US or French export laws as justification for blocking the bid. Thomson denies breaking US or French export laws.</p>

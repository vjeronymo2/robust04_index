			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Restricted growth at Isotron A sharp reduction in interest receivable restricted growth in first-half profits at Isotron, the sterilisation company. Profits were Pounds 1.51m pre-tax for the six months to end-December, compared with Pounds 1.44m previously. Interest income fell from Pounds 192,000 to Pounds 100,000, reflecting the combined effect of lower interest rates and the group's investment in a new plant in Ireland. Operating profits were almost 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1.25m), helped by higher volumes in medical sterilisation, which accounts for more than half of sales. However, Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said the group's biological and chemical businesses had shown little growth because of weak European demand. Total turnover increased by 10 per cent, from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 3.79m. Mr Clive said most of the capital expenditure on the Irish plant had been made, and it was on schedule for trials at the end of April. The plant is expected to incur a small loss in the final quarter as the trials are carried out. Earnings per share were 8.1p (7.8p). The interim dividend is increased to 1.66p (1.51p.)</p>

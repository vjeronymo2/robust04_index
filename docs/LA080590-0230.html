			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: TAKING THE MYSTERY OUT OF LISTING TERMS;  </P> <P> HOME SALES: THERE ARE SEVERAL CHOICES FOR THE HOMEOWNER WHEN CONTRACTING WITH A  REAL ESTATE AGENT TO SELL PROPERTY.  </P> <P> If you are thinking of selling your home, it will pay to spend a few minutes  considering the pros and cons of your listing choices.  </P> <P> To a real estate agent, a property listing is inventory. It costs the agent  nothing. But a fairly priced listing gives the agent control of an asset that,  if the agent does his or her job well, should produce a handsome sales  commission.  </P> <P> A listing is a contract between the real estate owner and a realty agent  whereby the seller agrees to pay the agent a fee for selling the property on  acceptable terms. But there are several types of listings, with different legal  consequences, for the seller and agent.  </P> <P> 1 -- Open listings. From a real estate agent's viewpoint, the worst type of  listing is the open listing. It is a written or oral invitation by a property  owner to one or more real estate agents to find a buyer on terms acceptable to  the seller. The first agent to bring a purchase contract, which the seller  accepts, earns the entire sales commission.  </P> <P> But an open listing is really no listing. At first glance, the open listing  might seem attractive to agents. However, if the owner finds a buyer without an  agent's help, then the seller owes no sales commission. Or the property owner  can withdraw the property from the market and owe no fee to an agent.  </P> <P> Because of this lack of control over the sale, most realty agents will work on  open listings only if the potential commission is large and there is nothing  else to do on a rainy day. Few agents will advertise or spend much time on open  listings.  </P> <P> 2 -- Exclusive listings. An exclusive listing means the owner has listed the  property for sale with just one real estate agent. However, there are two types  of exclusive listings:  </P> <P> Exclusive right to sell. Regardless of who finds a buyer for the property,  whether it is the seller, the listing agent or a selling agent, the listing  agent will earn the sales commission. Of course, if two agents are involved in  the sale, they split the sales fee.  </P> <P> Most realty agents prefer this type of listing, because it gives the agent  maximum control over the sale. For this reason, agents gladly invest their time  and money in the sale of a property listed on an exclusive right to sell.  </P> <P> Most real estate agents don't want property owners to know about an exclusive  agency listing. It earns the exclusive agent a sales commission if the listing  agent, or any other licensee, finds an acceptable buyer for the property.  </P> <P> However, if the property owner finds a buyer without the help of a licensed  real estate agent, then the listing agent does not earn a sales commission. In  other words, this type of listing creates a race between the owner and the  exclusive agent to find a buyer.  </P> <P> 3 -- Multiple listings. This is not really a type of listing. A multiple  listing is either an exclusive right to sell, or an exclusive agency listing,  which is submitted to the local multiple listing service (MLS) for distribution  to all member real estate brokers.  </P> <P> The MLS is a cooperative organization, often run by the local Board of  Realtors, for sharing listings to give them the widest possible market exposure  to agents who may have buyers looking for the exclusively listed property.  </P> <P> The MLS does not accept open listings from the general public. Computers are  widely used by local MLS members to quickly distribute the listings to members  who also usually receive weekly MLS books with photos of all current listings.  The MLS is considered a major marketing tool by agents and their sellers.  </P> <P> 4 -- Net listings. A dangerous variation of an exclusive listing is the net  listing, where the property owner specifies the net amount desired for the  property and any amount received above this minimum becomes the agent's  commission. Net listings are illegal in some states, but are legal in  California.  </P> <P> To illustrate, suppose you sign a $100,000 net listing for your property. If  your realty agent obtains a $120,000 offer, you will feel cheated and might  refuse to accept unless the agent cuts his $20,000 commission. However, if the  agent receives a $100,000 purchase offer, the agent will earn nothing and might  be tempted to forget to deliver such a low offer to you. The best way to avoid  these net listing pitfalls is to exclusively list your property for sale at its  fair market value, based on recent sales prices of nearby comparable  properties.  </P> <P> By knowing your real estate listing alternatives, you can decide which type of  listing is best for you. For most home sellers the exclusive right to sell  listing is best, because it gives the realty agent maximum sales incentive.  Such a listing should be submitted by the agent to the local multiple listing  service for maximum market exposure.  </P></p>

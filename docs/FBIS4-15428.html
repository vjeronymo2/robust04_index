			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian </F> Cabinet of Ministers in Jurmala on 6 April]    [Text] On April 6, 1994 of this year, the Government of the  Republic of Latvia received at its disposal decree No. 174  signed by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin on April 5,  in which the Russian Federation President has consented to the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defence proposal, approved by the  Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, concerning the  establishment of military bases in the territories of the CIS  and the Republic of Latvia, in order to ensure the security of  the Russian Federation and the previously mentioned nations, as  well as to test new armaments and military equipment. The  Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with  the Ministry of Defence and other interested Russian Federation  ministries and departments, has been charged with negotiating  with the CIS and the Republic of Latvia, and to conclude the  reached agreements by means of the appropriate documentation.    In this connection, the Government of the Republic of Latvia  states that the substance of the decree by the Russian  Federation president is in stark contrast with the draft  agreement on Russian troop withdrawal from the Republic of  Latvia prepared by the delegations of the Republic of Latvia and  the Russian Federation, and initialed in Moscow on March 15,  1994. It can be regarded as an unwillingness by the Russian  Federation to sign these jointly prepared and initialed draft  agreements, and subordinate covenants.    The Government of the Republic of Latvia categorically  states  that it has not agreed to, does not agree to, and will never  agree to the establishment of Russian Federation military bases,  or to the testing of new armaments and military equipment in the  territory of the Republic of Latvia, and rejects the possibility  of any discussion on these issues. The Russian Federation does  not have the right to wailfully undertake to guarantee the  security of the Republic of Latvia.    The decree by the Russian president fundamentally changes  the  international political and military situation in Eastern  Europe. The Government of Latvia regards this decree as open  submission to pressures from Russia's reactionary imperialistic  circles.    That Russia wants to establish its military bases in Latvia  proves that the goals of specifically these forces were not met  in the March 15 initialed agreements. They are now attempting  to make these agreements inconceivable.    The fact that these intentions have gained support in the  Russian Federation president's decree, is a heavy blow to the  international community's and the Republic of Latvia's ability  to trust in the course of Russia's foreign policy and the  foreign policy's compliance to internationally accepted norms.    The Government of Latvia is evaluating its further policy in  relation to Russia and will take commensurate countermeasures to  any attempts to threaten Latvia's sovereignty.    The Government of the Republic of Latvia requests  explanations from the Russian Federation regarding this decree  and reserves the right to inform the governments of countries  around the world and international institutions about the  changes of Russia's position on the issue of Russia's troop  withdrawal.    The Government of Latvia once again requests that the  Russian  Government without delay and unquestioningly withdraw all army  and military personnel who are located illegally in the  territory of the Republic of Latvia.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SECOND HELPINGS;  </P> <P> GUSTAV ANDERS NOW SERVING UP EXCELLENT FOOD, GOOD SERVICE  </P> <P> Last summer, I experienced mild disappointment at Gustav Anders, the La Jolla  transplant that was expected to become one of Orange County's best restaurants.  Today, I'm happy to say that it has begun to realize its potential.  </P> <P> The sparse, rustic design makes for one of the area's most striking dining  rooms, and the outdoor patio is a pleasant place to have lunch. Maitre d' Bill  Magnuson (Gustav is his middle name) is a solicitous, able host, and he  obviously has solved any problems with his staff. Service here, once spotty and  indifferent, is now nearly perfect.  </P> <P> Ulf Strandberg (the Anders in the equation) is a creative and original chef,  and he seems to have ironed out the inconsistencies as well. The same good  breads such as Swedish limpa, Italian country white, brown crispbread and the  world-class onion rolls still accompany all meals, and the menu still changes  daily. But the food is more self-assured now, far more reliable. Apparently,  Strandberg just needed time to settle in.  </P> <P> At lunchtime, the dining room is airy and elegant, usually full to the brim  with a well-dressed, professionally proper crowd. Wonderful appetizers like  house pickled herring (served with Vasterbotten cheese from the north of  Sweden) and a puffy wild rice pancake with smoked salmon, golden caviar and  creme fraiche are fine al fresco choices. Salads of minced parsley with  sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and parmesan have irresistible lightness.  </P> <P> A wide variety of main dishes, French, Italian and Scandinavian-inspired, are  available to tempt you, but I would go with Strandberg's strong suit, the  cooking of his native Sweden. His sugar-and-salt-cured salmon is sheer delight,  with creamed, pearl-sized bits of steamed potato, speckled with fresh dill,  that are a revelation. The good desserts, Swedish cakes and homemade ice  creams, are by Piret's of San Diego.  </P> <P> GUSTAV ANDERS  </P> <P> 3610 S. Plaza Drive, South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana  </P> <P> (714) 668-1737  </P> <P> Open every day from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. All major credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

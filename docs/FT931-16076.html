			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Honda to supply Indy car engines HONDA, the Japanese car-maker, is to begin supplying engines for motor racing in North America in 1994. The announcement that it will participate in the US Indy Car World Series follows only weeks after its withdrawal from Formula One racing. Honda's move reflects its need to boost its presence in the North American market, where its sales have begun to weaken in the face of the resurgence in the fortunes of the domestic US car-makers. The company was forced to announce this week that the Honda Accord had lost its place in 1992 as the best-selling car in America, a position it had held for three years. It was beaten into second place by the Ford Taurus. Honda, with the Marlboro McLaren team, dominated Formula One for several years, but was beaten in last year's world championship by the Canon Williams Renault team. Nigel Mansell, the British Formula One world champion last year, is also moving to the Indy series in the US. Honda said yesterday it had established a new racing subsidiary in the US, Honda Performance Development, which would begin testing engines this year. The company said its switch to the Indy series would help it expand its R&amp;D and engineering capabilities in the US and would provide it with 'distinct marketing opportunities'.</p>

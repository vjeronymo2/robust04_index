			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Labour plans to stop ITV takeovers A BILL to prevent takeovers of ITV companies until 1996 was published yesterday by Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary. She argued that unless urgent action was taken 'we could eventually see the existing 14 ITV companies reduced to just three or four'. The single section bill to amend the 1990 Broadcasting Act has no official status although Ms Clwyd said yesterday she hoped it would become a private members' bill. The government is under considerable pressure from some of the larger ITV companies to make takeovers easier. They believe that reform of the ITV structure is both necessary and inevitable. Medium-sized companies which do not want to be taken over argue the importance of regional independence. The nine largest companies are forbidden from taking each other over. Until next year there are also obstacles that make it difficult for anyone to take over ITV companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Klaus Blume] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 12 Feb (DPA) -- Costa Rican Foreign  Affairs Minister Bernd Niehaus, who, so far, is the main  candidate to aspire to the OAS Secretary General seat due to be  decided on 27 March, has said that after 40 years it is only  fair that a Central American hold the post.    In an interview granted to DPA, Niehaus pointed out: "We  strongly believe in the principle of juridical equality of the  states," and he recalled that in the four decades since the OAS  birth, the secretary generals have always been South Americans.    The Costa Rican politician, who is of German descent, added  that "Costa Rica holds a special place for the OAS because,  thanks to this organization, we have lived 40 years without an  Army." He emphasized that it is uncommon for a country,  regardless of how small it is, to live without an Army. It was  precisely the OAS which guaranteed the protection of Costa  Rica's sovereign interests.    He described his chances of winning the election at the next  OAS Assembly in Washington, D.C. as "excellent." He added: "We  have 23 sure votes and only 18 are required." In addition to the  six Central American nations and 13 Caribbean countries, he has  the support of Chile, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, and Argentina.    Niehaus doubts those who say the United States opposes his  candidacy and pointed out: "I sincerely do not believe that the  United States opposes my candidacy." He believes that what the  United States could oppose is a break in the tradition of larger  countries occupying such a high position. He said that this  would be unfair because all states are equal. According to  Niehaus, the secretary general does not have to be a former  president, as in the case of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria,  who the White House supposedly favors.    The 52-year-old statesman, who has been an international law  professor for 20 years and foreign minister twice, noted: "I  think that have a knowledge of international law is more  important." He believes that some countries are afraid that the  small nations of the continent would unite to create a so-called  "mechanical majority" against larger nations. He added that  "this is stupid because we are not that foolish."    Niehaus feels that the most important thing for an  organization like the OAS to do is "to reach its basic goal: to  defend democracy." This means that all countries must give  democracy the special treatment it deserves. He cited Cuba as an  example. He believes a change toward democracy and respect for  human rights will soon come to that country. "That change must  be promoted so that it will be peaceful and nonviolent," he  said. Niehaus advocates rapprochement with Cuba to promote  development. In this specific case, which is very different from  Haiti, he feels the blockade is inappropriate. "Isolation does  not lead to positive results," the outgoing foreign minister  concluded.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Argentine bank raises Dollars 100m in Eurobonds BANCO Rio del Plata, Argentina's largest private bank, has raised Dollars 100m in the Eurobond market. The bank said it planned to return to the market with a further Dollars 100m bond issue before the end of the year. The bank is paying a yield to investors of 9.6 per cent a year on the three-year bonds. Argentine corporate and government borrowers have been flocking to the Eurobond market in the past 18 months. Rates and maturities on the international market are more attractive than the under-capitalised local market. Local legislation has also been reformed to encourage borrowers to enter the bond market by offering companies tax exemptions. Equally, international investors have taken increasing interest in Argentine paper, since Argentine borrowers must still offer above-market yields.</p>

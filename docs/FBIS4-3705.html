			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, 22 Apr (MENA)--Following meetings today  with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen and the Arab and  African ambassadors here, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said that  the talks with Chinese officials dealt with bilateral relations  and issues regarding investment, trade, and technical and  economic cooperation.    The foreign minister said that the talks also touched on the  international economic and political situation; the problems in  Asia, Africa, and the Arab world; and the issues that are under  discussion at the United Nations.    'Amr Musa said: We also discussed the UN and Security  Council roles because China is a permanent member. We reviewed  the ongoing study to increase the number of the council's  permanent members.    Responding to a question about the issues focused on during  talks with Chinese officials, the foreign minister said that the  talks centered on all important issues, including the grave  situation in Bosnia, the continued Serbian aggression, and the  inaction prevailing at the Security Council. Musa added: We  also discussed the existing problems in Africa, including the  situation in Somalia, Rwanda, and the developments in South  Africa. The talks also touched on Libya and the Lockerbie  issue, Musa said.    Continuing, the foreign minister said: The talks also  focused on developments in the Middle East peace process. The  two sides discussed certain problems in Asia, such as the Korean  problem and the situation in the Pacific, he added. [passage  omitted]    Responding to a question on Egypt's ability to compete in  the  world market, the foreign minister said: Certainly, we can  compete in the world market because everyone has a chance.  Take, for example, countries like Malaysia and Singapore, who  are part of the competition game. Egypt can do the same.    The foreign minister said that the trade balance between  Egypt and China is estimated at $200 million. We import Chinese  goods worth $140 million, and our export to China is $60  million.

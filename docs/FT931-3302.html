			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Schesinger claims more realistic exchange rate structure from EMS turbulence Recent turbulence in the European monetary system has resulted in a sounder, more realistic exchange rate structure, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank claimed yesterday, Christopher Parkes writes from Frankfurt. It was a mistake to interpret events of the past few months as a dramatic setback for the EMS, he added. It was also wrong to expect hard currency countries to direct their interest rate policies primarily towards maintaining exchange rate stability. That could lead the EMS into an 'inflationary cul de sac', he said in a lecture in Milan. He also spoke out against changing the rules of the exchange rate mechanism.</p>

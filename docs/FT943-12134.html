			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: All systems go for Oresund fixed link - Hugh Carnegy on tender preparations for the project joining Sweden and Denmark Work is accelerating on the tenders for the first fixed link between Sweden and Denmark now that the Swedish government has at last given the go-ahead to one of Europe's biggest infrastructure projects. The Oresund Consortium, the joint Swedish-Danish group which is running the project, has published a list of 14 pre-qualified construction consortia, involving some 50 Scandinavian, European, US and Turkish companies. They were picked from a list of 23 to qualify for bidding for the four main parts of the 16km combined bridge-tunnel, road-rail link across the Oresund channel dividing the cities of Copenhagen and Malmo. After a delay of about a year, caused by a tortuous row within Sweden's right-centre coalition over the environmental effects of the link, the first tenders will go out in September, with the first construction work due to begin next summer. If all goes according to the revised plan, the link should open to traffic in the year 2000, a year later than intended when in 1991 the two governments signed their treaty to build the link. Taken in tandem with the DKr20bn (Pounds 2.1bn) Storebaelt bridge-tunnel link between the Danish islands of Zeeland and Funen, due to be completed within the next three years, the Oresund link will for the first time provide an unbroken land connection not just between Sweden and Denmark, but also between Sweden and its main export markets in Germany and the rest of Europe. The commercial benefits, especially for the Copenhagen-Malmo region, with its 3.2m inhabitants, are expected to be considerable. But stringent environmental specifications placed on the project, principally by the Swedish authorities, have already forced the Oresund consortium to make significant changes in the construction plans to ensure the link will be, in the words of Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, 'the greenest bridge in the world'. This will add DKr800m to the estimated DKr12.2bn the coast-to-coast tunnel and bridges are projected to cost in 1990 prices. Associated land works on both the Swedish and Danish sides will add DKr6bn. The Oresund link is essentially a public sector project, although it will receive no direct state funding. It is to be financed by borrowing on international markets, backed by government guarantees. Payback is scheduled to take 24 years from opening, based on annual revenues (in 1990 prices) of DKr300m jointly from the Danish and Swedish state railway companies and annual tariffs from a projected 3m vehicle crossings. The chief environmental demand made by the Swedish side was that the bridge section of the project, and the artificial islands it involves, would have no net effect on the vital salt-water flows through the Oresund in and out of the Baltic Sea. This so-called 'zero solution' is aimed at ensuring no change in the oxygen content of the already badly polluted Baltic waters. Second, the constructors must ensure that spillage from the extensive dredging works does not exceed 5 per cent of the excavated material. These conditions are 'very tough' says Mr Ingmar Bjornsson, project director at the Oresund Consortium. 'But we have shown that it is possible through a combination of methods. The restrictions will be monitored to make sure we work within the limits set - and these conditions will be among the evaluation criteria when we select the contractors.' The environmental conditions entail four main changes: first, extensive dredging will be done off the Danish coast to compensate for the hindrance to water flows caused by the islands and bridge pillars. Second, a planned artificial island 4km long will now be split into two islands with a 600m bridge between them. Third, the tunnel - an immersed concrete-section tunnel sunk in a sea-bed trench linking the Danish side to the artificial islands - will be lengthened by 400m to 3,700m. Last, a man-made peninsula on the Danish side will be narrowed by 200m. The first tender dates - for the dredging/island building work and the tunnel - will be set for December and next January, with contracts to be signed in May. The tender dates for the 1.09km cable-stayed elevated bridge and the 6.4km of bridges leading to the high bridge are set for March next year. After all the delays, Mr Bjornsson and his colleagues are anxious to get on with the work. Not least because they are fed up with the hour-long journey they must now make almost daily via ferry between Malmo and Copenhagen city centres. Once the Oresund link is up and running, the trip will take 25 minutes.</p>

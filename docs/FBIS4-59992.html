			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the  Yemeni Socialist Party, by Muhammad Karkuti in London; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karkuti] The Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] has put forward an eight-point peace plan  that was rejected by Sanaa. How do you assess Arab reaction to  this initiative? Note that the initiative was proposed during a  visit of an Arab League delegation to Sanaa, so what was the  Arab League's reaction to this initiative?    [Muhammad] Arab and world media have reflected complete  sympathy with the stand of our party and leadership toward this  peaceful initiative, whether before or during the war. We are  now defending our honor, property, homes, cities, and villages.  We have not been on the offensive yet. We are against war. We  support dialogue. We have exercised a policy of self-restraint,  because over the past three years we had seen many practices,  such as assassinations and liquidations of our party's leaders.  All this did not make us lose patience or lose our mind. We  have worked, and we are still calling for dialogue as the only  language between the parties that have a different view of the  complex Yemeni situation. [passage omitted]    [Karkuti] To say that the current crisis, which is tearing  Yemen apart, is the result of foreign intervention is extremely  doubtful. However, the tragic developments of the crisis make  us reconsider the validity of this view. What is your personal  opinion? If there are foreign and behind-the-scene forces  working to ignite the crisis, who are these forces and what do  they want?    [Muhammad] Yemen is not an isolated island. As you know, it  is part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world. What is  happening now proceeds from two plans: a tribal plan, supported  by an international fundamentalist movement, which is now trying  to establish its state in Yemen; and another plan to establish  an Arab Islamic state in this region that will have ideal and  natural relations with Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the other Gulf  states and the world. This plan will seek to develop Yemen  according to the mentality of the late twentieth century and the  beginning of the next century. There are people who waver  between these two stands. This is why Yemen is today at a  crossroads.    Therefore, it is not strange that Sudan should be supporting  this latter scheme. Also, the religious fundamentalist movement  is involved in supporting this trend and in removing all  obstacles that arose as a result of unity and democracy to pave  the way for this plan. Alliances will therefore depend on who  supports and who allows this plan and who supports the other  plan. As for the statements and attempts to win the favor of  this or that party, they are all propaganda as a result of the  hot military and political battle.    [Karkuti] Is it true that Iraq is playing a role in Yemen?    [Muhammad] The supplies we saw in the battles were  originally there in preparation for the recent Gulf war. We had  expected this. This also was clear in the weapons the northern  troops have. Iraqi delegations came before and during the war.  This is also clear in the training and expertise. Consider  also Iraq's attitude at the Arab League, which gives a true  picture that Iraq, which should abandon this policy, is involved  in supporting the military option in Yemen. It is enough to  note the Iraqi Ba'th Party National Command statement that  reflects its support for the military option that seeks war.    [Karkuti] How true are the reports that there are Iraqis  with the northern forces?    [Muhammad] Yes, there are Iraqi experts with the Republican  Guard. There are also Iraqi experts with the northern brigades.  [passage omitted]    [Karkuti] What about the victims of the war. Do you have  any figures?    [Muhammad] They are very huge and terrifying figures. They  try to hide the figures from the public and the outside world.  Entire brigades have been destroyed. Since they are attacking,  then they must have sustained major losses, but they are hiding  these facts. There are also huge losses among civilians,  whether in al-Dali', Kirsh, Abyan, Mukayras, and also huge  losses in Sanaa and 'Imran. There are social and economic  damages known only to God alone. [passage omitted]    [Karkuti] What is the military situation now on the  battlefield?    [Muhammad] The situation keeps changing. They are attacking  in the Kirsh region and their attacks are being repulsed. There  are also fierce battles in al-Dali'. They started another  battle in Bayhan in Shabwah. This is in addition to the battles  in Abyan. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEELERS OVERCOME THEIR ANEMIC OFFENSE;  </P> <P> AFC: DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS KEY FIRST HOME VICTORY AGAINST A CENTRAL  DIVISION TEAM IN NEARLY THREE YEARS.  </P> <P> With an offense that has proved inept this season, the Pittsburgh Steelers  turned to their defense and special teams for touchdowns Sunday night against  the Houston Oilers.  </P> <P> David Johnson returned an interception 26 yards and Rod Woodson returned a punt  52 yards for touchdowns as the Steelers beat the Oilers, 20-9, for their first  home victory against a Central Division opponent in nearly three years.  </P> <P> The Steelers (1-1), whose offense has not produced a touchdown this season, had  not won against a division team at Three Rivers Stadium since beating  Cincinnati, 23-20, on Oct. 25, 1987.  </P> <P> Oiler quarterback Warren Moon completed 24 of 48 passes for 284 yards, but he  threw four interceptions as Houston, thwarted by turnovers for the second  consecutive week, lost at Pittsburgh for the first time since 1986.  </P> <P> Moon has thrown six interceptions in two games after throwing seven in his  previous 350 pass attempts.  </P> <P> "We still haven't scored points, but the defense bailed us out again,"  Pittsburgh running back Tim Worley said. "But you can't expect them to do that  every week. The offense has great practices, but then I don't know what happens  in the games."  </P> <P> The Oilers (0-2), who outgained the Steelers, 309-123, have seen four of their  turnovers returned for touchdowns -- three in a 47-27 loss to Atlanta and  former Coach Jerry Glanville.  </P> <P> Gary Anderson added 31 and 27-yard field goals for the Steelers, who were  coming off a 13-3 loss to Cleveland.  </P> <P> Johnson, subbing for the injured Delton Hall, intercepted Moon's first pass of  the game, which deflected off the hand of receiver Ernest Givins. Johnson  bobbled the ball momentarily, then grabbed it and ran into the end zone  untouched at 11:31 of the first quarter for the Steelers' first touchdown of  the season.  </P> <P> With 3:11 left in the game, Woodson went 52 yards down the left sideline for  Pittsburgh's first punt-return touchdown since Louis Lipps' 71-yarder on Nov.  10, 1985, against Kansas City. The punt-return score was the first against  Houston since 1978.  </P></p>

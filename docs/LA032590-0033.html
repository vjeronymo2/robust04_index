			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER LEGALIZATION OF DRUGS IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Regarding the article by Sweet: I'll bet the drug dealers who come before him  in court feel pretty lucky. Two often used quotations come to mind: "Putting  the cart before the horse," and "Throwing the baby out with the bathwater." The  costs of alcohol are a poor track record for legitimizing drugs.  </P> <P> JERRY F. JONES  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

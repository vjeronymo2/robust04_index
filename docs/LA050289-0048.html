			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC PROFIT INCREASES 13% FOR 1ST QUARTER  </P> <P> Tekelec, a Calabasas maker of equipment that tests telecommunications products,  said its first-quarter profit rose 13% from a year earlier on a 36% jump in  revenue.  </P> <P> In the quarter that ended March 31, Tekelec's net income climbed to $1.24  million from $1.1 million, and its revenue rose to $9.12 million from $6.73  million.  </P> <P> Tekelec said that U.S. orders for its equipment were lower than expected in the  first quarter, but that international demand remained strong. Tekelec said its  profit gain was limited because of new-product costs and higher engineering,  marketing and customer-service spending needed to support its increased client  base.  </P></p>

It has been concluded that the key to peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be found through the Croat-Muslim  agreement [as heard]. Americans, Germans, and Italians are  involved in the search for that key.    Minister Granic told us that he came to Rome today in order  to clarify the Croatian standpoint regarding the creation of a  Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There are some  differences as regards the set-up of the future  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, Granic told us that the Croatian  position was met with understanding by the Italian side.  Croatia's view of Italy's importance in the negotiations is  positive, Granic told us.    In reference to his talks with Tauran, he said that the Holy  See assessed as positive the fact that Croatia has accepted the  Vatican's suggestions.</p>

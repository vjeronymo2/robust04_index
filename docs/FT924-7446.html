			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Inflation edges down in France FRANCE'S annual inflation rate eased to 2.4 per cent last month, from 2.6 per cent in September, according to provisional figures, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The result places the French inflation rate 1.2 percentage points below the average of its nine main trading partners. The French rate has been running below the German rate consistently for 17 months. A wave of strikes will disrupt France's public transport this week, halting the Paris Metro at rush hours and disrupting trains and airlines, according to the unions, Reuter reports. Metro drivers are protesting at changes which they say will mean longer working hours. The Communist-led CGT union has called a 24-hour rail strike for Thursday to demand wage rises and protest against planned job cuts. Pilots and ground staff at Air France are also to stop work on November 27 in protest at plans to cut 5,000 jobs.</p>

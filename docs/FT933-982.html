			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / How To Spend It: Ski rivals jostle for supremacy - Arnold Wilson previews the start of the new season on the pistes THE HAILSTONES were so big I could have gone cross-country skiing in my garden in Richmond, south west London, on Wednesday night. Is this a good omen for a season full of snow? I must ask my neighbour, television weatherman Michael Fish. Certainly the season has arrived - in fact it has been steadily arriving ever since the first brochure was sent to rather less than eager readers before last winter was even over, I seem to recall. Did last winter ever really end? Neilson's early brochure landed on my desk in London while I was still skiing on last winter's snow. I could hear the thud from Verbier. On the other hand, some operators' 'early booking brochures' came out so late that they had hardly reached the client's doormat before the 'main' brochure arrived with a clatter on top of it. Crystal has incensed Thomson this year by proclaiming the company as Britain's 'biggest and best ski specialist' and 'offering the UK's biggest ski programme'. Crystal adds that the 260-page brochure features more resorts (105 in 10 countries), more regional airports (13) and more fully-catered chalets (131) than 'any other operator'. Thomson's brochure has a mere 195 pages covering around 70 resorts. However, having a bigger brochure does not mean Crystal will sell more holidays than Thomson. Do not expect Thomson to be dethroned from its position as brand leader. Between them, Thomson and Crystal have more than 400 photographs of skiers skiing in their brochures. So it is intriguing that Finlays Chalet Holidays has produced the (almost) impossible: a ski brochure with only one picture of a skier skiing in it - and a tiny one at that. Nevertheless, it is a pleasant brochure: there are photographs of lots of skiers not skiing (leaning on poles, carrying skis, lying in the snow, having lunch on the balcony after skiing etc). Apparently, according to Richard Finlay, pictures of skiers skiing are 'difficult to come by'. A remark which prompted Paul Chase Gardener, managing director of Bladon Lines, to retort light-heartedly: 'You mean you have to pay for them?' So what of the season ahead? Ski Solutions, the leading specialist travel agent, suggests that Christmas, though hopefully white, is going to be a bit of a nightmare. 'Christmas Day and New Year's Day both fall on a Saturday,' observes Lizzie Norton, the company's director. The formula she dreads is this: 'Awkward dates plus high demand equals limited availability.' The result? 'A bewildering farrago of different departure dates and holiday durations.' However, in spite of a terrible time for some four and five-star hoteliers last March, ski business is booming - at least for the festive season. 'Even clients who advise us that money is no object cannot be certain of getting precisely the accommodation and dates of their first choice,' says Norton. With Switzerland, France and Austria looking costly there is considerable interest in Italy, where a good rate of exchange is helping a skiing renaissance, and North America, where the likes of Vail and Breckenridge, Colorado (with a new fourth mountain, Peak 7, to show off this winter) and Whistler and Banff/Lake Louise are selling well. Alpine Answers, the new kids on the ski specialist travel agent block, suggest that Italy's gain is Austria's loss, with an increase in bookings to Cervinia, Livigno and Sauze d'Oulx, 'where the apres ski is less expensive than in similar Austrian destinations.' According to Hilary Jackson, high-altitude French resorts may also be taking a share of skiers whose usual haunt is Austria. This would narrow the gap still further between Austria, which in Britain always outsells the other ski nations, and its traditional rival, France. The two countries might even end the season neck and neck, in spite of on-going jokes about the size of French apartments and the lingering Gallic shrug. Safety is a big issue this year; the bloodcurdling way in which some people ski is alarming many skiing fans. After nine British fatalities on the slopes last winter, skiers are being urged to slow down, drink less at lunchtime and be more thoughtful about other skiers on the mountain. In a survey last month almost half of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO) 37 ski operators urged that separate areas should be set aside for snowboarders. And 80 per cent of them called for a package of measures including more piste patrols, with powers to confiscate lift passes from dangerous skiers, slow skiing areas and clearer piste marking. Sue Ockwell, AITO's chief executive, says: 'The aim should be to reduce accidents on the slopes to an absolute minimum.'</p>

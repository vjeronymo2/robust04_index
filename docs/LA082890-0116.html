			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MAKING TRACKS: But some like to ride the rails, even if they don't like to be  taxed for it. . . . Ridership on Orange County's new commuter trains along I-5  between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles has soared 20% since May to 337 a  day. Still, that's far short of the trains' 1,200-seat round-trip capacity, so  monthly fares, already 20% below Amtrak rates, will fall another 10%. Also, a  direct mail marketing effort is in the works.

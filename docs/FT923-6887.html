			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / NHS shake-up likely after trusts boost THE MANAGEMENT of the National Health Service is likely to be reorganised following the announcement yesterday of a further increase in the number of self-governing trusts. The Health Department confirmed that 151 hospitals and other NHS units in England and Wales have applied to join the third wave of self-governing trusts which are to be created in April. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, has written to all remaining non-trust hospitals and health units inviting them to join a fourth wave of trusts in 1994. Since the launch of the NHS reforms last year 156 trusts have been created in two waves. Most third-wave applications are likely to be accepted, meaning the number of trusts in the NHS will have virtually doubled by April. More than 70 per cent of the hospital and community health service budget will then be spent by self-governing trusts, which are managed directly by the NHS management executive. This would greatly increase the strain on the executive's six regional offices. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday confirmed that the management executive had been reviewing the arrangements for monitoring the performance of trusts. 'The success of trusts raises the issue of how to ensure their accountability, assuming that there are, say, 450 trusts, as well as how to preserve their essential freedoms,' she said. 'The NHS is, after all, a national system managed locally.' One option is to create a new management structure by merging the executive's regional offices with the regional health authorities. The RHAs  -responsible for managing hospitals and health units which have not become trusts - will have a greatly reduced role after the third and fourth waves of trusts. Mrs Bottomley said no decision had yet been taken. The third wave of applications includes ambulance services and community health organisations as well as hospitals. Among those applying are institutions such as Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, which pioneered heart transplants; and Addenbrooke's, the Cambridge teaching hospital. Ms Dawn Primarolo, Labour's health spokeswoman, said the boost in the number of trusts was unwelcome and 'a leap in the dark'. She said: 'There has been no published assessment of the success of even the first wave of trust hospitals. All we have is reports of cut-throat commercialisation, expanding privatisation, cuts in services and in staff but not in waiting lists.' Cohse, the health service union, said many trusts were financially unprepared to compete in the NHS internal market. The union published a survey yesterday which claims that a third of trust applications contain insufficient financial data to be properly assessed. It says a quarter rely on 'dangerously optimistic assumptions.'</p>

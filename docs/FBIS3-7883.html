			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F> MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter Akira Goto in Belgrade on 25 February]    [Text] Belgrade, 25 Feb -- Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic, of new Yugoslavia (which consists of Serbia and  Montenegro), granted an interview to MAINICHI SHIMBUN in  Belgrade on 25 February. In the interview, the foreign minister  warned against NATO's "threatening policy," saying that if NATO  extends the target of an air-strike threat to other areas of  Bosnia, "something unexpected will occur." He called on Muslims  to make bold to sign a peace accord at the opportunity of the  cease-fire in Sarajevo.    [Goto] How will the avoidance of NATO air strikes affect the  Bosnian conflict?    [Jovanovic] NATO's ultimatum was designed to stand to the  side of the parties in the civil war, and it nearly demolished  the cease- fire accord reached between Serbs and Muslims. If  NATO extends an air-strike threat to other areas of Bosnia,  something unexpected will happen and it will spread to all areas  of Bosnia.    [Goto] Some people see that the Serbian force has withdrawn  its heavy weapons from around Sarajevo under pressure of NATO.    [Jovanovic] This is not true. We took the action after  concluding that the withdrawal is a rational compromise which  turns out to our advantage. Because we already reached an  accord with Muslims on withdrawal of weapons several days before  NATO's ultimatum was given to the Serbian force, the ultimatum  was unnecessary. Because NATO has lost its enemy of the Soviet  Union following the collapse of the Cold War structure, it is  now seeking a new external enemy in a bid to justify its  existence.    [Goto] Do you think the Sarajevo cease-fire will bring  progress in negotiations on peace?    [Jovanovic] The Serbian force has made the maximum  concessions in response to proposals included in a draft peace  accord presented by the European Union (EU). The utmost  concession is to grant one- third of national land to Muslims,  and 98 percent of the draft peace accord has been agreed on.  Now is the time to sign a peace agreement and to discuss the  land issue that remains unsolved. We support any agreements  among the three parties, including the Croatian.    [Goto] Russia played a major role in achieving the Sarajevo  cease-fire. Do you think its influence will increase?    [Jovanovic] Different from American and European nations,  Russia has adopted balanced policies toward the Bosnian  conflict. Serb's withdrawing weapons is the product of Russian  policies. President Yeltsin's call on American and European  nations to hold a summit is one of Russia's initiatives. We  support the proposal.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Trio Pounds 5.08m in the black Trio Holdings, the revamped investment trust, yesterday returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.08m for the 12 months to September 30, against losses of Pounds 68,000 in the previous 15 months. The company, which last month warned that full year results would not meet market expectations, described the figures as 'satisfactory'. 'In the event, our results were better than the current market expectations,' said Mr David Hagan, chairman. Turnover was Pounds 72.7m, against a nil figure for the previous period. The balance sheet shows net tangible assets at the year end of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 1.46m). Fully diluted earnings per share were 2.93p, compared with losses of 0.85p. The final dividend is 1.5p making 2.5p (nil) for the year. The results mark the first meaningful full year since the restructuring and the takeover in January of Martin Bierbaum, the moneybroker, which contributed for eight months. The restructuring was directed by Mr Hagan who in May 1992 was given the job of trying to revitalise a trust which had been brought to the stock market 16 months earlier at 50p per share by Raphael Zorn. It had been set up as a specialist trust for investors with personal equity plans. But the trust lost its original sense of purpose after rules were changed and was trading at a substantial discount to its then Pounds 1.6m of net assets. Mr Hagan said: 'I regard the results as satisfactory but the core of the group's traditional strength is in foreign exchange markets which have been periodically subdued. Nonetheless, we are continuing to implement our programme to revitalise the business.'</p>

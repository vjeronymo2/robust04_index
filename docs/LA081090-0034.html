			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEACH NOTES;  </P> <P> DODD CONTINUES HIS SEARCH FOR A STEADY PLAYING PARTNER  </P> <P> When Tim Hovland told Mike Dodd a month ago that he wanted to end their  nine-year, professional volleyball union, he said he wanted to "dance with a  new partner."  </P> <P> Hovland has played exclusively with 22-year-old Kent Steffes since the breakup.  </P> <P> Dodd has been dancing to the tune of "Hello, Goodby."  </P> <P> Today at noon, when the $150,000 Cuervo Gold Crown tournament gets started at  San Diego's Mission Bay, Dodd will be playing with his fifth different partner  -- counting Hovland -- in as many weeks.  </P> <P> For a man who was a steady sight for so many years standing on Hovland's right,  the variety of the past few weeks has been exhilarating.  </P> <P> "I've really enjoyed this," Dodd said. "It's exciting getting the chance to  play with someone with different skills each week."  </P> <P> In Cleveland, it was hello Dan Vrebalovich and goodby Hovland.  </P> <P> In Chicago, it was hello Scott Ayakatubby and goodby Vrebalovich.  </P> <P> And in Seal Beach, it was hello to fellow South Bay native Brent Frohoff and  goodby Ayakatubby.  </P> <P> Frohoff's regular partner, Karch Kiraly, is returning from television  assignment at the Goodwill Games this weekend.  </P> <P> So at Mission Bay, Dodd will greet partner No. 5: veteran Pat Powers.  </P> <P> At least the lack of stability hasn't affected Dodd's game. He and Vrebalovich  finished third at Cleveland, and Dodd-Frohoff -- a first-time union of two  long-time buddies -- came in second at Seal Beach.  </P> <P> "I was really looking forward to playing with Brent," Dodd said. "I've played a  million pickup games with him down at Marine (Avenue in Manhattan Beach) and I  had a feeling we'd do well."  </P> <P> Dodd played on the left side with Frohoff -- his first time on that side in  seven years.  </P> <P> "It was kind of weird," Dodd said. "No, it was very weird."  </P> <P> Coming at Randy Stoklos from a different angle in Sunday's final, Dodd was able  to score a few points simply out of newness. But Dodd and Frohoff had to come  through the consolation bracket to reach the final, and a well-rested Sinjin  Smith and Stoklos won their 10th tournament of the year, 15-6.  </P> <P> "I was happy to come all the way back through the losers' bracket, but Sinjin  and Randy were fresh as daisies," Dodd said.  </P> <P> Dodd won't get too used to playing with Powers either. Dodd will be teamed with  former Olympian Steve Timmons in next week's Seattle Seafair Open.  </P> <P> He doesn't know who his partner will be in the season-ending USA Championships  of Pro Beach Volleyball at Hermosa Beach Aug. 25-26.  </P> <P> It could be any of the above.  </P> <P> "Next year I'll pick one guy and stay with him the whole year," Dodd said.  "That's the only way to do it. It just didn't happen this year. But I really  don't know who it will be."  </P> <P> Dodd and Powers, who last played together in 1981, are the fourth-seeded team  in this weekend's Gold Crown event, which is the final jewel in Cuervo's triple  crown of big-money tournaments.  </P> <P> Smith and Stoklos have already won more than $300,000 between them this year,  including the titles of the first two Cuervo events at Clearwater, Fla., and  Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> No team has ever won all three events of the Cuervo Gold Crown. The winning  team at Mission Bay will split $70,000, which will be delivered in gold coins  to the event site by a Brinks armored car for Saturday's final.  </P> <P> To pull off the clean sweep of the Cuervo events, Smith and Stoklos will have  to survive the tournament's shotgun format. The top eight teams on the beach  play a round-robin format, with the top two teams competing for the  championship.  </P> <P> The unluckiest man in beach volleyball would have to be Ayakatubby, who was  scheduled to play in San Diego with Dodd, then had to withdraw because of a  dislocated ring finger on his left hand.  </P> <P> Ayakatubby suffered the injury last weekend while playing in the International  Surf Festival's Six-Man beach tournament at Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> It's just another setback in what has been a star-crossed three years for  Ayakatubby, who was once Frohoff's regular sidekick.  </P> <P> Ayakatubby suffered a severely herniated disc in his lower back that wiped out  half of his 1988 season. The injury has recurred and Ayakatubby has had to skip  a smattering of tournaments since because of back stiffness.  </P> <P> He has also faced bouts of heat exhaustion, thwarting several promising  finishes.  </P> <P> At least Patty Dodd won't have to worry about picking another partner this  weekend in the Venice Beach Open.  </P> <P> Dodd got a call this week to play with Lisa Strand -- who was a winner in Tokyo  with Janice Opalinski -- but she decided to stay with Rita Crockett-Royster  instead.  </P> <P> Strand would have been Dodd's fourth partner of the year.  </P> <P> "I was in limbo for awhile," Dodd said. "It was very stressful and difficult to  make a decision. Going from partner to partner in one summer is kind of crazy."  </P> <P> Dodd and Crockett-Royster finished fourth last weekend at Pismo Beach.  </P> <P> You might catch a look at some of beach volleyball's future standouts today at  Marine Avenue.  </P> <P> Mira Costa High Coach Mike Cook -- the winningest volleyball coach in  California history -- is running a boys' high school level two-man tournament  today, beginning at 8:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Five members of Cook's 1990 Mira Costa team -- which swept undefeated to the  Southern Section 4-A Division title and the No. 1 ranking in the nation -- will  be in action today.  </P> <P> Canyon Ceman -- who was Mira Costa's deluxe setter and class valedictorian --  and long-time partner David Swatik are one of the top teams in the tournament.  Both Ceman and Swatik have AA ratings in the California Beach Volleyball Assn.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Cook is holding a co-ed open tournament, also at Marine Avenue. In  its 23rd year, the tournament attracts players from the fringes of the men's  and women's pro tournament.  </P> <P> Some of this year's players are Barry Hanna, Doug Foust, and Mike Doll -- all  AAA-rated players who have seen action on the pro circuit.  </P> <P> "They're going to pick up some girls and play," Cook said. "We've been doing it  this way since 1968. This used to be a darn strong tournament before the men's  pro tour got going."  </P></p>

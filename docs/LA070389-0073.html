			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARISHIONERS HOLD SERVICE FOR DETROIT CHURCH CLOSING  </P> <P> Parishioners at a Roman Catholic church held a prayer service Sunday, a week  after the church was ordered to close. About 50 members of Mother of  Consolation Church were at the service, which was not a formal Mass, said Dario  Guidarini, president of the parish council.  </P> <P> The church was among 30 ordered closed or merged with other congregations  because of declining memberships, a shortage of priests and the costs of  maintaining the large churches.  </P></p>

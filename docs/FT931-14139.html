			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Letter: Appointments raise concern about system of government The survey of quangos you published ('Resurgence of quangos defies Thatcher's new broom', January 14) highlighted one important but little discussed development - the tendency for an increasing amount of public expenditure to be placed under the responsibility of appointed boards. One reason for the lack of discussion is that it happens step by step, or rather responsibility by responsibility. Discussion focuses on the particular changes rather than on the implications for public accountability generally. This is well illustrated by recent discussion about the proposals for police authorities, currently being considered by the home secretary. It has been widely reported that he is considering replacing elected councillors on police authorities by non-appointed members, or perhaps not even non-appointed members since they may already be serving on other appointed boards. Discussion has naturally focused on the implications for the policy, rather than on the implications of adding to the extent of public expenditure under the control of appointed members. If carried through it would be a significant increase in the Pounds 41bn which your article showed to be the responsibility of appointed boards. The nature of the accountability of these boards to the public is in some cases uncertain and in other cases at best indirect and they are often not subject to the degree of scrutiny and access for the public that we insist on for local authorities. The extent of public expenditure involved and the wider issues of public accountability raised suggests the need for an examination of the role of those appointed boards - possibly by a select committee of the House of Commons. It would be unwise to extend the principle of government by appointment until there is much deeper understanding of the implications of what has already happened. The issues raised by the home secretary concern not merely the police, but the whole system of government.

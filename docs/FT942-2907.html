			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Zimbabwe civil servants receive large pay rise Zimbabwe's public servants, police and soldiers are to get an interim pay rise ranging from 10 to 23 per cent next month, at a cost of ZDollars 1.74bn (Pounds 146.6m). In a country, where individuals are overtaxed, according to finance minister Dr Bernard Chidzero, the government has introduced a battery of tax-free allowances for public servants covering housing and transport. The chairman of the Public Service Commission said the increases, announced late on Wednesday night, were an interim measure designed to help civil servants cope with inflation of 24 per cent over then past year. He said private sector salaries were - on average - 172 per cent higher than those in the public service while parastatal employees were paid 84 per cent more than civil servants. The government was committed to redressing this situation once it had considered the report of a British consultant. Further reviews of allowances for the police and the defence forces were under way, he added. Ironically, the announcement follows increasingly shrill warnings about inflationary pressures in the economy from the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe. The ZDollars 1.7bn pay award represents a rise of nearly 12 per cent in public spending in the 1994/5 fiscal year starting on July 1. With the government likely to miss its budget deficit target of 5.4 per cent of GDP by a substantial margin - most estimates suggest a deficit in the current year to June 30 of around 9 per cent - the increase will not go down well with the donor community. But with real wages having fall by a third in the last four years to a 20-year low, substantial pay increases, next year as well as this, were inevitable, the more so ahead of next February's general elections. With inflation forecast to average at least 24 per cent this year, thispay award is not going to reverse the long-run downward trend in real take-home pay.</p>

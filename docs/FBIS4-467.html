			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Office of the Chief Minister of kwaZulu </F> on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 9 April]    [Text]  <H5>  Resolution 1 </H5>   We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP] re-state our unqualified commitment to seek  an all- inclusive solution for the present national crisis.  We further    1. Fully support the international mediation effort aimed at  resolving outstanding issues so that a solution to the national  crisis can be found prior to the holding of any election.    2. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation must  be to seek a constitutional settlement on the basis of the  outstanding constitutional issues identified in the respective  IFP and ANC terms of reference and on the resolution of the  issues related to the claims and demands of His Majesty the king  of the Zulu nation.    3. Re-state that the above said constitutional compromise  must be translated into amendments to the 1993 constitution so  that it can form the basis for a broader political settlement  and reconciliation to take place before elections.    4. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation and  of the constitutional settlement is to enable the Inkatha  Freedom Party to rejoin the electoral process on an equal  footing with all other political parties.    5. Re-state that the election date of April 27 is to be  postponed so as to offer an opportunity for international  mediation to bring about the results we all hope for.    6. State the willingness of the IFP to resolve by means of  international mediation any outstanding differences between the  terms of reference of the IFP and the ANC.    7. Re-state that international mediation is not and shall  not  become international arbitration and that the role and function  of the international mediators is to facilitate the process of  negotiations between the IFP and its counterparts with respect  to the issues which divide us.    8. Re-state that the purpose of international mediation is  not to determine who is right and who is wrong, nor is it to  assess the value of the 1993 constitution against any abstract  constitutional model. The purpose of mediation is to  acknowledge the objective differences between the requirements  of the IFP for the establishment of a federal and pluralistic  system of government and the provisions of the 1993  constitution, as amended, with a view to seeking a fair and just  point of settlement and reconciliation, which the IFP has  submitted to be provided by its compromise proposals contained  in the December 19, 1993 yellow paper.  <H5>  Resolution 2 </H5>   The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes  with  approval that the leadership of the African National Congress  has at long last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu  nation. It applauds the statesmanlike manner in which His  Majesty set out the question of sovereignty of the Kingdom of  kwaZulu.    The Central Committee wishes to place on record that it was  saddened by the proposals made by the ANC in its so-called  "offer" made to His Majesty the king. The document displays a  great deal of ignorance and some aspects are even colonial in  character.  We therefore:    1. Applaud the fact that the leadership of the ANC has at  last met with His Majesty the king of the Zulu nation.    2. Formally note that the so-called "offer" to His Majesty  the king was clearly drafted by people unfamiliar with African  customs and protocol and will thus give offence to the Zulu  people. It is wittingly or unwittingly prescriptive in  character and typical of centralised thinking.    3. State that any proposals relating to His Majesty the king  or to the Kingdom of kwaZulu must be based on an acceptance of  the principle of sovereignty and self-determination of the Zulu  nation. The proposals of the ANC are in breach of these  principles.   <H5>    Resolution 3 </H5>   The Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom Party has received  with satisfaction the report by the President Prince Mangosuthu  Buthelezi of the historic summit with his Majesty King  Zwelithini Goodwill Ka Bhekuzulu, Dr Nelson Mandela, president  of the ANC and State President FW de Klerk, held at Skukuza camp  at the Kruger National Park on April 8, 1994.    The Central Committee notes that presentations and proposals  were made by the various parties. Particular attention needs to  be drawn to the concerns expressed by His Majesty the king as  well as to the detailed proposals made by the president of the  IFP whose aim was to facilitate an all-inclusive political  settlement that would enable the IFP to join the electoral  process.    The Central Committee regrets that the summit was not  immediately productive but nevertheless endorses the decision to  press ahead by means of a task group charged with producing a  package of proposals vis-a-vis His Majesty the king and  constitutional issues that have to be placed before the  respective leaders of the summit by Thursday 14 April 1994. The  Central Committee supports a second summit to be held towards  the end of next week to take final decisions.  <H5>  Resolution 4 </H5>   We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha  Freedom Party place on record our total opposition to the state  of emergency imposed on kwaZulu-Natal to achieve party-political  gains for the ANC/SACP [South African Communist Party]/NP  [National Party] alliance at the deliberate expense of the  kwaZulu government and the people of kwaZulu-Natal.    This construct of the ANC/SACP-dominated TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] amounts to an invasion of this region and  will therefore be resisted by all citizens who will  democratically reject this assault on their basic and lawful  rights.    After the revolutionary coup in Bophuthatswana, the  politically motivated imposition of a state of emergency in  kwaZulu-Natal is another stage in the breakdown of legality in  South Africa to silence any dissent and political opposition to  the ANC/SACP strategy to seize power at whatever cost.    We call for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency  as necessary and essential for the continuation of negotiations  seeking a peaceful resolution of the present national crisis and  the holding of free and fair elections.    We reject the notion of electoral processes and negotiations  being conducted in the shadow of armoured vehicles and under the  intimidation of armed forces which are no longer required to  respect basic human rights.    The freedom of the people of kwaZulu-Natal cannot be  subjugated with iron fist measures. History will defeat those  who engage in totalitarian follies equal to those perpetuated  during the darkest years of apartheid.  <H5>  Resolution 5 </H5>   The Central Committee of the Inkatha Freedom Party notes  with  dismay the growing partisan character of the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] as reflected in the utterances of its  chairman and vice- chairman. The comments of some officials of  a statutory body charged with quasi judicial functions have been  loud and improper.    Both those wishing to participate and those wishing not to  participate in the elections are citizens entitled to equal  fundamental human rights. It is unedifying for those holding  public office to hurl gratuitous insults at citizens of the  country.    We call upon officials of the I.E.C to act with decorum and  to desist from making partisan comments.  <H5>  Resolution 6 </H5>   We the members of the Central Committee of Inkatha Freedom  Party add our voice to the many millions of South Africans who  were equally appalled by the cold-blooded slaughter of Zulu  citizens peacefully marching in support of their king in  Johannesburg.    We call for all witnesses to the massacre of these people  outside Shell House, in front of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] headquarters and at the Library  Gardens to come forward and testify in the best interests of  justice and democracy.    That there was publicly observed evidence of killer snipers  firing from buildings occupied by the ANC and that police  investigations in this regard were blatantly and deliberately  thwarted is nothing short of a national disgrace. We demand:    1. That the commissioner of police immediately provides the  people of South Africa with a precise explanation as to why a  proper investigation was not conducted inside both Shell House  and the ANC's PWV headquarters as a priority.    2. We demand a report on the current status of the enquiry  into the murders.    There appears to have been a conspiracy of silence drawn  over  the public assassination of these men and women and the apparent  lack of the ability of the relevant authorities to arrest any  perpetrators is an outrage. The Central Committee of the IFP  salutes these sons and daughters of kwaZulu, and it grieves for  them, their families and their loved ones. We are determined  that their deaths will not be allowed to be forgotten and we  will annually commemorate the anniversary of their brutal  slaying in the Shell House massacre.  <H5>  Resolution 7 </H5>   We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha  Freedom Party are alarmed to hear that it is intended to move  members of Umkhonto weSizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military  wing] operating within the National Peacekeeping Force into the  East Rand next week.    Members and supporters of the IFP are adamantly opposed to  the deployment of this non-inclusive, non-proven and highly  controver- sial force into the area. They warn of grave  consequences given the already notorious conduct of some of its  leaders and ordinary members and fear for their lives.    To choose the East Rand for the first placement of this  fledgling force, given the long history of death and destruction  in the area, is an irresponsible act of extreme provocation.  <H5>  Resolution 8 </H5>   We the members of the Central Committee of the Inkatha  Freedom Party yet again mourn a much loved son of our party, Mr  Jeff Sibiya, who was brutally slain yesterday in the East Rand.    Mr Sibiya who was a youth leader, publicity spokesperson and  peace committee member and monitor was felled by SADF [South  African Defense Force] bullets, when according to numerous  witnesses, he was attempting to mediate and while wearing his  peace monitor jacket and holding a torch.    The IFP has already called for an immediate enquiry into his  tragic and unnecessary death and he joins many other IFP  leaders, who were active in peace committees, who have been  killed throughout the country.    Our deepest condolences go to his family and to all his many  friends and colleagues who will remember Mr Jeff Sibiya's  ability to always smile in the face of adversity as he sought  peaceful solutions amidst the horrors of living the life of a  hostel dweller in the East Rand.</p>

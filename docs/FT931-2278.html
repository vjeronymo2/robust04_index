			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A spanner in the works - The impact on families / The Budget and You THE CHANCELLOR'S Budget proposals were so complex that they could have widely different effects on different families, depending on their investments and their employment status. So, the Weekend FT asked Michael Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh, of Price Waterhouse, to invent three hypothetical families to analyse how a cross-section of readers would be affected. The three are Mr and Mrs Wrench, a self-employed plumber and wife; Mr and Ms Suburban, a relatively prosperous unmarried couple with children; and Mr and Mrs Executive, a well-off couple whose children have left home. Mr &amp; Mrs Wrench. He earns Pounds 20,000 from his plumbing business but his wife has no income. They have a Pounds 40,000 mortgage and own two cars. In the 1993-94 tax year, he will gain Pounds 25 in income tax because of the widening of the 20 per cent band to the first Pounds 2,500 of taxable income. But they will spend an extra Pounds 10 a year on excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, and will face a 6 per cent rise - Pounds 143 a year - in motoring costs. The net effect is a loss of Pounds 128. Many of the chancellor's tax increases are postponed until 1994-95. From that date, the Wrenches will suffer from the restriction of the married couple's allowance to the 20 per cent band - this will cost them Pounds 86. The 1 per cent rise in Class 4 National Insurance contributions will add another Pounds 139 to their tax bill. The restriction of MIRAS to the 20 per cent band will also cost the couple Pounds 120 a year. Add an extra Pounds 72 of fuel costs, to reflect the 8 per cent VAT band of domestic fuel and power, and a further Pounds 75 in motoring expenses. Even though they will gain a further Pounds 25 from the continued widening of the 20 per cent band; the Wrenches will be a further Pounds 575 worse off than they were in 1993-94. He will qualify for the option of self-assessment in 1996-97 (see page III), but is uncertain about the administrative burden this will involve. Mr &amp; Ms Suburban. Each earns Pounds 30,000. He travels 5,000 business miles in his company car, which is a two-litre BMW320i with a list price of Pounds 18,500 (fuel is not provided). She has a private car. They have a joint Pounds 60,000 mortgage on a house bought after 1988, so they receive tax relief of only Pounds 30,000. But, because of his job, they are about to buy a new house in a higher-cost area and his employer is set to pay a relocation subsidy of Pounds 13,440. All this means the Budget has hit the Suburbans very hard: in particular, they suffer from the change in tax treatment of relocation costs. The chancellor made two adjustments in this area. Previously, the employer could give a tax-free allowance for moving to a higher-cost area, plus covering the actual costs of the move. Now, the relocation allowance is taxable and only the actual moving costs - of up to Pounds 8,000 - can be reimbursed without a tax liability. The staggering cost to the Suburbans is Pounds 5,376. They also suffer from higher alcohol and tobacco duties, motoring expenses and petrol costs. National Insurance costs rise, since the higher-rate band has moved from Pounds 405 to Pounds 420 a week. Even without the relocation effect, the Suburbans are more than Pounds 1,000 worse off in 1992-93. Since they have children, the Suburbans are entitled to the additional personal allowance of Pounds 1,720. But in 1994-05 this, like the married couple's allowance, will be limited to relief at 20 per cent; a cost to the couple of Pounds 344. What with all the other changes such as MIRAS, and the 1 per cent NI increase, the Suburbans will be Pounds 1,984 worse off in 1994-95 compared with the present tax year. Mr &amp; Mrs Executive. He earns Pounds 100,000 a year and she gets Pounds 30,000. He has a Rover as a company car and does 2,000 business miles, with fuel costs provided. They have Pounds 1,000 of dividend income outside a Pep and a further Pounds 1,200 inside. One Budget change which affects the Executives is the loss of tax relief on BES loan-backed schemes. This saved him Pounds 5,600 in tax in 1992-93. The dividend income of this couple is also affected by the chancellor's alterations to advance corporation tax. As the Price Waterhouse figures show, this higher-rate tax-paying couple sees a drop in its Pep income because of the change. The change does not improve the tax benefits of a Pep for higher-rate payers. All the other tax changes mentioned above hit the Executives, particularly the higher levies on company cars. His car benefit will increase from Pounds 8,625 in 1992-93 to Pounds 9,450 by 1994-95, an effective cost of Pounds 330 at 40 per cent tax. Excluding the opportunity cost of the BES, the couple is Pounds 799 worse off in 1993-94, and Pounds 1,826 worse off in 1994-95, compared with this tax year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MR &amp; MRS WRENCH  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1992-93     1993-94     1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total tax liability excluding mortgage                   3,609       3,584       3,645 National insurance                     874         874       1,013 Tax relief on mortgage                (599)       (599)       (479) Household fuel                         650         650         702 Alcohol and tobacco                    990       1,000       1,000 Motoring expenses                    2,380       2,523       2,598 Total costs                          7,904       8,032       8,479 Net cost of changes                    n/a         128         575  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Price Waterhouse.

Shushkevich is Filled by a  Militia General"]    [Text] Late in the evening on 26 January 1994 in the Oval  Hall of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, among a  small group of like-thinkers from the former party nomenklatura  the power of the Communists was finally restored. As a result of  a secret vote (in booths), the chairman of the Supreme Soviet,  S. Shushkevich--the only "new face" on the republic's political  Olympus--was recalled.    Most of the people took what happened calmly; there were no  heated rallies on the squares. What happened was no surprise to  the people because they knew their parliament.    The parliament of Belarus is a unique phenomenon of modern  times. It is the largest in the world (in terms of the number of  members of parliament per capita) and the last on the territory  of the former USSR to be elected under the leadership of the  CPSU. Only in the Belarusian parliament are there people who got  there through quotas of public organizations and, naturally, the  Communist Party. The revival of the relic could have occurred at  any time--all that were needed were favorable conditions.    The occasion was the arrest in Minsk of two ideological  soulmates from Lithuania--Burokjavicius and Ermalavicius.  Everyone knew that the former leaders of the Communist Party of  the neighboring republic were living in Belarus. They were  hidden, as it turned out, quite professionally, with the help of  Belarusian Communists, who were constantly moving from one  conspirator's apartment to another's.    Having isolated itself from the people for a week, the  Belarusian parliament expressed its international solidarity  with the two like-thinkers, demanded their return to Belarus,  and at the same time demanded the firing of the internal affairs  minister and the KGB chairman. Certainly not because they  committed certain procedural transgressions when arresting and  exiling the Lithuanians. The procurator general named a more  serious blunder: He had verbally sanctioned the arrest (which he  admitted, although not immediately). But parliament scolded him  and let him stay in his post. And the generals who were fired  were paying for the fact that two months earlier they had had  the audacity to write an open letter to the Supreme Soviet in  which they protested the Council of Ministers' usurpation of the  military and militia structures.    In the Supreme Soviet's justification for recalling  Shushkevich the phrase "lack of control" of the activity of the  aforementioned generals slipped through. But that was not the  only reason for such a radical decision. An additional, populist  wording was also generated: "manifestation of personal  indiscretion." This was suggested by the chairman of the  temporary commission of the Supreme Soviet "on corruption," a  people's deputy and sovkhoz director, Aleksandr Lukashenko--a  rank-and-file participant in the political action to remove  Shushkevich.    The farmers' newspaper NOVAYA ZEMLYA conferred on Lukashenko  the title "person of the week." His report on corruption  presented a mixture of generally known facts, slander, rural  hatred of another's good fortune, and ideological garbage. The  sovkhoz director dug up inaccuracies in the documents of the  repair and construction administration of the Council of  Ministers, which had repaired Shushkevich's apartment and dacha  and had placed a marker on his mother's grave. Not considering  it necessary to hear the accused out, the parliamentary relic  rejoiced: Get that mafia chieftain out of our ranks!    By the loutish fist of Lukashenko the party and state  nomenklatura, united by ideology and corruption, eliminated from  parliament the foreign element--Shushkevich. To make the fist  more deadly, troops obedient to the Council of Ministers were  brought to the Supreme Soviet twice (illegally).    But the Communists still would not have dared to remove  Shushkevich (there were no clear-cut reasons and his ratings  with the public were high) if external conditions had not been  favorable--Russia. It is a clear pattern: When there is a  political storm in Russia, there is political calm in Belarus.  Here people are waiting to see how things end there. And then  they will act accordingly.    It is possible to see Russian processes in Belarus without a  magnifying glass. So the Minsk version of the restoration of  communism is quite plausible in Moscow.    The success of the Russian Communists in the elections and  the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov--these were animating  factors in the revival of the Belarusian Communist relic. It  never was an independent organism. Having gained sovereignty, it  lost its head and froze in inaction. The structural  rearrangement of the national economy in Belarus was never  begun. The reforms were merely declared. The land is "public."  The gigantic plants imposed on the republic by imperial division  of labor are standing idle without raw material, batching items,  or wages. The "rabbit" is rapidly growing thin. The population  is becoming impoverished: Belarus has the lowest per capita  income in the CIS and the most expensive meat.    The main point in the government "program" has remained  unchanged for several years: "to restore economic ties with  Russia." That is, to restore everything to the way it was  before. "Economic alliance," "unification of monetary  systems"--in the minds of Belarusian strategists these are steps  on the way to political unification, to a "new federation" (the  main slogans of the pro-Council of Ministers People's Movement  of Belarus).    Shushkevich was an overt (and covert) counterbalance to the  communist forces of the two countries--Russia and Belarus--who  hate him because of the "Belovezha conspiracy" and are nurturing  plans for the restoration of the USSR.    As soon as Shushkevich was sent away, Council of Ministers  Chairman V. Kebich, making no secret of it, said that he saw a  "closer" association behind the economic union with Russia. And  he expressed joy over the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov, who  will not get in the way now. And he immediately announced his  idea of reorganizing the entire system of propaganda and  agitation: "We will take command of the mass media." He did not  take such liberties under Shushkevich--was he embarrassed or  something?    S. Shushkevich is an undoubted loss to Belarusian democracy  and national revival. With all of his shortcomings  (inconsistency, gentleness), he was the guarantor of an  intelligent and civilized parliament. Shushkevich's departure  from the political Olympus signifies a decline of its  moral-ethical level. The youth in parliament distinguished  themselves by special cruelty during the process of the assault  on Shushkevich. The "public" elders passed the communist baton  on to them.    The nomenklatura generated an organic particle of itself to  replace Shushkevich. Comrade general. It should not have been  otherwise. It was predictable that the nomenklatura would rely  on trouser stripes and shoulder boards--on force. Mechyslaw Hryb  was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of  Belarus (by a secret vote, in booths). He is 57 years old. He is  a militiaman by education and career. He rose to be chief of the  internal affairs administration of Vitebsk Oblast. He headed up  the permanent commission of the Supreme Soviet on questions of  national security, defense, and fighting crime.    M. Hryb is a completely unknown, lackluster personality in  Belarus. He is a person without a program of his own. He stated  that the program had already been developed by the Supreme  Soviet and is being implemented by the government, which he  supports. He has stated that the foreign policy of Belarus will  remain the same. But there will be adjustments: a) Belarus will  ratify the Treaty on Collective Security Within the CIS  (Shushkevich put forth reservations); b) Belarus will no longer  talk about pure neutrality since such a concept does not exist;  c) Belarus is in favor of the speediest and closest union with  Russia (Shushkevich spoke more about an equal economic  partnership)...    The people are trying to guess which he will be called:  MeCHYslaw or MecheSLAW. Announcers use both versions.</p>

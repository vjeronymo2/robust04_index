			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Following in George Soros' footsteps  -One year on from Black Wednesday, Philip Coggan finds out what scope there is for the private investor in currency funds A YEAR ago, sterling dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and its value against other European currencies dropped sharply. The international investor George Soros supposedly made a billion dollars out of the pound's fall. So how easy is it for private investors to follow the Soros route? Nipping down to the bank to exchange your pounds for Japanese yen is obviously too expensive a way of playing the foreign exchange markets. Currency funds are designed to give small investors the chance to diversify their assets. They need not be used purely for speculation. If you are planning to retire, or emigrate, to another country, a fund gives you the opportunity to build up savings in the currency of your new home. Given that the pound has shown a long-term tendency to decline (sterling was worth Dollars 4.03 in 1949), it may be sensible for a UK investor to hold part of his or her assets in a foreign currency. The drawback of currency funds is that they are invested purely in cash, or deposit, instruments. Over the long run, therefore, they tend to produce poor returns compared with the alternatives of bonds and equities. For example, the average dollar-denominated fund produced a return of 85.8 per cent over the 10 years to September 1 (offer-to-offer: source Hardwick Stafford Wright); the worst performing UK equity growth unit trust returned 98.9 per cent over the same period, whilst the average was 283.8 per cent. However, if you opt for a bond or equity-based overseas fund, you are no longer making a pure currency play. You might have picked the right currency (one which will appreciate against the pound) but the wrong equity or bond market, so that the losses on the latter wipe out your foreign exchange gains. One should also try not to get carried away by the short-term movements on the foreign exchange markets. Back in August 1992, the Weekend FT ran a piece highlighting the fact that the pound was worth around two dollars, a situation which appeared to be unsustainable, and suggesting ways that investors could profit from a dollar rebound. Sure enough, just over one year later, the pound is worth Dollars 1.53. The average dollar-denominated currency fund has given investors a return of 37 per cent, in sterling terms, over the year to September 1. But an investor would have done better to buy a UK equity growth unit trust, which returned an average 40.96 per cent over the period. Soros made his billion by allowing his funds to borrow to invest in the areas they favour. But that would be most unwise for a private investor. Having established all the caveats, suppose you are convinced that you have the power to predict the movements of the foreign exchange markets and you want to back your judgment. How do you pick your currency and how do you pick your fund? The factors which govern exchange rate movements are highly complex, but there are three obvious long-term influences: Inflation. The higher a country's inflation rate, the more its currency will tend to depreciate. Economists talk of 'purchasing power parity'; the theory that tradable goods, such as Mars bars, should cost the same, after exchange rate conversion, round the world. If goods are very expensive in one country, that is a sign its currency may be overvalued. This process can be self-perpetuating; if currencies devalue, the price of imported goods will rise, increasing inflation and putting pressure on the currency to devalue once more. Latin America provides an obvious example of the effect of inflation on currency values; in some countries, such as Brazil, hyperinflation and a rapidly deteriorating currency go hand in hand. But major currencies may stay out of line with their purchasing power parity values for quite a long time. Balance of payments. If a country is running a trade deficit then obviously it is paying out more for imports than it is receiving for its exports. Foreign traders will start to accumulate its currency, with which they will buy bonds or other investments. Since buyers and sellers of a currency are matched, the outflow on the current account of the balance of payments is ofset by an equal inflow of capital. For this reason, a big trade deficit may be sustained for several years; but if foreign investors lose confidence in the government's ability to control inflation or its trade and budget deficits, they will withdraw their money and the currency may depreciate extremely steeply. Alternatively, countries with balance of payments deficits may devalue their currencies, in order to make their exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers. Japan, which has a large balance of payments surplus, is willing to see the yen rise (which makes its exports more expensive for foreigners). The reasoning, no doubt, is that it is better to eliminate the deficit through a strong yen than through protectionist measures on the part of the West. Interest rates. If a country increases its interest rates, that increases the attraction of holding its currency. Therefore, high interest rates can be used to support a currency, as Britain used them during its membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism between 1990 and 1992. However, high interest rates can often indicate a weak currency, since investors need the high rate to compensate them for the expected depreciation. And investors will be happy to invest in a currency with low interest rates, if they expect the exchange rate to appreciate. It was foolish to think, in 1990, that there was an easy way to a cheap mortgage - borrowing in a foreign currency with lower interest rates than in the UK. The pound's decline since then will have increased the sterling value of the debt. Similarly, it would be wrong to assume that investing in a country with higher interest rates is a surefire way to achieve enhanced investment returns. It is important to remember, however, that all these factors which may be important to exchange rate movements in the long run may not matter in the short run. Foreign exchange traders tend to worry about the next hour rather than the next year; sentiment and chart patterns are just as likely to govern their actions as macro-economic factors. Once you have chosen your currency, based perhaps on its inflation, balance of payments position and so on, how do you make the next step of choosing the right fund? The first thing to realise is that currency funds are usually offshore-based and so, for those who remember Barlow Clowes, security must be an important consideration. The safest decision is to opt for those funds which come under the 'SIB recognised' heading in the Managed Funds pages of the FT. This means the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief financial services regulator, has accepted that regulation in the offshore centre is equivalent to that in the UK, and that the funds are run in a proper manner. After opting for a SIB-recognised fund, you must then make two further choices. The first is between a roll-up and a distribution fund. With the former, any gains made or income received are accumulated within the unit price; UK investors only pay tax when they withdraw money. This means that tax can be deferred, perhaps until the investor is in a lower tax bracket or has moved offshore. Distribution funds must pay out at least 85 per cent of their revenue as income, which is taxed as income. Any other gain (ie not income) is taxed under the capital gains tax rules. Distribution funds pay income gross which may be handy for non-taxpayers. Having chosen between distribution and accumulation (or roll-up funds), you must then choose between a managed fund and a single currency fund. Under the former, you select a fund manager who makes investment decisions on the basis of his or her expectation of currency movements. By investing in a broad spread of currencies, the fund is more stable than a single currency fund; however, the charges tend to be higher and investors cannot back their individual currency 'hunches'. The range of single currency funds is now very wide. Fidelity's Bermuda-based funds, for example, offer Australian dollars, Austrian schillings, Canadian dollars, Deutschmarks, Dutch guilders, Ecus, French francs, Hong Kong dollars, Irish punts, Italian lire, New Zealand dollars, Spanish pesetas, sterling, Swiss francs, and US dollars. Rothschild Asset Management's Guernsey funds also offer a very diverse selection, including Belgian francs and Danish krone. The tables show the top performing SIB-recognised funds over the past year in three categories: managed, US dollars and Japanese yen. Those seeking further details can find addresses and phone numbers on the Managed Funds pages in section one of today's FT.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top SIB recognised US Dollar funds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Centre   Perf     Min'm    Yld   Init   Ann                                      over     inv't      %    chg   chg                                      1 yr                       %     %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DB Invst Mgrs Dollarenta    Lux      52.2      1 share*   5.3   3  0.99 Abtrust Atlas Dollar Port   Lux      41.8  Dollars 1.5k  8.76  **   0.5 Govett GSI Dollar Cash      Jersey   37.6     Pounds 2k   1.9 0.5   0.5 Equifund-Wright  USDollars Res              Lux      36.7    Dollars 2k   n/a n/a   1.0 Guinness Flight Acc  USDollars                  Guernsey 36.5   Pounds 5k/   2.47 nil   0.5                                             Dollars 10k  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Dollars 57 ** up to 7.5 per cent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top performing SIB-recognised yen funds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Centre    Perf     Min'm     Yld   Init   Ann                                     over     inv't       %    chg   chg                                     1 yr                        %     %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guinness Flight Acc Yen   Guernsey  61.3   Pounds 5k/ 2.29    nil   0.5                                           Dollars 10k Eagle Star GAF Yen Lqd    Lux       61.3    Pounds 5k  2.5      5   0.5 Guinness Flight Dist Yen  Guernsey  61.2   Pounds 5k/ 2.33    nil   0.5                                           Dollars 10k Lloyds Int'l Yen          Guernsey  60.9  Dollars 10k 1.93    nil   0.9 RBC Int'l Yen Acc         Guernsey  60.8        Y1.5m 1.69    nil   1.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top SIB recognised managed funds  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Centre    Perf   Min'm     Yld   Init   Ann                                        over   inv't       %    chg   chg                                        1 yr                      %     %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guinness Flight GS Mgd Curr  Guernsey  51.2  Pounds 5/  4.91    5  0.75* Guinness Flight Acc Mgd Curr Guernsey  50.5  Pounds 5/  4.57    5  0.75* AIB Grofund USDollars  Mgd Acc                     Jersey    43.5  Pounds 2k  8.27    3   1.5 Hambros EMMA Dollars  Managed Dist                Guernsey  42.2  Pounds 2k  4.59    4   1.0 Capital House Dollars  Mgd Curr Acc                Jersey    40.4  Pounds 1k  1.78  5.5  1.25*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Plus custodian fee.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

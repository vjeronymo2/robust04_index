			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian delegation at the Moscow talks on  settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia decided today to finish  drafting the agreement on cease-fire and separation of the  forces discussed over the two last days. This was announced by  a member of the Georgian delegation, First Deputy Foreign  Minister Mikhail Ukleba in an interview with INTERFAX.    He pointed out that at the moment the document was not  ready.  Ukleba said it should be finished so that it reflects the main  idea of ensuring the safe return of refugees and displaced  persons. He added that this was the main purpose of deployment  of the peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone.    Ukleba stressed that this did not mean the talks had been  wrecked since the consultations would continue on Friday [13  May].    He suggested that the document would be prepared by 13 May  in  the evening. "I do not how much ready we will be for its  signing," Ukleba emphasized.    In accordance with the draft, the Georgian and Abkhazian  formations must be withdrawn for 12 km away from the Inguri  River creating a 24-km buffer zone where the CIS peacekeeping  forces would be deployed. They are expected to be formed of  Russian military contingency. UN observers will also be  stationed in this zone.    Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze stated in parliament on  12 May that the talks in Moscow were "very difficult."</p>

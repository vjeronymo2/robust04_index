			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko, Aleksandr Privalov, and </F> Andrey Shmarov entitled "Hunting Season for Private Investments  Opens"]    [Text] A favorite idea of KOMMERSANT experts, solving the  investment crisis through shared participation of the state in  investment projects, is definitely acquiring not only  well-wishers but active advocates in government organizations.  According to information received by the KOMMERSANT editorial  staff, the Ministry of Economics has submitted, simulatneously  to the government and to the judgment of business circles, "On  the Concept of State Participation in the Investment Process  Through the Use of Stock Market Instruments," This, of course,  is only the first step, but that's why it's important.  <H5>  Let's Congratulate Ourselves: The First Pancake is Being </H5> Baked    Employees of the Central Checking Investment Fund  participated with the specialists of the Ministry of Economics  in developing the concept, so it seemed natural to make the  All-Russian Conference of Checking Investment Funds the site for  the document's debut. This was held from 28 March through 1  April in Izhevsk. ChIFs [checking investment funds] approved the  basic provisions of the concept, which is natural, as we will  soon show.    The heart of the concept is a quite complicated mechanism  for  "attracting the capital of private investors for achieving goals  stipulated by state programs" through the concept of state  guarantees of investment activity. We will try to briefly -- and  consequently in an oversimplified way -- to describe the main  points of this mechanism.    The state, guided by its priorities, decides to invest in a  certain project. It accomplishes this as a purchase from the  recipient of the investment of a block of his stock (at face  value). The recipient is obligated to subsequently redeem the  shares at a price indexed to the dollar (a typical "repo"  operation takes place), and also gives the state bills of  exchange for yearly payments for interest for credit. For each  block of securities redeemed in this manner, the state  establishes a trust with a government agency. This agent -- here  is the central point of the concept -- "accepts the indicated  securities to its balance in exchange for its own obligations  which ensure the attraction of additional investment of private  investors and the full repayment of funds to the state, as well  as a rate of profit equal to the prime rate during the  established time period."    These government agents (the authors of the concept call  them  "General Investment Funds" or GRIFs [griffin] -- smells of  Freud, doesn't it?) may be of two types.    First, a GRIF can be a specially created "state guarantee  fund." Then the securities it issues would have the status of  state securities and represent, according to the authors'  notion, an "absolute guarantee" for private investors attracted  to participation in the given projects. These are the GRIFs  which would have to attract the population's capital, private  pension funds, and so on, "minimizing their risk in long-term  investment."    Second, a GRIF can be a non-state investment structure. In  this case it is delegated "the right to issue state guarantees  in the distribution of securities to private investors". For  example it could issue bonds to redeem these securities at a  certain fixed rate after a certain time period -- but not before  the given investment project is completed.  <H5>  "You would never understand what I will get out of this" </H5>   The scheme, to be sure, works out beautifully. Practically  nothing is required from the agent of the government, the GRIF.  Remember: it "ensures. . .the full repayment of funds to the  state, as well as a rate of return equal to the prime rate (! -  KOMMERSANT) in the established time period." And it achieves  these results entirely from the profits from investments, for,  it is assumed, other opportunities for using the money will be  closed to it according to the agreement with the state. There  are, it turns out, "wonderful growth areas" in our economy,  where investments pay for themselves in less than six months  (based on the current annual rate for centralized credits of 210  percent)!    What remains incomprehensible is: if the Ministry of  Economics specialists concede the presence of such "growth  areas" in the economy, then why not just extend credit to them  directly -- by using the capital of the Central Bank at a  refinancing rate with payoff in the aforementioned "established  time periods"? KOMMERSANT's experts (possibly due to their  naivete) supposed that the government's Credit Commission,  Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economics should have been  searching for just such ways of financing through centrally  allocated resources.    A second unclear point is: why did the document's drafters  so  blindly believe the credit allocated by the scheme would go to  investments, and not to the "idling" which they hate so much?  There are so many ways to convert investment money into working  capital that it is somehow indecent for the authors of this  document to pretend that they are not familiar with at least one.    And finally the third unclear point: why is it necessary to  create GRIFs to attract the population's funds to the investment  process, inventing two types of state agencies? If you don't  want to finance investment projects from Central Bank capital,  there is still a way out. Why not, for example, raise the rate  on deposits to the Russian Federation Savings Bank to the  refinancing rate and attract the population's money this way?  After all, the "growth areas" will guarantee everything "up to  par" and "on schedule." And the question of guarantees is also  solved -- deposits in the Savings Bank are guaranteed by the  state. There are also other types of profitable and guaranteed  assets (GKOs [short-term bonds], gold certificates, "October"  and "April" series treasury notes) which the state can issue and  put the money into investment projects.    In short, KOMMERSANT's experts get the feeling that the  proposed scheme does not promise any investment success for  either the state or private investors, except for that which  could be achieved by quite traditional methods.  <H5>  On failure and this attempt to kill two birds </H5>   Expressing the same conclusion somewhat differently, the  concept is inordinately complicated. It has, to use the term of  the medieval philosopher, too many superfluous essences, which  is bad for two obvious reasons. One, such an intricate design,  requiring the creation of a whole cohort of new institutions  from materials on hand, will not work in principle -- or, at  best, will take a long time to start to work. Two, if the state  agencies put all their strength into this scheme, then there  will be no strength left for the more natural (and that means  more promising) methods -- as we know, there isn't all that much  strength. The good deed of government encouragement of private  investment will be left undone.    The reason behind the extreme intricacy of the concept seems  perfectly obvious to KOMMERSANT experts. The trouble is that the  authors were trying to kill two birds with one stone: provide  joint state-private financing of priority projects, and save  hundreds of ChIFs from impending oblivion, hiring them in the  role of GRIFs.    Actually, the authors (remember that among them are  representatives of the ChIFs) don't hide the "dual use" in the  concept. That's just the way they write: "At present the  checking investment funds, realizing the difficulties associated  with the coming stock market crisis, and the real possibility of  total bankruptcy, are completely ready for transformation into  investment companies, investment banks, branches and departments  of investment banks" -- and so on, and so on.    "Such a trend in their development should be supported," but  for this reason: "create, based on them, an essential  infrastructure of agents of the RF government, who will fulfill  the functions listed above."    This train of thought is entirely understandable. Up to now,  the ChIFs were engaged in a rather unnatural business -- they  accumulated certain securities which were artificially invented,  not engendered by economic reality, and exchanged them for not  very natural shares of stock in enterprises which were to one  degree or another doing poorly. Now, when this business has  ended with the conclusion of the voucher era, the majority of  these economic homunculi, not hoping to survive in a real  economy, are hurriedly trying to find another just as unnatural  business. But if the ChIFs think the role of government agents  in the proposed scheme is just the role which would allow them  to survive, then it is hard to agree with them. Reread the list  of a GRIFs duties in previous administrations, and you will see  that a firm capable of surviving in such work does not need the  title of government agent.    But actually the ChIFs would like more: they would like a  part of the non-liquid shares of privatized enterprises which  they have already accumulated to be at least partially exchanged  for state securities within the framework of this scheme. This,  of course, is pure insanity; we simply don't feel like  commenting on such a plan of partial renationalization of the  most hopeless of the enterprises which have just been privatized.  <H5>  Bad is the block of wood that doesn't want to be Pinnochio </H5>   But there is, there is in the document a kernal of truth. If  the ministry specialists will rid themselves of their attraction  to their entrepreneur partners, who love themselves in business  more than the state interests in them (and thank God!), and will  chop off superfluous essences, then it is possible to cultivate  this kernal. Here is how this agrotechnical operation looks to  KOMMERSANT's experts.    First of all, about the guarantees to private investors,  whose money will be used to finance the projects. Everything  that is written in the document in this regard is too  complicated. In reality the matter is much simpler.    Shares in a project will be bought if they are safe and  profitable -- this is obvious. Here no state guarantees are  needed. On the contrary, the state has already compromised  itself as a reliable borrower and is just now beginning to win a  decent reputation (in particular, in the GKO market). For this  reason a far more impressive recommendation for potential  stockholders in a project is the participation of the private  investor who invests his own money in it.    From this comes the first conclusion. In each project with  shared investment the already invested private  capital should be clearly visible, with a minimum of  commercial secrets and a maximum of openess. Only this condition  will create for potential stockholders realistic prerequisites  for return on their money. That's the logic of investing. The  state only secondarily attracts private money. It primarily  seeks projects on which money has already been spent, evaluates  them according to their merit, and offers to help with money --  on terms advantageous to the private investor.    It's not bad if foreign capital participates in the project,  or if the possibility is at least seriously discussed. In the  Soviet mind, the capitalist will not miss out on a profit; an  analysis of the results of check auctions confirms this  recommendation.    Second conclusion. In order to make shares lucrative and  attractive to investors, whose funds are needed by the project  in addition to the state and private capital already invested,  one has to work to improve these shares. It is obvious to  everyone, however, that until the project starts to yield a  profit, there is no reason to count on dividends. Nevertheless  the earning potential of the securities can be ensured if the  securities are issued as growth stock.    If a dividend is even paid on growth stock, it is purely  symbolic; the profit comes as a result of the increase in price  of the security. The point is that effective, even potential,  investment in a real sector provides a real basis for growth.  First, because the value of the project's assets grows in  proportion to its development, even if not yet in operation  (recall from our investment surveys how costly unfinished  projects are). Second, the nearer the project is to completion,  the nearer the time it will begin to yield a return and  dividends. And the more clearly visible they are, the higher the  price -- every child knows this.    For this reason, the role of the "agent of the government"  which figures in the Ministry of Economics concept in reality  comes down to one thing: it must make markets in stock issues.  The task of such a market-maker is to price shares of stock,  raise their price, earn on margin. The task, clearly, is  difficult, but someone will succeed. Some ChIF, let's say, will  succeed -- wonderful! (and it's not worth mentioning anything  more about checking funds in this context).    This may be the basic scheme. It could be dressed up with  various decorations, but the essence won't change.    Let us comment on one other point in the document. For some  reason the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Economics are lately  more holy than the Pope; one and all shy away from the growth of  the budget deficit as from the Devil's temptation. No deficit is  fine, but this is unrealistic. In point of fact the authors  estimated the amount of private capital attracted, on which they  are counting, to be one trillion rubles. But this is a drop in  the bucket -- scarcely more than one percent of the year's  predicted investment program. What can you do with so little  money?    But the idea of shared financing is different. The trick is  in return of capital and effectiveness of investments. If shared  financing does this, then let the inflated money be invested by  the state. Paris, in the end, is worth the mass. And money.</p>

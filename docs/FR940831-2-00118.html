Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Cheryl Evans Dunfee, Attorney, Commission, dated April 21, 1994. Amendment No. 1 to the proposal made certain clarifying changes to the text of the proposed amendments to the NYSE Rules. In addition, accompanying Amendment No. 1 was a draft NYSE Information Memo to members which discusses the substance of the amendments to NYSE Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465. The Information Memo provides that the written designation of the registered investment adviser: be signed by the beneficial owner of securities; be addressed to the member organization; include the name of the designated investment adviser, and specify that the investment adviser is being designated to receive the proxy and related materials and vote the proxy. It also requires NYSE member organizations to assure themselves that the designated investment adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and that such adviser exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract, and maintains records substantiating this information. The Information Memo further specifies that beneficial owners of securities have an unqualified right at any time to rescind designation of the investment adviser to receive materials and to vote proxies. The rescission must be in writing and submitted to the member organization. On August 15, 1994, the NYSE submitted a revised draft Information Memorandum that added a statement that member organizations may wish to provide consolidated proxies and related materials to investment advisers designated by beneficial owners to exercise voting discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  letters from: Roger Hertog, President, Sanford C.

Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is amending several NYSE Rules related to the giving of proxies and the transmission of proxy and other related materials. Specifically, the NYSE is amending NYSE Rules: 450_Restriction on Giving of Proxies; 451_Transmission of Proxy Material; 452_Giving Proxies by Member Organization, and 465_Transmission of Interim Reports and Other Material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments to NYSE Rules 450, 451, 452 and 465 will permit investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercise investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract and who have been designated in writing by the beneficial owner, to receive proxy soliciting materials, annual reports and other related material and to vote proxies in lieu of the beneficial owners of securities. The term investment adviser is defined to include a registered broker-dealer ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a member organization). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, NYSE Rules prohibit a member organization from voting proxies, on a discretionary basis, on securities held in its custody, unless the securities are beneficially owned by a member organization, the beneficial owner has failed to provide the member organization with voting instructions and the subject of the vote is non-substantive, or the member organization is the investment manager for an ERISA account. Currently, NYSE Rules also require transmission of proxy and related issuer materials, as well as proxy voting instructions, to each beneficial owner of stock held in the member organization's possession and control. Rule 451.60 explicitly requires that proxy material be sent to a beneficial owner even though such owner has instructed the member organization not to do so. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NYSE Rule 451.60_Duty to transmit even when requested not to. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the Exchange, a number of member organizations along with the Investment Adviser Committee of the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') informed the Exchange that many of their customers who have their accounts managed by investment advisers do not want to receive proxy related information and annual reports, or vote the proxy. These member organizations have indicated that their customers would rather have the professionals, whom they pay to manage their accounts, represent their interests relative to the companies in which they own stock because the professionals are better qualified. In addition, the Exchange states that banks, investment advisers, and broker-dealers who are not subject to the Exchange's or similar rules may receive proxy material and vote proxies on behalf of their customers in accordance with fiduciary obligations set forth by contractual arrangement. Accordingly, the Exchange is making the following changes to permit beneficial owners to designated investment advisers that are registered broker-dealers to receive materials and proxies and to vote proxies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NYSE Rule 450_Restrictions on Giving of Proxies_currently provides that no member organization shall give or authorize the giving of a proxy to vote stock registered in its name, or in the name of its nominee, except as required or permitted under the provisions of Rule 452, unless the member organization is the beneficiary owner of the stock. The Exchange proposes to add an exception (paragraph (2)) to Rule 450, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  that would provide that any person registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and who has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner to vote the proxies for stock which is in the possession or control of the member organization, may vote such proxy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The first exception to Rule 450_paragraph (1)_provides that any member organization designated by a named fiduciary as the investment manager of stock held as assets of an ERISA Plan that expressly grants discretion to the investment manager to manage, acquire or dispose of any plan asset and which has not expressly reserved the proxy voting right for the named fiduciary may vote the proxies in accordance with its ERISA Plan fiduciary responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 451_Transmission of Proxy Material_generally provides that, whenever a person soliciting proxies furnishes a member organization copies of all soliciting material which the person is sending to registered holders, and satisfactory assurance that he will reimburse such member organization for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such member in connection with such solicitation, such member shall transmit to each beneficial owner of stock which is in its possession or control, the material furnished. The Exchange is amending Rule 451, paragraph (a) to add the requirement that the member organization may also transmit the soliciting material to an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 who exercises investment discretion pursuant to an advisory contract for the beneficial owner and has been designated in writing by the beneficial owner of such stock (``designated investment adviser'') to receive soliciting material in lieu of the beneficial owner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (1): The double-edged sword - A look at the region's plans to spur economic growth and create business opportunities with the aid of Pounds 628m from the European Union Merseyside has been handed a two-edged sword. This week the European Commission approved outline plans to spend Pounds 628m of EU money over the next six years to help one of Britain's most deprived conurbations catch up with other more prosperous parts of Europe. This is Merseyside's share of the EU's 'Objective 1' funding for those parts of Europe where the local gross domestic product per head is less than three-quarters of the EU average. Other beneficiaries include Greece, Portugal, Ireland, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and parts of the former east Germany. The award does bring with it its own dilemma, as Mr John Stoker, head of the UK government regional office on Merseyside and the man who will be in charge of the money, points out. 'Objective 1 is two-edged because you can interpret it positively or negatively.' In other words, if an area needs such help, that might put investors off. Yet, if the resources are handled well, they could accelerate economic growth and create unprecedented business opportunities, reversing the decline that has enveloped Merseyside for decades. The trick, as the conurbation's leaders recognise, is to cut with the right edge of the sword. Worried Eurocrats in Brussels rejected initial proposals. These would have involved the disbursement of funds on projects not dissimilar to others that have so far failed to stop the decline. Training is one of these. Professor Patrick Minford, Liverpool University's celebrated monetarist, has warned that soft-focus training  - preparing people for jobs that might never materialise - is likely to encourage emigration in search of work, further weakening the skills base. He wants more spent on physical infrastructure, arguing that freer movement encourages trade. Brussels called in Mr Peter Lloyd, professor of geography at Liverpool University, to redraw the spending plans. Among the people he consulted was Prof Michael Parkinson, whose European Institute of Urban Affairs at Liverpool John Moores University has done definitive work for the EC on why some cities succeed while others fail. The result is a strategy based on five economic 'drivers' - big companies, small companies, technology transfer, leisure industries and human resources. Brussels has accepted the principles involved, perhaps noting some signs that the tide may already be turning. As Mr Jack Stopforth, former head of economic development at the abolished Merseyside County Council and now a marketing consultant, observes: 'The image of Merseyside is now lagging behind the reality. Before, we used to say Merseyside was great, and try to make it so. Now it's getting great but it doesn't look like it yet.' The membership and subscription list of the Mersey Partnership - which will use Objective 1 funds to market the area worldwide - supports him. Councils and companies have contributed between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 150,000 each to raise more than Pounds 1m. They clearly mean to make it work and seem to have learnt the lessons of what has produced successful regeneration elsewhere. The lessons are that there have to be leaders; they have to sink their differences and work together; and they have to develop a wider vision of the community than their own role in it. 'There has been a telling influx of young or vigorous people into key positions. Many are newcomers, unconstrained by the great burden of Merseyside's past. They have a commonsense approach which is yielding benefits,' Mr Stopforth points out. Already in place is Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency now chaired by Sir Desmond Pitcher, the chairman of North West Water. It has rescued the Mersey waterfront from dereliction, though it has blotted its copybook recently with a public relations disaster over financial losses incurred by a promotional opera concert. An infrastructure of financial and professional service providers is re-establishing itself. Among them, KPMG Peat Marwick is playing a central role in devising and evaluating financial mechanisms needed for regeneration, while Grant Thornton's Mr Amin Amiri is running a vigorously competitive corporate finance operation from Liverpool. The latest newcomer is Mr Ian Lobley, director of 3i's Merseyside office, the successor to Mr Rob Toomey, who has joined Edward Billington, the Liverpool sugar merchant and food process group, as development director. Mr Lobley provides the best evidence of growth where it is needed most (because more jobs are created there) - in the small and medium-sized business sector. 'Our local equity book has grown from Pounds 10m to Pounds 35m since 1991. 3i's total portfolio has risen from Pounds 39m to Pounds 63m in the same period,' he says. He believes the base of small and medium-sized businesses is too small and must be seriously nurtured. Mr Tim Beer, in charge of a new operation for KPMG dealing with owner-managed businesses, thinks mergers and acquisitions among them - possibly aided by a new fund set up with Objective 1 help - is one answer. The region's basic problems, leading up to the need to seek special assistance from Brussels, have been the changing patterns of world trade, transportation technology and global economic groupings. Nearly a century ago, Liverpool was the leading European terminal for transatlantic emigration to the US and for world trade. It grew rich on it but has been in relative decline ever since. A body similar to the new Mersey Partnership was proposed in the 1920s, when it was already clear that a damaging change to the economic structure was under way. The jet age, bulk cargo handling, containerisation of shipped freight, and Britain's political and economic alliance with an ever-uniting Europe have all further accelerated Merseyside's decline since the 1981 Toxteth riots. Church leaders - notably the Rt Rev David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool - characterised the riots as an explosion of frustrated helplessness in the face of unbridled market forces, but the aftermath did more damage as Merseyside demonstrated an unrivalled ability to shoot itself in the foot. Marxist factions on Liverpool's city council and among its town hall trade unions sought to municipalise as much of the local economy as they could. Bitter confrontation with the Thatcher government ended with 47 councillors disqualified for financial mismanagement and Liverpool in debt to foreign banks which had financed a series of deficit budgets. With Merseyside's capital emanating little but bad news, the private sector and the four other Merseyside councils - Wirral, St Helens, Knowsley and Sefton - ran for cover and decided to act independently. Seven years after the House of Lords confirmed the disqualifications, the Merseyside community is coming together again, though with less than wholehearted commitment from Wirral, which watches developments warily from its self-contained peninsula across the Mersey from the other four, contiguous, boroughs. In the meantime, the Labour party has expelled most of its known local Marxists or hard-left former members who would not accept the discipline of Mr Harry Rimmer, Liverpool's moderate leader. Most local leaders believe Merseyside touched rock bottom in 1991 with a seven-month town hall strike But although relative economic decline has since continued - resulting in Objective 1 status - there are signs it may now be reversible. Merseyside seems to have finally got its act together. All it needs to do over the next six years is to spend Pounds 628m of EU funds wisely.</p>

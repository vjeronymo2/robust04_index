			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: My Favorite Year - Theatre in New York Remember 1954? I don't. I was not yet born during the heyday of live television comedy and matinee idols, the era in which My Favorite Year, the first Broadway musical of the New York season, is set. But I can certainly remember the 1980s and early '90s, as musicals like Phantom of the Opera, Starlight Express, and Miss Saigon have upped the genre's technological ante at the expense of originality and humanity. These memories have a lot to do with why I found My Favorite Year, which recently played at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in a Lincoln Center Theatre production, so wonderfully refreshing. This new musical, based on the 1982 film of the same name starring Peter O'Toole, is far from perfect, but what it has in large supply, which so many of today's musicals lack, is charm. It is a good, self-contained, self-controlled little musical, and unlike last season's nostalgia vehicles  -the Gershwin mishmash Crazy for You and Jerry Zaks' over the top revival of Guys and Dolls - it does not give the sense of material worked over and tarted up with making millions in mind. The creative team - lyricist Lynn Ahrens, composer Stephen Flaherty and writer Joseph Dougherty - has filled out the movie's strong story line with a tight, clever book and tuneful songs that spring naturally from the action and dialogue. It is the tale of junior comedy writer Benjy Stone (Evan Pappas), who is assigned to keep his now-faded and drunken childhood movie idol Alan Swann (Tim Curry) off the sauce for the week Swann is the guest star of 'King Kaiser's Comedy Cavalcade'. Given that set up, everything that you think will happen happens, with a decidedly 1990's personal-growth twist. Swann charms everyone, falls off the wagon and clambers on again just in time to save the day and make up with his long-neglected teenage daughter. Handling Swann mixes up Benjy's life just enough so that he can really shine in straightening it out: he gets the girl; recognition for his yeoman writing duties; and in bonding with Swann works through some lingering bad feelings about his own father, who deserted his family when Benjy was young. It is all pretty predictable, but Ron Lagomarsino's production clips along with such verve and it is all played with such freshness that the lack of originality does not seem to matter. Pappas' Benjy embodies what makes My Favorite Year charming; he is as simple and perky as his bow tie, with a soaring singing voice and some of the production's best numbers on which to show it off. Curry's Alan Swann is less successful; he is too obviously playing at star quality, the essence of which is effortlessness. A shame, because when he lets down his guard, as in his climactic confrontation with Benjy in 'The Lights Come Up,' his natural magnetism is estimable: he can swashbuckle through my musicals in his Musketeer getup anytime. Andrea Martin, as the doubletaking second-banana comedy writer Alice Miller, gets the show's best laughs and its cleverest musical number: 'Professional Showbusiness Comedy.' Her performance is almost too excellent, though, because it points out what keeps My Favorite Year merely good instead of sublime. If only the whole production had her dead-on, period-specific zing] My Favorite Year saves the title tune, its most memorable, for last and is this good, old fashioned musical's final nod to the classic rules of showbusiness: it leaves 'em humming.</p>

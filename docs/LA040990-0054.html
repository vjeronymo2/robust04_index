			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ATTEMPT TO TAKE ECOLOGY PAYOUT BLASTED  </P> <P> The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund has denounced an apparent move by the U.S.  Justice Department to send a $4.2-million settlement check to the government  instead of spending it on environmental work around San Francisco Bay as  planned.  </P> <P> The proposed consent agreement with Union Oil Co. of California, a subsidiary  of Unocal Corp., would settle a suit brought in 1984 by the environmentalist  group under the federal Clean Water Act for alleged pollution of the bay.  </P> <P> Sierra Club attorneys say they were prepared to charge more than 2,300 civil  violations had the case gone to court in February.  </P> <P> Unocal agreed to pay $2.72 million to the Trust for Public Land to be used on  wetlands and other land around the bay; $1 million for a study of  dredging-material disposal and $500,000 for emergency pollution response.  </P> <P> In a letter dated March 12, a Justice attorney put the San Francisco District  Court on notice that "any penalties . . . should be made by check payable to  the 'United States Treasury.' "  </P> <P> "This is one of those cases where we are simply quoting the law," said Amy  Casner, Justice Department spokeswoman. "We have to do that."  </P> <P> Sierra Club attorney Stephan C. Volker called the move -- the first intrusion  into the 6-year-old case by Justice -- "preposterous and infuriating." If  successful, he said, the money would disappear in the "bottomless pit" of the  federal general fund.  </P> <P> Jeff Callender, spokesman for Unocal, called the letter "ambiguous," adding  that the question is unresolved in the law.  </P></p>

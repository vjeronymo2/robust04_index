			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Russian farmers need more aid' MR VIKTOR Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, said yesterday the state would need to spend far more than the Rbs160bn (Pounds 185m) announced last week in extra subsidies to help farmers feed the country. If the ailing budget could not be stretched any further, Mr Khlystun proposed levying a 3 per cent tax on the profits of enterprises in other sectors of the beleaguered economy to raise money for agriculture, which remains dominated by state and collective farms. Mr Khlystun said Rbs600bn was needed just to help peasants meet fuel and equipment bills so they could get on with sowing. That was because much of their revenue existed only on paper because they were still owed money by other debt-burdened enterprises. He said the problems were particularly acute in milk and meat production, which had fallen by 18 per cent last year, compared with a general decline in agricultural output of 8 per cent. He said he would propose a more effective mechanism for distributing subsidies in a couple of months. 'If you produce better quality meat for instance, you will get a higher subsidy,' he told a news conference. His ultimate goal was to shift subsidies from producers to consumers but he said that would not be possible until the country developed a social welfare system capable of distributing subsidies to the worst off in society. Agriculture has been severely affected by a 'scissors crisis' under which the price of finished goods, including agricultural equipment, had risen more sharply than prices paid to peasants. Before last week's package, initially estimated to cost Rbs160bn, Russia's budget deficit for 1993 has been projected at Rbs3.5 trillion (million million), the amount the government sees as the limit for lowering it to 5 per cent of gross domestic product from unofficial estimates of 10 to 15 per cent last year. Mr Khlystun said government farm subsidies, expected to reach Rbs430bn in the first half of this year, would 'not be significantly higher' than the Rbs128bn promised and paid for the whole of 1992, if inflation was taken into account.</p>

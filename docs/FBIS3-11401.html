This proposal  was made in Brasilia today.    Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu pointed out that the  initiative for seeking a consensus candidate "may seem a vague  response, but it is in fact a responsible one" given the  atmosphere of confrontation arising from the candidacies of  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus.    The third aspirant for replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao  Baena Soares is Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Burelli, who together with Abreu is participating in the two-day  meeting of Rio Group foreign ministers which was inaugurated  today at Itamaraty, the seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.    The Uruguayan Foreign Minister noted that the controversy  between groups of countries -- Central America and the Caribbean  support Niehaus, whereas North and South America endorse Gaviria  -- may lead to a split in the organization, which could have an  adverse effect on the tenure of the next secretary general.    Abreu neither gave many details about his initiative, nor  did  he put forward for consideration the name of a possible  candidate. He said that his proposal had met with the approval  of the Rio Group delegations, especially those from countries  that fear a split in the OAS.    Abreu stated: "The OAS ought not to go to elections with a  confrontation. If we leave things as they stand now, we will  start the new tenure of the General Secretariat with an  entrenched split."    Seven of the 13 Rio Group nations -- Mexico, Argentina,  Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support Gaviria  on the grounds that his election will bring prestige to the OAS,  as he has successfully discharged his duties as Colombian  president, his four-year term in office expiring in August.    Although his country supports Gaviria, Argentine Deputy  Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella seconded the idea of debating  a consensus formula.    Within the Rio Group, Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad and  Tobago endorse Niehaus' candidacy. Only Venezuela endorses  Burelli.    The other members of the group have not yet decided for whom  they will vote. Uruguay is in favor of reaching a consensus on  the candidacy, and Ecuador -- which had pledged to support  Niehaus in 1993 -- has recently indicated that it will not come  to a decision until the minute before each country's ambassador  hands in the ballots at the OAS headquarters.    Diplomatic sources in Brasilia reported that if Gaviria  decides not to run for office, Bolivia would be willing to vote  for the Costa Rican foreign minister.    In response to a question asked of him by reporters, Chilean  Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa said that he will respect "the  commitment" to vote for Niehaus made by former President  Patricio Aylwin several years ago, when Gaviria was not yet a  candidate.    This pledge is included in a joint declaration issued by  Aylwin and Costa Rican President Rafael Calderon -- both of whom  are Social Democrats -- after a meeting.</p>

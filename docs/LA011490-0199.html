			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR WANTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: STATE SEN. MARIAN BERGESON OF NEWPORT BEACH WILL BE INTRODUCING  LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT DEUKMEJIAN'S CLEAR MESSAGE.  </P> <P> When it comes to year-round schools, Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state  budget contains few specifics and very little new money, but it sends a clear  political message that the state's fiscally conservative chief executive wants  California schools off the traditional summer-break calendar.  </P> <P> "We're not exactly sure of the specifics of this, but I think the message is  clear: He wants us to move in that direction," Bill Honig, state superintendent  of public instruction, said last week.  </P> <P> "The governor has never taken such a strong position in use of facilities  year-round. It's his boldest, strongest statement to date," said Charles  Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Education.  </P> <P> Referring to a continuing explosion in school enrollment, Deukmejian in his  State of the State address Monday proposed three steps pushing the state toward  year-round schools.  </P> <P> Saying California schools cannot afford to "depend simply on building our way  out of the shortage of classrooms," Deukmejian proposed increasing incentives  to districts that switch to multitrack, year-round calendars that ensure that  classrooms do not sit idle for weeks at a time.  </P> <P> His package also includes allocating slightly more money to reward districts  that have multitrack, year-round schools and loosening requirements for voter  approval of local bond measures to build year-round schools. He also proposed  giving districts with year-round schools priority in tapping the state's pool  of school construction funds, a plan similar to an existing law.  </P> <P> It is unclear what effect the governor's proposals will have on the Los Angeles  Unified School District, where year-round schools are being hotly debated as  the district struggles to cope with massive overcrowding. About 23% of the  district's 610,000 students already attend year-round schools, contrasted with  only 9% of students statewide.  </P></p>

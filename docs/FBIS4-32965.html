			<p>BFN     [Text] Engineer Franck Pierre, secretary general of the  Capois Lamort Organization of Haiti [OCLH], has called for a  state of siege. Pierre has written Lieutenant General Raoul  Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH],  demanding the state of siege and calling for the president of  the Republic and Parliament to declare a state of siege to  prepare for any possible provocation in Haiti. The current  political sphere of influence continues to tear Haiti's social  fabric and has led the country to a fatal deadlock, clearly  threatening our national sovereignty with the military  intervention of foreign powers known as Friends of Haiti.    The OCLH can in no way remain indifferent and idle during  crucial points in the nation's life and has decided to save and  defend our national independence. The OCLH earnestly and firmly  asks the FADH high command: 1) To order a state of alert at all  military bases in the nine geographic departments and to put the  Army on alert; 2) To call up all officers, noncommissioned  officers, and retired soldiers [words indistinct].</p>

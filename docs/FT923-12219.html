			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: News-packed week gives food for thought ON Friday last week the short-end of the Treasury market enjoyed a short but sharp rally on rumours that President Bush was afflicted by serious health problems. Although the rumours turned out to be false (as they almost invariably do - in Chicago, they have a saying that the President of the US dies once a month on the floor of the futures exchange), it showed how jumpy the market was at the end of what had been an unusually busy and news-packed week. Thursday's increase in German interest rates was probably the biggest story because of its international dimensions and the effect the Bundesbank's move had on the vulnerable dollar. The German rate rise was open to interpretation in two ways: it was bullish for Treasuries because higher German interest rates will slow down European, and ultimately US, economic growth, which is good for bonds; or it was bearish for Treasuries because with higher German interest rates pushing the dollar lower, the Federal Reserve will be less likely to sanction another cut in US interest rates for fear of sending the already weak US currency into a tailspin. There were a few other stories for the markets to feed on last week. Mr Ross Perot's sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the election race was generally well-received, not because of any particular dislike for the diminutive Texan billionaire, but because his departure removed a large element of political uncertainty that had been troubling US financial markets for months. The Democrats' successful convention in New York, and Governor Bill Clinton's surge in the polls after the Perot withdrawal provided further food for thought, food that the markets found less than palatable, given their concern for what the Democratic candidate might, if elected, do to the Federal budget deficit with his ambitious spending plans. As Mr David Ader, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston said recently: 'One of the significant factors contributing to the steepening of the Treasury yield curve is this week's Democratic convention. While the Democrats scream 'Jobs] Jobs] Jobs]' the Street only hears 'Spend] Spend] Spend]' and backs off.' Friday morning's trade figures were also worthy of the bond market's attention. The bigger-than-expected Dollars 7.4bn May trade deficit was partly explained by a 2.5 per cent decline in exports (imports also fell, but less sharply). With exports now down three months in a row, there is little doubt that economic growth in the second quarter will eventually come out well below the 2.7 per cent achieved in the first three months of the year. In this respect, the trade numbers were a positive for Treasuries. As for this week, in the absence of valuable statistics other than the notoriously volatile and unreliable advance durable goods orders, due on Friday, the bond market is likely to focus on Congress, where Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will be giving his twice-yearly Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Mr Greenspan, as always, is unlikely to give away anything that would move the markets, but he will at least be asked to outline the policy thinking behind the big cut in interest rates earlier this month. At the time the rate cut was seen as a panicky response to the dreadful June employment numbers, and by less charitable observers as a caving in to political pressure from the White House, but Mr Greenspan's views on the current state of the economy, and on whether he believes the Fed has finished easing, should make interesting hearing.</p>

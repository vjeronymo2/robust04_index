			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, the chairman of the board of  the secretariat of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP], emphasized that those who ran away from  implementing the pledge and accord document about which they  used to talk a big mouth talk are the ones who plunged Yemen  into civil infighting and who set plans for a brutal crime, the  effect of which will not end for generations to come.    He clarified in an interview with the Middle East satellite  television channel, MBC, that the war imposed on the Yemeni  people has levelled the gunpowder, the bullets, and the shells  to the heart of the unity and that the unity has been stabbed in  the back. Pointing to those who committed this brutal crime, he  said that this brutal crime did not only lead to the killing of  the citizens in the peaceful villages and cities but it also  directed a stab against the Yemeni people and to its history and  future. He said: In this critical situation I call upon ... if  we want to preserve something for the future, it is in the  interests of Yemen that people are pledged to a logic rather  than the logic of war. [sentence as heard] As for some, to put  the invasion or the manipulation is the impossible which cannot  be done. [sentence as heard] Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man reiterated  that he that received reports from the war- mongers must know  that they are [word indistinct]. He expressed satisfaction  about the good intermediation efforts and said in this  connection: Those who reject these intermediation under the  illusion of achieving a military victory must wake up from their  illusions, which I am afraid will hit them in their strongholds.    [Al-Jundi] What is the purpose of your visit to Riyadh?    [Al-Iryani] To discuss bilateral ties and explain the  situation in Yemen.    [Al-Jundi] Reports say that you personally were behind the  failure of the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Salalah in Oman. You  reportedly said that the southerners offered proposals that  contradict Yemeni unity.    [Al-Iryani] Yes. This remains my opinion. I believe in it.    [Al-Jundi] Can we say that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  as  chairman of the Presidential Council, can issue a cease-fire  order to protect Yemeni unity and, above all, Yemeni blood?    [Al-Iryani] If the Armed Forces obey the authority of the  state and the orders of the supreme commander of the Armed  Forces, then I am sure he will.    [Al-Jundi] The Presidential Council dismissed Prime Minister  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and the defense minister, while the  House of Representatives dismissed Presidential Council Vice  Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-'Attas told the Voice of the  Arabs that the decisions were illegitimate and that the House of  Representatives and the Presidential Council had no right to  carry out such dismissals.    [Al-Iryani] Concerning the prime minister, the defense  minister, and the oil minister, they were dismissed on the basis  of a clear constitutional provision, namely, Article 111. The  House of Representatives did not withdraw confidence from 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, but from those who support secession and work  against Yemeni unity.    [Al-Jundi] Through your current contacts, is there a glimmer  of hope for a settlement and calm in Yemen or will the war  continue?    [Al-Iryani] You cannot lose hope. I believe the fighting  will not continue long, but that sense and reason will prevail.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Al-Iryani] You are welcome.</p>

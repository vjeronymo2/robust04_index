			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Staying the Course"] </F>   [Text] In typical FERAL TRIBUNE style, mixing seriousness  with satire, reporter Marinko Culic examines Croatian foreign  policy and the threat of possible international economic  sanctions in the latest issue of this Split weekly. Despite the  possibility that Croatia will soon "sail" into international  sanctions, the "ship" of state does not show any visible signs  that something serious is happening. The course remains the  same. One hears an angry but inconsequential foreign policy  debate carried on by the opposition. According to FERAL TRIBUNE,  for a short while the opposition even succeeded in convincing a  part of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] that  Croatian foreign policy was misdirected. However, both soon grew  silent as if they were afraid of their combined strength.    A possible introduction of sanctions against Croatia  certainly would not be enough to shake the image of the  president who takes credit for everything in the country.  However, the sanctions could probably cause suspicion and  mistrust and lead to uncertainty as to what to expect next.    Enumerating these factors, Marinko Culic concludes that the  next moves by President Tudjman will be interesting, especially  with regard to his relations with that wing of HDZ which wants  the international sanctions -- as the best environment for  creating the Croatia it wishes for.</p>

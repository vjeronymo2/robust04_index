			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Berlusconi Gets 3 Million Preference </F> Votes"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- Elected and rejected. Guess who is going  to Strasbourg? The man with the most votes, Silvio Berlusconi,  is not going there, despite almost three million personal  preference votes in the five electoral districts in which he  headed the list. As prime minister, Berlusconi cannot be elected  to the European Parliament, but the plebiscite is nonetheless  impressive. To give an idea, the second person is Gianfranco  Fini, with two million preference votes (but the National  Alliance leader received most of his votes in the South); while  in third place we find PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  Secretary Achille Occhetto, for whom obviously 1,100,000  personal votes obtained in three--not five--voting districts,  were not enough to avoid his resignation yesterday.    Cut down in size but elected were all the other leaders,  from  Umberto Bossi [Northern League] to Mario Segni [Pact for Italy],  from Marco Pannella [Radical] to Carlo Ripa di Meana [Greens],  from Fausto Bertinotti [Communist Renewal] to Pierferdinando  Casini, coordinator of the Christian Democratic Center, who,  campaigning in the south under the Forza Italia banner, came  immediately after Berlusconi with another 200,000 votes. Even  more notable was the feat of Leoluca Orlando who had the  satisfaction -- unique in Italy -- of beating Berlusconi in  Palermo, the city of which the Rete leader is mayor.    Remaining with the mayors, the following have become members  of the European Parliament: Marco Formentini of Milan (Northern  League); Salvatore Tatarella of Cerignola (National Alliance);  the brother of Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe; and Giancarlo  Cito of Taranto, the owner of the local TV6 television station,  elected at the head of his own list, the Southern Action League.  Also elected was Bologna's mayor Renzo Imbeni (PDS). [passage  omitted]</p>

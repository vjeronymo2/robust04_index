			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Wanna traded option? It had to happen sooner or later - gambling on gambling has arrived, thanks to the Chicago Board Options Exchange. On Monday the CBOE starts trading options on an index of 15 US casino operators on land and water. It reckons the move will appeal to those interested in hedging exposure to the gaming sector. It sounds more like a sophisticated version of the old three-card trick. But the decision is even more piquant, because Chicago has yet to get involved in the gambling craze sweeping across the US. The only legal betting allowed within city limits is on state-sponsored lotteries and off-track betting on horses. If Richard Daley, Chicago's mayor, had his way, the windy city would build its own casino. No way, says Jim Edgar, Illinois governor, who's very protective about his state's growing riverboat gaming business. Why not join forces, and get the riverboats plying the city's waters?</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: MTM secures extended bank facilities MTM, the chemicals group, has secured extended credit facilities with its banks until January 4 next year. The move, involving a standstill arrangement, follows two short extensions after the disclosure last month that it was in breach of its covenants. MTM ended the 1991 year with total endebtedness of Pounds 82.2m. By last month, when the group announced its results for 1991, debt had risen to Pounds 106.7m. Mr Ken Schofield, the newly appointed chief executive, has said his main objective would be to reduce the company's debt to about Pounds 50m. Meanwhile, the company has received the final version of a report by auditors Binder Hamlyn on the events leading up to the series of profit warnings this spring. The report is understood to reveal transactions that were 'incorrectly recorded' last year and in 1990.</p>

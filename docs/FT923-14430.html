			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / AEEU to assist Romania unions THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging the AEEU engineering and electrical union to provide know-how to the nascent free trade unions of Romania, Michael Smith writes. The Foreign Office's 'know-how fund' has paid the expenses of Mr Nigel Harris, an AEEU executive councillor, for an exploratory visit to the former communist country. It has also agreed in principle to a two-week visit by eight of the unions' officials. The Foreign Office's know-how fund was set up in 1989 to provide technical assistance for east European countries to adapt to market economies. Although the AEEU money will have only a limited impact on the fund's annual budget of Pounds 46m, its use may raise the eyebrows of some Tory MPs. The AEEU is a moderate union but led the successful campaign for a 37-hour week for engineering workers. Mr Harris said that in Romania he and his colleagues would aim to show how unions could operate in a market economy with a multi-party political system. The union's engineering section last year incurred a deficit of Pounds 949,714, according to its accounts published yesterday. It was the third deficit in three years but the union expects staff reductions and property sales to result in surpluses by 1993.</p>

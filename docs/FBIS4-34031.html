			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Sugar workers from Santiago de Cuba and other  provinces will work hard not only to harvest the last bit of  sugarcane but also to properly prepare for the next harvest  under adverse conditions. This commitment was made to the  provincial Communist Party of Cuba leadership during an  assessment of the results of the last 10 days of the harvest.  The province has already surpassed the production level  attained in the last harvest and is gearing up to complete the  remaining sugar production. This goal implies establishing a  link between the cane waiting to be processed and the mills with  higher production capacities. This vital final period is  getting the support of the manual and combine workers from mills  that have completed operations.    Only the Rafael Reyes, Salvador Rosales, and America Libre  Mills have met their sugar production goals to date.  Recognizing their success, Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado  Ventura and Esteban Lazo instructed the management of those  mills to present labor feat banners to their respective workers.    Machado Ventura stated that together with the efforts that  the current harvest demands, it is necessary to guarantee, by  every means, the sugarcane spring planting campaign. This makes  it necessary for Santiago de Cuba to increase the daily pace to  keep up with the program. Esteban Lazo stated this is why we  need to take advantage of the days remaining in June to get  ahead without neglecting crop tending tasks.</p>

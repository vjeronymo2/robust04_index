			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH PASADENA PUTS THE BITE ON NAIL SALONS  </P> <P> Nail salons looking for a toehold in South Pasadena may be out of luck soon.  </P> <P> Councilman Amedee Richards suggested at last week's council meeting that the  city investigate the possibility of limiting the number of certain types of  commercial enterprises in South Pasadena.  </P> <P> Richards said he would like to see a "balancing of the nature of the businesses  we have here."  </P> <P> He cited a recent survey by the South Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, which found  that there are 18 hair and nail salons, 16 fast-food restaurants, 15  dry-cleaning shops and seven video rental stores in the 3.4-square-mile city.  </P> <P> The matter was referred to the Planning Commission for further study.

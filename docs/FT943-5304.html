			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Media Futures: European push for caller-pays pagers In the US and Asia-Pacific, pagers are an integral part of the mobile communications sector. The US has 21m paging subscribers, Asia-Pacific 19m, and in some Asian cities pagers are as much a teenage fashion accessories as means of communication. Western Europe, by contrast, has only 3.2m paging subscribers. Beyond Sweden, few attempts have been made to take the pager into the high street. It remains largely the preserve of the business sector - generally used by companies or organisations that do not want to equip their employees with mobile phones but need them to have some form of mobile communicator. Almost all European paging operators earn their revenue on the basis of fixed rental charges, often linked to restricted geographical zones. The package is unattractive to personal consumers, who want low up-front prices and a simple usage package. That may be about to change. Sweden is pioneering calling-party pays paging. Pagers are available on the high street for less than Dollars 150, with immediate connection. In the UK, several initiatives are under way. One of the most adventurous is a pilot scheme to make alphanumeric paging available on a straight calling-party-pays basis. Alphanumeric pagers are the most advanced of the range, allowing callers to leave long text and numerical messages displayed on a large screen on the pager. Student Pager, the private company undertaking the pilot, is launching the service with 8,000 students at the two universities in Nottingham at the start of the coming academic year. The students can hire the pager for a flat fee of Pounds 99 to cover their course duration. They can then tap into four channels of information about lectures and student or local events. They can also receive messages, which callers leave by phoning a Mercury Paging bureau at premium rate. The premium rates are 39p off-peak and 49p daytime, so messages will cost between about 20p and 50p each to leave. The total charge is a fraction of the cost of running a mobile phone. Student Pager plans to go nationwide next year. Paging operators will monitor its progress carefully: conventional wisdom holds that an alpha-numeric service is too expensive to provide on a calling-party-pays basis unless the charge is higher than standard premium-rate. The problem is bureau costs, which are high - and cannot be avoided given the state of voice-recognition technology.</p>

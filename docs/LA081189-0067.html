			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTONIAN PROTEST LEADERS REJECT CALL TO END WALKOUTS OVER ELECTION LAW  </P> <P> Walkouts spread Thursday in Estonia to include up to 20,000 workers, and  protest leaders said they had no plans to call off the 2-day-old protest  against a new election law, reports from the Baltic republic said.  </P> <P> In a bid to stop the strike, the Estonian parliament passed a resolution  Thursday suspending all strikes at enterprises and organizations in Estonia,  Tass reported.  </P> <P> The strike by non-Estonian workers was sparked by a new law that tightens  residency requirements for voting and holding office. Non-Estonian residents of  the republic complain that the law, which was passed Tuesday by the republic's  parliament, is aimed against them because many are new arrivals.  </P> <P> Strike committee member Artur Kopykin refused to estimate the number of  strikers but said 37 enterprises had joined the walkout.  </P></p>

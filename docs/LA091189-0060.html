			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA'S NEWSPAPERS HEADLINE COMMUNISTS' TOP 40 SLOGANS  </P> <P> They aren't the catchiest slogans in the world, even in the original Chinese.  But China's leading newspapers gave top-of-page-one display Sunday to 40 of  them -- some new, some old -- selected to be official slogans of the 40th  anniversary Oct. 1 of the founding of the People's Republic of China.  </P> <P> It may be difficult even for the Communist Party ideologues who compiled the  list to envision enthusiastic repetition of such slogans as: "Enhance socialist  democratic and legal construction and consolidate and develop the stable and  unified political situation!"  </P> <P> Virtually every person in Beijing knows that China's top leadership, far from  being stable or united, is rent by a fierce struggle over succession to  85-year-old paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. That, in fact, is why claims of  unity are necessary.  </P> <P> Almost no one, on the other hand, has any idea what "socialist democracy"  means, if it means anything at all. "Legal construction" does at least have a  meaning. It refers to China's attempt to gradually rely more on the rule of law  and less on the whim of administrators and Communist Party bosses. Progress in  this direction is spotty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neat Summary  </P> <P> Despite their shortcomings, the slogans -- some simplistic, some bombastic,  some contradictory -- give a neat summary of what preoccupies China's leaders  today. They form a kind of snapshot of Communist Party policies as the People's  Republic of China nears its 40th birthday.  </P> <P> The slogans reflect a recent shift toward more hard-line ideology, but most  also address real problems. As in the case of references to stability and  unity, however, the fact that a subject is embodied in a slogan usually means  that it concerns an area where the government faces difficulties.  </P> <P> Near the top of the list is praise for the June 3-4 martial-law crackdown  against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, during which soldiers killed  hundreds, perhaps thousands, of students and ordinary Beijing residents who  poured into the streets in a vain attempt to block the army's advance.  </P> <P> The people of Beijing, and of all China, now are supposed to rally behind the  slogan: "Warmly hail the successful quelling of the turmoil and  counterrevolutionary rebellion!" Or: "Salute the People's Liberation Army men,  police and armed police who have performed remarkable feats in the struggle to  defend the People's Republic."  </P> <P> In a rebuttal to Western condemnation of the brutal June crackdown, people are  urged: "Maintain the sovereignty of the country and national dignity and firmly  oppose any foreign interference in China's internal affairs!"  </P> <P> Other slogans reflect the ideological and political tensions inherent in  government policies that aim to open China to the world and introduce market  forces, while at the same time trying to maintain a political dictatorship and  elements of central planning.  </P> <P> "Adhere to the reform and open policies and accomplish the tasks of improving  the economic environment, straightening out economic order and deepening  reform," proclaims one slogan, which strings together a series of familiar  phrases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Central Controls  </P> <P> "Straightening out the economic order" is a reference to reassertion of some  centralized controls to cope with problems such as corruption and inflation.  The official line is that this will lay the groundwork for further  market-oriented reforms, but China's most enthusiastic reformists and many  Western analysts view this "straightening out" as actually being an attack on  the reforms by hard-line advocates of central planning.  </P> <P> On the ideological front, the people of China must "adhere to the Four Cardinal  Principles" -- which require support for socialism and the dictatorship of the  Communist Party -- and "firmly fight against bourgeois liberalization" -- a  reference to the spread of Western concepts of democracy and civil liberties.  </P> <P> At the same time, according to another slogan, China will "carry out the policy  of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend."  This slogan was introduced by the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung to encourage a  period of intellectual liberalization in 1956, which was followed by the  arrests of many critics. Since then, it has been repeatedly used during periods  of relaxed political controls.  </P> <P> Such periods, however, have always been followed by renewed crackdowns during  which some of those who spoke their minds were punished.  </P> <P> Some slogans stress the importance of education, science, culture and the role  of intellectuals.  </P> <P> But in a throwback to the Maoist rhetoric of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,  one slogan declares: "Wholeheartedly rely on the working class and consolidate  and develop the worker-peasant alliance."  </P> <P> The people of China also are to "enhance the construction of socialist ethics  and be socialist citizens with ideals, morality, culture and discipline."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number of Recent Moves  </P> <P> This stress on "socialist ethics" is reflected in a number of recent policy  moves, including a decision reported Friday by the official New China News  Agency requiring all high schools and colleges in Beijing to cooperate with  factories "to have students perform regular manual labor."  </P> <P> For many years, some schools have required students, as part of their  ideological education, to spend time in workshops. Beijing authorities are now  determined to expand the practice. Hard-line Communist Party leaders have  repeatedly claimed that students who participated in this spring's  pro-democracy protests were divorced from China's social realities. The  performance of manual labor -- likely to be a few hours per week -- serves both  as punishment and re-education.  </P> <P> Rhetoric about tougher social and political discipline is also being paired  with action. In the culmination of several years of preparation, a nationwide  identity card system is to go into effect Friday, becoming a major new tool of  authoritarian control. More than 570 million cards have been issued in the last  few years, with more cards still due to be issued in some remote areas,  according to Chinese press reports. Citizens over the age of 16 will be  required to carry the cards at all times, the official China Daily reported  Saturday.  </P> <P> Other slogans list a variety of additional tasks, none of them easy: a battle  against government corruption, protection of the legal rights of women and  children, population control, protection of the environment and the  reunification of Nationalist-ruled Taiwan with the Chinese mainland.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE 'DESIGNER-DRESSED'  </P> <P> I have just finished reading Jeannine Stein's article of Jan. 21, titled  "Designer-Dressed to Impress."  </P> <P> In this age of conspicuous consumption, I don't know when I have ever been so  disillusioned and disgusted by an article.  </P> <P> Those women who are so active in raising money for the arts and many other  charities are the very people who set the worst examples for the children of  today. No wonder children are killing each other for designer label shoes and  clothes.  </P> <P> ADDIE SLOAN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

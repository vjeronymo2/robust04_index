			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Vontobel takes stake in Swiss bank VONTOBEL Holding, the Zurich-based private banking group, has taken an agreed one-third stake in Tardy, de Watteville &amp; Cie, a small Geneva private bank. It plans to raise its share to two-thirds within two years. The price paid - in cash and shares - was not disclosed. The move represents a first step along the path mapped out last May by Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chairman of Vontobel Holding, to ensure an independent future for the family-controlled group. The three existing partners of Tardy, de Watteville will continue to run the Geneva bank, which employs 55 people and had a balance sheet of SFr94m (Dollars 64.9m) at the end of July. One partner, Mr Bernard de Watteville, is to be proposed to the Vontobel board.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jacques Maurice] </F>   [Text] Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide opposes U.S.  intervention in Haiti as a means for his return to power.  Father Aristide told U.S. public radio on 25 June that he would  never return to power by way of intervention, which the United  States does not rule out if the latest measures do not have the  desired effect. Jacques Maurice reports:    [Maurice] President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has finally  spoken  his mind about threats of U.S. military intervention in Haiti.  The former Saint-Jean Bosco parish priest expressed opposition  to military intervention in his country a few hours after the  latest U.S. measures -- aimed at commercial flights and  financial transactions -- took effect. He noted that the  Haitian Constitution forbids him from making such a request.  The president-in-exile said: I oppose military intervention  and military occupation. Aristide called for a surgical strike  to dislodge the military in power in a NEW YORK TIMES interview.  I will never, never, never return to power by way of  intervention, President Aristide added, explaining that he has  always opposed the idea of U.S. military intervention. Aristide  opposed establishing a Haitian army-in-exile aimed at  overthrowing the military regime in power in Port-au-Prince. On  3 June, the ousted president insisted on quick and determined  U.S. action to remove those responsible for the coup d'etat, but  within the scope of the Governors Island agreement signed on 3  July. Aristide has clearly expressed his position on U.S.  military intervening in Haiti to restore him to power. This is  not the Clinton administration's opinion. The U.S. President  still does not rule out military intervention in Haiti if  international sanctions do not force the military in power to  surrender.    Both sides are prepared. The U.S. armada remains anchored in  Haitian territorial waters. A plane is conducting  reconnaissance flights in the southeast. U.S. crews are nearing  the northern coast and are imposing their authority. (?Border  guards) are ready to help in case of failure. Thousands of  Dominican soldiers patrol the Haitian-Dominican border, soldiers  who could not stop trafficking in gasoline, yet could kill a  young Haitian trying to cross into the Dominican Republic.    The Haitian military is also prepared. Troops are  mobilizing, garrisons are being visited, demonstrators are  protesting intervention, homage is being paid to ancestors, and  1,001 strategies are being prepared. A military official, who  has asked to remain anonymous, said that more civilians than can  be imagined are ready to fight alongside the military. Another  official said that the Haitian Army has prepared many surprises  for the invaders.    The U.S. Government is considering two alternatives: to  launch a campaign on the airwaves to promote discord within Army  ranks and well-to-do Haitians to rise up against military  officials or intervene militarily to restore democracy but not  to return Aristide to power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 8 (AFP) -- An explosion at a coal mine  in southeastern China has claimed 38 lives, marking the gravest  accident so far in what is fast becoming the worst safety year  on record for China's coal industry, the Legal Daily said Sunday.    The accident occurred May 1, when a gas explosion ripped  through a mine in Jiangxi province, killing 38 miners instantly,  the newspaper said, adding that initial investigations had  attributed the disaster to poor management and sub-standard  safety procedures.    Following the blast, the Ministry of Coal convened an  emergency meeting May 5 to discuss the recent series of  disasters that has afflicted the industry and issued an urgent  call for stricter adherence to safety regulations.    A total of 724 miners have died in accidents in the first  three months of this year alone, compared with 1,058 for the  whole of 1993.    Following an emergency meeting of labour and coal officials  in February, nearly 2,000 mines in the northeastern province of  Heilongjiang were closed to allow for the upgrading of safety  equipment and the replacement of inadequately trained safety  staff.    A recent government circular accused local authorities of  being soft on officials found responsible for mining accidents.  Failure to give "harsh and timely" punishments was one of the  main reasons for the alarming rise in the number of deaths and  injuries, the circular said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Krasnikov report under the "In Brief" rubric: </F> "Shakhray Satisfied With Memorandum on Accord"]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray has told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent that he received the draft memorandum on civil  accord drawn up by the presidential administration (during the  drafting Shakhray himself supervised the work of a section that  drew up the memorandum's provisions on interethnic and  inter-regional relations). Shakhray said that he was completely  satisfied with "the high quality of the document," but he had a  number of proposals to make regarding the procedure of adopting  it. Shakhray believes that the ratification of the document  should not be rushed and that "it would be better to work on it  for a month or two," than to have it signed by representatives  of parties representing the same political spectrum. In  Shakhray's view, "this slowness" in drawing up the document will  enable, say, Anatoliy Lukyanov and his allies, "who are  preparing their own draft document on civil accord," to join it.  Shakhray thinks that the document should be passed to the State  Duma, adopted by it as a law, and opened for new signatories.  "Both Rybkin and Yeltsin ought to sign the memorandum not as  citizens, but as statesmen," Shakhray said.</p>

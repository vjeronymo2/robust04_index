			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: Toil and trouble / Assessment of how Sir John Harvey-Jones' proteges have fared two years after starring on TV Sir John Harvey-Jones is one of Britain's best-known businessmen. Through the BBC's 'Troubleshooter' series, he brought the secrets of management to the living rooms of the British viewing public. 'Troubleshooter' was a great success, attracting the highest audiences ever for a business series. However, not all the companies involved are complimentary about Sir John's management skills. Some claim they were duped by the BBC, being told the series was a documentary about business and not an investigation into their company. Two years after broadcast, Sir John's troubleshooting on the six companies involved has had mixed results. The Shropshire District Health Authority and Copella Fruit Juices successfully followed his advice, although they did not stick to his timetable. Apricot Computers adopted much of the strategy that Sir John outlined, and profits have risen as a result. However, the company claims that the publicity from the programme was the 'worst piece of PR we ever encountered'. Tri-ang was bought by the French corporation, SuperJouet, in spite of Sir John's efforts, and ceased trading in the UK altogether. Right from the outset, The Morgan Motor Company was resistant to Sir John's advice. Two years on the company is flourishing, despite having ignored all the Troubleshooter's recommendations. In March 1989, when Sir John first visited the Malvern-based company, the waiting period for a Morgan car was over 10 years and the factory produced just nine cars a week. Turnover and profit plateaued in 1984, but Peter and Charles Morgan, father and son partners in the family business, were secure in the strong demand for their product. They showed a great reluctance to increase production by any means that might spoil the cachet attached to Britain's only hand-made motor-car. The Morgans maintained a low selling price, a tradition that promoted Morgan as an affordable luxury. They were, however, aware of the need to increase profit to allow for future investment. In an effort to preserve the car's prestige, their strategy was to make a small increase in production of a car a week. Sir John's solution was more radical. He suggested almost doubling output, producing an extra 300 cars a year, slicing the waiting list in half, and increasing the price of the car. 'He looked at Morgan from an accountant's point of view,' says Charles Morgan, 'Sir John failed to take into account the fact that Morgan wants to be here in 100 years' time.' It seems that Sir John was intent on squeezing the company into a mould abhorrent to its owners. The Morgans continued on their original course, despite Sir John's warning that the Morgan Motor Company would disappear down a black hole of increasing labour and material costs. Three years later, despite a decline in the classic car market, the Morgan is up and running. The company has increased its profits from Pounds 488,000 in 1989 to Pounds 910,000 last year, a performance which has made the Morgans damning of Sir John's troubleshooting skills. 'He has his own inimitable style,' says Charles Morgan, 'whether that is suited to British business I do not know. He's certainly not the guru that I would turn to in the motor industry.' Charles Morgan is currently taking an MBA in business studies at Coventry Polytechnic where he has been learning of management systems more to his liking than those preached by Sir John. The Morgans deny accusations that they run the Morgan Motor Company as a hobby and claim that the proof of a professionally run business is strong profit and a solid customer base, 'We have both,' says Charles Morgan. Sir John enjoyed more success troubleshooting at Churchill Tableware, a ceramics company in Stoke-on-Trent. The company, run by the three Roper brothers, made a record profit of Pounds 1.5m in 1988, but the following year the domestic tableware division went into serious decline. When Sir John arrived at Churchill, he was faced with the problem of cutting costs while establishing a niche in the domestic tableware market. A catalogue of problems left plenty of room for improvement. He found that there was a conflict of priorities between the brothers, who concentrated on different aspects of the business, thus confusing the overall strategy. The Ropers were engrossed in the minutiae of the business and failed to lead the company successfully. Sir John advised them to relinquish some responsibility to the frustrated middle management, convinced that they would rise to the challenge. He also discovered that the newly installed computerised kilns had a voracious appetite for clay. In an effort to meet this demand the factory produced enormous amounts of inexpensive tableware. Sir John demanded more investment in design, increasing the quality and range of products. He also suggested a higher level of automation to reduce the high wage bill (then 36 per cent of production). He estimated Pounds 1m a year could be saved by installing machines that would cut 100 jobs. According to Michael Roper, this was not economically viable. 'We did invest in some machines, but a single machine can cost Pounds 50,000 and an employee in Stoke costs Pounds 200 a week. You have to weigh it up on the short term and the long term.' Neither do the brothers agree on the point of internal conflict. Stephen Roper says: 'With regard to the three of us working together, I don't believe that there ever was a problem. I think that was just the 'Troubleshooter' programme looking for an angle that didn't exist.' Nevertheless, the Ropers have spent more on design and now sell an upmarket range which has successfully established itself in the market. They also took time out of the office for brainstorming sessions on strategy, and have relinquished many of the problem-solving tasks to a grateful management, who indeed showed their true potential. With pretax profit up to Pounds 3m in 1991, the Ropers still turn to Sir John for advice long after the 'Troubleshooter' series was broadcast. 'Sir John's visit was an extremely positive episode in the life of Churchill. He acted as a catalyst. His visit galvanised more action than we were prepared to take at that stage', says Stephen Roper. Sir John's degree of success varies, depending on who sits in judgment. He does not claim to be a management consultant nor a business guru, but states his prime objective was to correct some of the anti-business feeling that he is convinced exists in Britain and raise the awareness of the British public in commercial matters. In this respect, he undeniably succeeded.</p>

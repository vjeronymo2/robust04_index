			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Boarding schools seek extra funds Boarding schools, which suffered a 5.2 per cent drop in boarding pupil numbers last year, are discussing possible extra state funds with education ministers. Mr Ian Small, chairman of the Boarding Schools Association, which represents both independent and state boarding schools, and headmaster of Bootham School in York, said: 'At the moment there are a lot of financial constraints on parents. 'There are a number of state boarding schools which have actually increased their numbers recently, and there are various ways in which boarding schools might be made more flexible.' He suggested that the government could contribute towards independent schools' salary bills, using a model used in Europe, or it could expand the assisted places scheme, which funds children from low-income families to attend independent schools. Mr Paul High, headmaster of the Prior's Court preparatory school in Berkshire, said the assisted places scheme could be extended to pupils aged more than seven or nine. At present, the funding is only available from the age of 11, effectively excluding most preparatory schools. He said: 'If the government is acting to support education, why only start at 11? If they have a commitment why shouldn't we be able to offer the facilities we have to more parents?' Mr Small expressed reservations about the scheme, unveiled at the end of last year, to allow independent schools to 'opt in' to the state sector and become grant-maintained schools. A number of schools were considering the move, he said, but were not prepared to go further until government regulations on eliminating surplus places had been clarified.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Management: Making fairness work - Richard Donkin on an impending review of UK industrial tribunals Imagine a divorce court ordering a husband to be reunited with a wife who cannot stand the sight of him. The decision would be unworkable. Yet a review of the UK industrial tribunal system ordered by the Department of Employment is expected to consider re-instatement of employees in the workplace as an alternative to compensation for unfair dismissal. Like the saving of a marriage, it sounds attractive in theory. But in practice, as with non-consenting partners, it seems fraught with difficulty. While enforced re-instatement is thought to be one of the ideas the government is considering for inclusion in a consultative document expected to be published later in the autumn, it may have been dismissed already as unworkable and unacceptable to employers. Nor may business be enamoured with the German approach, which has been scrutinised widely in Britain. In Germany companies must give appropriate justification to works councils composed of elected employee representatives. Although a works council cannot prevent a dismissal, its opinion is taken into account in any subsequent proceedings at a labour court - the more powerful German equivalent of the UK's tribunals. Some organisations had been lobbying for a review for years. When it was announced by Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, in a reply to a parliamentary question in April, she said the move was intended to identify any changes that would help tribunals cope with the rising volume and complexity of cases, to reduce delays, and to contain demands on public spending. Industrial tribunals, conceded the government, had grown too cumbersome and costly. The annual number has more than doubled from 34,000 in 1989-90 to upwards of 71,000 in 1993-94. Most of these were unfair dismissal cases, very few of which led to re-instatement orders and fewer still to actual re-engagement. Under present legislation employers cannot be forced to re-employ someone if they choose to ignore an order of the tribunal. Although reform has been an issue for years, the timing of the review may have much to do with the European Court of Justice's decision last year to remove the ceiling on compensation awards in sex and race discrimination cases. One result has been a series of six-figure awards to women who were dismissed from the armed services after becoming pregnant. The cases have sounded alarm bells in Whitehall, faced with a Pounds 100m bill if all the appeals prove successful. The government is thought to be deliberating compensation ceilings because of the discrepancies that have arisen. While unfair dismissal cases are limited to awards of Pounds 11,000, there is no limit on race and sex discriminations cases. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, the equivalent of the civil Appeal Court, has already laid down detailed guidance on the MoD cases and cautioned against such high payments. The underlying need for reform arises from the numerous piecemeal changes made in the system since tribunals were established in 1964. Initially their role was to hear complaints from employers against the 'training levy' - levies on each industrial sector to pay for training. They were wrenched from obscurity by the 1971 Industrial Relations Act, which gave them jurisdiction over unfair dismissal claims. They have gradually acquired more status and power as arbiters of the various employment discrimination laws, to the extent that they now give judgments on 60 types of claim. Today, because of diminishing union power and representation among many employees, the tribunal has become the chief and in some cases the only recourse against unfair treatment in the workplace. Tribunals have recently been given the power to judge contractual disputes, but there is a ceiling of Pounds 25,000. The format of industrial tribunals is largely similar across the country. They tend to be held in two or three characterless rooms in an office block. The proceedings are deliberately informal. With a presiding lawyer acting as chairman, the sides are divided into applicants (aggrieved employees) and respondents (employers). Each can be formally represented but often choose to forego lawyers because of cost; legal aid is not available. The result is that individuals inexperienced in advocacy tend to stumble through their questioning, taking up almost as much time as lawyers. Often the parties are allowed to lead their witnesses in a way that would not be allowed by a Crown Court judge. Case backlogs and the length of hearings are leading to too many split hearings, where the beginning and end of a case may take place months apart. Two years ago full-time tribunal chairmen were given powers in certain circumstances to sit alone, but they appear to be reluctant to dispense with their panel of two lay people. 'The presence of lay people with practical experience is an important check and balance,' says Digby Jacks, a national officer of MSF, the technical union. Jacks is among a growing lobby who believe that the government-funded Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service should have a greater involvement in cases. Currently, it is available for consultation, but some believe that if its powers were extended to those of mediation or arbitration it could prove a more efficient filtering process. Other ideas being considered by the government include a system for employees to meet both sides' costs if they pursue frivolous claims. Examples of the trivialising of tribunals are legion, and include complaints about the way a brigadier's cook fried eggs. While the badinage of workers who called their Ulsterman colleague a 'thick paddy' was arguably trivial, it won the employee Pounds 6,000 in compensation for hurt feelings, and may have had a broader social influence in the way that people behave at work. So may have sex discrimination cases - which, more than anything else, have raised the profile of industrial tribunals in the media. Last month Samantha Phillips, an insurance broker at Willis Corroon, won Pounds 18,000 in damages after claiming sexual discrimination and unfair dismissal. 'I think the case will send strong vibrations down the spines of some managements,' says Jacks. One fear about the consultative document among organisations that have been urging reform is that the government's prime concern is cost, and that its recommendations may dilute the powers of tribunals. Peter Martin, legal officer at the Engineering Employers' Federation, says: 'I fear the document may be too narrowly focused when what we want is a broader review.'</p>

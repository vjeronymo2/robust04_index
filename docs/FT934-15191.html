			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Singapore privatisation share offers no different from those in UK Sir, Contrary to your report, 'Singapore goes all out to turn its citizens into share owners' (October 5), the Singapore government is not 'urging the public to go on a share-buying spree'. It is encouraging Singaporeans to own shares as long-term investments and take a direct stake in Singapore's prosperity and success. Nor is the government granting 'considerable incentives to those who put their money into the stock market'. It is specifically offering a limited number of Singapore Telecom (ST) shares to each citizen at a 45 per cent discount when the company is privatised. This is no different from what the British government did when privatising companies like British Telecom and British Petroleum. You said that 'Singaporeans have been bombarded by state-sponsored television and newspaper advertisements describing the virtues of share ownership'. The public education programme accompanying the ST flotation is smaller, in proportion to the size of the issue, than similar programmes in overseas privatisations, for example British Telecom. You pointed out correctly that there is no guarantee ST will thrive after it is listed. This depends on the quality of its management and its ability to exploit rapid economic, technological, and regulatory changes in the telecommunications industry. But the government is not forcing anyone to buy ST shares. The investing public, within and outside Singapore, will assess ST's prospects and decide what its shares are worth. Why should Singaporeans blame the government for offering them a discount off the fair market price of these shares? Abdul Aziz Mahmood, High Commissioner for the Republic of Singapore, 9 Wilton Crescent, London SW1X 8SA</p>

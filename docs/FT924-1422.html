			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / After two steps back, Brazil takes another familiar one: Christina Lamb assesses the debilitating impact of the resignation of the latest economy minister after just two months BRAZIL woke up yesterday to a familiar scene. Another economy minister out - the seventh since 1985 - and frantic speculation on impending economic plans which caused a rush into the dollar and prompted shopkeepers to mark up prices. The resignation of Mr Gustavo Krause after just two months in office provoking such disarray shows just how much expectations have fallen since Mr Itamar Franco assumed the presidency after the suspension of President Fernando Collor on corruption charges. The appointment of the inexperienced Mr Krause to run the world's ninth-largest economy had, after all, sent stock markets crashing. Yet his continuation in government as a known free-marketeer had become a guarantee that the orthodox stabilisation programme would continue. Mr Paulo Haddad, the planning minister who has temporarily assumed the economy portfolio, insists that there will be no change in policy, nor any shock measures in the battle against inflation of 25 per cent a month. But in the absence of any clear policy direction, the departure of Mr Krause  -combined with the suspension of the privatisation programme and a series of meetings between Mr Franco and economists advocating nationalist ideas - are being viewed as strong indications that Brazil has seen the end of its modernisation programme, at least for the near future. 'Everything points towards a sharp change in orientation of the Brazilian economy and the trend is for less liberalism and more state intervention,' says Mr Carlos Langoni, economics professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. Such a shift will not be certain until after Mr Franco's ministerial meeting this weekend and his first address to the nation next Wednesday after the senate judgment of Mr Collor which is expected to strip him of power. Mr Franco says he cannot get on with governing until he is officially President and can take Mr Collor's portrait down from his office wall. But analysts note that the 61-year-old Mr Franco has given no commitment to the modernisation programme of his predecessor. Instead, he shows every sign of favouring the state intervention, nationalism and populism that he has always supported throughout his long political career. He chose a communist as leader of the government in Congress and his main policy moves so far have been to suspend privatisation, albeit temporarily, the suppression of public sector tariffs, and a war on foreign pharmaceutical companies for 'abusive price increases'. He has ordered the Inland Revenue to investigate their activities. Last month he cancelled talks with the International Monetary Fund. He rejected the Krause-Haddad formula of continued high interest rates, privatisation, and fiscal adjustment to combat inflation. He has been consulting all week with Mr Paulo Nogueira Batista and Mr Dercio Munhoz, economists who favour prices and incomes policy and the lowering of interest rates and a big state investment programme to restart growth. The former even advocates a moratorium on foreign debt payments. Already behind much of Latin America in stabilising its economy, Brazil has never really gone far down the path of modernisation. Many people have still not accepted the failure of the old import substitution model which for many years made it the world's fastest growing economy. The focus now is on whether Mr Haddad remains in office and manages to maintain real interest rates against Mr Franco's desires. He is under pressure from sectors within the government to leave and from outside to stay and keep up the resistance against less orthodox measures. His hand may have been strengthened by the strong reaction to Mr Krause's resignation which sent the black market dollar premium soaring to almost 20 per cent, its highest for more than a year. The congress is still discussing a fiscal reform package crucial to help plug a Dollars 15bn hole in the government budget for next year. Mr Roberto Freire, the leader of the government in Congress, asked yesterday: 'Hasn't anyone noticed that while they are all speculating about shocks and deviations in policy in fact we are still negotiating fiscal reform ?' However the departure of Mr Krause, a key negotiator in Congress, has reduced the likelihood of this passing and uncertainty is now so high that the main economic agents are acting as if a shock plan had been announced, resorting to risk instruments and marking up prices as protection against a future freeze. Through his vacillations, Mr Franco has already undone the work of former economy minister Marcilio Marques Moreira in convincing the business community that the era of shock plans had ended. According to the director of FIPE, an institute which measures inflation, protective price increases have already put 2.5 percentage points on inflation this month which is expected to near 30 per cent in January. Mr Daniel Dantas, director of Icatu Bank, believes this may be a good thing: 'We've all got too accustomed to 25 per cent a month inflation. Perhaps what we need is for it to rise to a level which cannot be tolerated and shakes everyone up.' But Mr Langoni complains: 'We're just wasting time. What we have learnt from the experiments of the last few years is there is no other way but strict monetary policy and fiscal adjustment.'</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Transmission business of GM for sale GENERAL MOTORS, the troubled US vehicle manufacturer, is trying to sell its Allison Transmission division, which produces medium and heavy-duty automatic transmissions for trucks, buses, military and off-road vehicles, writes Martin Dickson. GM is thought to have lost as much as Dollars 3bn in 1991 and needs to bolster its balance sheet. It announced last month it would be closing 21 plants and shedding 70,000 jobs in North America over the next four years. Mr William Hoglund, executive vice-president in charge of its automotive components group, said the Allison move was consistent with GM's plan to focus on improving its core business. Allison, which employs just under 6,000 people and has a turnover of about Dollars 800m, represents less than 1 per cent of GM's business. Mr Hoglund said most of the heavy-duty automatic transmissions operating in the US, and nearly 10 per cent of those abroad, were made by the company. One interested party might be Detroit Diesel, the heavy diesel engine company which GM sold three years ago to a joint venture headed by Mr Roger Penske, an entrepreneur and former racing driver. Another possibility is a management buy-out.</p>

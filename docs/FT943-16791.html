			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Betacom shares fall 27% after profits warning Shares in Betacom, the telephone equipment company, fell by almost 27 per cent yesterday after the group, whose main shareholder is Amstrad, issued a profits warning. Betacom's shares closed 4p lower at 11p after the company said despite optimism at the interim stage, its new cordless products 'have not made the expected contribution in the second half of the financial year ended June 30'. As a result, the company warned that the results for the second half would be significantly below market expectations. Betacom said its insistence on high quality had resulted in an interruption in the production of cordless products and a shortfall in quantities required to meet customers' orders, and added 'the performance of high street customers has been below the company's expectations'. Betacom also revealed that following the consolidation of its activities at its head office in Enfield, provision has been made to cover the anticipated loss on disposal of its freehold property in Bristol. In February, the company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 103,000 for the six months to December 31, on turnover of Pounds 6.91m. The market was expecting full year pre-tax profits of some Pounds 500,000, but in the wake of yesterday's announcement, this estimate was cut to about Pounds 200,000.</p>

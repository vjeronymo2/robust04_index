			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / French politicians questioned French police yesterday rounded up some 30 local politicians and possible underworld associates for questioning about last Friday's murder of Mrs Yann Piat, a conservative UDF deputy who had crusaded for a clean-up of her Var constituency on the Riviera, writes David Buchan from Paris. Among those questioned were the UDF vice-president of the Var departmental council and the mayor of Hyeres whose post Mrs Piat was planning to contest in this month's municipal elections. Earlier this week Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, said he was determined to clean up the Riviera region which was last year identified in a parliamentary report as an area of growing Mafia influence.</p>

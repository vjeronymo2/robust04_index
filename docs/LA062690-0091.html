			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER SCORNS MANDELA VISIT  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer on Monday denounced Nelson Mandela's scheduled  appearance before Congress today as "a national disgrace."  </P> <P> Mandela's "longstanding support for such luminaries of freedom as Fidel Castro,  Yasser Arafat and the Libyan loony Moammar Kadafi" makes him an inappropriate  guest to speak before a joint meeting of Congress, Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton)  said in a one-minute speech on the House floor before business hours Monday.  </P> <P> "The invitation alone heaps shame on this body (Congress)," Dannemeyer said.  "Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King. . . . Mandela should be condemned."  </P> <P> During a television appearance on ABC-TV's "Nightline," aired Thursday, Mandela  defended his ties with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Arafat,  Libyan leader Kadafi and Cuban President Castro, all of whom supported his  African National Congress "to the hilt."  </P></p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / People (Names in the News): Heirs to two fortunes seek to do good When the Prince of Wales, the heir to the British throne, holds his next business leaders forum in Los Angeles in November, check who is at his elbow, writes William Hall. Tucked away alongside the great and the good from US blue chips such as American Express, Coca-Cola and Atlantic Richfield is likely to be the relatively unknown heir to a family fortune which is said to be many times bigger than that of Britain's royal family. Ross Perot Jnr, 34, the only son of the self-made Texan billionaire who spent Dollars 60m on running for US president in 1992, has joined the board of the Prince's four-year-old Business Leaders Forum. Its mission is to promote the practice of good corporate citizenship and sustainable development internationally, as a natural part of successful business operations. Ross Perot Jnr's background is very different from that of his 64-year-old father, who was the son of an East Texas horse-trader and started out as a humble IBM computer salesman after he left the US Navy. He formed Electronic Data Systems in 1962 and sold it to General Motors in 1984 for Dollars 1bn. Perot Snr, said to be worth Dollars 2.4bn, remains one of the most colourful business tycoons in the US. His son, by contrast, has a much more conventional background. After leaving the US Air Force, he joined the family business and now owns and runs the Dallas-based Hillwood Development Corporation. It develops and manages mixed-use residential and commercial real estate in 15 US cities and has 23,000 acres under development. It has also worked with 20 or so big corporations on infrastructure projects to revitalise South Dallas. The Prince's advisers hope that Perot Jnr will use his experience to help champion sustainable development in urban areas which might be relevant on a wider scale in countries like China. Perot's involvement with the Prince of Wales's Business Leaders Forum is yet another sign that he is starting to make his own mark in business. Last year, he acquired another status symbol when he bought the Circle T ranch, once the weekend retreat of Nelson Bunker Hunt, the fallen oil and silver billionaire. As the late Armand Hammer, the founder of Occidental Petroleum, realised, being seen rubbing shoulders with the future King of England is good for business.</p>

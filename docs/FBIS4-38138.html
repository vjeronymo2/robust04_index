			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 25 Jun -- In a press statement published  here today, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah, first deputy prime  minister and minister of foreign affairs, stressed the rejection  of any threats or accusations made against the Gulf Cooperation  Council [GCC] because of support for the secessionist Yemeni  state, or that it supported one side at the expense of the other.    In a statement to the newspaper AL-ANBA, Shaykh Sabah  al-Ahmad expressed regret over the Yemeni president's attack on  GCC states because of the GCC's statement in which it supported  the UN Security Council resolution, saying that this attack was  a hard to forgive mistake.    Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad affirmed that all Damascus Declaration  states were awaiting the current international move aimed at  resolving the Yemeni crisis and the outcome of the efforts of  the UN envoy regarding this crisis. He said that these states  were also awaiting the results the envoy had achieved, which he  would present to the UN secretary general and the Security  Council.    In light of these results, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad added that  developments and their required resolutions could be discussed  during the meeting of the Damascus Declaration's foreign  ministers to be held in Kuwait on 27 June.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP AND RAP SONG WORDS  </P> <P> I am writing in response to Danny Goldberg's Op-Ed column "A Song's Just a  Song; Censorship Is Wrong" (Feb. 7). Perhaps his perceptions of anti-Semitism  have been blurred by his place in the world of music publishing; I find the  lyrics quoted by him completely unambiguous and thoroughly, offensively,  anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> He asks, "Why should Jewish sensitivity be more important (than those of women,  gays, blacks, Catholics, etc.)?"  </P> <P> He seems to have forgotten that 6 million of us died in the Nazi camps, a mass  murder made possible, in part, by anti-Semitic propaganda. The German people  were bombarded by Jew-hating speeches, newspapers, books, magazine articles,  and yes, even songs.  </P> <P> No, I am not advocating censorship of the recordings of Public Enemy, whose  name, I think, speaks for itself. But a song is not always just a song, when it  incites to hate -- and I will certainly exert my public opinion to express  distaste for the publishing company which has chosen to record it. I had never  heard of this record before Goldberg's column; I do not find anything amusing  in rap music doggerel.  </P> <P> I will now make time to write a letter to CBS, urging its officials to drop  this group.  </P> <P> ELINOR LENCH  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

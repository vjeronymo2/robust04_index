			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Brooke will report to MPs on IRA murders MR PETER Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will report to MPs today on the IRA's murder of seven building workers in County Tyrone on Friday, amid intensifying gloom about the prospects of resolving the province's political future. His decision to make a Commons' statement on security in Ulster follows the arrival yesterday of an extra 500 troops in the province. Tonight Mr John Major, the prime minister, will meet a delegation of Unionists MPs whose anger at the terrorist outbreak is overshadowing Mr Brooke's attempts to start 'round-table' talks. Mr Brooke is likely to tell MPs that fresh talks before the general election are unlikely. But he will make clear his intention to continue 'talks about talks' to ensure that communication with all sides continues. He faces a call from the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to resign for his alleged insensitivity in allowing himself to be persuaded to sing a folk song on an Irish television chat show only hours after Friday's bombing. Although Mr Brooke may express regret today, the Northern Ireland Office believes it would have been allowing the IRA to set the agenda if he had withdrawn from the programme. The IRA warned last night in a statement issued in Dublin that the policy of attacking companies providing services and materials to the security forces would continue. Ministers said the decision to send extra troops to Northern Ireland was taken before Friday's murders on the main road from Omagh to Cookstown. Unionists continue to press for internment of IRA suspects - a measure rejected by Mr Brooke. Concern about security and the continuing failure on talks have forged cross-party unity at Westminster. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for a non-partisan pact to make clear that, whoever wins the general election, there will be no private deals with either the nationalist or Protestant communities. Similar support for Mr Brooke's efforts has already been offered by Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman.</p>

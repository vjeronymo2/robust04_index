			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Jan 27 (AFP)--Strong Sino-Russian ties are  of paramount importance in ensuring stability in the  Asia-Pacific region and defusing potential regional conflicts,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said here Thursday.    Kozyrev, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day visit,  gave a speech at the Chinese Institute of Diplomacy following  talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen.    While the danger of major regional conflicts is "less than  at  any time since World War II," potential flashpoints still exist,  Kozyrev said in his speech, citing an upsurge in religious  extremism in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.    Beijing is particularly concerned that Islamic activists in  Tajikistan will fuel unrest in the bordering Chinese region of  Xinjiang which has a Moslem-majority population.    Kozyrev also warned of the danger of clashes as countries  moved to exploit natural resources in the Pacific, an apparent  reference to the oil-rich area around the Spratly islands that  are claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, the  Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.    As permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia and  China should work together to help promote the denuclearisation  of the Korean penninsula and to control nuclear proliferation in  the region, Kozyrev said.    He also proposed the establishment of a regional forum for  discussing disputes.    Russia recognises that constructive ties with China "have a  strategic importance in Asia and the Pacific," he added.    After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning  of  the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in  1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since Boris  Yeltsin came to power in 1991, the neighbouring countries have  enjoyed strong military cooperation.    During his talks with Qian, Kozyrev said the strengthening  of  bilateral relations would remain a "top priority" and would not  be affected by domestic political upheavals in Russia.    The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of  "sincere and cordial" talks on bilateral and international  issues, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said, adding that  one hour of the talks was held in private.    No details were given of their closed-door session.    According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts  over the past year, as well as Yeltsin's visit here in December  1992, had lent "great impetus" to the development of  Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links.    Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7  billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5  billion dollars.    Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement  for regular consultations on the establishment of "transit  ports" along their 4,500 kilometer (1,800-mile) common border.  Around 20 such ports are currently in operation.    During his speech later in the day, Kozyrev welcomed China's  participation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum summit in Seattle in November, and he called on China to  help Russia integrate fully in the regional economy.    Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to  participate in several large-scale construction projects in  China, including the massive Three Gorges hydro-electric dam  being built on the Yangtze River.    Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Premier Li Peng and  President Jiang Zemin tomorrow before leaving for a tour of the  southern Chinese special economic zone of Shenzhen.</p>

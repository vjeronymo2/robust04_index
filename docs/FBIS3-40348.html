Fibre optics is a well-established  technology on the ground, but ESA is now developing space  optical communications using lasers. The first ever  demonstration of such a link will take place in 1997.    The deployment of a one-metre telescope on Tenerife, Canary  Islands, to receive laser signals from satellites is part of  this effort. The telescope, financed by the German Space Agency  DARA, was built by Carl Zeiss Jena and was presented for the  first time to the public on 23 November 1993.    Following comprehensive testing in Germany, the Zeiss  telescope will be installed on Tenerife in the second half of  1995, awaiting the launch of ESA's telecommunications satellite  ARTEMIS [Advanced Relay and Technology Mission] at the end of  1996 and the comprehensive tests with its SILEX [Semi-Conductor  Laser Intersatellite Link Experiment] laser-optical payload.    ARTEMIS is an advanced satellite for testing and operating  new telecommunications techniques and will also help to  introduce several other new services. The SILEX optical  terminal carried by ARTEMIS will enable it to exchange data with  other satellites or with ground stations, by sending or  receiving a laser beam.    The Tenerife site chosen for the deployment of the telescope  is at 2,500 metres altitude. Observations are almost entirely  undisturbed by stray light and the site is particularly well  suited to simulating and testing laser optical communications  with a satellite in geostationary orbit.    The first satellite to make use of ARTEMIS laser  communications capabilities will be the French SPOT-4 Earth  observation satellite to be launched in early 1997. From its  low-Earth orbit some 700 km above the ground, SPOT-4 cannot send  its image data to any one ground station for more than ten  minutes. Data sent to ground stations overseas often have to be  transported over long distances for processing and distribution  to users.    Thanks to SILEX, an uninterrupted link between SPOT-4 and  its  operations centre in Toulouse, France, will be possible whenever  the satellite is in sight of ARTEMIS on its geostationary orbit  36,000 km above Europe; in practice, SPOT-4 will therefore be  able to observe more than half of the Earth's land masses via an  ARTEMIS data-relay link. The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbit per  second.    SILEX is being developed in close cooperation between ESA  and  CNES [French National Center for Space Studies]. The  manufacture of the optical terminals to be installed on the  spacecraft has been entrusted to a consortium of European  companies led by Matra-Marconi-Space.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Opera At Glyndebourne, this opera comes across with overwhelming force. It was given at the festival in the 1971 season, with fair success; now, the sum of Graham Vick's new production, Andrew Davis's conducting of the (magnificent) London Philharmonic, and the singing and acting of a carefully chosen cast is, I think, a milestone in festival history. An opera written for a large Russian theatre and re-deploying the structural machinery of 18th- and 19th-century operatic spectacle discloses here all its heart-rending secrets. The loss of acoustic and physical space matters relatively little, while the close focus on details of Tchaikovsky's musical dramatisation brings thrills and revelations in uncountable number. The 'psychological' messages sent to the audience from the lower depths of the orchestra (in particular the bassoon and low clarinet parts, superbly well delivered by LPO principals) needle their way into our perception of the characters with a quiet insidiousness that proves irresistible. (Will these close-up effects be possible in the new, enlarged Glyndebourne theatre shortly to be built? Fervent prayers are required, starting now.) Everything about the music communicates, makes sense, adds up: the frisson of repeated accompaniment figures, the wallop and flash of emotional thunder and lightning, the fraught sweep of the whole canvas. An opera formerly held to be loosely constructed, with numbers and whole sequences ripe for easy removal, is given absolutely complete, and drives its points home with riveting insistence. The special greatness of Queen of Spades lies in large part in the balance Tchaikovsky sustains between outward opulence and inward turbulence, luxuriance and high-Romantic passion. At Monday's opening performance Mr Davis's expert conducting, so sensitive to his singers, seemed to lean a touch in the direction of the former - there was much lovingly moulded lyrical phrasing, also a slight shortage of the demonic in the accompanying undercurrents. He will surely grow into the opera; the production, which at Monday's opening revealed untidinesses of ensemble in the opening scene, is likewise bound to move ever more authoritatively as it wears in. Already it seems to me a quite marvellous and brilliant piece of modern music-theatre. It has been planned, by Mr Vick, the designer Richard Hudson and the lighting designer Thomas Webster, with fastidious intelligence to look - as the opera itself does - both forward and backward: to deal in unsensational yet toughly argued theatrical terms with the 'psychodrama' at the heart of the opera while not neglecting the picturesque elements, the influences of Tchaikovsky's beloved Mozart and Carmen, the delicate touches of rococo filigree. Psychodramatic accounts of this opera may have been the fashion in recent years, but they take an audience only part of the way toward the opera's core. Mr Vick proves his fuller understanding of it by staging the pastoral divertissement, with the help of Ron Howell's delicious mock-authentic dances, with a touch of gentle comedy that never turns into send-up. The whole of the ball scene, indeed, is admirably precise in its purpose: a great golden staircase falls from the flies to suggest the St Petersburg glitter that so drives and torments the outsider Hermann, and around it ironic reflections of the opera's main plot-points are deftly thrown. The look of the production pinpoints a poetically knife-edged duality. Costume is period, the set semi-abstract modern. White walls, kinked in perspective and daubed with furious Gerald Scarfe-like black ink-scratches, funnel the eye toward a 'black hole' at the back - an image of Hermann's madness that grows ever more potent as the show unfolds. The gambling finale, with hellish skeleton figures pressing through cavities, forms a daringly conceived yet (in the terms of this production) perfectly logical conclusion, a final fusion of spectacle and phantasmagoria; and before that point, scene after scene has been directed with acute insight into the mainspring of each character. Every small part is made telling - of all the many vivid players who deserve a brief mention, Graeme Matheson-Bruce (Chekalinsky), Enid Hartle (Governess) and Anne Dawson (Chloe) demand to be singled out. Louise Winter sings Pauline's elegy with lovely warmth and purity; the two baritones - Sergey Leiferkus as the most elegant and vocally commanding of Tomskys, Dmitry Kharitonov as a soft-grained, notably stylish Yeletsky - are excellent individually and in contrast. Nancy Gustafson, her shining lyric soprano in mint condition, has done nothing better than this Lisa: no passive figure she, but a girl who simultaneously grows to womanhood and tragic stature. The two great narcissists at the opera's centre are confronted with rare and chilling exactitude. Felicity Palmer's old Countess - cold, selfish yet with an aura of mesmerising radiance to her song-murmurings  - proves all the more compelling for being so rigorously underplayed. The area of controversy likely to be aroused by this Glyndebourne performance concerns the Hermann of Yury Marusin. He has what the Italians call a 'fixed tenor', of power and sometimes impressively dark intensity but little beauty, which seems to fall worryingly often on the flat side of notes and phrases. Yet so ferociously unsparing and wholehearted is his plummeting toward madness, so free of gibbering-loony cliche, that his vocal shortcomings end up by counting for amazingly little. Sponsored by Johnson Matthey; in repertory at Glyndebourne until July 23.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> SHOULD WE EASE ANTITRUST LAWS?  </P> <P> Are U.S. antitrust laws obsolete?  </P> <P>  There's a move in Congress to repeal parts of federal antitrust law that  prohibit large companies from producing goods jointly. The idea is that by  acting together -- particularly in risky ventures such as computer chips --  U.S. companies would better compete globally. The proposed law would not only  allow joint ventures but would also limit penalties for activities found to be  anti-competitive by reducing damages that could be awarded to companies  squeezed out of the market. The laws have already been modified somewhat: In  1984, the part of the law restricting joint research and development ventures  was modified.  </P> <P>  For a debate on easing antitrust laws, free-lance writer Sharon Bernstein  interviewed former Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Paul McGrath, who directed the  Justice Department's antitrust division during the Reagan Administration's  first term and supports the changes. McGrath, now a partner in the New York law  firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood, represented U.S. Memories,  the failed chip industry venture, in hearings before Congress.  </P> <P> For an opposing view, she also interviewed Michael E. Porter, a Harvard  Business School professor whose book, "The Competitive Advantage of Nations,"  analyzes antitrust issues with regard to global competition.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Should antitrust laws be modified to allow for joint manufacturing ventures?  </P> <P> McGrath: Yes, for two reasons. One, joint manufacturing ventures almost never  raise antitrust problems. Historically, there's almost no example of such a  venture raising antitrust problems.  </P> <P> Two, in our very expensive, complicated world, such ventures can be critical to  success in a number of fields. Take semiconductors. The interest of U.S.  companies in manufacturing certain kinds of semiconductors has dwindled as the  expense of building plants and the risk becomes greater. The risk is greater  because of the short life cycle of these products.  </P> <P> Porter: Any joint production venture that has important benefits for  competition is already perfectly acceptable under antitrust laws. Official  relaxation would be counterproductive.  </P> <P> Smaller companies that have a modest share of an industry already have  considerable flexibility to enter into joint agreements. They're handled by the  rule of reason (in the courts), and there's been virtually no questions. What  is needing antitrust scrutiny is joint ventures by industry leaders, and these  are the ones that would be allowed under the proposed legislation.  </P> <P> If joint ventures are allowed, is anti-competitive activity a risk?  </P> <P> Porter: Yes. That's the fundamental problem. Joint production ventures  involving leading companies limit individual company investments in plants and  in new-process technology, and reduce the pressure of competition which forces  everybody to improve to maintain their position.  </P> <P> Joint production ventures are based on the idea that if you allow companies to  do things jointly you eliminate overproduction and encourage economies of  scale. What we learn from other countries whose operations are world class is  that this is extremely rare. Joint production ventures threaten the health and  vigor of competition. Although they may achieve some short-term efficiencies,  they sap the dynamism of the industry as a whole.  </P> <P> McGrath: The kind of statute that has been proposed by the Administration would  still subject a company to criminal prosecution if there was illegal price  fixing or something of that sort.  </P> <P> Can those risks be guarded against? If so, how?  </P> <P> McGrath: The legislative history would spell out the kinds of situations you  would worry about. For example, U.S. Memories would have involved a very small  percentage of companies that were manufacturing the particular kind of product.  In legislative history, you'd make it clear that where companies that have less  than 30% of a market are putting together a joint venture, that almost is never  going to cause a problem. You can define the safe harbors in terms of the  percent of the market covered, whether there is ease of entry into the market  and so on. That's really where you get the protection. If the entry into the  market or size of market indicates that there's a problem, then the government  can enter into it.  </P> <P> Porter: I don't believe that there are any practical ways of guarding against  the risk, and what is more significant is that there is no evidence that the  supposed benefits of these ventures are significant in any industry. Let's take  the semiconductor industry. There's a lot of discussion about how we need joint  production in memory (computer chip) ventures. If you look at the semiconductor  industry in Japan, you'll find that there are 13 companies making memory chips.  All of those companies are doing very well. So the idea that we need to have  one plant in this country to make them doesn't add up; it doesn't fit the rules  of logic.  </P> <P> How does the global nature of the marketplace play into the arguments for and  against the modifications?  </P> <P> McGrath: It generally plays pretty directly into it. First, if you don't take  into account global markets, you're going to overstate the hold on a market  that U.S. companies have. If U.S. companies really only have a quarter of  worldwide production of a product that in fact moves in international trade,  they're not going to be able to monopolize the market for the product. They  don't have enough of the market.  </P> <P> If we prevent U.S. companies from entering into joint ventures -- saying that  it will make them less competitive at home -- the result is, we will actually  hurt U.S. companies and hurt competition.  </P> <P> Porter: I don't believe that companies compete against countries. That is a  stylized view of international competition promoted by those who view Japan in  particular as a tightly managed economy. But if we look closely at Japan, we  see numerous companies that compete fiercely, that hate each other's guts. And  we see numerous examples where the Japanese government has asked companies to  do things, and they say no. The Japanese government attempted to consolidate  the auto industry, and the companies said no. If we look at the facts and try  to understand where nations are winning, what we're finding is that the key is  having companies that compete.  </P> <P> And the notion that we should merge all our U.S. companies or have them all  cooperate comes from a misguided idea of what makes for success. The most  successful U.S. industries are the ones with the most competition: software,  consumer packaged goods, business services, medical-related products and  services.  </P> <P> Where should the United States be in 10 years in terms of antitrust regulation  and joint ventures?  </P> <P> McGrath: U.S. companies all ought to have in their mind cooperative ventures in  relation to more and more aspects of their business. Companies will be even  more internationalized than they are today, and we'll have more companies with  production capacity in different parts of the world, capacity which they may  own directly and may share with joint ventures. I think joint ventures will  become more complex as research and development, and the tools of research and  development, become more complex.  </P> <P> Porter: We're now in a period where we're questioning one of our most basic  values, and that's competition. If you look at antitrust, if you look at  collaboration, if you look at trade policy, copyright law, in one area after  another with very elaborate excuses we're trying to make arguments as to why we  shouldn't compete anymore. What we've learned from industries all over the  world is that this doesn't work. It saps dynamism and it saps improvement.  </P></p>

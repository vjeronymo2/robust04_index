			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Saleroom: Auction record for photograph AN IMAGE by El Lissitzky, the avant-garde artist who worked in Germany during the 1920s, sold for Dollars 132,000 (Pounds 73,537) at Christie's in New York on Tuesday, a record for a photograph at auction. Entitled 'Pelikan Tinte', it uses photomontage to form an advertisement for an office supply company. The buyer, who paid twice the high estimate, was a private European collector. The auction totalled Dollars 1.49m, with 'Sans Titre', a 'Rayograph' of 1922 by Man Ray, selling for Dollars 104,500. Many lots sold at, or below, forecast. Three large photogravures by the controversial artist Robert Mapplethorpe made Dollars 28,600, slightly below their estimate. Italians dominated the bidding at Sotheby's successful Old Master auction in London. The auction totalled Pounds 1.7m, with only 11 per cent unsold. A still life by Cristoforo Munari, the Italian artist, was sold for Pounds 79,200, compared with a top estimate of Pounds 20,000, and a painting of the 'Turin Shroud held by Angels' by Octavanius Montfort, another late 17th-century Italian artist, also far exceeded forecast at Pounds 52,800.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Russian paratroopers platoon from among the UN  peace-keeping force in the former Yugoslavia was airlifted on  the night of April 24 from Sarajevo to the Gorazde enclave. It  consists of 19 paratroopers, three armored personnel carriers,  two Ural motor vehicles and a radio station. The statement was  made to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the commander of the Russian  Airborne Troops, General Yevgeny Podkolzin.    According to him, British General Michael Rose, the  commander  of the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, asked for  the redeployment of the Russian unit. The airlift of  paratroopers was made to enforce the peace-keeping contingent in  the area of Gorazde. Earlier other peace-keepers units,  including a Ukrainian company, were deployed in the region.    Podkolzin believes that the airlift of Russian paratroopers  will affect beneficially the situation in the region, as well as  Bosnian Serb units. He also said that the Russian diplomacy  will only benefit from the presence of Russian troops in Gorazde.    The commander said that the rotation of the Russian  peace-keeping contingent in the former Yugoslavia will end on  April 29. As many as 600, out of the 1500 Russian contingent,  will be replaced by fresh forces.    Podkolsin said that most soldiers and sergeants who had  served for six months in line with the contract, acquired cars  in the former Yugoslavia. They received 6,000 dollars for their  peace-keeping work and most have decided to return to Russia  behind the wheel of their own car.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Headmasters' Conference schools hold fee increases to an average of 4 per cent this year HEADMASTERS' Conference schools have held fee increases to an average of 4 per cent this year, head teachers said yesterday. This is the lowest rate of fee inflation for more than a decade, and follows a 6 per cent drop in the number of boarders last year. A pay freeze for teachers in the public sector would allow further containment of fees, which are mostly driven by labour costs, for next year. The conference also heard that further initiatives involving research into US independent schools are being taken to reduce fees, by cutting staff. Research by Mr Vivian Anthony, conference secretary, showed that 'the same number (or more) of pupils could be taught by fewer teachers without reducing the standard of their education'. He said schools 'engaged in a struggle for their very existence' should investigate the proper maximum and minimum class sizes they needed.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Wolves &amp; Dudley rises to Pounds 16.5m in tough market WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries increased first half pre-tax profits 4.8 per cent to Pounds 16.52m in 'a fiercely competitive beer market.' Mr David Thompson, managing director, estimated that beer volumes had fallen 5 per cent nationally and 9 per cent in the Midlands region during the six months to March 29. Trading in the Midlands had been 'extremely tough', with rising unemployment hitting pubs on large housing estates and the take-home trade suffering from over-stocking and discounting by national brands. 'The market is now much more sensitive to pricing,' Mr Thompson said. 'Customers are demanding value for money.' But the group's underlying trading performance, supported by 'a remorseless attack on costs', was strong. Earnings grew 2.3 per cent to 17.6p, in spite of a rising tax charge. The interim dividend is raised 4.9 per cent to 4.3p. Trading profit rose 1 per cent to Pounds 18.05m on turnover 11.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 101.89m. Camerons Brewery in north-east England, acquired in January, helped Wolves to increase beer volumes but contributed to a reduction in operating margins from 19.5 per cent to 17.7 per cent. Camerons would become profitable next year, Mr Thompson said. 'We now have a production and distribution cost per barrel which is competitive  - the essential platform on which to build sales in the free trade. Our objective is to create a vigorous regional brewery company in the north-east and progress so far is excellent.' Mr Thompson said that expansion prospects appeared more favourable in the north where land prices were lower, pub-going was fashionable, and beer prices were higher than in the Midlands. Wolves acquired 9 pubs and built 7 new outlets during the six months. Further development of greenfield sites this year was expected to raise borrowings from Pounds 59.6m to about Pounds 75m. The group sold or closed 17 pubs - 'certain pubs remain hard to let,' said Mr Thompson - but all Camerons' tenants and 77 per cent of Wolves' tenants have now signed new lease agreements. Pubs in good locations continued to trade strongly. The group's Milestone restaurants increased sales of meals 13 per cent and raised spend per head; and Milestone taverns sold 54 per cent more meals. Profits declined, however, at the group's hotels.</p>

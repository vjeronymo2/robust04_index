			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Miklos Duray, chairman  of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian minority movement in  Slovakia, said today that the current cabinet of Jozef Moravcik  had been charged by parliament with joining the European Charter  of Regional and Minority Languages. He said that a failure to  meet this condition might influence Egyutteles' support for the  government coalition.    "I know nothing about the proposal to sign the European  Charter of Minority Languages having been withdrawn," Duray told  CTK, adding that while discussing the government program the  parliament charged the government with joining the charter.  This had been demanded by Egyutteles for at least two years,  already during the former Czechoslovakia, he said.    The Slovak Government press department today told CTK that  the proposal for the signing of the charter had been withdrawn  from the agenda of today's cabinet meeting.    However, the government today approved a parliamentary  proposal on population registers. The passing of this proposal  was one of further demands by Hungarian minority leaders as it  was to include the use of Hungarian first names and Hungarian  women's names without the Slovak ending -ova. Meeting this  demand was also one of the conditions which Slovakia committed  itself to fulfilling when it was accepted to the Council of  Europe.</p>

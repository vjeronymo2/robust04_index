			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMITTEE SET UP TO RAISE FUNDS TO RECALL TUCKER  </P> <P> A political action committee has been established to raise money for a recall  campaign against Mayor Walter R. Tucker, and organizers say they will serve the  mayor with a recall notice at the Oct. 3 City Council meeting.  </P> <P> The Committee to Recall Mayor Walter Tucker was established by Basil Kimbrew, a  local activist and a paid political consultant, after the mayor suggested at a  Sept. 13 press conference that the city dismantle its Fire and Police  departments and contract with Los Angeles County for those services.  </P> <P> The mayor, citing the city's poor financial health, said Compton could no  longer afford its own Police and Fire departments and that the county could  provide the same level of public safety service at a lower cost. Tucker's  suggestion drew angry responses from firefighters and police officers, some of  whom are talking about joining the recall effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tucker Says He's Not Worried  </P> <P> Tucker said last week that he is not worried about the talk of recall and  accused Councilwoman Patricia Moore of being behind it. "Her stooges, her  cronies," are organizing the recall effort, he said. "She's in it as thick as I  don't know what."  </P> <P> Kimbrew managed Moore's successful campaign this spring to oust incumbent  Councilman Floyd James. Kimbrew also managed the unsuccessful campaign of  Tucker's opponent in the mayoral runoff election in June. Tucker, a 64-year-old  dentist, was elected to his third mayoral term, garnering more than 60% of the  vote .  </P> <P> Moore denied having anything to do with the recall effort. "That's giving me an  awful lot of credit and influence," she said.  </P> <P> Kimbrew also denied that Moore was involved. He said he and Benjamin Holifield,  his partner in the recall effort, will be joined Tuesday or Wednesday by a host  of other Compton residents at a press conference to launch the recall campaign.  </P> <P> Kimbrew said the group is seeking to recall Tucker because the mayor lied  during the election campaign by insisting that the city was financially sound.  At the time, some city officials were acknowledging privately that there would  be a severe budget crunch this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Administration in Turmoil  </P> <P> After the June election, when the council faced the task of putting together a  new budget, it became clear that the city was in poor financial health. About  100 employees were laid off, the city's ambulance service was abolished, and  some police and fire officers were demoted. City Manager James Goins also was  abruptly fired by the council.  </P> <P> Tucker said this week that he did not know at the time of his reelection  campaign that the city was financially strapped. "Staff said there wasn't  anything wrong," Tucker said, insisting that it is the city manager's job to  prepare the budget.  </P> <P> Once the city clerk certifies a recall notice, proponents would have 120 days  to gather about 8,000 signatures on petitions asking the council to hold an  election.  </P> <P> Kimbrew insisted that he had no candidates in mind to replace Tucker if the  recall is successful. Moore said: "I have not envisioned being anything else  but a good council person."  </P> <P> The recall effort, Kimbrew said, will be built around a group called Concerned  Citizens of Compton. Kimbrew and Holifield, a local businessman who was an  unsuccessful candidate in this year's City Council elections, organized the  group this summer. They claim to have about 120 members.  </P> <P> Police in particular are likely to play an active role if there is a recall  election to oust the mayor.  </P> <P> "He's attacked us job-wise and we don't think he has any foundation to be  talking like he's talking," said Marvin Branscomb, president of the Compton  Peace Officers Assn. "He hasn't done his homework," said Branscomb, referring  to the mayor's assertion that the city could get the same level of service if  it dissolved its Police Department and contracted with the county sheriff.  </P> <P> Though the police union has not formally addressed the recall issue, Branscomb  said, he believes many of his members would be heavily involved in a recall  campaign. "I can see some of our officers carrying petitions," Branscomb said.  </P> <P> Eli Curtis, head of the firefighters union, said its executive board had  instructed him not to make public statements about the mayor's remarks.  </P> <P> Fire Department ranks are split on the issue of a county takeover. Many older  firefighters who also hold command positions in the department are worried that  the county would not absorb them into its ranks. Younger firefighters, many of  whom eventually shift to the county department, are not as worried, according  to Compton Fire Department sources.  </P> <P> However, one longtime Compton firefighter said he expects his union to  contribute time and money to any recall effort. "Face it," said the  firefighter, who asked not to be named, "this guy doesn't want us around, so,  we don't want him around. That's the bottom line."  </P> <P> Mayor Walter R.

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Ceausescu spies keep their jobs Mr Virgil Magureanu, head of the Romanian Intelligence Service, yesterday said 5,000, or one-third, of the former full-time employees of the Securitate, the secret police of executed communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, still worked for its successor agency, the RIS. At a rare press conference, Mr Magureanu said their previous allegiance did not matter. He also said a staff of 5,000 was insufficient and that he was in the process of doubling it. However, he denied reports that the recent replacement of a quarter of RIS office staff was due to an internal power struggle. He added that the KGB was a 'huge problem' for the RIS, which was investigating its former activities in Romania.</p>

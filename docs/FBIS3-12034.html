In the opinion of Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes,  Gaviria will have to turn the OAS into a more pragmatic  organization that spends less time making statements; an  organization that will be able, for example, to attack extreme  poverty and to make international solidarity a reality.    According to the experts, it will fall to Gaviria not only  to  devote himself to consolidating democracy on the continent but,  especially, to leading American integration. The analysts point  out that it is in connection with Cuba, however, that Gaviria  could contribute something new to the OAS. They remember that  Colombia is one of the American countries that has maintained  the best relations with Cuba in recent years, even with  formerally ruptured diplomatic ties, and it has gone so far as  to negotiate the sale of oil to the island in defiance of the  U.S. embargo. According to observers, for these reasons, from  his new position in the OAS and with his excellent contacts with  the United States, Gaviria is in an excellent position to build  bridges toward the Cuban Government and perhaps achieve Cuba's  reincorporation into the Pan-American system.</p>

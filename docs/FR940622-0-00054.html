			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes that the investigative file on an alleged violation should not be subject to public disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) permits public access to agency records except to the extent that such records or parts thereof fall within specified exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552(b). A statutory amendment would be required to adopt the commenter's suggestion, since there is no blanket exemption under the Freedom of Information Act for documents compiled in investigating complaints of violations of section 1867 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twelve commenters believe that it is not appropriate for HCFA to notify other components of the Department about alleged violations as each will then conduct its own investigations. The commenters recommended that HCFA notify the OIG and the Office for Civil Rights only when it determines that there was a violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority for enforcing the requirements of this provision was delegated by law to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. All of the components of the Department mentioned by the commenters have responsibilities in connection with the enforcement of this provision and/or other provisions, such as the civil rights and rehabilitation acts. We believe it is entirely appropriate that these components be notified early in the process and begin to carry out their functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter expressed concern that a provider may be subject to double jeopardy if HCFA is allowed to terminate the provider agreement for violating section 1867 of the Act and then, for the same violation, the OIG is authorized to suspend the provider. Several commenters expressed concern that a provider is subject to double jeopardy since, for an alleged single inappropriate transfer, OIG may suspend a provider and subject the provider to civil monetary penalties even if HCFA determines there is no violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A provider agreement can no longer be suspended for a violation of section 1867 of the Act since, as we previously indicated, section 4008(b)(3) of OBRA 90 deleted the suspension provisions contained in the original legislation. If, however, HCFA begins a termination action based on a violation of the statute, but the hospital avoids termination by demonstrating to HCFA's satisfaction that it has in place effective policies and procedures to prevent a recurrence, the OIG remains free to seek civil monetary penalties against the hospital and physician for the violation of the statute on which the termination action was originally based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven commenters believe that when HCFA notifies a complainant and other entities about the receipt of alleged violations, this implies guilt and may result in frivolous lawsuits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA notifies organizations of complaints before investigating expressly to make the point that no decision has been made about the complaint but that an investigation is being conducted. We do not believe that the subject of a complaint should be unaware of the complaint, and we certainly do not believe that receipt of a complaint establishes or even implies that there is a violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that, in order to avoid duplication of effort, the regulations should limit OIG investigation to those cases where it finds a pattern of noncompliance, with willful violation of the provisions, or where there is some indication of fraud or abuse against the Medicare program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law does not require a pattern of violations or willful noncompliance for the Department to invoke sanctions. The OIG may impose a civil monetary penalty for a single violation of the statute. The statute was amended in OBRA 90, however, to allow the OIG to exclude physicians from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs only if the violation is ``gross and flagrant or repeated.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``gross and flagrant'' is also used in section 1156 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1320c&hyph;5, and has been defined in regulations at 42 CFR 1004.1(b). This definition has been challenged for being unconstitutionally vague and the courts have disagreed, upholding the Department's interpretation of the term. See, for example,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lavapies  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 883 F.2d 465 (6th Cir. 1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Doyle  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secretary of Health and Human Services,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 848 F.2d 296 (1st Cir. 1988);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Varandani  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 824 F.2d 307 (4th Cir. 1987). It is against this background that Congress amended section 1867 of the Act to allow a physician to be excluded only if the violation is ``gross and flagrant or repeated.'' (``The legislature is presumed to know the prior construction of the original act or code and if previously construed terms in the unamended sections are used in the amendment, it is indicated that the legislature intended to adopt the prior construction of those terms.'' Sutherland Stat. Const. &sect;22.35 (4th Ed.).) As a result, we have defined this term in &sect;1003.105 to be consistent with the definition contained in &sect;1004.1(b). The regulation now states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that presents an imminent danger to the health, safety, or well-being of the individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes that HCFA and the OIG should coordinate enforcement activities to avoid duplication of effort and unnecessary administrative costs. In addition, the commenter suggested there be a central review to prevent components from taking multiple enforcement measures against a hospital or physician for the same violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that every effort should be made to coordinate enforcement actions. However, some of the issues relating to multiple enforcement measures have been mitigated by the amendments in OBRA 90 that deleted the suspension authority. HCFA's authority is to determine compliance with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OIG has the authority for civil monetary penalties and physician exclusion from the Medicare program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

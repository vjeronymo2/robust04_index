			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Financial reforms create a 'Wall Street' elite in India Financial reforms are creating a new elite in India, bringing Wall Street investment banks, aggressive headhunting and salary packages that tower over the earnings of the bank clerks of Bombay. Salaries for the sought-after have risen 300 per cent in the past year and could climb further as US and European investment banks rush to set up shop in India's commercial capital to take advantage of the government's liberalisation drive. Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers of the US have recently hired senior managers for salaries estimated at Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 266,500) including bonuses. At that rate, the pay is at least five times more than these bankers were paid at their previous jobs at the old-established foreign banks in Bombay, and at least 100 times more than the salary of a typical Indian bank clerk. 'The cost of hiring in India is hitting international levels,' Morgan Stanley Asset Management said. Mr Rafiq Dossani, a director of Jardine Fleming's Indian affiliate, added: 'The difference between India and the rest of the world is narrowing sharply.' The differences are also being reduced by the arrival of non-resident Indians from the US, the UK and elsewhere. Companies are finding it difficult to pay their locally-hired top executives less than the non-residents who are also bringing with them a modern work culture. Lap-top computers, digital diaries, and Mont Blanc pens have become commonplace among the financial elite. The top earners are beginning to imitate the lifestyles of the city's established business families. Taxes on imported cars are still prohibitively high, but owning two or three Indian models is well within the reach of bankers on better salaries. Clothes are mostly bought abroad. Slick gelled-back hairstyles are the order of the day. Membership of Bombay's top dining clubs - the Belvedere at the Oberoi Hotel and the Chambers at the Taj Hotel - has become almost mandatory. The talk is no longer of trips to hill stations but of weekends in Singapore. Women as well as men are getting top jobs, though not in the same numbers. Ms Ratna Kakkar, who has recently joined Smith New Court, the British stockbroker, says: 'Things are definitely more fast-paced and there's more risk of burn-out.' Salaries are being pushed up by foreign companies establishing offices or increasing their staff. The arrivals are hiring middle- and junior-level staff including research analysts, corporate financiers and fund managers. Median annual salaries for such people have reached Dollars 30,000-Dollars 40,000, a senior executive at one foreign broker said.</p>

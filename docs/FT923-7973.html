			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Cold water treatment Yesterday's bounce in water company shares was a clear expression of relief that Ofwat's statement on the cost of water quality contained no nasty surprises. Indeed, Mr Byatt made plain that substantial real price increases will be required if tough environmental standards are to be met. It is only natural for water companies and the market to applaud. Yet future capital spending requirements remain as vague as ever. Ofwat's own estimates to 2005 range from Pounds 28bn to Pounds 43bn, depending on the stringency of the quality regime. The regulator wants the sector to operate with a higher level of borrowing, but, even on the lower of these figures, real price increases will be required simply to keep the water companies within their bank and bond market covenants for interest cover. If expenditure is near the top end of this range, debt finance alone will hardly suffice. Moreover, harmony between the industry and the regulator is only skin-deep. The companies will resist yesterday's proposal that real annual efficiency gains of 5 per cent should help offset the cost of water quality. Shareholders will suffer in the form of lower dividends if unattainable efficiency targets are set. The industry has also failed to convince Mr Byatt he was wrong to propose a reduced 6 per cent rate of return on equity from 1995. He concedes that highly-geared water companies may require a higher rate of return to attract capital, but there will be generally less scope for dividend growth in the second half of the decade. The sector has still outperformed the market by 50 per cent since privatisation. That going cannot be maintained.</p>

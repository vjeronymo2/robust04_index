			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Trinity term Regina v director of the Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith (FT, June 17) THE HOUSE of Lords allowed an appeal by the Serious Fraud Office where the chairman of a company had been charged with the criminal offence of having been a party to carrying on the company's business with intent to defraud creditors. However, under the Code of Practice for the detention and questioning of persons by the police, a person had first to be cautioned and then told he did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so - in which case it could be used in evidence against him. After he had been given bail, the defendant was served with formal notice by the SFO under section 2(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which gave the SFO power to 'require' a person whose affairs were to be investigated to answer questions or furnish information. The notice stated: 'Failure without reasonable excuse to comply with these requirements is a criminal offence.' The defendant invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. As a matter of interpretation, the House of Lords held, the SFO's powers were such that it was entitled to question a person even if he was charged with a criminal offence. In the present case the general provisions of the Code of Practice for questioning suspects yielded to the particular provision of the 1987 Act. Russell v Northern Bank Development Corporation Ltd and others (FT, June 18) WHEN THE control of two companies was vested in a new holding company, TBL, an agreement between the executives, including the plaintiff, Mr Russell, and the holding company provided that it should have precedence over the articles of association. Clause 3 of the agreement provided that no further share capital was to be issued without the written consent of each of the parties. The TBL board then gave notice of an extraordinary general meeting to consider a resolution that the share capital be increased to Pounds 4m. Before the meeting, Mr Russell issued a writ claiming an injunction to restrain the shareholders from voting on the resolutions. At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that article 3 of the agreement constituted an attempt to fetter TBL's statutory power to increase its capital and was accordingly invalid. Allowing Mr Russell's appeal, the House of Lords stated that, while a provision in a company's articles which restricted its statutory power to alter those articles was invalid, an agreement outside the articles between the shareholders themselves as to how they should exercise their voting rights on a resolution to alter the articles was not necessarily invalid. TBL's undertaking was independent and severable and there was no reason why it should not be enforceable by the shareholders between themselves as a agreement which in no way fettered TBL in the exercise of its statutory powers. The Standard Steamship Owners' Protection and Indemnity Association (Bermuda) Ltd v Gann and another (FT, June 19) THE CLUB was a shipowners' mutual assurance association, which issued and provided insurance on the basis of its rules from year to year. Its claim, from the defendants amounted to more than Dollars 1.8m for loss and/or damages arising from non-payment of supplementary calls and relief calls. Rule 32(1) provided that 'the owner hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice in England'. The English choice of law clause was a significant consideration in favour of English jurisdiction, Hirst J said, in refusing to set aside an order which granted the plaintiff leave to serve proceedings on the defendants out of the jurisdiction. (i) On all main issues the crucial point of contact was in London between London brokers and the club. The witnesses relevant to those aspects were in London and the relevant documents would mainly be in London. (ii) The defendants' claims against third parties, which were by no means all London-based, would only arise if the club succeeded in its claim. (iii) It seemed likely that the number of witnesses for each jurisdiction would be evenly balanced, and that the preponderance of documents would be in London. Touche Ross &amp; Co and others v Baker (FT, June 24) Touche Ross and five other accountancy firms were insured under excess professional indemnity policies. Substantial lines had been taken by Lloyd's Syndicate no. 126 on the first and third excess layers. The policies contained discovery extension clauses giving the assured an option exercisable before expiry of the policy to prolong cover for a further period in exchange for additional premiums. When the assured set about replacing cover, not all insurers were willing to participate, so the assured invoked the discovery extension clause. With one exception, the non-renewing insurers accepted invocation of the clause, the exception being Syndicate 126, which maintained that the clause had to be exercised against all the insurers or none. At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that the argument for the syndicate would mean that the assured would have the right to exercise the discovery extension option separately against each individual name, which was a result entirely contrary to the way in which Lloyd's conducted its business. Dismissing the appeal, the House of Lords stated that there was nothing in the words of the policy to compel the result for which the underwriters contended, and everything in the practical considerations to the opposite effect. Regina v Lautro, ex parte Ross (FT, June 25) THE COURT of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the sole director of the Winchester Group plc when his application for judicial review of the decision by the Life Assurance Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation Ltd (Lautro) was refused by the Divisional Court. Lautro had served an intervention notice under its rules on Winchester which in effect had prohibited the carrying-on of its investment business. On appeal, the key issue was whether Lautro's failure to give Winchester an opportunity to make representations before service invalidated the notice. The Court of Appeal stated that the decision whether to exercise the power of intervention and to serve a notice before hearing the persons to whom it was directed or whom it would affect had to be balanced against what Lautro regarded as the interests of its members. As a general proposition the decision-making body did owe some duty of fairness to that second person, which in appropriate circumstances might well include a duty to allow him to make representations. That would particularly be the case when the adverse effect was on the second person's livelihood or ability to earn. Although at the relevant time, Lautro's rules, and thus its procedure, were defective in the respects outlined, it was not required by law to afford to Winchester the opportunity to make representations before deciding to serve its notice.</p>

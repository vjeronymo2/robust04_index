			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Swedish purchase holds back Henkel's profits HENKEL, the German chemicals, cosmetics and household goods group, recorded a 10 per cent fall in profits last year, mainly due to the costs of restructuring and acquisitions. Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31, 1992, fell to 'around DM400m' (Dollars 250m) while total sales rose by 9 per cent to DM14.1bn. Sales in Germany grew by 5 per cent and sales abroad rose by 16 per cent. Turnover was boosted by a 53 per cent increase in sales of cosmetics, which rose from DM1bn to DM1.5bn as a result of the acquisition from Sweden's Nobel Industrier of Barnangen, the household and personal products company. Henkel bought Barnangen early last year for DM900m. A company spokesman said the fall in profits was mainly due to the cost of financing the acquisition and to the expected bigger marketing costs for Barnangen products. Cosmetics sales accounted in 1992 for 10.9 per cent of the group's total sales, as compared with 7.8 per cent the previous year. The group also suffered an undisclosed fall in the sales of chemicals products, which had been hard hit by the appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FATHER, SON HELD IN 5 KILLINGS FIGHT EXTRADITION  </P> <P> A father and son facing murder and kidnaping charges in the ritualistic slaying  of a five-member Ohio family refused Thursday to comply with a governor's  warrant authorizing their return to the Midwest.  </P> <P> The attorney for Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a reputed cult leader, and his  19-year-old son, Damon, now have 10 days to file a petition for a writ of  habeas corpus challenging the order.  </P> <P> But that deadline can be extended should the defense need more time to review  the information in the case, said John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy  district attorney.  </P> <P> The Lundgrens, who have been jailed in San Diego since their arrest last month  in National City, were dressed in blue prison uniforms and remained silent  throughout the 15-minute hearing before Municipal Judge William Woodward.  </P> <P> Hewicker said the case will now go to Superior Court, where a judge will decide  either to deny the petition or grant the writ.  </P> <P> "If the court denies the petition, we could have agents out here to pick them  up within three weeks," Hewicker said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said that if the Superior Court grants a hearing on the writ, it  could take up to six weeks before the two could be forced to return to Ohio.  </P> <P> But Hewicker said that even if the writ if denied, the case can still be  appealed.  </P> <P> However, Hewicker said he does not foresee any problem in eventually returning  the pair to Ohio.  </P> <P> Lundgren, his wife, Alice, 38, and their son were arrested on fugitive  allegations outside a National City motel following a nationwide manhunt for 13  members of a cult indicted in the Ohio slayings.  </P> <P> Alice Lundgren waived extradition and was returned to Ohio, where she has  pleaded innocent to charges of complicity to aggravated murder, conspiracy and  kidnapping.  </P> <P> Lundgren and his son are charged with aggravated murder and kidnapping.  </P> <P> The elder Lundgren faces the death sentence if convicted of charges stemming  from the slayings of Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl and their three daughters,  Hewicker said.  </P> <P> The family's bodies were found in early January buried under a barn on a farm  in Kirtland, Ohio. Lundgren and his followers had lived on the rented farm  until leaving last April, when authorities believe the family was killed.  </P> <P> Reputed cult members Kathryn Johnson, 36, and Daniel David Kraft, 25, who were  arrested in eastern San Diego County, are scheduled to be in court today for a  hearing regarding the status of their extradition proceedings.  </P> <P> They are also fighting extradition and remain jailed without bail in San Diego.  </P> <P> Eight other cult members face charges in the case.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Lundgren formerly was a lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints before being defrocked in January, 1988, for  radical teachings, according to church officials.  </P> <P> He later formed the sect, persuading some former church members to follow him.  </P></p>

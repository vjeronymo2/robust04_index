			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: A man of mystic symbolism - Alan Davie At well past his 71st, the celebration of Alan Davie's 70th birthday is more than a little overdue, but none the less welcome for that. He is one of the most distinguished and significant of painters to emerge in Britain since the War, perhaps Scotland's outstanding artist of the period. In the late 1940s especially, and through the 1950s, he was as potent as force as any, as conspicuous as Bacon and Sutherland and yet quite alone in his commitment to symbolic, expressionist abstraction. We might well wonder, therefore, why this show does not command the Tate; and if not the Tate, why not the National Gallery of Modern Art at Edinburgh, where it was first mooted and then abruptly cancelled. Edinburgh, where he studied and, for him, a city as long personal association as Glasgow is short. Yet all has come right in the end, for nowhere but in Glasgow, close by Macintosh's art school where his father taught just round the corner into Sauchiehall Street, are there galleries at once so handsome and spacious enough to do justice to his full life's work. So Davie's Solo fills the splendid McLellan Galleries until March 22 (then a gap until Bristol in September). There are several pendant shows: in Glasgow, of mixed works, at The Compass Gallery (West Regent Street, through February); and, to be fair, in Edinburgh, of Works on Paper 1959-91 at the Talbot Rice Gallery (until February 22: a British Council initiative which tours first to Aberdeen and then extensively around South America), and Tapestries and Prints at Edinburgh Weavers (until February 29). He has always shown extensively abroad, most especially in South America; but in London, had it not been for regular exhibitions with Gimpel Fils, his dealers since 1950, we should have seen little of him. As for our public institutions, mixed shows apart, South West Arts gave him a provincial tour in 1978, the Royal Scottish Gallery a retrospective at the Edinburgh Festival of 1972. The British Council showed him in Delhi in 1971, the Graves in Sheffield in 1965. In London the last such show was at the Camden Arts Centre in 1971, before that a touring retrospective that came to the Whitechapel in 1959. Can such indifference have been a mere chance of fashion, a case of a face not fitting, a body of work suddenly rendered as invisible as the jazz, of which Davie has always been as devoted a practitioner as he is a painter, was suddenly inaudible in the cool and raucous, rocking 1960s? Yes, it can. Davie, like so many prolific and romantic artists, has over-produced uncritically in his time, and gone through periods of uncertainty and even failure in his work. Yet good artists are not always the best self-editors, and a certain unneveness of achievement is hardly surprising in a career now little short of 50 years. The truth would seem to be that Davie had the temerity not merely to stick to a manner, abstract expressionist, that the received wisdom held to be both out-moded and imitative, but continued with its evolution towards a specifically symbolic, ultimately figurative imagery. If it is hard to categorise - ie, if it does not fit  - leave it out. We have only to walk through this large, splendid show to realise how narrowly mistaken is such a view. The earlier work, up to about 1960, is consistently extraordinary and enough to confirm Davie's importance had there been nothing to follow. Then come two decades of transition, sometimes tentative, awkward, sometimes sure enough; and at last, in more recent years, work again of such assurance and resolution that, its eccentricity notwithstanding, it both validates and is validated by all that has gone before. He has always been a mystic and a symbolist, intrigued by sign and totem, ever drawn into the attempt at sustaining a kind of visual incantation. Instinctively pantheistic and general in his imaginative references and associations, he began obviously enough, close to the romantic expressionism of Chagall and Rouault. By the late 1940s, however, he had abandoned overt figuration, and while his friendship with Peggy Guggenheim in Venice had exposed him to the earlier phases of American abstract expressionism, Pollock especially, he remained firmly European in his sensibility, never persuaded that the surface, the paint, the mark of itself were ever enough. Although his own personal and visionary heraldry for a while was subsumed in the rich paint, the brooding, atmospheric colour and the broad, freely calligraphic handling - all quite as accomplished as anything of the Americans of the time - it was never dispensed with altogether. Indeed, it remained perhaps the more potent in its imaginative charge for being the more ambiguous, generalised and unspecific. Not by the titles alone, of his paintings of the 1950s, the Witches' Sabbaths, the sundry creations, martyrdoms and initiations, do the black paintings of Goya come to mind. After 1960, even more so after 1970, the colour clears and brightens and becomes flatter. The pictorial space is now more clearly established, a curious shallow, somewhat theatrical space or room animated by a strange menagerie of symbols - a kind of free-floating still-life of moon, snake and wheel, stripe and chevron. The imaginative source is avowedly Celtic, Pictish, a conscious evocation of unknowable magic and ancient principle. And slowly, as it clarifies and becomes specific, so the figuration in the most recent paintings shifts towards the acknowledged mysticism of the Buddhist and the Hindu, drawn upon the mannered imaginary landscapes and gardens of Mughal miniatures and carpets. The later water-colours are especially strong and beautiful in holding both to the open, general influence and reference, and the personal integrity. From the pagan Celtic to the mystical Hindu may seem a strange odyssey, but it is all one.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES markets basked in the glory of the underlying FT-SE 100 index which hit a record closing high yesterday and Footsie futures continued to attract buyers. The futures contract for September delivery was not heavily traded but found buyers at every level and broke through several support bands. Surprisingly, there was very little fundamental backing to the market and dealers attributed yesterday's strength to an 'excess of cash in the City' as investors moved funds from low yielding bank accounts. The only excuse to buy appeared to be the French decision to end its emergency high lending facility and return to its existing 5-10 day cent intervention rate which set the floor for French rates. September futures opened at 2,960 and gained throughout the day to close around 2,985, a premium of 12 to the cash market. Traded options saw just over 38,000 contracts dealt with BT the most active stock option on turnover of 2,348 lots.</p>

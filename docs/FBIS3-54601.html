			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The fourth and final stage of the great Victory-3  maneuvers began in the blue waters of northern Persian Gulf this  morning with the extensive participation of units under the  joint command of the [Islamic Revolution Guards] Corps [IRGC],  the Army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the popular forces.    In this stage of the maneuvers, initially a divers'  exploration team attacked the jetties of an imaginary enemy and  while destroying support vessels tied up at the docks, passed  through defensive positions and mine fields.    The operating forces, in a lightning attack on military  installations on the island, including radar, listening, and  [word indistinct] posts, destroyed a substantial portion of the  enemy's radar capacity.    In the final stage of the Victory-3 maneuvers the heavy  artillery of the Guards and [military] equipment company, with  their heavy, precise, and extensive fire on enemy positions,  installations, and the beach jetty, prevented the vessels of the  imaginary enemy from aproaching these areas.    At the same time as these operations, the joint IGRC-Army  mine-layers blocked all entrances and sensitive areas with  various marine mines of extremely high sensitivity. Meanwhile,  the fighter-bombers of the army of the Islamic Republic of Iran,  using the best tactical actions, identified attacking vessels  and, coordinating with missile sites, took action to ensure  their destruction.    While bombarding the positions of the imaginary enemy, the  Kousar brigade warship and the Qader support vessel, supported  by the heavy fire of the army's gunships, began their thunderous  attacks.    The marine brigade and the commando brigade of the navy of  the Guards Corps, together with the army's armored units and  supported by the tanks and armored vehicles of the Guards Corps'  land forces, executed a lightning attack on the island and  captured the first defenses of the imaginary enemy.    Meanwhile, in order to speed up operations and to capture  the  island, companies of the IRGC commando brigade, landed from  helicopters beyond enemy lines and carried out their tactical  military operations.</p>

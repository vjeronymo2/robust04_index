			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swedish mortgage group to de-mutualise Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage credit institute, yesterday launched a SKr3bn share issue to convert it from a co-operative organisation into a profit-orientated listed company, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The offer is being made to 760,000 borrowers who will be eligible, according to the size of their mortgages, to subscribe for shares at a price of SKr80 per share. They will also receive one matching share free for every share they buy from Stadshypotekskassan (the Urban Mortgage Bank), the trustee fund which currently owns Stadshypotek.</p>

Members of the public have been  asked to avoid Wolhuter and Koch Streets. At least 2,000 Zulus  are currently gathering at the George Goch Station where they  are being addressed by Zulu leaders. Another large group of  marchers are waiting for trains at the Jeppe Station.    People believed to have been injured during the march are  streaming into Johannesburg and Hillbrow Hospitals, and the  situation in both hospitals is said to be chaotic. A spokesman  for the Johannesburg Hospital said the victims were suffering  from gunshot and sjambok wounds, and multiple injuries.    Altogether 42 people were admitted by the casualty section  of  Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto following violence in the area.  A spokesperson said 30 of those admitted had bullet wounds and  three people were in a critical condition, the other 12 were  stabbed, beaten or had been struck by motor vehicles.</p>

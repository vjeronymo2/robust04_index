			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Lutskiy video report from Yugoslavia; from the </F> "Utro" program]    [Text] Spring is in full bloom in Croatia. Unfortunately,  the smell of blooming trees in once picturesque towns and  villages that have found themselves in a combat zone contrasts  sharply with the almost apocalyptic horror of devastation.  Blood brothers, Serbs and Croats, look at what you have done.  Ruins, ruins, and ruins again.    and this is a roadblock of the UN peace keeping force, UNHCR  [as heard] for short. It controls a part of the territory  between the self proclaimed republic of Serbia and Croatia. Had  it not been for the blue helmets, the smoldering fire of war  would have blazed here with renewed strength.    A UN command post snuggled near a demolished church in the  small town of (Pakrac), formerly a resort. The chief is  Canadian. When asked whether it was dangerous here he said that  while today the situation was relatively relaxed, a month ago it  was very dangerous.    Intense fighting took place at the local cemetery as well.  Even the dead have no peace from the living, many of whom found  their final resting place here.    While touring the roads of former Yugoslavia, we managed to  meet fighters of the Russian battalion, which serves under the  UN aegis. There were 1,200 in the beginning, then a third was  sent to Bosnia, to the long-suffering town of Sarajevo. These  lads serve at the so-called checkpoints.    [Begin recording][Lutskiy] Do shootings occur often?    [Bessmertnykh] There are battles every day.    [Kobzev] Our battalion lost two men this year, and 17  sustained injuries of varying extent. As to the situation, it  is difficult to say how an immediate peace can be established  here. There can be no talk about establishing immediate peace  here. [end recording]    The deputy battalion commander's opinion was also confirmed  at the Russian Embassy in Croatia.    [Begin Kerestedzhiyants recording] I want to emphasize that  there is no side where you can plant both feet and say: This is  just. [Points to a wall map of former Yugoslavia, with color  coded division of forces displayed] The Serbs have no right to  clean out Gorazde, which is home for 60,000 Muslims. These  people have nowhere to go. The Muslims here also have no right  to attack the Serbs because they are under UN protection and  have been declared to be in a security zone. And a security  zone implies lack of danger from within the zone first and  foremost. General tension and readiness to continue is fairly  high on all three sides. No one here is satisfied with the way  things have been solved so far. [end recording]    Politicians and servicemen are unsatisfied, but what about  the common people, who are forced to abandon their homes and who  find themselves in refugee camps? According to estimates of  representatives of the UN high commissioner for refugees, who  take care of the problems of dispossessed people -- housing,  feeding and providing medical services for them -- more than 4  million people in the former Yugoslavia are in need of such  services. However, even here in the camps life goes on,  children feel at home here and play merrily, old people talk  about their own affairs, and everyone is making plans for the  future.    This is Aleksandr Lutskiy reporting from Croatia for the  "Utro" program.</p>

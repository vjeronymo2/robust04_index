			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore hits out at Southend Prop's gearing SOUTHEND Property Holdings, which is attempting to become one of the largest quoted property companies in the UK through a Pounds 130m paper bid for Frogmore Estates, yesterday said that the merger would create a stronger, better balanced portfolio, savings in administrative costs and improved liquidity for the shares. Frogmore Estates hit back, however, saying that: 'Southend's offer is no more than an attempt to solve a very real gearing problem at Frogmore shareholders' expense'. In the offer document, posted yesterday, Southend announced a revised net asset value per share of 147p. This followed a revaluation of its investment property portfolio which has declined 8 per cent in value to Pounds 239.4m since the end of March 1990. Frogmore said it noted this revised figure with considerable surprise. 'Recently reported net asset values of other property companies, particularly those concentrated in offices and retail, have shown considerable declines,' it said. Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend, said that the relatively small decline was explained by the absence of any City of London properties and a conservative internal valuation last year. Southend said that its gearing after revaluation was 123 per cent and Pounds 100m of its Pounds 158m borrowings were in the form of a 35-year quoted debenture at a fixed interest cost of 6.9 per cent after tax. The merged group would have gearing of 49 per cent and would have gross assets in excess of Pounds 600m, net assets of Pounds 330m and net borrowings of Pounds 161m. See Lex</p>

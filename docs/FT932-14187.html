			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Lafarge bids Pta36bn for Asland LAFARGE Coppee, the big French construction group, yesterday announced a Pta36bn (Dollars 318m) share swap bid for full control of Asland, the second-biggest Spanish cement company in which it has a 54 per cent stake. Under the terms of the bid, Lafarge will offer two of its shares for every nine of Asland's. Lafarge acquired its stake in 1989. The French group, which is advised by Kleinwort Benson, will be issuing a maximum of 4.7m shares, representing 8 per cent of its equity capital, to make the offer at an extraordinary general meeting on May 25. The downturn in Spanish cement consumption is not forecast to touch bottom until late next year and is unlikely to return to 1992 levels until 1996. Asland has a capacity of 5.9m tonnes, representing 15.9 per cent of Spain's installed capacity, and is the main producer in the Madrid region and in central Spain. The swap bid values each Asland share at Pta1,730, which represents a 21 per cent premium on the opening price last Friday but well down on Asland's book value of Pta2,200 per share. 'It is not a generous price but it is a reasonable deal,' said Mr Paul Farrow, chief analyst at FG, Madrid brokers. Asland's net profits slid to Pta3.9bn last year from Pta8.6bn in 1991 and Pta11.7bn in 1990. The company is forecast to have flat profits and a high price/earnings ratio over the next two years. Lafarge's decision to buy out the minority shareholders may have been prompted by the aggressive acquisition policy of Mexico's Cemex group which bought a series of companies, including the main domestic producers Valenciana and Sanson, last year in order to corner nearly 30 per cent of Spain's cement market. The French construction group is seeking a cheaper purchase. According to FG, Lafarge will be paying Pta17,000 for every tonne of cement sold by Asland whereas Cemex paid some Pta25,000 per tonne sold in its 1992 acquisitions. Lafarge has not set a minimum acceptance level for its offer and has not disclosed the success rate of its bid. Lex, Page 24</p>

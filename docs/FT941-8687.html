			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Roots still in Scotland Sir, In your survey of Housing Associations (February 15) I was interested to see Octavia Hill cited as a key figure in the establishment of the housing association movement. As her biographer, and until recently a committee member of a large London housing association, I see all the trends described in your survey as rapidly taking the movement away from its roots. The kind of community-based housing action that Octavia Hill and those housing professionals of the next generation that she trained believed in is under threat and only survives, to any extent, in Scotland. Had you featured the Glasgow housing association movement, for example, you could have demonstrated that value for money produces architectural quality, job creation, children's playgrounds and a high degree of tenant involvement at every level - the very things that Octavia Hill promoted.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael Sparks] </F>   [Text] After more than five years of publishing the  viewpoint of progressive Afrikaners, court judgments and a  shortage of money have forced Vrye Weekblad to close from  February 2, editor Max du Preez said yesterday. Foremost among  the problems faced by the newspaper was a R[rand]1.5 million  defamation suit brought against it and the Weekly Mail by former  police forensics chief Lieutenant-General Lothar Neethling.    The papers published stories in 1989 linking Neethling to  death squad activities by allegedly providing poisons and  knockout drops to former police captain Dirk Coetzee. The  Supreme Court found the stories were true on overwhelming  probability, a judgment that was overturned by the Appeal Court.  The amount of compensation still has to be determined.    Du Preez was unrepentant, saying he would not have done  anything different. "Our closure will leave a vacuum, but we  played an interesting role. My regret is not being part of the  election coverage. This effectively gives Nasionale Pers a  monopoly of election coverage in the Afrikaans press."    Du Preez and his 10 editorial staff members are now looking  for jobs, but he added that he had been approached last year to  present one edition of AGENDA on TV1 each week.</p>

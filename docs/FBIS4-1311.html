			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by G. Arde'] </F>   [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The delay experienced by  some special voters in certain parts of KwaZulu/Natal was being  urgently addressed on Tuesday [26 April] morning, Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Glenn McDougall said.    He said because of late changes to the ballot paper and  logistical problems, especially transport, there had been delays  at certain polling booths. Some voting material had also  arrived late from Johannesburg.    However, no serious disruptions had been reported in the  region by 10AM, Mr McDougall added.    Voting at two polling stations visited by SAPA in the  greater  Durban area on Tuesday morning was late in getting underway.    In Amanzimtoti, special voters were served tea and cake  while  they waited for over two hours to cast their vote. An IEC  official at the scene said some voters were "not impressed".    The official said a number of people had missed the  opportunity to vote as some had to board flights abroad, while  other disappointed voters had gone home.    At Durban's City Hall one disabled pensioner said after  casting her vote: "I'm fed up ... I haven't even had a cup of  tea."    The old lady who had travelled from Umlazi at 5.30AM said  she  was happy she had finally had the opportunity to exercise her  choice in electing the next government.</p>

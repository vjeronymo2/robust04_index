			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: BOUGHT THE RECORD? THEN STOP WHINING  </P> <P> Three cheers!  </P> <P> For once, the system works and justice prevails! The National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences moved quickly and heroically this week in stripping  Milli Vanilli of its ill-begotten Grammy award in the wake of the outrageous  revelation that Vanilli's two "lead singers" never sang a note on the album or  on subsequent concert. . . .  </P> <P> Oh, forget it. Who bleeding cares, huh?  </P> <P> As far as I'm concerned, the only "controversy" about Milli Vanilli is that the  "group" won a Grammy Award in the first place. But now we're hearing that  disappointed fans are stomping into record stores -- Milli Vanilli tapes, LPs  and/or CDs in hand -- demanding their money back. Requesting refunds for the  very same "music" that up until a week ago they thought was just about the  sweetest sound this side of Heaven's Gate.  </P> <P> Equally incredible is a lawsuit filed in Oakland -- and you can bet this won't  be the last one -- suing the band, the record company, concert promoters and  presumably the parking lot attendants because group "leaders" Rob Pilatus and  whatever-the-other-guy's-name-is were lip-syncing in "live" performances. (This  suit also alleges that the quasi-Vanillis lip-synced -- the faint-hearted  should skip this sentence -- in their music videos!!!! If lip-syncing in music  videos becomes a crime, the entire music business will go to jail. That's the  way they are made, kids.)  </P> <P> Get off the bloomin' high horses, OK folks? If you bought an album because you  like the music, why should it affect your enjoyment of that music if the hunky  models on the album cover didn't really sing it? It's still the same music --  get it?  </P> <P> As to the recording academy and its self-righteous breast-beating about  maintaining the "integrity" of the award -- where were they when the bloody  thing was nominated? This is the organization with a 30-year history of  honoring imitation Vanilli flavorings.  </P> <P> It was over this very category -- best new artist -- that I swore off paying  any serious attention to the Grammys in 1978. That year, Grammy voters at least  made one respectable nomination in that category by including Elvis Costello,  who has since proven himself the most prolific, most consistently challenging  and rewarding singer-songwriter in rock possibly since Bob Dylan. (Come to  think of it, Bobby didn't win a Best New Artist Grammy either, nor did the  Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Prince, Bruce Springsteen or . . . ).  Instead, that year the recording industry gave its highest honor for a freshman  performer to . . . A Taste of Honey. If A Taste of Honey ever winds up in the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it will only be in the display for Fastest  Disappearance Without a Trace.  </P> <P> And ripped-off Milli Vanilli concert-goers? Aren't these the same people who  snapped up tickets to the group's "concert" last May at Irvine Meadows,  screaming their heads off and then writing whiny letters castigating rock  critics who had the audacity to suggest that any applause should be reserved  for the fine folks at TDK?  </P> <P> The bitter pill that must be swallowed by any of the 7 million or so folks who  bought Vanilli's "Girl You Know It's True" album and now feel betrayed is that  it's your own damned fault. Fact is, you went to a concert hoping to hear  exactly what was on the album (these folks are the first to gripe if a  dance-pop performer's concerts don't sound just like the record) and that's  exactly what you got. So can it already.  </P> <P> Those who liked the music will still like the music. Those who were responding  instead to the image of two gorgeous guys singing pulsating dance-pop tunes --  ah, there's the rub.  </P> <P> Pop audiences, encouraged by the music industry itself, demand their singers  conform to a standard of physical perfection that's every bit as hollow as most  of the music associated with it. No matter how gorgeous your voice may be, if  you don't look like you belong on the cover of GQ or Playboy, forget it.  Conversely, if you look great, who cares what you sound like? We can always fix  it in the mix.  </P> <P> That's why videos of new pop phenom Wilson Phillips show two of the three women  singers frolicking in scenic locations, outfitted in revealing, body-hugging  fashions; the third, who doesn't possess a Cosmopolitan cover-girl's looks or  body, is dispatched in fleeting cutaway shots, draped in yards of black to hide  her imperfect body.  </P> <P> I'd rather listen to three minutes of a wrinkled, overweight,  50-something-year-old black singer named Katie Webster, pounding out old blues  tunes on her very own piano than to sit through two hours of throbbing, vacant  Milli Vanilli music -- live or digitally reduced to perfect 4 3/4-inch shiny  aluminum discs.  </P> <P> Milli Vanilli epitomizes the youth-pop world's credo of surface beauty over  substance. The fact that the band's two ersatz lead singers were faking is  all-too fitting, since most of this genre's music only imitates the human  emotions it pretends to address.  </P> <P> Were audiences genuinely yearning for truth and honesty in the records they  buy, Milli Vanilli's album wouldn't have sold three copies to begin with.  </P> <P> You want the real thing? Try Bob Dylan's latest album. Go see a Neil Young  concert or Bonnie Raitt if you want to be assured that the singers on stage  aren't just moving their lips. Girl, you know that's true.  </P> <P> But Milli Vanilli complaints? Don't make me laugh.  </P></p>

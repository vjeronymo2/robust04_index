			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Potatoes provide growth at Everest Everest Foods, the frozen foods and egg production company, reported another record year in the 12 months to May 31. The shares rose 5p to 220p. On turnover 12 per cent higher at Pounds 33.8m (Pounds 30.2m) pre-tax profits advanced 26 per cent to Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 2.64m). Trading profits in the food distribution and egg production divisions both fell but frozen chips and potato products advanced 30 per cent. The pre-tax result was helped by a halving of interest costs to Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 874,000) as a result of the placing and open offer in December. Earnings per share were 20.13p (17.97p) and the final dividend is raised to 4.8p for a total of 7p (6.8p). A 1-for-1 scrip issue is proposed.</p>

Inacker report: "First Russian Ceremony for </F> German Fallen at Stalingrad"]    [Text] Moscow/Volgograd -- Icy wind streaks across a field  35 km to the west of Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad. Thousands  of German soldiers are buried there under frozen Russian earth.  A simple birchwood cross, hammered into the ground only a few  days ago, marks the field of graves for the victims of that  battle in 1942-43, which constitutes a low point in the common  history of both Russians and Germans.    On Thursday [17 February] a new chapter in relations between  German and Russian armed forces was opened there. For the first  time since 1945 the highest-ranking German soldier, Bundeswehr  Inspector General Klaus Naumann, was able to honor the dead.  And for the first time since 1945 a guard of honor consisting  of Russian soldiers took their positions for the fallen Germans.  In his talks in Moscow with Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces,  Naumann advocated that this ceremony take place.    What this means for the Russians was explained by Lieutenant  General Vladimir Patapov, chief of staff in the Military  District of Volgograd: "For decades we have been taught to see  the Germans as our enemies. And now, because of the talks with  the highest-ranking German general, we see that everything is  quite different."    Major General Lev Rokhlin, commander of the corps groups in  the Military District of Volgograd, said that he fought as a  soldier in Afghanistan and in the Caucasus and has experienced  suffering and death; "to the left and to the right of me my best  friends fell. We soldiers often do not know where the just war  ends and the political lie begins. In this Russian soil there  are German soldiers, here against their will, because of a  criminal political leadership. It is the simple soldiers who  suffered and who did not do anything but follow orders. Often,  we soldiers do not have any other choice."    By visiting a country whose inhabitants link German uniforms  with the memory of suffering, Naumann has achieved more than  some political travelers: He represented German identity and  German interests with dignity also in a situation burdened with  historic events.    In St. Petersburg (Leningrad), where 1 million people died  during 900 days of Wehrmacht siege, Naumann wrote into the  commemorative book of the siege memorial: "The 900 days and the  innumerable sacrifices of, above all, the citizens of this  heroic city must never be forgotten. However, from the graves  there rises an admonition to us who are alive -- an admonition  for reconciliation and an obligation for lasting peace between  Russia and Germany."    Naumann's behavior made the German general's talks with  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and Chief of General Staff  Kolesnikov about other sensitive topics easier:    -- Naumann promised to withdraw Russian troops from Germany  in a dignified manner to avoid any impression of a defeat.  However, there is to be no joint event with the Western allies.    -- Concerning the subject of NATO's expansion to the East,  Naumann remained tough: Russian security interests will be  taken into consideration, but the 16 NATO members alone are the  ones to decide about accepting new members.    -- In a lecture at the General Staff Academy, Naumann called  on the Russian military leadership to finally publish its  military doctrine adopted last autumn. The result: the Russian  chief of General staff intends to send Naumann a copy translated  into German in the coming weeks.    In addition, the inspector general achieved progress in the  field of further development of German-Russian security policy  relations. Naumann says that the agreement about more intensive  German-Russian military cooperation "sets a new course." Above  all below the command echelon, younger officers are to be  exchanged between the two countries. As of this autumn, one  Bundeswehr officer will go to the Russian General Staff Academy  and three Russian officers will receive training at the  Bundeswehr Command Academy. There are also to be visits at the  troop level.    During Naumann's five-day visit the new relationship between  Russian and German Armed Forces was demonstrated in particular  by the fact that the German delegation was shown military  installations that had been top secret before. In a  snow-covered forest near Balabanov, 100 km south of Moscow, the  bunker doors to a launch pad of the SS-18 intercontinental  missiles opened for the Bundeswehr inspector general.    These are the Russians' most terrible nuclear weapons;  having  10 warheads each and high precision, they were destined to be  used in a disabling strike against NATO. Naumann was shown a  simulated launch, by which the Russians wanted to demonstrate  that the nuclear missiles are safe in their country because they  are coded and cannot be fired by unauthorized persons.    In Kubinka, 69 km from Moscow, a Russian Air Defense  command post is hidden 20 meters underground right in the middle  of a residential area. Naumann was the first West European  general to be briefed on the operation and command procedures of  Russian Air Defense. The large map projected in the darkened  operations headquarters covered the entire area between Russia  and France. On a board to the left all potential approaching  flying object, their number, and their direction are registered;  on the right the planes that can be used for interception as  well as the airports and the relevant weather conditions are  listed.    In Totskoye, 1,000 km east of Moscow, Naumann was shown the  27th Motorized Rifle Division during an exercise -- an elite  unit that is to participate in UN missions in the future.  Naumann noticed weaknesses of a T-72 tank company during  training shots. The Russian commander, Division General  Anatoliy Sidyakin, took the German inspector general's critical  questions with good humor. The Russian general said he is happy  that Naumann visited in his function as Bundeswehr inspector  general and not as inspector of his troops.    The extent to which the relationship between the former  enemies has changed was demonstrated by Naumann's meeting with  Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin, who is responsible for  armament. Kokoshin worriedly inquired about the cutbacks in the  German defense budget, because, after all, Moscow wants to sell  Russian high technology armament to the Germans. Kokoshin gave  Naumann a glossy brochure: The "Military Parade" -- a catalogue  from which in the future the supreme German Bundeswehr planner  can order all the weapons systems he needs -- around the clock,  if he likes.</p>

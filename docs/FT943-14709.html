			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Observer: Family matters The death of Sir Kenneth Kleinwort, 59, means that another of the City's merchant banking dynasties is nearing its end. Sir Kenneth, son of Ernest Kleinwort, started work at the bank in 1955 and although he never carried the same weight in the City as his father, he remained the nominal head of a widespread family which is said to control up to 20 per cent of one of the City's best known merchant banks. The family will continue to be represented on the board by David Peake, the former chairman who is married to Susanna Kleinwort, and David Benson, a member of the other founding family, remains a non-executive director. However, it is most unlikely that there will ever be another Kleinwort on the board of Kleinwort Benson.</p>

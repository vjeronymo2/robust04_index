Meng Jianxiong, deputy major of this largest commercial city  in China, told a local meeting that the drive will stress  revising the existing management of state-owned property and  forming a group of powerful corporations.    Topping the list of the city's ten main tasks is  standardizing the management system of the ten nationally known  commercial and service companies in the city, such as the  Shanghai No. 1 Department Store and the Hualian Trade Mansion.    In addition, the city is to adopt a series of measures to  promote the drive this year, including establishing ten large  corporations through mergers and purchasing, improving its 19  existing joint-stock companies and adding 10 more to the list.  In addition, initial experiments in handling bankruptcies and  mergers will be carried out, and 400 small-partnership  commercial enterprises and 500 chain stores will be set up.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: In the clouds - Ballot Box Plaid Cymru's election manifesto was partly written by Dr Phil Williams, a terrestrial physicist. Williams was unable to be present at the launch of the document yesterday because he was in Kiruna, Sweden, north of the Arctic circle, studying aspects of the earth's atmosphere. His work on global warming and the ozone hole fuelled his interest in the party's energy policies. The launch of a satellite by the space shuttle is keeping him away, but he will be back in Wales in time to vote for independence.</p>

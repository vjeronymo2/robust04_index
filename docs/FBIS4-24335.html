			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] France is resuming cooperation with Togo. This  was announced in Paris this morning by Richard Dequesne, a  spokesman for the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. The French  Government believes that the crisis has ended in Togo, and has  decided to resume civil and military cooperation with our  country. This cooperation had been suspended at the end of  1992. The French Government noted that, up to now, the long  political crisis experienced in Togo did not permit them to  engage in palliative measures to cushion the impact of the  devaluation of the CFA franc, as was done for all other franc  zone countries. These measures were essential to the country's  economic and financial balance.    The French Government also announced that, to show its  solidarity with the Togolese people, it has decided to resume  its cooperation, and called on its European Union partners to  follow suit.

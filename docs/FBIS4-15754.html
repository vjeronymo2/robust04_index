			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of  parliament) Ivan Rybkin in a letter to the Ukrainian leadership  has protested at Kiev's seizure of the Black Sea Fleet's group  of warships deployed at Odessa and the detention of the group  commander, officers and men.    The letter requests the immediate release of the detainees  in  the name of long-running friendly relations between Russia and  Ukraine.    Head of the parliamentary committee for CIS affairs  Konstantin Zatulin told reporters in Moscow that soon after  receiving an INTERFAX report about the incident on Monday, the  Duma Council had held consultations with Chief Commander of the  Russian Navy Feliks Gromov and Russian chief negotiator in talks  with Kiev Yuriy Dubinin. He said the two officials would fly to  Kiev late on Monday and that the "incident will be resolved and  servicemen released".    Zatulin expressed the hope that the incident was caused by  misunderstanding rather than being a deliberate act intended to  strain bilateral relations. If the detainees are not set free,  he said, the Duma will have to resume discussion of the issue on  Wednesday and adopt a special resolution. Zatulin did not rule  out a souring of relations between the two countries and their  parliaments.    At the same time, the Russian official said the incident  might have been planned as a way of causing friction between  Moscow and Kiev. Zatulin believes that tension is being fuelled  in Ukraine in a bid to cancel presidential elections in June and  impose presidential rule in the country.</p>

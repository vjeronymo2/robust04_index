			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S. Korean `National Security Law' Must Be Scrapped </F> Immediately" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Voices strongly urging  the abrogation of the "National Security Law [NSL]" in South  Korea are ringing out from different countries.    J.O. Adeloju, chairman of the Nigerian Committee for  Supporting the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said in a press  statement that the "National Security Law" of South Korea is the  fascist law which defines North Korea as "an anti-state  organization", barring free travels and exchange between the  North and the South.    If the North-South dialogue is to progress successfully and  peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved  at an early date, it is necessary to immediately and  unconditionally scrap the NSL, he contended.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said in a statement  that the South Korean authorities must know clearly that they  can never evade the blame for their treason in blocking the  national reunification, if they refuse to repeal the "National  Security Law" despite warnings from the world people.    The Indonesian paper IN O SIAN OTSERVER carried an article  branding the "NSL" as an obstacle to the materialization of  democracy in South Korea.</p>

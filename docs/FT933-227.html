			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Action against Hoover ruled out TRADING standards officials yesterday ruled out criminal action against Hoover over its disastrous free-flights offer, but criticised the company for failing to foresee that the scheme would go so badly wrong. Mid-Glamorgan trading standards department, which has received almost 2,000 complaints from Hoover customers, said it had received legal advice that there were no grounds for prosecuting the company under the Trade Descriptions Act. The department, which has spent six months investigating the offer, said criminal action could be brought only if Hoover could be shown to have known in advance that its statements about the free flights were false and if it was criminally careless. It said that while Hoover might be accused of 'extreme gullibility' for miscalculating the likely take-up of its offer, there was no evidence that the company had set out to deceive or defraud customers. The department said it was calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to review the Trade Descriptions Act, which had not kept up with advances in technology and marketing techniques. The department, which conducted its investigation on behalf of trading standards authorities throughout the country, said Hoover customers who had not received free flights to which they believed they were entitled could still take civil action. The Hoover Holiday Pressure Group, which claims to represent 1,600 dissatisfied customers, said yesterday that about 40 actions were pending in small claims courts. Hoover said it was pleased by the department's decision. It said 103,000 people had so far flown under the free-flights scheme and that about 12,500 tickets were being issued every month. It would not say how many applications remained to be dealt with.</p>

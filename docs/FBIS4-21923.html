			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mohammad Beshkar in Beirut] </F>   [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has announced its  responsibility for the operation carried out by one of the  Palestinian mujahidin this morning in the occupied city of  Ashdod, north of the Gaza Strip. A Zionist settler was killed  and four others were wounded in the attack. A statement by the  movement obtained by our radio says: 'Ali al-'Amawi, an Islamic  Jihad member from the al-Shati' camp in Gaza, acting alone,  attacked a group of armed Zionist settlers in Ashdod this  morning, killing one and seriously wounding four others. The  mujahid was martyred by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire  during the attack.    In a telephone contact with him a short time ago, Dr. Fathi  al- Shiqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in  Palestine, stressed the continuation of jihad and military  operations against the occupation forces and the Zionist  settlers. He condemned UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  and the president of the Security Council for rushing to condemn  the martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula, north of occupied  Palestine, yesterday. He said this proves that the United  Nations and the Security Council are controlled by the American  will. Asked about the Islamic Jihad in Palestine's operation  today, he said:    [Begin al-Shiqaqi recording] The operations will continue.  They reflect our people's protest against and rejection of the  alleged and [word indistinct] peace agreement between the PLO  and the Israelis. They stress that our people's option is to  continue jihad and fight despite all attempts by the United  States, the Zionist enemy, and the official Palestinian side to  implement the Oslo agreement, which, again, I stress, makes  peace for no one but gives another reason for war.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has notified the South Korean  Government of its willingness to cooperate in Seoul's bid to  resettle fleeing North Korean loggers, a senior Foreign Ministry  official said Tuesday.    In reply to a government request, the UNHCR praised Seoul's  decision to allow the loggers to resettle in South Korea and  expressed its readiness to cooperate, the official said.    He said the ministry asked the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva  last Friday to confirm the identity of loggers who escaped from  North Korean camps in Siberia and give them refugee status.    The UNHCR will instruct its Moscow office to cooperate in  offering refugee status to the escapees late this week when it  finishes a study on how to protect, temporarily accommodate, and  look into the backgrounds of, the escapees and what to do with  the loggers after giving them refugee status.    The government told the UNHCR about human rights conditions  at the North Korean logging camps in Siberia and about escapees  from the camps, and asked for cooperation in resettling the  loggers in South Korea.    The government plans to allow those who have been clearly  identified to come here directly after consultations with the  Russian Government, while those requiring further identification  procedures must be screened by the UNHCR to determine their  refugee status.    Hundreds of North Korean loggers have escaped from Siberian  logging yards, testifying later to rampant human rights  violations inside the camps.</p>

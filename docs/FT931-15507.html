			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Waterford Crystal's workforce agrees to cost-cuts THE WORKFORCE at Waterford Crystal, the loss-making division of Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer, has overwhelmingly approved an IPounds 8m (Pounds 8.3m) cost-cutting package proposed by management, which should enable the company to return to profitability. Mr Paddy Galvin, chairman and chief executive of Waterford Crystal, said yesterday that he has been 'terribly encouraged that we have had an almost unanimous acceptance by the workforce'. Last November, the unions at the company's three plants in Ireland rejected the rescue package, which initially called for 500 voluntary redundancies out of the workforce of 1,900, across-the-board wage cuts and an industrial peace agreement for five years. The proposals then went to the Labour Court for arbitration, which recommended that the voluntary redundancy scheme should go ahead, as well as a series of wage cuts as high as 25 per cent for some workforce categories, but that the industrial peace agreement be reduced to three years and that a 12-month moratorium be placed upon any further outsourcing of crystalware from European manufacturers. Mr Galvin warned last week that a rejection by the workforce of the Labour Court recommendations would result in the closure of Waterford's Irish plants, and that all of its crystalware sold under the Waterford brand name would in future be sourced overseas. In the past six years the crystal division has suffered losses in the region of IPounds 90m, due to rising costs and declining markets, exacerbated by the recession in its two principal markets in the US and UK. Rationalisation has resulted in 1,400 redundancies since 1987, while short-time working over the past 18 months has further enabled losses to be trimmed. However, in the company's interim results in September, it appeared that a 16 per cent increase in crystal sales failed to lift the division out of the red. It reported increased losses of IPounds 3.2m for the half year. The company blamed the deficit on 'unabsorbed overheads' related to increased short-time working. The rescue plan is expected to facilitate a return to full-time working in the coming months.</p>

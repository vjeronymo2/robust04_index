			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Whitehall top job selection attacked Senior appointments in Whitehall should be advertised openly and filled on short-term contracts, says a report published today by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. The report says there has been little change in the way top mandarins are selected and trained despite far-reaching changes in the civil service. Greater movement between Whitehall and other occupations would strengthen officials' understanding and skills. Short-term contracts, renewable except in cases of acknowledged poor performance, would make clear that there are no longer guaranteed jobs for life in the civil service. The report is written by Mr William Plowden, a former civil servant and member of the Central Policy Review Staff, the Downing Street think-tank abolished by Baroness Thatcher in 1983. He says that by world standards, the British senior civil service ranks very high. But constant change in Whitehall and denigration of civil servants by ministers have undermined morale and destroyed relationships with ministers. However, a professional and self-confident civil service is essential to give ministers the advice they need, the report says. A new, non-Conservative government should seek to restore relationships with officials and encourage their professionalism. Top civil servants must also change to reflect the changing needs of society, the study adds. Senior mandarins still have too little, if any, experience of the world outside Whitehall, and there are fewer women in top jobs than in the US, Australia or Canada. The majority of top Whitehall jobs should be advertised, Mr Plowden says, with better training for civil servants to help them compete against outsiders. The report also recommends that ministers should be able to replace officials they do not wish to work with and veto nominees for top appointments. Ministers and Mandarins.

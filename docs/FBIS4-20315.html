			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Zhang Wanlong: "The Real Estate Market </F> Nationwide Gradually Came To Function Normally--Development  Slowed Down, Investment Structure Improved, and the Rules Were  Being Perfected"]    [Text] At the recently closed national conference on  construction work, this reporter learned that the work of  exercising macroregulation and control over the real estate  market nationwide had produced prominent results in the second  half of 1993.    Development slowed down. The entire year's rate of growth  over the same period of the previous year was 14.9 percent lower  than the first six months' rate of growth over the same period  of the previous year. In terms of floor space, the amount of  commercial buildings being built declined by 26.7 percent, and  newly started projects of buildings declined by 67.2 percent,  the amount of buildings completed declined by 15.9 percent, the  amount of buildings sold declined by 22.4 percent, and the sales  volume declined by 3.2 percent.    Investment structure improved. The localities reexamined the  projects of luxury buildings and projects of high-consumption  construction which had already been approved, strictly  controlling the granting of approval to construction projects  with unclear market prospects and shifting the focus of  investment to the construction of urban housing. The share of  housing in the amount of commercial buildings being constructed,  newly started, or completed increased markedly over 1992.    Prices stabilized. In the second half of the year, forward  real estate prices in the hot spot regions declined by 20-30  percent over the beginning of the year, and spot real estate  prices declined by 10-20 percent. Under the situation of strong  inflationary pressures and a strong demand for real estate, real  estate prices remained basically stable.    Market rules were being gradually perfected. The relevant  agencies of the central and local governments all quickened the  pace of legislation. In addition to the national Provisions for  Land Appreciation Tax and Provisions for Fund and Quality  Management of Real Estate Development Enterprises, provinces  such as Zhejiang and Guangdong promulgated regulatory rules on  real estate development; over a period of time some regions also  issued such local laws and regulations as on the relinquishing  and transferring of land use rights, real estate trading, real  estate evaluation, and standard land prices.    The situation with respect to the regulating of development  companies became markedly more orderly. The companies with no  real estate development capabilities were withering away by  themselves. In Guangxi 380 real estate companies closed down by  themselves; Guangdong terminated 170 real estate companies with  no development capabilities. At the same time many law-violating  companies were investigated and actions were taken against them;  and, in accordance with state regulations, land management  agencies and financial institutions were disconnected from the  companies they had created.</p>

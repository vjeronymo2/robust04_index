			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / CSO in private sector link-up to market official business data The government's Central Statis-tical Office has entered into its first private sector partnership to publish and market its business and trade statistics. Taylor Nelson AGB, Britain's largest market research group, has won a three-year contract as part of the CSO's attempts to assume a greater business focus and broaden its role away from being simply a supplier of statistics to the government. The deal, which will be officially announced later this week, is expected to yield annual turnover of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 3m, with the profits shared between the CSO and Taylor Nelson AGB. The group plans to publish about 90 annual reports and 36 quarterly collections of official business data on a detailed sectoral basis. These would be targeted largely at the estimated 28,000 UK companies that currently supply data to the CSO, according to Taylor Nelson. The reports, which would be compatible with other European Union statistics, would effectively replace the CSO's earlier business publications, which were controlled by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, the government data publishing department. The CSO is negotiating with financial news agencies to market statistical information to the City through computer links. Meanwhile, a contract for the collection of the retail price index data, the first area of data collection to be opened to private sector competition, will be announced later this month. The Department of Employment, which currently collects the data, is bidding for the contract, worth about Pounds 1m. More than a dozen private sector market research groups, understood to include Taylor Nelson AGB and the British Market Research Bureau, are also competing. Mori, another leading market research group, has refused to bid, claiming that the tender is too restrictive and skewed in favour of existing practices. The CSO also plans to hold tenders for the collection of compulsory business data next year if the government's deregulation bill is passed. The bill would remove the ban that prevents private companies collecting this data. Although the plans have been welcomed by market research groups, the programme is controversial within the CSO, where officials point out that allowing private contractors to collect data might create problems with business confidentiality.</p>

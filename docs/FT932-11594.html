			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Treaty view challenged THE STAKES were raised in the parliamentary battle over the Maastricht bill yesterday with the publication of the legal opinion obtained by Tory Euro-sceptics about the amendment on the social chapter. The opinion challenges the government's view that passing the amendment would not affect the UK's ability to ratify the treaty. Almost 300 MPs have put their names to the amendment, which would exclude from the bill the protocol containing the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out'. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, will consider over the weekend which amendments to the legislation should be chosen for debate and vote on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week when MPs resume their detailed discussion of the bill. She will announce her decisions on Tuesday.</p>

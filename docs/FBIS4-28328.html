			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 4 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 3 June, a top official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry commented on the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, and predicted: "Negotiations on all  three priority areas will probably be concluded at the same time  (at the Japan-U.S. summit to be held in early July)."    Among the three areas, negotiations on automobiles and auto  parts have been laggard compared with progress made in the areas  of government procurement and insurance, thus producing  speculation that an agreement in this area will be delayed until  sometime after July.    According to the top official, negotiations are now focused  on the issue of "objective criteria" which is the common issue  for all areas, and it has become likely that "the negotiations  will proceed in one set" [preceding two words in English].    Director-level meetings in the auto sector on 2 and 3 June  are due to be followed by vice-ministerial talks between  Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice-minister for international trade  and industry, and Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for  international trade, on 9 June.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Fed raises US short-term rates by 3/4 of a point The US Federal Reserve surprised the financial markets yesterday with an increase of three-quarters of a percentage point in short-term interest rates intended to keep inflation under control. The increase is the largest adjustment the Fed has made under the chairmanship of Mr Alan Greenspan, who has preferred more gradual changes in monetary policy, and responds to what the Fed called 'evidence of persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'. The size of the increase unsettled Wall Street, which had expected the Fed to raise short-term rates by only half a percentage point. Share and bond prices immediately jumped sharply as the markets applauded the central bank's resolve to fight inflation. But they later retreated as investors worried that the Fed's comments about its concern at the strength of the economy suggested it might raise rates again soon. By the close in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - which fluctuated wildly all afternoon - was down 3.37 at 3,826.36. The bond market held its modest gains, which pushed the yield on the long bond down slightly to 8.047 per cent. Currency markets, however, reacted unequivocally to the Fed's move, with the dollar rising a pfennig to DM1.555 and half a yen to Y98.7. The dollar opened in Tokyo at Y98.61 and DM1.5565. 'The Federal Reserve views these actions as necessary to keep inflation contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth,' the Fed said after its federal open markets committee, which sets interest rate policy, met yesterday. The move is the sixth interest rate increase this year, and takes the federal funds rate, which banks pay when they borrow from each other's reserves held at the Fed, to 5.5 per cent from 3.0 per cent at the beginning of the year. The discount rate, which banks pay for direct borrowings from the Fed, also started the year at 3 per cent but has risen only to 4.75 per cent. Many commercial banks immediately followed suit, lifting their prime rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.5 per cent. Financial market traders and economists have been beseeching the Fed to act decisively to slow economic activity. But the Fed has not moved rates by more than half a percentage point in either direction since 1981. When the FOMC last met in September, it decided to leave rates unchanged, in spite of the growing conviction of Wall Street economists that another move would be needed. Economic data available at the time of the September meeting showed that US gross domestic product had grown at a 3.8 per cent annualised pace in the second quarter, the unemployment rate had stabilised at 6.1 per cent and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity. Since then, second-quarter growth has been revised up to 4.1 per cent, with the third quarter still humming along at a 3.4 per cent rate; unemployment has dipped to 5.8 per cent and the NAPM index has risen sharply for the past two months. Industrial production figures yesterday added to the picture of 'persistent strength in economic activity and high and rising levels of resource utilisation'.

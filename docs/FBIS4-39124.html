			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] "I am in favor of economic union with Russia, on  which we depend so much for energy supplies and a market," the  presidential candidate and co-chairman of the Interregional  Reform Alliance Leonid Kuchma told a press conference in Odessa.    He said "the non-competitive production of Ukrainian  enterprises has so far found a market only in the eastern  republics of the former USSR." However, he said "Ukrainian  industry is in dire need of western technology, something which  Russia is unable to give us."    Kuchma was convinced that Ukraine needed a strong centrist  party for the Ukrainian president to lean on. "One possible  basis" was his own Interregional Reform Alliance, he said.    Kuchma believes that only well-versed economists could put  Ukraine's economic mess right. "I see no one to fit the bill  among potential future prime ministers," he said.    Regarding the situation in Crimea, Kuchma pointed out that  separatist moods on the peninsula could have been warned  earlier, without creating a precedent for their encouragement.  He said that the regions must be given broad economic stability  rather than political independence.    "The Black Sea Fleet is a constant source of tension in  Crimea," Kuchma commented. "The fleet must be leased in its  entirety to Russia and the proceeds used to buy Russian oil and  gas...Ukraine does not need such a huge or, for that matter,  decrepit fleet," the presidential candidate said.</p>

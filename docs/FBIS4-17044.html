			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Estonian Government gave authorities to deputy  chancellor of the Foreign Ministry Raul Malk to sign an  agreement between Estonia and Belarus on national minorities,  Reform Minister Liia Hanni told a press conference on Tuesday  [19 April].    Hanni said that the agreement will include both Estonian  nationals that live in Belarus and have Belarusian citizenship  and Belarusians that have Estonian citizenship. She said that  the reason the agreement had to be concluded was that there were  not enough Belarusians in Estonia to grant them rights according  to the law on cultural autonomy, which gives bigger minorities  in Estonia rights to found cultural organisations, open schools  etc.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL;  </P> <P> SEVERAL FIRMS TO BOOST THEIR SPENDING IN 1991  </P> <P> Several major oil company executives said Monday that they will boost 1991  spending, a move that is in keeping with recent industry trends and is not  influenced by the Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> The executives, in interviews at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum  Institute, said they are basing their plans for modest increases in spending  next year on expectations that oil prices will stabilize in the low  $20s-per-barrel range once the crisis is resolved.  </P> <P> Such prices would be higher than before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but lower than  they are now.  </P> <P> On Monday, crude oil for December delivery closed down $2.02 a barrel at $31.87  in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Although increased oil revenues have prompted some companies -- including  Unocal Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- to speed up drilling plans, executives said  their long-range strategies remained unaffected by the crisis, which has driven  prices as high as $40 in recent months.  </P> <P> "This is a long-term business, and you don't turn the money on because the oil  price spikes," said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp.  </P> <P> Although spending plans vary from company to company, many of the executives  said they would boost spending on exploration and production of oil,  particularly overseas. In refining and marketing, there is a complicating  factor as oil companies prepare their 1991 budgets: the unknown costs of  retrofitting refineries to meet requirements of the proposed federal clean air  act.  </P> <P> Rawl said Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, would probably spend a  little more than the $8.3 billion it expects to spend in 1990.  </P> <P> Exxon plans few changes in its current allocations, with about 20% to 25% of  the budget going to refining and marketing, 10% to chemicals and the rest to  exploration and production. About 65% of Exxon's exploration and production  budget is spent overseas, the rest in the United States.  </P> <P> As for the effects that the clean air act might have on spending, he said Exxon  had not placed a figure on it -- "but it's going to cost a lot."  </P> <P> No. 2 Mobil Corp. will spend more than $6 billion in 1990, considerably higher  than before, said Chairman Allen E. Murray, who also is API's board chairman.  </P> <P> "We have a very aggressive budget that we adopted for the year 1990, one of the  highest we've ever had, because we think things look good for the oil industry,  and the basics seem to be coming back into line," Murray said.  </P> <P> But for next year, he added, "if you're asking me if I'm suddenly going to set  our exploration people loose assuming (that the price of oil is $40 a barrel),  the answer is we are not."  </P> <P> Texaco Inc. plans to spend about $3.1 billion in 1991, an increase over 1990's  estimated $2.9 billion and 1989's $2.3 billion, said James W. Kinnear,  president and chief executive. About two-thirds of that will go to exploration  and production, he said. Texaco will spend another $600 million through  affiliated companies, he added.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp.'s 1990 capital spending will come in at $4 billion. Next year,  "it will be up a not-insignificant amount," said Chairman Kenneth T. Derr.  </P> <P> Much of the exploration and production money will go overseas, he said.  </P> <P> He estimated that the company also must spend more than $500 million in the  next five years just to meet initial requirements of the clean air act, though  he declined to guess total costs.  </P> <P> British Petroleum will increase capital expenditures "something more than  inflation" from current levels of about $6.5 billion worldwide, said James  Ross, president of subsidiary BP America Inc.  </P> <P> Ross expects spending in the United States, which is more than $2 billion a  year, to go up slightly next year.  </P> <P> At Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., "we're going to be drilling more  wells next year, so our spending will be up some," said Chairman Lodwrick M.  Cook.  </P> <P> He estimated that spending would increase to around $3.5 billion, with  expenditures heavily weighted to Arco's U.S. operations in Alaska and the lower  48 states.  </P> <P> Unocal Corp. will boost capital spending more than $1.1 billion above 1990's,  said Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier, who noted: "We have chosen to accelerate  our drilling program this year . . . that would have been in next year's  budget."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CRUDE PRICES  </P> <P> Daily close, December contract, light, sweet crude oil, price per 42-gallon  barrel.  </P> <P> Monday; $31.87, down $2.02  </P></p>

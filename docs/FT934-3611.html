			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: Picasso ballets in Paris - Dance It was Diaghilev who brought Picasso to the ballet stage, as he did so many more of the best painters of his time. No dance company today can boast such acumen. Only in France - with the visual wit and adventurousness of Roland Petit's troupes, and the proud record of Jean-Albert Cartier in finding artists to decorate works for his companies - has there been a readiness to let the painter's eye (rather than the designer's) show us something about ballet. The tried, the true, the predictably winsome and the sullenly grungey, make our dance-stages a dreary sight. How good, then, to see such performances as the Paris Opera Ballet's current Picasso et la danse, in which the eye is ravished, stimulated. Picasso made three great designs for Diaghilev (Parade, Le Tricorne, Pulcinella), married one of Diaghilev's dancers, and drew dancers for many years. His later involvement with ballet amounted to the provision of decorative accessories, beginning in 1924 with the two racing women who thunder across the painting La Course, which Diaghilev borrowed as a front-cloth for Le Train bleu, and including Picasso's suggestion that one of his war-time paintings (Candle and Mask) would serve well as a front-cloth for Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous of 1945. The Opera Ballet's Picasso tribute has been revived after its successful showing last season. It offers a reconstruction of Le Train bleu, with Nijinska's dances evoked as much as restored; a very fine staging of Le Rendezvous; and the sun-lit Andalucia of Tricorne. Le Train bleu, alas, stopped running years ago, and this capriccio about gaiety on a 1920s plage (it must be Eden Roc) is vivaciously dull. The central role of Le beau gosse was, in 1924, a picture of the beauty and physical daring of Anton Dolin. No-one today can capture the verve Dolin retained in even his late performances as a dancer. Without such central allure the staging is dutiful, spectral, unlikely. Yet Roland Petit's Le Rendezvous, which is quite as much a period-piece with its war's-end melancholy and existential disillusion, is tremendously alive. A Young Man finds death in the arms of the Most Beautiful Girl in the World, guided to her by the terrifying figure of destiny (a macabre top-hatted being, stupendously taken by Cyril Atanassoff). The setting is Brassai's photographs of Paris streets. The dance is as theatrically urgent as when we saw it in 1945, and last week-end's performers (Patrick Dupond as the Young Man; Marie-Claude Pietragalla as the Girl; Atanassoff as Destiny) were grandly alert to the choreography's dramatic pulse. It was an ideal revival. Tricorne is the only Spanish ballet in my experience that is authentically a ballet and authentically about Spain. It is well done at the Opera, and rather more alert in manner than last year. The designs and the de Falla score do a lot of the work nowadays - there is a tendency for companies to treat the piece as a glorious dress parade to a great score - but in Kader Belarbi the role of the Miller has a bold interpreter. He has both the youth and the vivid presence to make every moment count. The programme contains a photograph taken of the young Massine - he was 24 when he created the part - which tells everything of the dance's taut outlines. Belarbi, like last year's dazzling debutant in the role, Jose Martinez, gives it the right edge of sexual pride and rhythmic clarity. Throughout this programme the Opera's dancers were on best form. We have in the Palais Garnier a dance-house for Europe, and in its resident company a peerless troupe. Visiting the new Richelieu wing of the Grand Louvre - which is a triumph of design and restoration - the Barnes Collection at the Musee d'Orsay, and the Opera Bastille, I was struck again by the seriousness and generosity of France's patronage of the arts, and depressed even more by the mean-spirited inadequacies of our own national response. Gremlins in the machinery removed a paragraph from my Nutcracker notice in Friday's paper of the Perm Ballet's British debut in Northampton at the Derngate Theatre. With apologies to any puzzled readers, and to the Perm Ballet, the missing sentences are herewith restored. 'No less than six different stagings of The Nutcracker are threatened this year: the first outbreak, and I'd venture the most intriguing, is that on view at Northampton's Derngate Theatre. Derngate, lively in its programming, had scheduled a production from the Lille-based Ballet du Nord. That fell through, and with a nice turn of speed, the theatre engaged a Russian troupe, the Perm Ballet, never seen here before, albeit known and admired from European tours. Perm was Diaghilev's birthplace. More significantly, the Kirov Ballet was evacuated there when Leningrad was threatened with siege in 1941, and the Kirov's influence on the Perm troupe and school was to be profound and lasting. This first visit (until December 11 at the Derngate, Northampton) is welcome, and I hope a prelude to a more extended showing in future. The troupe - something after the size of Birmingham's Royal Ballet - is well mannered in technique, with a style that speaks clearly of Kirov example.'</p>

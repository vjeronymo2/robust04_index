			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UNAMIR commander General Romeo Dallaire by </F> correspondent Alain Frilet in Kigali on 24 June 94: "In Kigali,  `The Rwandan Patriotic Front Has Become a Little More Nervous'"]    [Text] The arrival of the first French contingents in  Rwanda within the framework of "Operation Turquoise" has led to  a large number of disruptions in the daily work of the Blue  Helmets belonging to UNAMIR (the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda). At the head of the UNAMIR since he arrived in Kigali  in October 1993, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire today expressed  his fears and doubts and gave a brief appraisal while awaiting  the reinforcements promised by UN headquarters in New York.    [Frilet] What have been the consequences of French  intervention in Rwanda for the UNAMIR forces?    [Dallaire] None so far, except that the Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) has become a little more nervous and is trying to  ascertain the impact that this intervention might have on its  own situation. As a result, it has reviewed its relations with  us and affirmed that it can no longer guarantee the safety of  the UNAMIR elements whose countries of origin announced that  they would contribute troops to the French initiative. That is  why I have withdrawn all the Senegalese, Congolese, and Togolese  military observers. Apart from that, the RPF has also affirmed  that since the announcement of French intervention, they would  no longer be able to guarantee the security of Kigali airport,  which is why we have so far been unable to reopen it.    [Frilet] Just recently, you would appear to have interrupted  quite a number of your observation missions in the capital. Is  this a direct consequence of "Operation Turquoise"?    [Dallaire] We have run up a delay over the past few days  because of the departure of the African contingents, and because  the new team designated to replace them has still not arrived.  Moreover, the delay in replenishing the logistics supplies of my  own force is also delaying and slowing down our operations.  Nonetheless, we are still carrying out our reconnaissance  missions in the capital and shall continue to distribute food.    [Frilet] Since Friday, you have set up a permanent telephone  link with the French commander in Zaire. What kind of relations  are you going to maintain with him?    [Dallaire] Let us rather say that I have his telephone  number. More seriously, my objective is to establish some form  of cooperation and coordination with the French commander in  accordance with the orders I have received from UN headquarters  in New York so that the two groups of staff can meet. This  meeting should take place within the next few days. We will  then discuss what we are thinking of doing, on both sides, and  see how we can best adapt to these new circumstances. On my  side there is not a great deal of adaptation to do. As soon as  I have the men and equipment, I shall continue to fulfill my  mission here in Kigali, and as far as I know the French should  be staying in the western part of the country.    [Frilet] Why has the arrival of the 5,500 men who are meant  to reinforce your own troops in Kigali been delayed?    [Dallaire] Perhaps Rwanda is regarded as a difficult country  when it comes to making commitments. The mission that we are  accomplishing is itself difficult, and we have still not secured  a cease-fire.</p>

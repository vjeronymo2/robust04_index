			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Green Property falls to IPounds 860,000 The timing of asset sales contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits at Green Property from IPounds 1.01m to IPounds 860,000 (Pounds 805,000) for the six months to June 30. However, net assets per share advanced from 181p to 194p over the six months, due mainly to the appreciation of sterling. Earnings per share were 3.77p (4.39p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 1.2p and the company expects that the full year payment will be at least maintained at 3.8p.</p>

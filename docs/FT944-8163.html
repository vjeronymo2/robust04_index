			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (32): Foreign travel is a national obsession - Germans abroad Not even recession can staunch German Wanderlust - and its concomitant drain on the balance of payments. Indeed, as recent experience has shown, the depression of holiday prices by international economic decline, coupled with the apparently unwavering strength of the D-Mark, actively encourages efforts to escape to the sun, writes CHRISTOPHER PARKES. Banks regularly issue exchange rate guides specifically aimed at trippers seeking the best value for their hard currency on quick getaway breaks. Popular newspapers printed excited reports during the summer when the Italian currency lost further ground and DM1 would buy L1,000 for the first time. Despite the domestic slump which has brought real income cuts, rising taxes and unemployment, German spending on foreign travel is forecast to increase around 3 per cent this year to some DM64bn (Dollars 41bn). Although this implies stagnation in real terms after a real 3 per cent increase in 1993, when set against falling expenditure on all other personal and household goods and services, it serves to underscore the strength of the national drive to get away. According to a new study by the Cologne-based IWD economics institute, the average west German family sets aside more than DM200 a month - almost a third of its leisure budget - for holidays. According to Dresdner Bank, a consumer poll in which people were asked which areas of spending they would find hardest to reduce found holidays ranked second only to the basics: food, rent and clothing. The vacation may be sacrosanct, but it is becoming a considerable burden on the balance of payments. While the national travel account has been in deficit for almost 40 years, the gap between German spending abroad and foreign travellers' spending in Germany has increased 50 per cent since unification. While travel expenditure has risen from DM47.5bn to DM64bn, revenue income has barely budged, increasing a mere DM1bn since 1990 to an estimated DM18bn this year. As a result, last year's travel balance was a record DM46bn in the red. The domestic industry has suffered from the effects of recession in neighbouring European countries as well as the daunting strength of the currency. Following a 10 per cent decline in 1993, the number of foreign guests staying in German hotels fell 3 per cent in the first half of this year. But the domestic industry's most enduring disadvantage, according to officials at the government-funded DZT tourism promotion authority, is lack of marketing effort. France, which arguably has more natural holiday appeal than Germany, spends four times as much on generic promotion than the DZT's DM52m budget allows. Austria spends DM20m a year. Earlier this year DZT's new management set about trying to correct 'false ideas' about Germany as a holiday destination, targeting young foreign travellers likely to be drawn by musical and other popular cultural attractions. As its researches had shown, the average age of vacationing visitors was 'well over 50,' according to marketing chief Ms Eva-Marie Sternagel. Surprisingly, however, Dresdner Bank data show that although revenue from foreign tourists in 1992 accounted for only 0.7 per cent of GDP, the absolute total of DM17.5bn was only a little behind that of Austria, and compared favourably with the UK's DM21bn. Meanwhile, the industry's potential in the former GDR is only just being tested. Despite the natural attractions of the Baltic coast, the relatively low population density and newly-accessible cultural centres such as Leipzig and Dresden, the region has attracted hardly any visitors from neighbouring eastern European countries. They prefer to spend their hard currency in locations more exotic than a former communist state. Westerners, too, have been deterred by the lack of relatively good quality accommodation and complaints of over-high prices are common. Although some 340,000 eastern jobs already depend directly or indirectly on tourism, the government estimates the industry needs a further DM6bn in private investment to raise hotel and guest-house bed density from its present level of around half that in the west. The heavy costs of rebuilding the basic infrastructure in the region, such as roads and railways, drains, water, power and telephone connections, has limited the volume of funds available for popular attractions such as sports and cultural facilities. Meanwhile, the local inhabitants are quickly developing their western cousins' taste for travel, but lower earning power tends to limit their range. Favoured destinations include western Germany, Austria, Spain and Switzerland. As in the west, the average-income, four-member family reserves 14 per cent of its disposable income for leisure activities - an average of DM554 a month. Little more than DM100 of this is set aside for holidays - just enough to cover the average German travel agent's price of a two-week foreign holiday for one.</p>

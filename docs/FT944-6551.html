			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / West and Russia press for ceasefire in Bihac The US, its European allies and Russia joined forces yesterday to press for a ceasefire in the Bosnian enclave of Bihac and a broader settlement in former Yugoslavia. Mediators from the five-nation contact group - comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - held secret talks with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. In a day of hectic diplomatic activity in former Yugoslavia, Washington and Brussels, the contact group also called for an immediate truce in Bihac and in Bosnia as a whole. The UN said last night that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, would meet Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, in Sarajevo tomorrow to urge an immediate ceasefire. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said Washington would 'seriously consider' any request for troops to help oversee withdrawal of UN peacekeepers from Bosnia but hoped no pull-out would be necessary. His comments were welcomed in Europe as a sign that the US administration, unlike Congress, remained sympathetic to its allies' concerns. In Bihac, blood-letting dragged on as two mortar rounds exploded within the notionally UN-protected 'safe area'. A man was killed. European Union foreign ministers rejected an attack by Mr Robert Dole, leader-elect of the Senate's Republican majority, on the stance of Britain and France. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said Mr Dole's comments - calling for an immediate UN pullout and arms deliveries to Bosnia - reflected a mistaken view on what outside forces could do to end the fighting. His comments were reinforced by Mr John Major, who dismissed a plea by Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, for military intervention or a lifting of the arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Dole said he hoped to narrow his differences with the UK in a trip to Europe starting today. 'Nato's inability to respond to a war of aggression on south-eastern Europe raises serious questions about Nato's future plans to expand to central and eastern Europe,' Mr Dole said. In spite of Mr Dole's weekend statements that the UN was in the way in Bosnia and blocking more robust action, the UN late yesterday rejected a Nato proposal to knock out the Bosnian Serbs' air defences, on the ground that that would be tantamount to war and would endanger UN troops, including 500 men already in some sort of detention. Mr Hurd, in a clear reference to US calls for tougher air action, said peace in the Bihac area 'will not be achieved by fostering illusions about what Nato air power can achieve'. British officials said contact group mediators were briefing Mr Milosevic on the group's latest ideas, reported to include further easing of sanctions on Serbia if he fully recognises Croatia. The group has also indicated that it will consider a 'special relationship' between Bosnian Serbs and Serbia if they accept the peace plan. The idea of 'confederal ties' between Bosnian Serbs and Belgrade was rejected by the Bosnian government. Diplomatic baggage Page 21 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

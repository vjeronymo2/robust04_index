			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: CP tries to get to grips with Laidlaw legacy - Canadian Pacific is taking a more forceful interest in its CDollars 500m investment ASK Bill Stinson what he thinks of Mr Michael De Groote and the response is unlikely to be flattering. Five years ago, Mr Stinson persuaded Canadian Pacific, the Montreal-based railway and energy conglomerate of which he is chairman, to spend more than CDollars 500m (USDollars 376.4m) for a controlling stake in Laidlaw, the North American waste services and schoolbus operator founded by Mr De Groote. The investment has proved to be a deep embarrassment both for CP and for Mr Stinson personally. CP's stake, which represents a 47 per cent voting interest, is now worth about one-third of the purchase price. CP also neglected to negotiate a non-compete agreement with Mr De Groote, who used some of the proceeds from the sale of his shares to start a waste-management company in competition with Laidlaw. CP has recently moved on several fronts to erase some of the De Groote legacy from Laidlaw. Apparently under pressure from his board to take a more active role at Laidlaw, Mr Stinson asked Mr Donald Jackson, the chief executive hired by Mr De Groote to succeed him, to resign. Mr Jackson has been replaced by Mr Jim Bullock, a Laidlaw non-executive director who was president of Cadillac Fairview, a prominent Toronto-based property developer. Laidlaw has also cleared the decks for the disposal or rationalisation of several businesses acquired during the helter-skelter period of growth under Mr De Groote. The company this week announced fourth-quarter write-downs totalling USDollars 349m, about two-thirds of which, or Dollars 244m, reflect the reduced value of its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the international security services and vehicle auction group, and its 35 per cent interest in Attwoods, the UK-based waste-management company. The write-downs drove Laidlaw to a loss of USDollars 292m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, in the fiscal year to August 31, compared with earnings of USDollars 132m, or 50 cents a share, in the previous year. Revenues rose to USDollars 1.99bn from USDollars 1.93bn. Laidlaw has been pondering the sale of its ADT stake for some time. The two companies have little in common. ADT's entrepreneurial chief executive, Mr Michael Ashcroft, would undoubtedly be glad to sever his links with a company which accused him three years ago of improper accounting practices. ADT's completion of a Dollars 1.2bn refinancing last summer means that Laidlaw now has little reason to delay the sale of its shares any longer. By signalling its willingness to sell, however, the Canadian company has driven ADT's share price down by a dollar on the New York Stock Exchange in the past week. As for Attwoods, its disposal this week of Mindis, a troubled Atlanta-based recycling company, has also paved the way for a new relationship with its biggest shareholder. The possibilities range from Laidlaw selling its Attwoods stake to some rationalisation of the two companies' activities. Much will depend on Mr Bullock's assessment of Laidlaw's own businesses, especially solid-waste disposal, which is also Attwoods' core activity. Mr Jackson had the misfortune to take the helm at Laidlaw in 1989, just as the North American economy peaked. 'You can blame him for not acting sooner on the problems, but you can't blame him for creating the problems,' says one US analyst. North American waste-management companies have been hit not only by the recession but also by such trends as recycling and tougher regulation of waste-disposal sites. Intense competition is reflected in plummeting landfill fees. Volumes and prices in the hazardous waste business have slipped even further in the past few months. The industry's over-capacity is reflected in hefty write-downs taken by several big companies in recent weeks. In spite of a Dollars 105m charge against its Canadian operations in the latest quarter, Laidlaw remains relatively strong in the North American hazardous waste sector. Unlike some of its competitors, which are burdened by big incinerators and landfill sites, Laidlaw has put most of its resources into a network of small service centres. Its solid-waste business is on a less secure footing, however. While operations in Canada are profitable, the US division has suffered from being too scattered. Even before Mr Bullock's arrival, senior management had drawn up plans for a rationalisation of the solid-waste division, involving several hundred million dollars. This week's moves suggest that the three senior Canadian Pacific managers on Laidlaw's board will take a more active role than they have in the past. When Laidlaw made a key strategic decision earlier this year to invest in a landfill business in Italy, CP, which has a reputation as a bureaucratic company, made its displeasure known only after the deal had gone through. The signs that CP is now taking a more forceful interest in its investment may also indicate, however, that it has not yet completed the job of erasing its unhappy experience. For the past year, Mr Stinson has described the Laidlaw stake as 'a portfolio investment' outside CP's main transport and energy interests. CP is understood to have held talks already with several prospective buyers, though all have so far proved abortive. CP values Laidlaw on its books at CDollars 13.50 a share, well above the market price of CDollars 7.63. One source familiar with CP predicts that 'if the stock ever gets close to the carrying value, they'll be gone.'</p>

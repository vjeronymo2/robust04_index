			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / GPA bankers in talks on new equity GPA Group's investment bankers recently approached the Kuwait Investment Office and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority about the placement of up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) new shares to plug the gap in the aircraft leasing group's finances. Discussions about the new shares centred on their being offered for sale at about Dollars 12 compared with a price range of Dollars 20 to Dollars 25 in last month's aborted Dollars 800m flotation. In the UK, a proposed two-for-one share split meant the shares were offered at between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12.50. At Dollars 12 a share on an unsplit basis the group would be valued at about Dollars 1.1bn. If the planned flotation had taken place, the group would have been valued at Dollars 2.4bn. In a separate development, Moody's, the credit rating agency, downgraded the long-term debt ratings of GPA's subsidiaries from Baa-1 to Baa-3 and the short-term commercial paper programme from Prime-2 to Prime-3. Discussions on raising new equity have provoked criticism from some GPA shareholders who are still bound to a 'lock-in' agreement signed before the ill-fated flotation. This obliges them to seek GPA's permission if they wish to sell more than 20 per cent of their stock for the next three months. Shareholders are irritated that while they are prevented from selling their shares, GPA's investment bankers have been talking to potential new investors. Nomura International, which acted as global co-ordinator to GPA in its failed flotation, said there had been talks with potential investors in the Gulf and nothing had yet been signed or agreed. GPA sought to distance itself from the move. It said: 'We have had an avalanche of advice from our advisers which we may or may not act upon.' It described the lock-in agreement as a 'technicality' and said the group would consider waiving the obligation when its board meets next Monday. However, the group did not want to 'give it up lightly'. GPA believes most of its institutional investors are relaxed with the lock-in agreement. It added: 'We have not been asked by any shareholders for permission to sell their shares. If it was asked for, it is likely that it would be granted.'</p>

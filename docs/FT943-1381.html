			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Apta Nursing in reverse takeover of Midland Assets Apta Nursing Services, which operates 13 nursing homes in the West Midlands and Berkshire, yesterday announced a reverse takeover of Midland Assets, the nursing home group. Midland conditionally agreed to acquire 39.7m ordinary shares and is raising Pounds 2.5m of new working capital by way of a 1 for 3 rights issue of 18.9m shares at 17p. The group, to be renamed Apta Healthcare, said it would use the capital to 'develop the business', including further acquisitions. The takeover increases the Apta's number of beds by 34 per cent to 628, rising to 898 by April 1996. Existing shareholders will be offered a bonus issue of warrants on a 4 for 5 basis, exercisable at 15p. Guinness Mahon has agreed to make a standby cash offer for 75 per cent of Midland holdings at 19p per share, including the forecast interim dividend, rights and warrants. Midland forecasts an interim dividend of 0.4p per share and a final of 0.5p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 are expected to be no less than Pounds 62,500 (nil). Apta's pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 are expected to be no less than Pounds 367,000 (Pounds 256,000). Midland's listing was suspended yesterday, with dealings expected to restart on October 18. The company was created in May to acquire four nursing homes from Northern Leisure for Pounds 1.9m. The new company's chairman will be Sir David Rowe-Ham, currently at Apta. Mr Trevor Price, chief executive, said the group's strategy would be to expand its activities in the sub-acute care sector, which commands high fees of up to Pounds 1,000 a week. The impact date is set for September 22, with an extraordinary meeting on October 14.</p>

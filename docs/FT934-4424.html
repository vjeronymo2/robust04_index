			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nissan to acquire rest of troubled Spanish offshoot Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, is to pay Pta9.38bn (Dollars 66.6m) to buy the outstanding 29.7 per cent minority shareholding in Nissan Motor Iberica, its Spanish subsidiary. Nissan said Nissan Europe was offering Pta260 per share for the 36.09m outstanding shares in NMISA. The shares last traded at Pta147 before they were suspended on November 18 and traded at an average price of Pta205 in the 30 days before the suspension. The shares have plunged in the last four months from a high for the year of Pta423 in August, as the company's losses have deepened. The share price peaked at Pta3,312 in September 1987. Nissan said the terms of the bid had been approved by the Spanish stock exchange commission. Nissan Motor Iberica has run up heavy losses in the last two years, which are forcing Nissan to undertake a radical financial restructuring in order to comply with Spanish corporate solvency law. Losses are expected to total around Pta40bn (Dollars 285m) in 1993, which will wipe out around two thirds of the company's share capital, reducing it from Pta60bn to around Pta20bn at the end of the year.</p>

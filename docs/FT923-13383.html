			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank keeps investors guessing The weakness of the dollar and concern about the German economy subdued European bourses last week, while South Africa and Mexico fell sharply on local issues, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index easier on the week. Some analysts note that they expect activity in Europe to remain dull ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank central council, at which it will review its monetary target for 1992. There are expectations that the Bundesbank will increase the minimum reserve requirements for German banks. Austria was Europe's weakest bourse after Thursday's sudden resignation of OMV's chairman, Mr Siegfried Meysel, and the announcement that the oil group expected to report first-half losses of some Sch500m (Dollars 47m). This news propelled the market to a low for the year. Only Norway managed to resist the downward trend, although there was no significant explanation. In its rec-ent review of the market, Kleinwort Benson notes that shipping rates could pick up towards the end of the year, helped by, among other factors, the larger than expected scrapping of old vessels and increased western demand for oil. The acquisition of a 54 per cent stake in Spain's largest cement manufacturer by Cemex, the Mexican cement company, was poorly received by foreign investors and the group saw its shares drop some 16 per cent. Latin American Securities comments that the negative reaction was partly due to the fact that Cemex intended to use cash from its recent equity issue to make new acquisitions rather than reduce its debt load. South Africa remained depressed by the uncertain political situation, while Malaysia was the only Pacific Rim market to rise. Rumours that Magnum, the Malaysian gaming operator, will be awarded lottery franchises in southern China helped to boost activity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change in              % change in local currency**        sterling** US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of    Start of                                          1992       1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        -3.89   -8.95   -21.39    -0.55     -2.48       +0.16 Belgium        -0.29   -1.45    -1.23    +1.84     +0.62       +3.34 Denmark        -0.77   -2.89   -18.04   -10.79    -10.98       -8.58 Finland        -0.09   -1.51   -20.75    +0.40     -1.55       +1.10 France         -1.36   -3.99    +7.21    +5.63     +5.60       +8.46 Germany        -0.74   -1.93    +1.78    +8.39     +7.06       +9.94 Ireland        -0.82   -4.27    -6.63    -7.31     -7.96       -5.48 Italy          -0.43   -6.93   -19.91   -10.45    -11.53       -9.14 Netherlands    -0.23   -4.35    +3.71    +7.05     +5.63       +8.48 Norway         +1.31   -9.97   -24.47    -4.03     -5.49       -2.94 Spain          -1.61   -5.70    -9.89    -4.60     -5.74       -3.20 Sweden         -1.53   -4.29   -14.54    +5.32     +4.97       +7.80 Switzerland    -1.12   -1.29    +9.16   +12.00     +8.98      +11.92 UK             -0.59   -4.96    -0.54    +0.29     +0.29       +2.99 EUROPE         -0.80   -4.16    -0.86    +2.32     +1.70       +4.44 Australia      -1.44   -1.16    +4.47    -1.64     -6.02       -3.48 Hong Kong      -1.54   +2.96   +54.23   +42.24    +39.28      +43.04 Japan          -0.69   -3.21   -28.28   -25.76    -27.98      -26.03 Malaysia       +2.65   +3.26    -2.34    +6.39    +12.69      +15.73 New Zealand    +0.66   +0.70    +1.89    -0.63     -2.20       +0.45 Singapore      -0.10   -3.51    +5.96    +0.30     -2.10       +0.55 Canada         +0.51   +0.18    -3.63    -2.74     -8.08       -5.61 USA            +0.62   +1.14   +10.92    -0.64     -3.26       -0.64 Mexico         -4.78  -12.56   +34.35    +2.31     -2.39       +0.25 South Africa   -4.61   -6.28    -0.94    +1.15    -20.22      -18.07 WORLD INDEX    -0.25   -1.62    -4.74    -7.08     -9.43       -6.98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on July 10th 1992.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and County NatWest Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hafnia files for bankruptcy with debts of DKr6.3bn HAFNIA Holding, which formerly controlled Denmark's second-largest insurance group, yesterday filed for bankruptcy with debts of about DKr6.3bn (Dollars 1.03bn), making it the country's biggest bankruptcy by a wide margin. The main creditors include Den Danske Bank, with a claim of DKr1.2bn, and Commerzbank of Germany with some DKr800m. The Danish savings bank Bikuben, Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, and the Netherlands' ABN Ambro Bank are each owed about DKr600m. Denmark's Unibank is owned DKr450m. Hafnia Holding went into payments suspension in August last year. Its equity capital was eliminated by the fall in the value of the group's shareholdings in rival Danish insurer Baltica and Skandia, the Swedish insurance company. Yesterday's decision to file for bankruptcy was taken by the committee of inspection appointed by the bankruptcy court last year. The committee concluded that there were no grounds for extending the payments suspension. Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman of Hafnia Holding, said yesterday that one reason why the group could not be reconstructed was the poor international reputation which the Nordic insurance industry has gained as a result of the collapse of the two big Danish insurance groups, Hafnia and Baltica, and Uni Storebrand in Norway. Hafnia has already sold most of its realisable assets, including its UK pension management company Prolific and its Danish insurance companies. The latter were acquired in March by Codan, the Danish insurance company which is controlled by Sun Alliance of the UK. Hafnia's remaining assets are a stake of just over 33 per cent in Baltica Holding and 13.8 per cent of Skandia. At the end of 1992 these shares had a value of about DKr2.5bn. The Baltica shares were acquired in 1990-91 in an attempt by Hafnia to gain control of Baltica, while the Skandia shares were acquired in late 1991 when Hafnia and Uni Storebrand launched an unsuccessful hostile bid for the Swedish company.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Science and Technology" section by Eduardo Gonzalez] </F>   [Text] Cuba has stood out in its participation in the 12  projects included in the program for the development of nuclear  science and technology in Latin America. Such were the remarks  of Dr. Daniel Cordorniu, vice secretary of the secretariat of  nuclear affairs, during a recent news conference.    Next week, a meeting will be held in Bogota, Colombia, by  the  regional cooperation agreement program [programa arreglos  regionales cooperativos] for the development of nuclear sciences  and technology in Latin America, in which our scientists will  play an important role.    The secretariat of nuclear affairs carries out hundreds of  projects for the use of these techniques in the diagnosis,  prevention, and healing of human and animal diseases, animal  nutrition and reproduction, the creation of new varieties of  useful plants, the rational use of fertilizers, the detection of  defects in construction, oil drilling and extraction, studies in  environmental contamination, nuclear safety, and many other  areas.    In November, our country will host two regional workshops on  advances in the use of nuclear energy, the development of  radiopharmaceuticals, and on the final meeting of the Latin  American project for the use of nuclear energy, which for five  years has given nations of the region access to advanced  technologies in this field.    Only four Latin American countries are pursuing research in  this field: Cuba, with almost 200 entities that use nuclear  techniques; Brazil; Chile; and Venezuela. It is for that reason  that, despite pressures and the Yankee blockade, our country was  welcomed into the Latin American section of the American Nuclear  Society, which in July will hold its annual meeting in  Argentina. This important meeting will include a roundtable in  which, for the first time, the situation of the nuclear power  plants in the region will be analyzed in a multilateral approach.    Dr. Daniel Cordorniu also announced that efforts are being  made to establish an economic association that will allow  resumption of the work at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant.</p>

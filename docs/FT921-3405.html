			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Opinion poll worries unsettle equities THE CURTAIN came down on a tension-filled week in London's equity market with share prices, not to mention marketmakers, looking completely washed out and hardly looking forward to a weekend which was rumoured to offer nothing more than an increased Labour lead in the latest opinion polls. A brief rally by share prices at the opening was quickly demolished by a decline in the Footsie future and sentiment thereafter was never better than fragile. At the close the Footsie was 17.3 off at 2,476.0, marginally above the day's low, 2,474,2, or some 19 points off, reached some twenty minutes before the market closed. Over the week the index showed a drop of 57.1, although this figure distorted the mood of the market; stripping out an aggregate gain of 41.7 points accrued before the chancellor of the exchequer delivered his Budget proposals on Tuesday afternoon the equity market has plunged almost 100 points with very few signs of any worthwhile support. There was no relief for equities from the foreign exchange markets where sterling remained under pressure and pre-Budget hopes of a reduction in UK interest had long disappeared. Gilts retreated afresh with the long-dated issues posting losses of over a half-point. The Footsie began the day some five points higher, with marketmakers expecting a technical rally. However, the futures market loomed large and began to retreat, unnerving dealers in equities, before trying to stabilise towards midday. A large sell programme also helped undermined sentiment. The afternoon session saw the future suddenly dip and move to a 17 point discount against fair value, and share prices ran back sharply to reach the day's lowest levels just before the close. A firm opening by Wall Street gave way as London closed, causing more unease. Dealers attributed the sudden downward lurch to rumours, thought to have originated in the foreign exchange markets, that the Sunday newspapers will reveal an opinion poll showing Labour ahead of the Tories by between 5 and 9 points. 'If the opinion poll stories are correct then the market is due another sharp fall on Monday, possibly in the region of 30 to 50 points,' said a senior marketmaker at one of the leading UK integrated securities houses. The big overseas earners provided a handful of good performances from the Footsie constituents with RTZ, Hanson and ICI commanding good support and substantially outpacing the market. Retail business in the equity market continued to rise this week as institutions began to alter their portfolios after the Budget proposals and ahead of the April 9 general election.</p>

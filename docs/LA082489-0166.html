			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> HERRMANN INSISTS HE'LL BE READY, BUT DILS MIGHT MAKE RETURN VISIT  </P> <P> Mark Herrmann isn't sure what the fuss is about. While the Rams were scrambling  to find a replacement for the backup quarterback, who cracked a rib in Monday  night's game, Herrmann spoke matter-of-factly about being in uniform for the  Sept. 10 opener in Atlanta.  </P> <P> "I'm real confident," he said Wednesday. "That's 2 1/2 weeks away. I think I  should be ready."  </P> <P> Taking no chances, the Rams put out an all-quarterbacks bulletin that included  a phone call to 33-year-old Steve Dils, who is selling commercial real estate  in Atlanta. Dils was a longtime backup with the Rams and knows the system. He  was released last fall, claimed on waivers by Atlanta but wasn't offered a  contract in 1989.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Dils was mulling over the proposition, which is basically this: take  a few snaps in practice for a couple weeks and be ready should Herrmann not be  available for Atlanta.  </P> <P> "The guy isn't coming in here to compete," Coach John Robinson said.  "Herrmann's the two. There's nobody that's going to come in and take his place.  You're buying insurance."  </P> <P> Dils is the logical short-term answer, should he wish to accept such a role. He  was supposed to get back to the Rams today with an answer.  </P> <P> Quarterback coach Dick Coury said it wouldn't take Dils long to get ready.  </P> <P> "We could hand him a playbook on the bus on the way to the game," Coury said.  "I think he could get in shape in about 10 minutes."  </P> <P> Herrmann's ribs, meanwhile, were feeling much better, he reported. He says he  could play in the Atlanta game at even less than 100%  </P> <P> "You can always wear protective padding," he said. "And there's not any  guarantee I'd be in the game anyway."  </P> <P> Alex Stewart, the former Cal State Fullerton Titan and eighth-round pick of the  Vikings, has a broken hand and won't make the trip west for Saturday night's  game against the Rams. The original break didn't set properly and surgery was  required. Stewart, a defensive end, had two pins inserted in the hand and is  wearing a cast extending to his elbow.  </P> <P> Minnesota Coach Jerry Burns said Stewart had been making progress, though not  enough.  </P> <P> "Right now we just have him in conditioning drills and things of that  consequence," Burns said, "but if he ever makes a decision to discipline  himself from a football standpoint and a personal standpoint he can play in the  league."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Receiver Mike Williams, the team's 10th-round pick, underwent arthroscopic  surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee. Williams is expected to be  out four to six weeks. . . . Steve Miles, a Rams' public relations assistant,  announced his resignation Wednesday and intends to explore other opportunities.  Miles had taken the job vacated by Doug Ward, who resigned last summer for  similar reasons. . . . Coach John Robinson said holdout first-pick Cleveland  Gary has greatly hurt his chances to contribute this season. "I think he can  contribute, but I think it would be in a selective role," Robinson said. "And  that role would expand as the season goes along. He's a real good player, no  question about it." . . . The Rams and Gary's agent are talking again but  remain more than a million dollars apart.. . . Mark Herrmann said he didn't  take offense to the third-quarter safety blitz by Phoenix safety Tim McDonald  that caused his injury. "They blitzed a lot in the first game we saw," Herrmann  said of the Cardinals' exhibition opener against Seattle. "They got  (quarterback) Jeff Kemp a number of times. That's part of the game. I can't  fault them for that." . . . Herrmann wasn't wearing a flak jacket at the time  of the hit, but plans to wear one from now on. . . . Safety James Washington  had his knee examined Wednesday but no damage was revealed.  </P></p>

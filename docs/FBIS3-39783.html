Elliasson, who supported a peaceful solution on the  Nagorno-Karabakh problem, took over the term chairmanship from  Italy.    Eliasson, before meeting with Cetin, said he came to Turkey  to exchange opinions with the concerned sides adding he will  later go to the region and meet with other sides.    He said defending the international community's and CSCE's  principles were very important and added that the  Nagorno-Karabakh problem should be solved in political ways.    Foreign Minister Cetin said most of the Azeri territory were  under Armenian occupation. `It is very diffucult to hold a peace  conference before this occupying attitude ends,' he added.    Cetin said Nagorno-Karabakh was Azeri territory and with the  CSCE resolutions this was once again confirmed.    Recalling that Turkey wanted Armenians to withdraw from the  Azeri territory soon the foreign minister said Turkey was ready  to do its best on the issue.    Eliasson will leave for Baku, where he will hold a series of  contacts with Azeri officials.    Turkey and Russia are active partners in the nine-nation  Minsk Group that is working to arrange an Armenian withdrawal  before an international conference can convene on the future of  the enclave.</p>

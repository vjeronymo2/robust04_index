			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs hit by worries over Offer Bearish rumours surrounding the regional electricity companies (Recs) sent shares across the sector sharply lower yesterday. Prominent among these was speculation that one of the sector's leading brokers was set to turn cautious on Monday. There was also talk that some Recs face losses from the decision last week by Offer, the industry regulator, to force National Power and PowerGen to peg electricity pool prices. Some companies are said to have tied themselves into contracts with the generators at the old rate and now face selling on the electricity at the new lower rate. According to the more pessimistic versions, one of the Recs faces losses up to Pounds 20m. However, most analysts were dismissive of the rumours, which have also been hotly denied by the companies, and point to regulatory concerns as the big negative factor hanging over the shares. The Recs face their own Offer review in the coming months and the intervention in the generating market has increased fears of new regulation in the supply side. Among those hurt by the rumours, Eastern slid 14 to 679p, Southern 12 to 674p and Northern 14 to 716p. Meanhwile, the big UK generators gained on continuing relief over last week's Offer ruling. SG Warburg said PowerGen and National Power offered the best dividend growth prospects in the sector. 'This and the new regulatory stability mean that the two stocks should be rated on an earnings and not a yield basis,' said analyst Mr Nick Pink. PowerGen shares gained 5 to 579p and National Power 3 to 502p.</p>

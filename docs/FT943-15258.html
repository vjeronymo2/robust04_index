			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Tough US line on Haiti Mr William Gray, President Bill Clinton's adviser on Haiti, yesterday said resolution of the republic's crisis had now become 'a vital interest' to the peace and stability of the western hemisphere. In an interview on ABC, Mr Gray gave a firm warning that the military dictatorship - from which 10,000 Haitians fled last week - would not be allowed to remain in power. To allow the return of a dictatorship in the 1990s 'sends the kind of signal to potential dictatorships in our hemisphere that cannot be tolerated because of the instability that it would cause,' he said. Administration officials interviewed yesterday had much the same message to deliver. Mr Gray, Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Leon Panetta, the newly appointed White House chief of staff, stressed the endorsement of US policy towards Haiti by the industrialised countries at the G7 summit, and US efforts to work with the United Nations, Organisation of American States and other Caribbean countries. Criticism of the policy's many incarnations, and the impact of sanctions on the poor, was met with scathing indictments of the 'illegal' regime in Haiti. Mr Gray's line was the toughest. He seemed to warn the Haitian military that its future rested on removal of the current leaders. 'Whether or not there is going to be any military in Haiti will depend on the behaviour of the coup leaders: whether they step down or they push the international community to ultimate options,' he said. He bluntly spelt out the US 'vital interest' in removing a regime committing human rights violations with 'thousands being killed and raped'.</p>

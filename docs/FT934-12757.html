			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Decline exposes frailty of earlier bull run IF IT takes so little to knock the wind out of the bond market's latest bull run, then how will the market react to some real evidence that the US economy is picking up momentum? That was the question left hanging in the air at the end of last week, as bond prices continued their week-long slide, and the yield on the 30-year long bond climbed back to nearly 6 per cent. There was precious little new information in the market to justify a 20 basis point rise in the yield on the long bond. The yield ended on Friday at 5.98 per cent, from 5.78 per cent (a record low) at the end of the previous week. The pain was felt across the yield curve: 10-year bond yields climbed 23 basis points, to 5.39 per cent, while the yield on the two-year note rose by some 13 basis points, to 3.9 per cent. Bullish data on inflation the week before had fuelled the latest run-up in bond prices, but it took little to prick the market's bubble of confidence. On Monday, JP Morgan said it was cutting its prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5 per cent. The move hardly seemed to pressage an immediate round of rate cuts by banks hungry to attract new loans. Morgan itself makes relatively few loans tied to prime, and other banks failed to respond to its lead. Still, the move was enough to raise the prospect of higher loan growth, one result of which would be that banks would slow their purchases of Treasury bonds. On Thursday and Friday, the bears had something firmer to bite on. The Philadelphia Fed's latest manufacturing index - not usually one of the bond market's most awaited pieces of data, to be sure - showed a sharp rise. A quarter of manufacturers questioned in the Fed survey said the general level of business activity had increased over the previous month, while only 9.9 per cent said it had fallen. This made a 'diffusion index' of 15.1, a sharp jump from 8.7 the previous month. The fall in bond prices on the data suggests the market expects the pick-up to be echoed in the more significant NAPM index, due a week today The Philadelphia Fed survey, though, also indicated little sign of inflationary pressure picking up. The diffusion index of prices paid by manufacturers was close to zero, while the index for prices received fell 11.5 (in other words, more people reported a fall in prices they could charge than a rise.) Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, ended a poor week for the bond market by announcing that the economic 'headwinds' which had checked growth had lessened. The implication: any chance of an easing of short-term interest rates, already a long shot, had become even more remote. The next fortnight will give the markets some more significant numbers against which to judge these straws in the wind. On Thursday, third-quarter GDP figures are widely expected to show an acceleration from the first and second quarters of the year (hardly surprising, given the weakness of those periods). Analysts forecast the figure at anywhere between 2.5 per cent and over 3 per cent, at an annualised rate, compared with the 1.9 per cent of the previous quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first three months of the year. Even that figure may understate the true increase in economic activity in many parts of the country: the summer's flooding in the Mid-West could have held back the growth rate by 0.5 per cent, according to one estimate. After last week's falls, the bond market seems to have braced itself for an acceleration in the growth numbers. The 30-year bond yield has held below 6 per cent pretty much consistently since the beginning of September, with the occasional slide towards the 5.5 per cent level at which many economists think it will trade in the medium term. It would take something significantly out of line with market expectations to push the yield out of this trading range and back above 6 per cent for a prolonged period.</p>

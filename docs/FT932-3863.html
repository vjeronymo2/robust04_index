			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Consumers assess cocoa pact plan INTERNATIONAL COCOA Organisation consumer members were yesterday assessing producers' ideas on a new international accord as both groups met separately in London, reports Reuter. Producers favour a pact based on a production and consumption policy, with controlled liquidation of the 232,000-tonne buffer stock. Consumers were surprised by the producers' proposal to liquidate the buffer stock, as that would seem certain to push prices even lower. But a producer delegate said: 'Producers see the fundamental situation continuing to move towards larger and larger deficits over the next few years and they would prefer to get it over and done with now'.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Tokyo surplus down again Japan's trade surplus continued its slow decline in September, for the second month running, with an unexpectedly large 4.6 per cent annualised fall, to Dollars 11.94bn (Pounds 77.2m). A strong growth in imports, sucked in by Japan's recovering economy, outweighed a rise in exports to the fast-developing markets of Asia and to a strong US economy. It brings the trade gap for the six months to the end of September to Dollars 59.38bn or 0.7 per cent less than the same period of 1993, the first such decline for 3 1/2 years. On a three-month sliding average, which shows a clearer trend for Japan's volatile surplus, the gap, at Dollars 9.4bn, is the lowest since January last year. The good news was partly undermined by a 13.2 per cent rise in Japan's trade surplus with the US, to Dollars 27.09bn in the six months to September, suggesting yesterday's figure will bring little relief to industry in the form of a weaker yen. Japan's exports to all destinations in the first six months of the fiscal year rose 8.3 per cent, while imports grew rather faster, by 12.7 per cent. Increased energy use during an unusually hot summer is one reason for the rise in imports. Another is strong growth in purchases of foreign food, drink, clothing, where the yen's strength has fed through to bargain prices. Three-quarters of export growth came from sales to other Asian countries, Japan's fastest growing market and investment destination, where the trade surplus rose to Dollars 31.4bn.</p>

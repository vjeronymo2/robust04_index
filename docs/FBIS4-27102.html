			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Obstruction to Replacement of Fuel Rods Denounced" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  refutes the slanders persistently hurled by seditious forces at  the refueling of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power  station of the DPRK.    The analyst says:    They are demanding the selected separation of fuel rods and  sampling. This is intended to invent a new pretext for claiming  credit for the inconsistency faked by them by forcing the DPRK  to fully implement the safeguards agreement, ignoring its unique  status.    We can never allow this under the present condition, no  matter what others say and what a counteraction they may take.    The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) have practically recognized the unique status of the DPRK  after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of its  withdrawal from the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. They  recognized it only yesterday and ignore it today, attempting to  reverse it. This is a shameless act of denying what they have  just said in order to attain their sinister aim.    It is utterly nonsensical to tell us to suspend the  refueling  of the reactor. We had frozen the operation of the graphite  moderated reactor, suffering enormous economic losses, in the  hope that the DPRK-U.S. agreement on its conversion into a light  water reactor would be implemented.    However, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks ended  abortive and the prospect of the implementation of the agreement  became dim owing to the perfidy of the United States. Under  this condition, we cannot allow ourselves to suffer unilateral  economic losses by freezing the operation of the graphite  moderated reactor.    And to tell us to stop the replacement of fuel rods halfway  is as good as urging us to reconcile ourselves to the danger of  radioactive leakage.    As regards the refueling of the reactor, we informed the  agency of it five times, urging it to be present on the scene  and take necessary measures including the removal of the seals.  The current refueling is taking place under the strict watch of  the inspection cameras installed by the agency and the fuel rods  are placed under the surveillance of the agency as soon as they  are taken out. Thus, the replacement of fuel rods is being  carried on from a fully justifiable position.    Nevertheless, they demand that we suspend the replacement of  fuel rods. This means that we should comply with their demand,  braving colossal economic losses and formidable danger. How can  we accept their demand?    The United States and the agency should feel themselves  responsible for the impasse where the solution of the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula has reached today and put their  heart and soul into its removal.    The most reasonable solution to the issue is to preserve all  the replaced fuel rods under the surveillance of the agency and  measure them when the nuclear problem is solved in a package  deal in the future. Then the nondivergence of the fuel rods  replaced this time for another purpose will be guaranteed and  the uprightness of our past nuclear activities be verified  through the measurement of all the fuel rods.    It is an arrogant stance to insist that anyone must accept  their demand, though wrong.    The international seditious forces must act reasonably,  clearly knowing that their untenable demand may lead the  situation to a more complicated phase.</p>

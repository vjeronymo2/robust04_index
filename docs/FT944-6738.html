			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (6): The programme gathers pace - Privatisation projects / telephone, power and shipping companies are being lined up for sale The beginning of the privatisation of Pakistan's telephone company, the PTC (Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation), this year, could well be the most important development in the country's four-year-old privatisation programme. So far, only small companies, making on average less than 2 per cent annual profits as a proportion of turnover, have been offered for sale. Following the sale of 65 such companies during the past four years, the government plans to transfer a further 30 companies to the private sector by next spring. The importance of the public sector in the economy is obvious. Large and small public sector companies account for about half of the manufacturing sector, virtually all power generation and transmission, and a substantial portion of banking. But the sale of the PTC marks the start of the sale of what many would regard as the 'family silver.' Other potentially lucrative enterprises be which may offered next year include portions of two large power companies, two gas companies, at least one public sector bank, a government-owned shipping company and even portions of the port. 'We are very much on a 'war footing' in the privatisation programme,' says Mr Naveed Qamar, chairman of the national privatisation commission. The offer of public sector utilities could be the most important step to liven up the effort, he says. Among new ideas to increase public interest in the offers, is scheme being considered by the government for registering a privatisation fund on Pakistani stock markets. This would comprise shares of state-owned companies, in which investors would be invited to buy shares through mutual funds. Despite Mr Qamar's confidence, and the novel concepts which are just being attempted, there are few clear indications as to how far the programme can be expected to succeed. The government is convinced, however, that Pakistan's public sector utilities can attract large investments from domestic and foreign investors. The PTC (Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation) - the government-owned telephone company which maintains an absolute monopoly, has alone been estimated to be worth up to USDollars 20bn. The thermal power generation units of the Water And Power Development Authority (Wapda) - the largest power company of those due to be sold, could be worth another USDollars 5bn, according to some estimates. However, those claims by no means give the final figure. In recent weeks, share prices in PTC have fallen, amid fresh selling pressures. The selling followed fears which had arisen over allegations that investors were not provided with accurate information when up to 6m shares were offered this summer, in the company's first public offer. Senior officials say that the ommission was merely an 'oversight' due more to inexperience than deliberate misinformation. However, that experience has alerted the government to the possibility of setbacks, unless future offers are planned properly, one official involved with the privatisation effort claims privately. Some investors are also concerned over the extent to which full financial details of the companies being offered would be made available. Mr Qamar is committed to providing full details on public sector organisations including the large banks, currently reeling under the pressure of extensive bad loans. The PTC and WAPDA are also faced with large scale liabilities. Clients owe more than Rs18bn (USDollars 580m) in unpaid bills to the two companies. The government has announced that it will introduce new laws, carrying stiff penalties for defaulters, but such measures still need to be enforced on a large scale to demonstrate that an extensive campaign to recover the money has prepared the ground to prevent further abuse of the companies. However, some businessmen are convinced that the most crucial need is to accelerate the pace of the programme. 'This process must be expedited because the longer these companies remain in the public sector, the longer will be the demand on the public exchequer,' says Mr Nisar Memon, Head of IBM's Pakistan operations and president of the influential Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) which represents foreign businesses in Pakistan. Mr Memon is also concerned that the country's bureaucracy is still not entirely in support, following years of official controls over lucrative corporations. But he is convinced that such resistance can be easily removed, if the government continues to press ahead aggressively. In spite of initial fears of resistance from unions, there are so far few signs of any labour unrest which could upset the government's plans. Workers have been assured of job protection for up to one year following privatisation. The government has also given a commitment of a 'golden handshake' or a large sum of money depending on an employee's length of service, if redundancies are necessary. However, Mr Memon wants to see new safeguards to prevent any social unrest such as might resulting from sharp price rises after privatisation of utilities. Mr Qamar says the government will set up price monitoring bodies before services are privatised, to protect consumer interests. However, many officials and businessmen say privately that price increases are inevitable, especially after years of subsidies to the public sector. The one important question is whether these price increases can be spread over a period of time to prevent discontent among consumers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A press communique sent to us last night by the  Presidency spokesman states that Romania's president,  acknowledging the communique issued by the Democratic Convention  of Romania [CDR] and the Democratic Party [PD], rejects --  because there is no basis for them -- the assertions that the  head of state's actions and statements are unworthy of the  presidential office and contradict the spirit of the  Constitution.    After describing as surprising the frivolity with which  representatives of certain parliamentary parties made such  assertions, which are, quote, offensive to the head of the state  as they lack any real foundation, unquote, the communique argues  -- using as evidence the transcription of the magnetic tape  recording of Ion Iliescu's statements during his visit to Satu  Mare in connection with nationalized housing -- that every time  Romania's president expressed his stance, he actually never did  anything but insist that the Constitution and laws of the  country need to be observed in such a controversial issue.  Besides, the aforementioned stances were expressed because of  the citizens' numerous grievances and complaints. They had been  cruelly dislodged from their residences on the basis of court  rulings, ignoring the law that stipulates that currently valid  rental contracts are automatically prolonged for the next five  years, until the legal status of nationalized housing is  regulated by law.    As a consequence of all this, states the presidential  spokesman's communique, there is nothing the president can  retract from the things he said during the meeting in the Satu  Mare County Prefect's office, in reply to a question he had been  asked. The communique concludes by saying that, quote, if that  answer, its context, and spirit are examined honestly, it  becomes obvious that those things asserted by the president  fully comply with the Constitution and with his resonsibilities  as guarantor of the observance of the Constitution's  stipulations, unquote.</p>

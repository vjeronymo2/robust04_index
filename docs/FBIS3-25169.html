This aggression, perpetrated by unidentified individuals,  took place at the southern entrance of the Bacongo area, one of  the areas most affected by fighting between militiamen of the  presidential group and the opposition in the past few months.    According to a military source, this attack "may have been  perpetrated by forces hostile to the return of calm in the  capital; but this will not jeopardize the ongoing peace process  engaged by the parliamentarians," with the signing of a  cease-fire accord on 30 January by deputies of both the  presidential group and the opposition.    This attack is the first violent incident recorded in the  southern areas of Brazzaville since the cease-fire is in force.</p>

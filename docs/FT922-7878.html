			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher to cite fears of federalism MRS Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, will today set out her fears over the European Community's institutions and moves to federalism in a speech her aides said should avoid an explicit intervention into Conservative MPs' rows over the Maastricht treaty. Underlining tensions over the Commons' debate on Maastricht next week, Mr Roger Knapman, Tory MP for Stroud, last night lost his job as unpaid parliamentary private secretary to defence minister Mr Archie Hamilton, after telling government whips he could not support the treaty. Such strict discipline before, rather than after, a vote is rare at Westminster. Mrs Thatcher's high-profile address in The Hague will include some praise for Mr John Major, and is expected to steer clear of direct references to his handling of the Maastricht deal. But she will be sharply critical of the federal ambitions of Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Ministers, however, will be braced for coded messages in Mrs Thatcher's words and for her stepping into the Conservative party's battles when she answers questions afterwards. Speaking in Munich yesterday, Mrs Thatcher said that the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe were part of a trend away from centralised bureaucracy and towards co-operation between national governments. 'It is for individual countries to decide what powers they cede to the (European) Community,' she said at a meeting of the International Securities Market Association. Her aides said that today's speech to the European Research Centre was 'not a parochial speech about Britain' but a 'thoughtful' consideration of Europe in a world context. She is expected to put particular emphasis on promoting economic prosperity through world trade. Mrs Thatcher will not shrink from renewing her traditional attack on the erosion of the sovereignty of national parliaments and on the aspirations of Mr Delors. Mr Major provided some encouragement to Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons yesterday by saying that Britain would not accept EC proposals to remove border controls under the single European market.</p>

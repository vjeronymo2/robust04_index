			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BET raises Pounds 39m from sale of three companies BET, the business services group, has sold Boulton &amp; Paul, the joinery company that has been running at an operating loss of more than Pounds 1m a month. The management, backed by Schroder Ventures, is paying Pounds 14.5m for the company, which has been severely hit by the deteriorating housing market over the past three years. Boulton &amp; Paul had become the most intractable problem for BET during its programme of divesting assets unrelated to the company's core operations. The offshoot was put up for sale in 1990, at the same time that BET offered Anglian, the double glazing company, for sale. Anglian was almost bought by management and has since returned to the market with a capital value of about Pounds 250m. However, in the 12 months to March this year, Boulton &amp; Paul's sales have shrunk to an estimated Pounds 70m, from Pounds 90.6m in the previous year, when losses were Pounds 9.5m after reorganisation costs. BET also announced yesterday the sale to management of Leada Acrow, the plant services company, for Pounds 8.5m and Initial Ireland, the textile services company, to Spring Grove Service for Pounds 3.5m. The group also realised Pounds 12.3m of capital employed in the businesses before they were sold. In total BET raised Pounds 39m in cash from the sales, but it has suffered a Pounds 31m shortfall over the book value of the assets. This is covered by the existing Pounds 90m provision BET set up when it began the disposal programme. Some Pounds 42m of this provision remains unused. Mr John Clark, chief executive, said the sales would increase group profitability and 'are an important step forward in the turnround of BET'. The sale of Boulton &amp; Paul will help the profit and loss account but may not be enough to save the final dividend. At the interim stage, Mr Clark said it was the group's 'current intention' to maintain the final 6.5p dividend. BET confirmed yesterday that remained the group's position. The sale of the loss-making UK companies will also help reduce the ACT problem which emerged at the half way stage. BET had to write off ACT because it was not making enough profit against which to offset it. Initial Ireland had sales of Pounds 9.2m in the year to March. BET said it has now completed its sales in the textile services area. Leada Acrow had sales of Pounds 11.3m.</p>

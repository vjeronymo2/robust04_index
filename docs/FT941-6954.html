			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / FT Guide to Personal Equity Plans - Single-Company PEPs (13): Not for the first-timer - Availability is different from suitability, observes Alison Smith. The tax benefit may not always be worth the additional risk for the small investor Is it worth putting all your eggs in one basket, even if the chancellor encourages you to do so? The chancellor's encouragement might in itself be enough to deter many people from any course of action, but in terms of the Inland Revenue, single-company Peps are a free gift, an added bonus. Apart from the general Pep tax allowance of Pounds 6,000, there is a special allowance of Pounds 3,000 plus charges if you invest in a Pep made up entirely of one company's shares. The idea was introduced by Norman Lamont in his 1991 budget, as another move in the government's campaign to create a nation of share-owners. They were devised primarily for employees who received shares through a share option scheme - giving them a perpetual tax shelter - but are available to anyone who chooses to take one out. Availability is different from suitability, however. There is a real question whether the extra tax benefit is worth the additional risk for the small investor of choosing just one company. Chase de Vere, the independent financial adviser which publishes an annual Pep guide, is not alone in believing that normally it is worth considering a single company Pep only if the general Pep tax allowance has been fully used. The process of taking out a single-company Pep can also involve more stages  -and more decisions - than might be expected. Someone working in a company and moving from an Inland Revenue-approved, all-employee share scheme can move their shares straight into an SCP, provided that this is done within 90 days of the shares emerging from the scheme. Qualifying new share issues, which are generally available, also allow any investor to transfer straight into a single-company Pep, as for a general Pep, provided they do so within 42 days of the allotment letter. But in all other cases, the procedure of turning one company's shares already held into an SCP is more complicated. The nearest equivalent is to sell an existing holding, put the proceeds into an SCP, and tell the investment manager to buy the same amount of of the same stock. Even this approach could leave the investor vulnerable to capital gains tax on the sale of the shares, as well as giving rise to dealing costs. Then there is the question of which type of SCP to choose, as well as which company. There are two broad varieties: those which are solely for one company; and those where either the investor or the investment manager decide which company to put the money into. Not all Pep plan providers offer all kinds of SCPs. Bradford &amp; Bingley building society, one of the leading independent Pep providers, for example, offers over 60 different single-company Peps, but for each of them just one company is specified, and there is no discretionary ability to switch. Then there is the question of charges. Many company schemes are cheaper than taking out an SCP through an independent Pep plan manager, though extra charges would be incurred by investors deciding after all that they did not want to hold a particular stock forever, and wanted to change to another company. Bradford &amp; Bingley has uniform fees for its single-company Peps. The initial charge is Pounds 15 plus value added tax, though in some cases this is paid by the company. Its annual charges are 0.5 per cent plus VAT, in some cases with a minimum of Pounds 5, and it makes no charge for early encashment. Though not quite the cheapest, at 0.25 per cent, its dealing charge is at the low end of the scale. Most independent Pep plan managers offering an SCP have front-end charges in the 0.5-1.5 per cent range, with an annual charge of 0.75-1.5 per cent thereafter. Dealing charges can rise to around 1.90 per cent. Single-company Peps where the fund manager chooses which stock to invest in can tend to be cheaper than those where the final decision is left to the investor, whatever the manager may advise. In the end, however, provided that the investment is in a stock where the yield is high enough to cover the charges, the decision whether to take out an SCP rests on broader issues than differences in percentage points on fees. 'SCPs are not for somebody who has decided to venture into the stock market this year for the first time and take out Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep,' says Brian Tora, of stockbrokers Greig Middleton. 'That amounts to putting one-third of your investment in a single company, which many investment managers say would be a high-risk strategy.' Robin Bloor, of Chase de Vere, takes a similar view. 'If you would not normally put Pounds 3,000 into a single company, there's no point in doing it just to be tax-free,' he says. Many investment managers would advise an investor not to have more than 10 per cent of a portfolio in any one company, suggesting that someone with investments of under Pounds 30,000 should perhaps be cautious about taking out an SCP. Others would put the case even more strongly, arguing that the real advantage of SCPs lies in the shelter from capital gains tax, perhaps implying a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 or more.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING WATER USE AND DWP LEAKS  </P> <P> I read with interest the article on DWP leaks (July 26). I discovered a similar  leak in my neighborhood a few days later.  </P> <P> I made at least four calls to the DWP "Trouble Board" to report this leak; I  never got through to anyone who could or would help. For all I know the leak is  still not fixed.  </P> <P> I am a water pipeline contractor and this type of incident always attracts my  attention. The answer to this problem is to have these breaks repaired by  private contractors.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Public Works has a list of contractors for  emergency repair work of sewer problems. I am on this list and I know it works.  We respond quickly to these problems and they are repaired for much less than  the city could afford to do it.  </P> <P> I strongly suggest that DWP officials explore the use of private contractors to  repair their system and also work on new installations. The work would get done  quicker and private contractors would cost the public much less money.  </P> <P> JOHN T. MALLOY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

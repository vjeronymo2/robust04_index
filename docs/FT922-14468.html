			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (5): Prices have plummeted - Personal Computers BUYING a small car five years ago cost less than buying a powerful personal computer with hard disc and laser printer. While car costs have risen significantly since then, PC prices have plummeted. They have fallen by up to 50 per cent in the last 12 months alone. One company that has profited from the price tumble is Apple Computer, which has finally resolved its customers' main criticism: that Apple PCs were too expensive. Now the Macintosh range starts at well under Pounds 1,000 and compares well on price with what Apple calls second-tier clones. By this, it does not mean expensive IBM and Compaq machines, the darlings of the corporate market, but the ASTs and Dells of the box buyers' world at Pounds 3,000-4,000. The reasons behind the collapse in PC prices are a complex mix of falling demand, falling component prices and fluctuating foreign exchanges. Advanced manufacturing techniques have also had their part to play in cutting costs. The squeeze has left the most basic 386SX-based machines from companies such as Opus costing about Pounds 1,200. Top of the range 486-based machines from Kyocera cost Pounds 6,000 or more. As PCs become commodity products, able to run any and all software, and as dealer margins become ever tighter, there is a clear move away from the traditional PC dealership, towards selling PCs direct to the user. Some companies, such as Dell, have been using direct sales - mail order - successfully for some time, throughout the recession. The search for new distribution channels is also an important facet of Apple Computer's strategy for the 1990s. The company is looking at new ways of extending its impact into the high street, away from its network of AppleCentres. 'We're certainly looking at the high street,' says Jan Edbrooke, Apple's product marketing manager for high volume and notebook products. 'You can see the names there for yourself. And while I can't comment on any specific retailer, because we're in negotiations with a number of them, we want to make sure that we are in places where people consider personal computer purchases.' The company is also looking to work with computer superstores, such as PC World in Croydon, which Apple believes will revolutionise PC sales in much the same way as Texas and B&amp;Q tackled the DIY market. ICL, the Fujitsu subsidiary, takes a Littlewoods approach to selling its PCs. It compiles a book or brochure which lists and illustrates its kit and publishes this to key buyers. The company has also budgeted for a Pounds 10m European launch of Nokia Data and ICL machines, at last unified after the takeover of the Finnish company last year. The tour kicks off this month with a separate Pounds 1.5m launch at the National Exhibition Centre, near Birmingham. ICL promises an 'earth-moving experience' for about 10,000 corporate buyers. John Arnell, ICL's business manager for personal systems, says volume shipments of the collection, based on Intel 80386SX and 80486SX-based machines, will start this month. Prices, without keyboard and monitor, run from Pounds 1,200 for a 20MHz CS386, to about Pounds 10,000 for a 33/50MHz Deskside MX486. The key question for ICL is how successful will the new systems be? On past performance it is difficult to believe that the wholesale acquisition of Nokia Data's ergonomic know-how or its manufacturing capacity is enough to revive ICL's reputation in the PC sphere. The company does, however, have a broad installed base of mid-range and mainframe systems, especially in local government, and there is little doubt that it has effective distribution channels. ICL's traditional 100-strong dealer base has been integrated quickly with Nokia's channels, so it will simply be a question of wait and see. For users, potentially the most rewarding aspects of PC vendor strategies are the various collaborations on the cards. With differentiation between product lines all but extinguished by the pressure to carve a slice of the commodity PC market, the only direction for the future can come from shared distribution channels or from shared research and development. On the distribution side, IBM is taking large numbers of portables from Zenith Data Systems, for instance, and is said to be talking to Olivetti about a similar distribution deal. In R&amp;D, IBM and Toshiba are already sharing the fruits of their joint liquid crystal display development programme, while Apple is talking to consumer electronics companies such as Sharp and Sony about its plans for 'personal digital assistants.' The most promising of the collaborations, however, are those from IBM and Apple, at last working together on a range of joint ventures. This surprising relationship between long-time rivals has yet to prove its worth in real terms, but the potential value to users of the venture is immense. It comes down to cost, connectivity and power. Already, the duo is working on linking IBM and Apple networks. Products are also released. These include a Token Ring adapter card that allows Macintoshes to run on 4Mbit and 16Mbit local area networks. Further nods in each other's directions include support for Apple's proprietary network AppleTalk on OS/2 servers as well as a new open systems environment called PowerOpen, intended to run IBM's Unix operating system, AIX, and Macintosh applications on the same machine. But perhaps the most exciting of all the IBM-Apple plans is the Kaleida venture, in which the strange bedfellows will develop and license video, sound and animation technologies for multi-media applications - expect to see a variety of cheap laptop and hand-held interactive devices by 1993. Almost every PC manufacturer is bandying the term around at present, but to many multimedia still seems like a technology looking for an application, rather like desktop publishing was, five years ago. A survey of 1,500 UK executives conducted by the British Institute of Management and Microsoft, the US software company, suggests that nine out of ten managers are still intimidated by personal computers. Add to this the speed with which technology advances and the changing nature of distribution channels, and corporate buyers face a complex gamble. How can they implement a sensible, long-term computing strategy, if the systems they choose today will be obsolete within 18 months? As always in the PC world, there are no easy answers.  ------------------------------------------------------------ WORLD MARKET FOR PORTABLE COMPUTERS  ------------------------------------------------------------ Forecast of unit shipments in thousands  ------------------------------------------------------------ Country/region          1991     1992     1993     1994 United States          1,313    1,687    2,022    2,284 Western Europe           973    1,309    1,620    1,883 Japan                  1,054    1,458    2,018    2,726 Rest of the world        522      711      912    1,136  ------------------------------------------------------------ WORLD TOTAL            3,862    5,165    6,572    8.029  ------------------------------------------------------------ Percentage growth rates for the figures above  ------------------------------------------------------------ United States             27       28       20       13 Western Europe            49       35       24       16 Japan                     41       38       38       35 Rest of the world         55       36       28       25  ------------------------------------------------------------ WORLD TOTAL               39       34       27       22  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: IDC  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Mellor weathers deluge of media criticism THE TUG-OF-WAR over the future of Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, remained as ferocious as ever last night - five days after the first revelations of his relationship with an actress. As several national newspapers pressed for his resignation, Mr John Major, the prime minister, again let it be known that his backing for his friend and colleague remained uninfluenced by a new deluge of 'revelations' in the popular press. Senior Conservatives believe, however, that the next few days may prove critical for the embattled minister. As one said last night: 'If there are no new developments, then he may be able to weather it. But he is not yet out of the woods.' The warning came as the first Conservative MP to call publicly for the minister's resignation emerged yesterday. Mrs Ann Winterton, MP for Congleton, told a BBC interviewer that Mr Mellor now had 'only one option'. Her argument was contradicted by at least one Tory backbencher who, while accepting that an MP's behaviour was of 'public interest', argued that the question was not a resignation matter. Elsewhere, Sir David English, the editor in chief of the Conservative-supporting Associated Newspapers group, said that the minister's position had become impossible. 'He has been moved from the minister of fun to a figure of fun, a figure of ridicule,' he said. In spite of the pressure, it was clear that several senior Conservatives, close to the prime minister, believe that the heritage secretary should and could brave out the storm. Increasingly the question has become a trial of strength between Fleet Street and Downing Street as the government has attempted to bring to an end a long history of resignations provoked by allegations of impropriety in ministers' private lives. The broadening of the controversy into a discussion of what is and is not an acceptable degree of press intrusion into politicians' personal lives has only hardened the stances of both sides. Most observers at Westminster believe that whatever happens to Mr Mellor, the row has postponed indefinitely any prospect of the government introducing new privacy legislation. The row has also unveiled the conservative nature of the British public. Commentators noted that in a BBC Radio 4 phone-in programme on Tuesday, a larger proportion of callers than might have been expected were highly critical of the minister's behaviour. That appeared to be confirmed yesterday by a telephone opinion poll conducted for ITV's Oracle teletext service. That showed 74 per cent of respondents arguing that Mr Mellor should be dismissed, against 26 per cent who thought he should stay. Tabloid newspapers have also consistently claimed that public opinion supports their detailed reporting of the relationship. In an interview in today's Independent newspaper Miss Antonia de Sancha, the actress with whom Mr Mellor is alleged to have had an affair, said she was considering legal action against newspapers which had told lies about her.</p>

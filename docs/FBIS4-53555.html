			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19, KYODO -- The House of Councillors  Budget Committee failed Thursday [19 May] to discuss a stopgap  supplementary budget for fiscal 1994 over an opposition demand  to summon a former attorney to a Buddhist lay group linked to  Komeito, a core party in the ruling coalition.    The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) demanded  that Masatomo Yamazaki, former attorney to Soka Gakkai, be  summoned as an unsworn witness in connection with his alleged  attempt to tap a telephone line at the House of Japanese  Communist Party Chairman Kenji Miyamoto.    Soka Gakkai is the primary support base for Komeito and  their  ties have often become the focus of disputes over the separation  of religion and politics stipulated in the Constitution.    The coalition urged the LDP to attend the committee session  on Friday to deliberate the 10.89 trillion yen stopgap  supplementary budget, which will extend for 40 days an original  50-day provisional budget worth 11.05 trillion yen that expires  Friday.    The LDP, however, declined because the coalition rejected  its  demand, parliamentary sources said.    The more powerful House of Representatives approved the  stopgap supplementary budget on Wednesday.    The rare supplement to a provisional budget, the first since  fiscal 1990, followed the continued political turmoil involving  the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the  selection as premier of Tsutomu Hata.    Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget  for  the 1994 fiscal year finally started Tuesday.</p>

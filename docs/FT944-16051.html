			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Latest figures stem pressure for rates rise: US inflation and output both ease off in September Inflation slowed in the US last month while industrial production flattened off, helping to reduce investors' expectations of an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. The consumer price index rose by 0.2 per cent last month after seasonal adjustments, the smallest monthly increase for four months, the Department of Labor said. Over the last 12 months the index has risen by 3 per cent, without adjustments, a fraction higher than August's inflation rate of 2.9 per cent. The core inflation index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also rose by 0.2 per cent in September and by 3 per cent over the last 12 months. Industrial production, meanwhile, remained flat in September, according to the Federal Reserve's own statistics, also published yesterday. Although production of business equipment increased - with much of the advance in computers and office equipment - output of consumer goods and construction materials fell. Flat output meant that US industry operated at 84.6 per cent of capacity in September, the Fed said, edging down from August's rate of 84.8 per cent and away from the 85 per cent level which some economists view as a rule-of-thumb indicator of capacity constraints and inflationary pressures. Both the inflation and industrial output statistics were somewhat lower than Wall Street economists had predicted, and confirmed a widespread impression that the US economy has slowed down from the breakneck pace of expansion it recorded in the second quarter, when gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 4.1 per cent, and that there are still no signs of rising inflation at the consumer level. The consensus forecast for third-quarter GDP collected this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators shows an annualised growth rate of 2.3 per cent. But some economists still believe third-quarter growth will have exceeded 3.0 per cent, a rate which could still cause the Fed to worry that the expansion is unsustainably fast. Retail sales statistics published yesterday by the Commerce Department showed somewhat faster growth than economists had predicted, advancing by 0.6 per cent in September, but this was not enough to alter the general impression of slowdown conveyed by the inflation and industrial production data. With few significant economic statistics due to be published next week, most Fed-watchers now expect no further increase in short-term interest rates before the next meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets Fed monetary policy, on November 15.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following talks between former U.S. President  Carter and North Korean President Kim Il-song, U.S. President  Clinton said that the United States would resume talks with  North Korea in connection the issue of North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear arms. In response, the Japanese  Government sees that "although it does not mean that the United  States has decided to disregard North Korea's past development  of nuclear weapons, the United States has lowered the hurdles of  the conditions for settling the issue" (according to a Foreign  Ministry source), thus analyzing that the U.S. Government has  taken a stalwart and hard-bred position -- showing a flexible  attitude while continuing to discuss sanctions. In this way the  Japanese Government welcomes such a move toward resuming talks  between the United States and North Korea. At the same time,  however, the government is still wondering what Pyongyang is  really thinking and believes talks would be tough, even if  resumed.    An announcement by Assistant Undersecretary of State (for  political and military affairs) Gallucci has drawn the attention  of the Japanese Government. He stated "the United States pays  attention to North Korea's readiness to return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to fully meet the requirements  of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards  agreement, including special inspections." Judging from his  statement, the government views that by using such a delicate  expression as "pay attention," the United States, while easing  conditions for resuming its talks with North Korea, has sent  North Korea the message that "Clinton's statement does not mean  disregarding the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons in the past."    Meanwhile, President Clinton's statement that "the United  States would resume high-level talks with North Korea if  Pyongyang is ready to freeze its nuclear program" has created a  stir in Japan, causing the view that "the United States might  ignore North Korea's development of nuclear weapons in the  past." In this connection, speaking at a press conference,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said: "We do not think  the United States only places emphasis on North Korea's future  nuclear development." Meanwhile, a top Foreign Ministry leader  said that "the U.S. Government statement does not mean it has  changed its position," thus ruling out the U.S. Government's  possible ignoring of North Korea's past nuclear development.  Underlying these officials' remarks is the fact that "ignoring  past nuclear development means that North Korea's nuclear threat  to the safety of Japan could not be removed" (according to the  Foreign Ministry source). It seems that the Japanese  Government, in fact, has a slight concern about the U.S.  statement because "there is a view within the U.S. Government  that shelving the issue of North Korea's past nuclear  development is inevitable" (according a Defense Agency source).</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Mubarak discerns 'ray of hope' after meeting Gadaffi for talks PRESIDENT Mubarak of Egypt emerged yesterday from talks in a tent near the Libyan-Egyptian border with Colonel Muammer Gadaffi and declared there was a 'ray of hope' for an end to the crisis between Libya and the west over the downing of two airliners. 'We are consulting with a lot of parties. We hope to find a way out to bring things back to normal,' Mr Mubarak told reporters, without elaborating. The talks took place inside a military airbase at Sidi Barani, 75 km east of the border town of Salloum. It was the Libyan leader's first high-level encounter with a fellow Arab ruler since United Nations sanctions, including an air and arms embargo, came into force last Wednesday. It was not immediately clear whether the meeting would yield any fresh ideas to resolve the crisis. In remarks to reporters, Mr Mubarak warned against a military solution, saying that such an approach would merely 'increase dangers and complicate matters'. 'I don't think there will be extra measures (against Libya) soon, but I hope that we could reach a solution before any extra measures,' he declared. Egypt's president has had a series of meetings with Col Gadaffi aimed at resolving the dispute over Libya's continued refusal to yield nationals suspected of involvement in the 1988 and 1989 bombings of American and French airliners. With more than 1m Egyptians working in Libya, Egypt fears that if the crisis continues to fester, open conflict might ensue, destabilising Libya in the process. Cairo has urged Libya to hand over the two men accused of bombing Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland for trial in either Britain or the US, but Tripoli after indicating that it might be prepared to do so has repeatedly balked at the last moment. Libya has also been resisting French attempts to gain access to four Libyans, including Col Gadaffi's brother-in-law, for questioning in connection with the blowing up of a French UTA flight over Niger.</p>

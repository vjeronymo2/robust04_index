			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jana Francikova: "The Grain Harvest Should Be </F> Higher This Year"]    [Text] Total grain production this year is expected to  amount to 7 million tons, which is approximately 400,000 tons  more than last year, HOSPODARSKE NOVINY was told by Jan Stehlik,  deputy minister of agriculture. According to current estimates,  areas sown to grain crops have increased by 70,000 hectares,  with the greatest expansion occurring in rye crops (increased by  more than 20 percent). Winter wheat areas (also used for food  purposes) have increased by approximately 2.6 percent over last  year. The average yield of grain crops is being estimated at a  level of 4.12 tons per hectare (as opposed to last year's 4.05  tons per hectare), in view of the improved status of winter  crops, compared with the comparable period of last year. The  attainment of the anticipated volume of the harvest is also  based on this year's better development of precipitation in the  winter months.    Imports of grain crops last year amounted to a total of  490,000 tons, which is approximately 350,000 tons more than was  the case in the previous period, noted Stehlik. Exports  (including transfers), on the other hand, declined from 493,000  tons in 1992 to last year's figure of 45,800 tons. "The  consequence of such low imports resulted in the overall decline  in the use of grain crops in this country by almost 10 percent,"  the deputy minister stressed. Last year, in terms of overall  consumption, reserves rose by approximately 288,000 tons--that  is, approximately to a level of 20 percent. "We are thus  reaching the optimum level--the low amount of reserves last year  was virtually critical," added Stehlik.</p>

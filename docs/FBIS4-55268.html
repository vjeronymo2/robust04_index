			<p>BFN     [Text] At its meeting yesterday, the Slovak Government  discussed and noted the report on the social situation in 1993.  The Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and Family provided us  today with information on this material. Marta Cierna comments:    [Cierna] The members of the Moravcik Cabinet had the  opportunity to acquaint themselves with the real social  situation last year. The report says that there was a further  decline in living standards in 1993. The worsening of living  standards manifested itself mainly in the continuing increase in  the cost of living, the reduction of the purchasing power of the  population, and rising unemployment.    The introduction of the new tax system, changes in the VAT  [value-added tax], and the devaluation of the currency also  affected the social situation. Therefore, although the overall  income of the population grew by 19 percent compared to 1992,  its real value fell by 2.6 percent. The average nominal income  was 5,310 korunas [Sk]; the average income of employees in the  private sector was Sk42 more. The cost of living, however, grew  much faster than incomes.    The social groups most affected were families with small  children, large families, and pensioners. The number of  families that asked municipal authorities for social  benefits--for example, the food allowance--went up by as much as  25 percent compared to 1992. The social situation affected  families with one or both unemployed parents in particular.  This was caused, apart from other things, by stricter  conditions for the payment of social benefits to the unemployed.    Regional differences in the rate of unemployment became  greater as unemployment grew. The number of long-term  unemployed went up as well. With regard to pensioners:  Although pensions went up twice in 1993, the first increase  beginning 1 March was only 3 percent, and the second, from 1  December, was 6 percent. The average pension was Sk2,367.  Although the state spent Sk2.7 billion more on pensions in 1993  than in 1992, pensioners' living standards declined  significantly.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dell stock hit by gloomy second-quarter forecast DELL Computer's share price fell sharply yesterday when the US personal computer manufacturer said it expected to report a loss for its second fiscal quarter after significant writedowns and restructuring charges. Dell said losses would be between Dollars 1.65 and Dollars 1.85 a share and it expected to record between Dollars 75m and Dollars 85m in pre-tax charges for the quarter, which ends August 1. The company added that the projected loss may place the company in default of the terms of its credit facilities. Dell has been a long-time favourite among Wall Street investors. It has grown rapidly to become the fifth-largest PC company in the world by pioneering direct marketing of PCs through mail and telephone sales. Its sales tripled over the past two years to Dollars 2bn in fiscal 1992. In early trading, Dell's share price dropped to Dollars 13 7/8 , a 2 1/2  year low. It regained some of its losses to trade at Dollars 15 7/8 at the close, down Dollars 3 3/8 from Tuesday's close and 68 per cent below its high of Dollars 49 7/8 reached in January. Dell said it expected to report revenues of between Dollars 710m and Dollars 730m for the second quarter, up by between 55 per cent and 60 per cent from the same period last year. Total revenues for fiscal 1993 would be about Dollars 3bn, it added. Dell's fast growth was at the root of its problems. Management controls had not kept pace with the rapid expansion of sales, the company said. However, analysts added that it faced credibility problems. In May, Dell reported a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, which it blamed on delays and cancellation of notebook computer products. At the time, analysts expressed concern that Dell's problems appeared to go beyond notebook computers. Yesterday, their fears were confirmed. Dell said that in addition to costs associated with delayed and cancelled notebook products, it would take restructuring charges. The group said it expected to resume its earnings growth by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. 'While the loss is certainly disappointing, we are determined to take the steps necessary to strengthen Dell for the future,' said Mr Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive. Dell said it was working with its lenders to revise the terms of its credit facilities. 'I am confident that we will be able to secure alternative financing or obtain a waiver,' said Mr Thomas Meredith, chief financial officer.</p>

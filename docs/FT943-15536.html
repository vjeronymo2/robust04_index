			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant demand helps Reg Vardy jump 92% Buoyant demand for new and used cars helped Reg Vardy, the multi-franchise motor retail group, to increase pre-tax profits by 92 per cent from Pounds 4.38m to Pounds 8.4m in the year to April 30. The company said yesterday resurgent sales of both volume and specialist vehicles had pushed turnover up from Pounds 205.2m to Pounds 298.2m. Mr Peter Vardy, chairman, said: 'Customers have been a bit more frisky. After three years in the doldrums, buyers are returning because prices and interest rates are low.' Those factors prompted a 58 per cent increase in total new vehicle sales to 11,268, while sales of used cars rose 27 per cent to 22,966. Forecasting a steady recovery in the motor retail trade, Mr Vardy pointed to increased gross profits of Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 5.95m) on new vehicles sales and Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 7.76m) on used cars. The figures were enhanced by improved profits in the after-sales division and contributions from seven dealers acquired during the year at a cost of Pounds 9.54m. Acquisitions injected Pounds 1.1m to operating profits ahead from Pounds 5.03m to Pounds 8.27m. The group also made an exceptional Pounds 1.07m profit on the sale of surplus land and Mr Vardy hinted at further disposals this year. Increased profits from both vehicle and property sales would, he predicted, enable the group to expand from its network of 28 dealerships to 40 within two years. 'We've promised to outperform our rivals in this sector, and that's what we've set out to do.' Earnings per share advanced to 12.9p (7.1p) and a final dividend of 3.2p makes a total of 4.6p (4.2p).</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Chicago looks to rolling contracts to gather investors THE rapid growth in global currency trading has been fuelled by the way corporate money managers use forwards, swaps, and options to manage the foreign exchange risks of their overseas operations. One of the early arrivals on the currency derivatives scene was the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It introduced currency futures in 1972, and later added options on all of its futures contracts. Though first out of the blocks, the contracts never really moved into the mainstream of foreign exchange trading. They proved too small to serve the largest bank and corporate traders cost-effectively and they lacked the flexibility of the tailored transactions available in the interbank market. As over-the-counter derivatives exploded, the CME's share of the Dollars 1,000bn-a-day forex market shrank. Traders estimate daily turnover in CME futures and options comprises only 1 per cent of the world foreign exchange market, compared with 5 per cent a few years ago. Distressed at being bypassed, the exchange developed a product that simulates spot-market forward trading, and companion short-dated currency options. The exchange was careful to market the integrity of its clearing house and the new products, playing on concerns that pricing formulas for over-the-counter currency options leave some dealing banks overexposed should volatility rates in foreign exchange markets rise unexpectedly. CME clearing house guarantees will likely attract second- and third-tier banks that do not want to over-extend their credit lines at the larger banks, and who want to avoid counterparty risk, said Mr David DeRose, a trader with Swiss Bank Corporation. The CME's rolling spot contracts, as they are called, address some defects in existing products. They will be offered in larger denominations than the CME's current futures and will not require the daily settlement, and associated costs, of spot market rollovers. The first of the new products, rolling spot futures and options on sterling, will be launched on June 15. The contracts, denominated in 250,000 units, are sized for institutional trades. Rolling spot futures in other currencies, including D-Marks, will follow later this year. They will be offered on Globex, the overnight electronic trading system, as well as on the trading floor. Most foreign exchange traders do not want to take delivery of the actual currency, so they customarily roll the postions, netting the applicable cash flow. While often highly customised, these rollovers can incur significant operational and transactional expense. The CME product will automatically roll over each day until the trader offsets the transaction or accepts delivery. The exchange will calculate the roll rate each day at approximately 5.30 pm London time, leaving the remainder of the Chicago session for decisions on whether to roll or exit a position. The roll rate is based on a survey of spot market prices. The contract will be netted or debited in cash each day according to the published rate. Traders who wish to take delivery before a contract expires can arrange an 'exchange for physical', or EFP, which swaps the futures position for a cash position. While the exchange is marketing the products as a 'better mousetrap,' no one expects them to overwhelm the spot market. As with any product, liquidity is crucial to trading, and the bank-traded foreign exchange markets are the most liquid in the world. Diverting trades to the new Chicago arena will be difficult, at best. Because it is an exchange, the CME cannot customise products. Rolling spot futures will replace only the most generic or 'plain vanilla' spot transactions. And, because the CME is a licensed exchange and subject to tight federal oversight, the paperwork required to track trades could discourage participation. Exchange officials recognise this, and have taken the unusual step of applying for exemption from Commodity Futures Trading Commission supervision for the rolling spot futures and options. It is the first time a US exchange has sought such an exemption since the new US futures oversight law became effective this year.</p>

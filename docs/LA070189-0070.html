			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDS OF TIME TURN UNKIND IN TINY BARBUDA  </P> <P> This languid tropical island with its miles of powder-white beaches and rare  wildlife is verging on devastation from, among other things, the wholesale  removal of its fine-grained sand, which is being shipped away by the barge-load  for construction projects elsewhere in the Caribbean.  </P> <P> Even if Barbuda doesn't disappear grain by grain over the horizon, it may be  paved over by resort hotel developers or overrun by diseased lions and llamas,  according to protesting leaders of the island's tiny but vocal population. The  people are demanding veto power over the pell-mell development.  </P> <P> As a result of political domination by outsiders and growing encroachment on  their land -- such as the island's newest unwanted development as a quarantine  base for zoo-bound wild animals -- Barbuda has become the only freed former  slave colony on Earth that wants to scrap independence and return to British  colonial rule.  </P> <P> "We're fighting for our survival," said Hilbourne Frank, a soft-spoken,  57-year-old former schoolteacher who represents Barbuda in the Parliament of  Antigua and Barbuda. The Parliament governs a national union of two neighboring  islands forced upon the reluctant Barbudans when Antigua was granted  independence from Britain eight years ago.  </P> <P> At times, the fight for survival has been fierce.  </P> <P> On the Thursday before Easter, most of Barbuda's roughly 1,500 people rallied  like a small, unarmed army on the island's only wharf to prevent the American  manager of the new quarantine center from landing a shipload of Chilean llamas.  The quarantine enterprise hopes to profit from keeping the animals -- and other  zoo-bound creatures -- on isolated Barbuda long enough to certify them as  disease-free before shipping them on to the United States.  </P> <P> Defying a special contingent of Antiguan police, the Barbudans camped out on  the wharf until daybreak of Good Friday, when, to triumphant jeers and cheers,  the frustrated ship captain retreated with his unwelcome cargo still aboard.  </P> <P> Days later, the 268 llamas were put ashore on a tiny, almost barren,  uninhabited island off the east coast of Antigua.  </P> <P> "America has 3 million square miles of land, and it doesn't let in sick lions  and llamas," complained Freeston Thomas, 38, a local builder and former member  of the once-autonomous but now-powerless Barbuda Council. "We have only 62  square miles. Do you think we need those animals here?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Worse Than South Africa'  </P> <P> "What they're doing to us is an outrage, worse than South Africa," the island's  74-year-old resident philosopher, McChesney George, said, leaning across the  counter of his general store.  </P> <P> "When I was a child no one interfered with us," he continued. "Antiguans had to  have special permits to come here, and no Antiguan government could make laws  affecting Barbuda. We didn't need a union with Antigua. We were already free.  But since independence, everything Antigua has done has taken our rights away  from us."  </P> <P> Barbuda's deep-seated hostility toward Antigua, a fast-growing tourist country  where the English-style Parliament and government are dominated by the rich,  development-minded family of Prime Minister Vere C. Bird, dates back three  centuries to the days of slavery. Relatively fertile Antigua was then a British  colony. Scrubby, arid Barbuda, 26 miles to the north, was a private estate,  leased from the Crown by an Antiguan English family named Codrington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Paths  </P> <P> Because of the sharp physical differences between the islands, the slaves on  Antigua and Barbuda took different paths of development from the start.  Antiguans became field workers on the 108-square-mile island's fertile  plantations. Barbudans became fishermen, woodworkers, weavers and boat-builders  because their scrubby land could support only garden plots and grazing.  </P> <P> According to historians, the Barbudans also developed a far greater degree of  independence, asserting their right to roam the island at will and use freely  what they still consider its communal land. In return, according to island  story-tellers, the English leaseholders used Barbuda as a selective "breeding"  colony for slaves.  </P> <P> "Basically, it was a stud farm breeding the tallest people in the world," said  Thomas, who acknowledged he was speaking from island lore, not from documented  history, which is cloudy on the question. "People here used to start at 6 feet  2 and go up from there."  </P> <P> As Britain's colonial empire began to break up after World War II, the first  step toward decolonization cast the island as an Antiguan dependency with no  direct rights of its own. The sturdy independence of the Barbudans flared into  open revolt against Antigua. The Barbudans protested, demanding to be made a  ward of the Crown. Britain refused.  </P> <P> In 1981, when Britain lumped Antigua and Barbuda together as a single, fully  independent Commonwealth nation, the Barbudans sought to secede, either to make  their own way as the tiniest micro-state in the Western Hemisphere or to  snuggle back under the protective wing of Whitehall, which again refused.  </P> <P> Some of the island's leaders even appealed for adoption by the United States or  Canada.  </P> <P> "Tell the Americans to send us about 5,000 troops to help us out," resident  philosopher George said with a smile.  </P> <P> "We are living in fear that the Antigua government at any moment will tread all  over our rights," said Frank, whose election to Parliament this year broke the  uninterrupted incumbency of wealthy, pro-Antigua businessman Eric Burton. "We'd  rather secede in order to live in peace than have them walk all over us."  </P> <P> Frank and the 11-member Barbuda Council, represented by a London lawyer, have  sued the government to establish both their historic communal rights to the  land and their rights to control the mining of Barbuda's especially fine  construction sand, which is highly prized by builders as concrete mix. The  lawsuits would also establish the council's right to veto unwanted land use  such as the animal quarantine center and future resort projects.  </P> <P> The sand mine -- actually an ever-widening open pit literally a stone's throw  from a beach as flawless as Robinson Crusoe's -- is the council's main concern  because it not only represents an ecological disaster in the making but is  robbing the island of one of its few financial resources.  </P> <P> "We are being ripped off on the sand," said an indignant Frank. "We're getting  about $2,000 a barge-load, and the owners of the operation are selling it in  Guadaloupe for $28,000 a barge-load. They get even more on some of the other  islands."  </P> <P> George complained: "We asked the (Antiguan) government to make them stop  shipping our sand, but Prime Minister Bird intervened and let them keep  shipping it."  </P> <P> Bird's son, Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird, was until recently one of the  owners of the sand-mining company, along with two other Antiguan Cabinet  ministers and an American manager, Dave Strickland, who also runs the so-far  empty quarantine station. In a recent interview, the younger Bird, who also has  been accused of planning to exploit Barbuda as a toxic dump, dismissed the  Barbudans' complaints.  </P> <P> "The whole question comes from certain people at the top forming suspicions  that the Antigua government wants to take away their lands," he said, ignoring  the reality of Barbudan land literally leaving the island by the barge-load.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Other Incidents  </P> <P> The Antiguan prime minister fueled Barbudan hostility at least twice previously  when he boosted two other private attempts to take over major chunks of the  island. One was by fugitive American financier Robert Vesco, who dropped the  effort and fled Antigua when his scheme was publicized in 1982. The other,  during the same time period but unrelated to Vesco, was an unsuccessful attempt  by an international group called the Sovereign Order of New Aragon to set up on  Barbuda with sovereign territorial status.  </P> <P> Bird's involvement with the sand mine has been even more abrasive, according to  the Barbudans. Aside from the loss of revenue, Frank said, the sand pit is an  environmental threat because it is situated on top of the island's best  freshwater aquifer.  </P> <P> "They've been digging down to water level for five years," he said. "If they  keep going that deep, the water will be polluted by a lower layer of saline  water."  </P> <P> The sand pit also has obliterated a wide area of scrubby vegetation favored by  the island's wild pigs and deer, as well as a sisal farm that Frank said was  one of Barbuda's chief economic resources. Sisal is used for rugs and a number  of hand-woven products the islanders make.  </P> <P> Not far away is a burgeoning beachfront hotel construction project called the  K-Club, owned by Italian businessman Aldo Pinto and his dress-designer wife,  Mariuccia (Krizia) Mandelli. When finished this fall, it will become one of the  Caribbean's richest resorts, with daily rates for two persons scheduled to be  as high as $1,500. The only other substantial hotel on the island is the  remotely situated, 20-year-old Coco Point Lodge, a quiet luxury resort with its  own airstrip almost adjoining the K-Club property.  </P> <P> Although the sprawling new hotel's dozens of luxury villas have gone up without  their explicit approval, most Barbudans accept the new Italian project as  beneficial. Like Coco Point, the new hotel will provide some local employment,  even though it will import outsiders for skilled jobs. But the Barbudans want  the right to control future resort development and to prevent it altogether  when construction threatens the island's delicate ecological balance or when  imported workers threaten to outnumber natives.  </P> <P> Their worst fears may already be close to nightmare proportions, said Frank, as  the result of an ambitious proposal by a group of speculators including the  Florida treasure hunter, Mel Fisher.  </P> <P> According to a recent article in the New Yorker magazine, the Fisher group,  apparently dealing through the Birds, has acquired a 99-year-lease on 654 acres  north of Codrington. The magazine said the plans include a 400-unit condo-hotel  and another "luxury hotel" that will include "a cosmetology center, a  hyperbaric treatment center, a biomedical clinic and a longevity center," as  well as a golf course, an underwater restaurant-observatory and excursions to  salvageable shipwrecks on the Barbuda reefs.  </P> <P> Aside from the simple threats of bigness and environmental damage above and  below the water, the Fisher development will almost surround a rare bird  rookery. The sanctuary is a mangrove-surrounded lagoon where hundreds of giant  frigate birds nest every winter, so gentle and unaccustomed to predators that  bird lovers can approach within a few feet of them. Only the frigate bird  rookery on the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador is as accessible.  </P> <P> "Their only threat is too much development," said Karlin Koepcke, one of two  young American women monitoring the nests of the 2,500 breeding frigate-bird  couples under a grant from the National Geographic. "So far, they're still OK,  but a hotel out there could ruin it."  </P> <P> "Secession looks like our best way out," said Henry Hopkins, 69, who manages  Codrington's small, macadam-strip airport and wants to see more development if  it is carefully placed and controlled by Barbudans. "We need the development to  lure back some of our young people who have moved away because there isn't  enough for them to do here."  </P> <P> About twice as many Barbudans live in New York as in Barbuda, Frank said.  </P> <P> But perhaps mindful that he is outnumbered by Antiguans 16 to 1 in the 17-seat  Parliament, Frank's once-strident stand for secession has softened compared to  that of Hopkins and other island elders.  </P> <P> "We'll be starting from scratch now (in Parliament) trying to find out what is  the attitude of the Antigua government towards Barbuda," he said. "I'm not  pressing to secede at this moment. I'm pressing to establish our political  relationship to Antigua and to establish the fact that we have the right to  secede if we want to."  </P> <P> George, who said he does not believe Frank will win a clarification of Barbudan  rights from the Antiguan Parliament, said with a sigh:  </P> <P> "They take the sand and give us what they like. Barbuda doesn't belong to us  now."  </P></p>

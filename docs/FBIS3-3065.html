			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 11 March, at the group discussion of Shandong  deputation to the second session of the eighth National People's  Congress [NPC], Jiang Chunyun, member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Shandong  Provincial Party Committee, said: The tasks we face this year  are extremely heavy and arduous. We must have a good command of  the overall situation, give prominence to focal points, and  actually grasp well the three major events of reform,  development, and stability to consolidate and develop the  excellent situation.    Shandong deputation to the second session of the eighth NPC  discussed and examined in eight groups the government work  report made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the State Council.  They unanimously expressed agreement and support to the report.    In his speech to the group discussion, Jiang Chunyun  emphatically dwelt on his opinions on the three major events of  reform, development, and stability in line with Premier Li  Peng's report and with Shandong's realities. Jiang Chunyun  pointed out: We should go all out to carry out reform to tide  over the barrier of reform. This year's reform is unprecedented  in its scale, scope, depth, and difficulty. We should  concentrate our energies on studying, promoting, and achieving  success in reform. The reform of large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises should be regarded as the most important  task. He said: To ensure the smooth progress of all reform  measures, we must firmly embrace the overall concept, correctly  handle the relations between the whole and the part and between  the immediate interest and the long-term interest, consciously  safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council, and maintain unanimity with the central  authorities. We must fully mobilize and exploit the initiative  and creativity of the broad masses of the people. Also, we must  seek unity of understanding, clear the people from doubts and  misgivings, and make concerted efforts to resolve the most  difficult problems of reform this year.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: In accelerating development, we must  focus on improving quality and efficiency. In guiding ideology,  we should define the following several issues: First, we should  effect an improvement in both quantity and quality. Without the  improvement in quantity, we will be unable to meet the  increasingly expanded market demands; and without the  improvement in quality, the improvement in quantity will be  restricted. Under the condition of the market economy, we must  win victory through quality and new products. Second, we should  not only maintain a relatively high growth rate but also pay  attention to improving economic efficiency. We should truly  shift economic work to improving economic efficiency. Third, we  should not only develop the processing industry but also  strengthen basic industries. In macroeconomy, we should give  both guarantee and pressure on the processing industry and  initiate the deep processing of precision products. At the same  time, we should exert great efforts in developing agriculture to  ensure the steady increase in output of grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops. We should pay attention to building such  basic facilities as traffic and communications facilities and  building energy resources and major raw materials projects in  order to lay a solid foundation for increasing the momentum for  further development. Fourth, we should not only pay attention  to expanding the scale of production but also pay attention to  carrying out technological transformation among old enterprises.  Fifth, we should not only attach importance to the materials  input but also strengthen scientific and technological input and  development of intellectual resources. In policy and input, we  should give special treatment to science, technology, and  education to promote the great development of scientific,  technological, and educational undertakings. Sixth, we should  not only pay attention to production but also strive to expand  markets, both domestic and international markets.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform and development must be  guaranteed by social and political stability. We should adopt  powerful and effective measures to maintain social stability in  order to create a fine environment for reform and development  and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist modernization  drive.</p>

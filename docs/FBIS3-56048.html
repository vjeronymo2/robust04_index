			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- On the eve of Russian  Press Day, the government took steps to alleviate the worsening  financial situation of the printed mass media. In particular,  the government ordered a halt to the implementation of its own  order issued on 25 November, "On the reassessment of the fixed  assets of enterprises and organizations," in as much as the  order concerns printing plants. In addition, instructions have  been sent to federal ministries and departments with the aim of  resolving the press's economic problems.    The 25 November order upset Russian journalists and editors  because it led to an immediate sixfold raise in printing costs.    In particular, the Russian Federation Press Committee was  given a month to draft proposals containing tax breaks for  papers and journals, and children's, academic, and other  socially significant literature. The committee must also  prepare proposals on state subsidies for the printed mass media.    Another order instructs the Press Committee, the State  Property Committee, and other involved departments to present to  the government within two months proposals on the means of  privatising printing plants with the participation of editorial  and book publishing staff.    The November order on reassessing fixed assets almost led to  a powerful protest action by Russian journalists, which would  have been expressed in a temporary strike by the majority of  publishing collectives. The order was the "last straw," which  would have broken the financial back of the Russian press. In  addition, the threat of strike forced the government to consider  other problems, which have gone unsolved for years. The  journalists' proposals were accepted by Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin during their recent meeting.    Judging by the latest order, the government will gradually  lower the tax burden placed on periodicals and socially  significant literature. As far as the system of state subsidies  for newspapers and journals go, it will probably be meaningfully  altered. Journalists do not like the current financing system  because it makes them dependent on the government. The new  financing system will probably include the proposals from  editorial offices, which suggest that the government subsidize  paper, printing, and communication needs.    The long-debated question of the participation of editorial  staff in the privatisation of publishing-printing enterprises,  if it is resolved in the affirmative, could enable journalists  to be their own bosses instead of being hired labor. The most  important accomplishment would be the destruction of the  government monopoly on the country's printing base.    Naturally, all of this will come into being only if the  instructions given to the government departments are really  carried out.</p>

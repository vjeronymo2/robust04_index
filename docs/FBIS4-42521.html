			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BS: "Government Finances Are Smaller </F> Handicap Than Before"]    [Text] "The situation of public finances in Belgium is less  of a handicap than before," Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy  said yesterday at a dinner of institutional investors organized  by the Petercam stockbrokers. If the forecasts turn out  correct, then the Belgian Government deficit, this year  amounting to 5.7 percent of the GDP, will fall slightly below  the European average.    Van Rompuy pointed out that tax levels, despite increases  since 1991, remained below 1987 levels. "We must watch over  competitiveness," the minister said. "But the forecast of a  balance of trade surplus of 400 billion Belgian francs (BFr)  this year (Bfr350 billion in 1993) still remains remarkable. It  cannot be put down to weak imports, since growth will be higher  than 1 percent."    Van Rompuy criticized the Leuven-based economists who called  for a currency devaluation last year to bring down interest  rates. "Short-term interest rates are just as low as German and  Netherlands rates and the surplus on the balance of trade is the  best justification for the strong currency," Van Rompuy said.    He said that "it was encouraging that companies'  investments,  after a serious downturn, would increase by 3 percent in real  terms this year and by 6 percent next year."    But there are structural weaknesses. The state employs  637,000 people, and 995,000 people receive unemployment benefit.  The private sector employs 2.1 million people, and there are  680,000 independent workers. That group of 2.8 million people  is too narrow, the minister said.    "The vicious circle of unemployment has to be broken  through," he said. "When we consider reaching the Maastricht  standard of a 3 percent reduction in charges, then reducing the  employers' social contribution must be given priority over  reducing personal income tax," he said.    "Social insecurity has a price. Insecurity adds costs to the  budget. The Justice Ministry budget increased by Bfr4.2 billion  between 1978 and 1988 and by Bfr9 billion, or three times as  quickly, between 1988 and 1993. For this reason, care is needed  with low benefits," Van Rompuy said. "Our problem is that in  some sectors, the number of people entitled to social benefits  is too high. More selectivity is necessary," he said.    "In my view, the seriousness and the likelihood of the risk  to income should be taken into consideration," he said.  "Nothing undermines the legitimacy of the social security  system more than not tracking down and punishing abuses."    The answer lays in delegating responsibility. "People,  organizations, and institutions must be encouraged to manage  their affairs economically," he said. "The approach in the  health care sector is already bearing fruit," he said. "Real  growth was reduced to 1 percent in 1993. We are expecting a  growth of 1.25 percent in 1994. In 1991 and 1992, the increase  was 7 percent," he said.    "Making people responsible for themselves goes hand in hand  with solidarity," Van Rompuy concluded. "If the economy is to  survive and flourish, then Homo Economicus is in himself not  enough. We must remain deeply aware of this paradox," he said.</p>

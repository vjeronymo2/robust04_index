			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures provide the lead for equities WITH WORLD stock markets providing no clear lead, the London equity sector was left yesterday to juggle with the chances of developments in interest rates and electoral prospects at home. However, hopes of early reductions in domestic base rates, encouraged by the UK press at the weekend, found no support either from sterling's progress or from the Bank of England's actions on the London money market. An advance in the stock market towards the close, in spite of the absence of Wall Street, which was closed yesterday, reflected a strong rise in the futures market, which caught the equity marketmakers short of stock in the underlying blue chip issues. The gain of 27.1 on the day took the FT-SE Index to 2,541.0, bringing the 2,550 level into the market's sights once again. UK public opinion polls continued to show that the ratings of the two main political parties are close together, while the latest hints from political circles merely underlined expectations in the City that the UK general election will be held early in April. A glimmer of optimism came from a survey of the distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which suggested a rise in sales volumes. The survey supported the view of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that a consumer spending boom is about to rescue the UK economy. Share prices opened uncertainly, however, and it was not until the stock index markets came in on a firm note that the underlying stock market moved ahead. A good premium on the March futures contract of the FT-SE Index was soon reflected in a gain of 18.4 for the index itself, which touched 2,532.3 at mid-morning. But trading volume, already foreshadowing the absence of a lead from Wall Street, was painfully thin and share prices could not sustain their early gains, at least for a while. The late upswing saw a pick-up in Seaq volume, which totalled 463.8m shares on the day, against a previous 593.1m. Friday's total represented Pounds 1.2bn in genuine customer, or retail, business, a significant increase over the daily values of the past week. There was further selling of BP shares, as the analysts continued to react negatively to last week's trading statement. The stores sector responded well to the CBI survey, although share volume was moderate. Great Universal Stores, notably a thinly traded share, stood out strongly, and Marks and Spencer and Kingfisher reacted positively to the hope of increased sales in the high streets of Britain. The strongest gains came among the blue chip internationals, which benefited both from the strength of the Footsie futures contract and the hope that Wall Street will sustain its recent firmness when it returns from holiday. Among these market leaders, pharmaceutical issues were strong and stocks such as Reckitt &amp; Colman and Rank Organisation, more directly influenced by Wall Street, closed very firmly. However, across the broad range of the market, shares were not active and traders warned that price movements reflected the need of marketmaking firms to find shares to cover selling bargains struck in the previous week. London is unlikely to develop any new trend until Wall Street returns to business.</p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Search for the party glue: Europe The reform of Italy's electoral law, widely regarded as an essential step to the salvaging of the political system, has now passed its first hurdles in the two houses of parliament. Some problems remain; but there is a reasonable probability that Italy is about to move from a voting system which has been wholly based on proportional representation, to one which will be mainly based on first-past-the-post. The objective of the reformers is to weaken the power of the discredited political parties. In a voting system which is wholly proportional, the voters' options (that is, the lists of candidates) are determined by the parties. They thus control the political system, and become the nexus for a vast network of patronage. The wholesale corruption rampant in Italy is the logical end-product. Unfortunately, there are at least two reasons for doubting whether this reform will be enough to provide a solution to the problem. First, the new law still contains a significant element of proportional representation; three-quarters of the seats will be filled by single-member constituencies, but one-quarter will be filled by PR. The ostensible reason for this residual hold-over is to protect the little parties, which might be wiped out in first-past-the-post voting. But the most important consequence will be to load the odds critically in favour of the party system as such, and against the candidacies of independent politicians. Considering that one-sixth of all members of parliament are now under some form of investigation for corruption, it is arguable that political reform depends on a far-reaching clean-out of the old cast of characters, and their replacement by new politicians who are untainted either personally or by association. But the only people who will be penalised by the new law will be independent candidates, since they cannot benefit from the residual PR votes. But the other reason for scepticism is that modern parliamentary democracy cannot work without organised political parties. The political parties which have dominated the scene since the second world war may be the source of Italy's political crisis; but the logical conclusion is not a parliamentary system which does not depend on political parties (a contradiction in terms), but one where the parties are reformed and uncontaminated. Believing in the attainability of this second alternative requires optimism on a heroic scale. Who will be the politicians in these utopian parties? Whom will they represent? And what will be their message? It is questions such as these which are being anxiously addressed by the French Socialists, in the wake of their comprehensive defeat in the March general elections. This weekend they have been holding a large-scale think-in in Lyons; in October they will hold a formal party congress to adopt new party statutes; and some time later they plan to stage a more broadly based debate, with potential allies from other parts of the political spectrum. They do not yet have answers to the strategic questions listed above. When Michel Rocard first called for a sweeping rethink of the party's future, he admitted that the Socialists had lost both their traditional message and their traditional constituency. He has since publicly confessed that the government he led in 1988-91 signally failed to provide socialist remedies for low growth and high unemployment. But he made no suggestion that he would have better socialist remedies today. He has implied that the way forward would lie through alliances with ex-Communists, ecologists, centrists. But so far it seems that electoral tactics, the rewriting of the party rulebook, and haggling over the party hierarchy are taking priority over strategy and ideology. Cynics will jeer that the disarray of the Socialists is merely the inevitable consequence of the disarray of socialism, four years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. There is no doubt a good deal in this argument; but it may be the Socialists' problem is just an early and acute form of a systemic dilemma facing most political parties in the closing decade of the 20th century. That dilemma is finding the glue to hold the activists together and attract the voters. One kind of party is held together by common interests, plus the promise of patronage after the conquest of power: for example, the interests of farmers, or the industrial proletariat. Another kind is based on a shared ideology, like socialism (plus, of course, patronage). Third, there may be a common enemy, like conservative hostility to socialism, or national hostility to foreigners, or regional hostility to the centre (plus patronage). Fourth, there is pure patronage as the only glue; that may describe the present rationale of most Italian national parties. Fifth, there is the presidential system, where the party's main organising principle is to support a charismatic leader (plus patronage); this is characteristic of the US. The problem for parliamentary democracy today is that the first two types of glue have progressively disintegrated: complex societies do not have large and homogeneous common-interest groups, and no-one is turned on by ideology. Pure clientelism can work for a while, as in Japan and Italy; but time and excess cause it to explode. As a result, countries without a presidential system, may by default find themselves driven into the politics of enmity. Mr Rocard wants to reinvent socialism; but the real fault-line in European politics may lie between the regionalists, the nationalists and the internationalists.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roman Ukolov report under the "Statistics" rubric: </F> "Criminals Increasingly Prefer To Shoot"]    [Text] Militia Lieutenant General Vyacheslav Ogorodnikov,  head of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Public Order  Directorate, made public yesterday some of the statistics on the  illicit arms trade as well as statistics on the dynamics of  crimes involving the use of firearms.    In the last three years, in his words, the number of such  crimes has risen from 4,000 to 22,500. One in every nine  murders is committed involving firearms. Last year, 1,366  handguns and revolvers, 1,946 automatic rifles, 140 machine  guns, six missile launchers, and 33 grenade launchers were  seized from criminals.    Participants in the news briefing noted that there are  several avenues through which weapons reach the "black market."  The first, and the most massive, is the smuggling of weapons  from "hot spots" in the CIS states. The second avenue is the  stealing of weapons from factories producing firearms. Recently  14 groups of criminals who were stealing the main product have  been discovered at the Tula firearms plant alone. In Izhevsk,  the activity of a group of "Izhmash" production association  employees, who carried out thefts of automatic weapons which  they later sold, was cut short. Thefts are committed also at  Defense Ministry installations located on the territory of  Russia. As in the case of the plants, the reason for arms  "leaks" consists in unsatisfactory arrangements for storing them  and unreliable guards.</p>

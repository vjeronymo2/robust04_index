			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Macquarie Bank converts London office to branch Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank, has had its application for a UK banking licence approved. As a result, the bank said that it was formally converting its London office to UK branch status from yesterday. The bank, which is owned by more than 40 institutions, with the UK's Hill Samuel holding the largest single stake, has been putting increased emphasis on international expansion recently. London is its largest centre outside Australia, and Mr Allan Moss, managing director, said yesterday that the current aim was to develop a 'more diverse European client base in centres including Spain, Italy, Denmark, Finland and Norway' - countries where Macquarie has had a limited presence.</p>

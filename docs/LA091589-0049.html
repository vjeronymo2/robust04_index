			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISVILLE MAYHEM SEEN SPURRING GUN DEBATE;  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS ON BOTH SIDES EXPECT NEW DRIVE TO WIDEN CURBS ON ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> With a spray of rifle fire and a trail of blood, a deranged killer in  Louisville, Ky., on Thursday vividly brought to life nightmarish images that  are likely to rejuvenate efforts to broaden restrictions on assault weapons,  activists on both sides of the issue agreed.  </P> <P> Some compared its potential impact to that of shootings in Stockton, Calif.,  earlier this year, where the schoolyard carnage also wrought by a man with an  AK-47 assault rifle led Los Angeles, then California and, finally, even  President Bush to adopt new gun control policies.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate, but this is going to provide a lot of impetus to new  legislation," said Jim Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> For gun control advocates, the top priority remains at the federal level, where  Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and others have been fighting to extend the  Bush Administration's ban on foreign-made assault rifles to include  American-made versions of the weapons as well.  </P> <P> "This is going to raise the public awareness that guns like the AK-47 are  efficient for killing people -- not for use in recreational or sporting  purposes," DeConcini said Thursday.  </P> <P> But the mayhem in the Louisville printing plant could also give unaccustomed  momentum to efforts in states like Kentucky, where a pro-gun state government  has forbidden cities from enacting their own gun control laws.  </P> <P> While Louisville once imposed a waiting period between the purchase of guns and  their collections, the Legislature "simply took that right away from us," Mayor  Jerry Abramson said in an interview. "One would hope . . . that we could  revisit the issue -- at least of assault weapons."  </P> <P> A gun buyer in the city need now only be of legal age -- 18 for rifles, 21 for  handguns -- and sign a form attesting to sanity and a clean criminal record  before he can walk away the same day with a loaded weapon.  </P> <P> Those provisions, which are the minimum allowed by federal mandates, put  Kentucky among a dozen Southern and Western states with the least restrictive  gun laws in the nation, gun experts said.  </P> <P> In an attempt to deflect the expected drive to tighten those laws, the NRA's  Baker dismissed Thursday's shooting as a "random act of violence by a madman."  </P> <P> "It's our responsibility to point out that there are already thousands of gun  laws, and law-abiding people will obey them -- by definition -- and criminals  will not," Baker said.  </P> <P> But within hours of the shootings, an angry chorus of politicians, law  enforcement officials and activists voiced renewed outrage about the status of  current law. They pledged to redouble their efforts to extend federal  legislation.  </P> <P> "There will be more and more mindless mass murders until the President and the  Congress put controls on the sales of assault weapons," said Rep. Pete Stark  (D-Oakland), sponsor of one of the most far-reaching anti-assault gun measures.  </P> <P> "This is a classic case," said L. Stanley Chauvin, president of the American  Bar Assn. "Assault weapons are used for no earthly purpose other than to kill  people. As long as they are available, people will be killed."  </P> <P> In the face of the outcry, pro-gun sources on Capitol Hill acknowledged that  they were troubled. "Clearly, they (gun control advocates) are going to use  this to try and further their cause," one aide said.  </P> <P> Even the most far-reaching legislation now under consideration at the federal  level would stop short of outlawing assault weapons altogether.  </P> <P> The measures instead would merely outlaw production and sale of all new  weapons. As a result, the 2 million to 3 million assault weapons already in  circulation -- including, perhaps, the AK-47 used by Louisville gunman Joseph  T. Wesbecker Thursday -- could remain in use.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration agreed in the aftermath of the Stockton shooting to  enforce regulations banning the importation of foreign-made assault weapons on  grounds that they were unsuitable for sporting purposes. Previously, the  Treasury Department had considered the rifles sporting weapons.  </P> <P> But the President has steadfastly resisted pressure to extend the ban to  include American-made weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clears Key Panel  </P> <P> The DeConcini-sponsored proposal to extend the ban to the domestic sphere  cleared a key Senate committee just before the summer recess. With activism on  the issue fading with the memory of the Stockton massacre, there had been no  plans until this week for a prompt vote by the full Senate.  </P> <P> In addition to Thursday's killings, another factor now appears likely to stir  the Senate out of its lethargy, the activists from both sides said.  </P> <P> The Colombian government, alarmed by the discovery of large caches of  American-made assault rifles during raids on the headquarters of drug cartels  there, has asked the United States for help in cutting off the flow. Drug  Enforcement Administration Chief John C. Lawn joined the call for tougher gun  laws.  </P> <P> A key supporter of such legislation, Sen. Howard E. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), took  to the Senate floor Thursday afternoon to urge prompt action in the wake of the  Louisville massacre.  </P> <P> "Let's debate the bill, and vote it up or down," he urged. "Anything less would  be irresponsible. It's time to act, and one more day's delay -- one more death  -- cannot be explained."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Feature by reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Xie </F> Rong (6200 2837): "Flower of Friendship Grows From the Weaving  of Carpets" -- XINHUA headline]    [Text] Ashkhabad, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Ashkhabad Carpet  Factory was filled with laughter in the afternoon of 21 April.  Age-old legends and touching scenes again added splendor to  Sino-Turkmen friendship.    At 1515, Premier Li Peng, who is currently on a visit to  Turkmenistan, arrived at the Ashkhabad Carpet Factory, which was  established over 60 years ago, for a visit. Factory Director  (Bayilan) warmly welcomed Premier Li Peng and his party at the  gate.    After walking into the workshop, Li Peng frequently extended  greetings to women workers skillfully doing their work. The  factory director said: The factory employs over 1,000 staff and  workers. The carpets it produces are famous all over the world  for their beauty as well as their fine and close-woven texture.  It is here that Turkmen's industriousness and wisdom, as  demonstrated by pairs of weaving hands making their traditional  carpets, enjoy long- standing popularity and brisk sales to  other parts of the world.    What makes the factory proud is the fact that Turkmen  carpets  have won eight gold medals at international expositions. One of  them was awarded by the Paris Expo in 1937. Factory Director  (Bayilan) said to Li Peng: The carpet weaving industry occupies  an extremely important position in Turkmenistan. Our national  emblem incorporates five basic carpet designs.    Chinese guests gasped with admiration at pieces of carpets  full of ancient, legendary figures at the factory museum.  Pointing at a carpet with designs woven on both sides, the  factory director said: The texture of this rare carpet is very  close-woven. It has over 1 million knitting knots per square  meter. The host said with pride: The craftsmanship of the  decorative carpets and tapestries produced by the factory is  very exquisite. They are very valuable. The factory has an  annual output of 2,700 square meters [figure as published].  Products are mainly sold to Germany and Britain.    Standing in front of a carpet woven with a dragon design, Li  Peng examined the carpet for a long time. It is an unusual  carpet, woven with a design of eight legendary Chinese dragons  and a cotton boll, which is a traditional Turkmen design.  According to a briefing given by the host, this was the design  on the ceiling of a mosque in the 12th century. A male artisan  and an 18-year-old girl tried to weave the design on a carpet.  When the weaving of the design on the carpet was almost  finished, with only a space of 15 cm left undone, they perished  in an earthquake that destroyed the mosque. The wife of the  artisan completed the weaving of the carpet. Factory Director  (Bayilan) said: "The design signifies that Turkmen-Chinese  contacts date back to ancient times." The guests were touched  by the story. Li Peng and his wife posed for a photo in front  of the carpet.    To welcome Premier Li Peng's visit to Turkmenistan and the  carpet factory, two female workers specially hastened to produce  a tapestry woven with a portrait of Li Peng and offered it as a  present to their honored Chinese guest. The factory director  said: "In the tapestry are woven the friendly feelings of all  the workers of our factory for you and the Chinese people." In  return, Premier Li Peng offered a traditional Chinese embroidery  as a present to the host. He said: "Like your carpets, famous  Chinese embroidery is also embroidered by needle, stitch by  stitch."    At the end of the visit, Premier Li Peng gladly wrote an  inscription: "Great Achievements From Industriousness and  Wisdom and Masterpieces of Superb Craftsmanship." The visit,  which lasted less than an hour, left an unforgettable impression  on the Chinese guests.</p>

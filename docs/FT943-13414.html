			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Warsaw keeps petrol control The Polish government is to retain control of the country's pipeline and rail petrol distribution system under cautious new privatisation plans announced yesterday. CPN, the state-owned service station operator, which owns 3,300 outlets, will be split into three and passed over to refining companies whose shares would then be offered to domestic and foreign investors, the government said. The state would retain golden shares in the companies with veto powers over the closure of refineries. The Poles will also seek to delay the lifting of quotas on petroleum imports from the European Union, promised for the spring of 1997. At present 20 per cent of Poland's petrol is imported.</p>

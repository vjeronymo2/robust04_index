			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: E Europe farming machine sales down THE BOOM in the agricultural machinery market in eastern Germany is beginning to tail off, according to Claas, Europe's biggest producer of combine harvesters and self-propelled forage harvesters. The family-owned company, based at Harsewinkel in northern Germany, says in its annual report for the year ended September 30 that the decline of sales to western European agricultural machinery markets is expected to continue in the current year. 'There is still uncertainty about the impact of the Gatt negotiations,' it says 'and this, along with the agricultural resolutions passed by the European Community in spring 1992, is causing purchasers of agricultural machinery to buy considerably less.' Overall sales of combine harvesters in western Europe dropped by about 20 per cent in the financial year just ended.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gandois to step down from Pechiney Mr Jean Gandois, chairman of Pechiney, yesterday said he would step down from the state-owned aluminium and packaging group and stand as a candidate to head the Patronat, the French employers' federation. The Pechiney chief said that since the company will not be privatised by the time he reaches the age of 65, next May, it would be better to leave the job and allow his replacement to prepare for the sale. Public-sector company chairmen have an age limit of 65. Mr Gandois is now set for a contest to succeed Mr Francois Perigot, the current head of the Patronat, who will step down in December. Mr Jean-Louis Giral, a former head of the Patronat's social committee, has already announced he will stand, and other candidates may emerge before the autumn vote which will determine Mr Perigot's successor. The Patronat has traditionally played an important role in contributing to the policy debate with the government in areas from labour market reform to macroeconomic policy. It recently urged the government to implement investment incentives and increase financial assistance for small and medium-sized industry to support economic recovery. In addition to his ambitions at the Patronat, Mr Gandois' decision to step down partly reflects the timing of the privatisation of the aluminium group. He has pushed for a rapid privatisation of the company, which is one of the 21 public-sector groups slated for sale by the centre-right government of prime minister Edouard Balladur. Losses at the group, however, and the complex negotiations surrounding an alliance with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone (CNR), the hydroelectricity producer, have prevented an early privatisation. Pechiney, which has suffered from the fall in aluminium prices and the increased supply from Russia and eastern Europe, suffered a net loss of FFr980m (Dollars 176.3m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr203m in 1992. Mr Gandois said yesterday that Pechiney should return to profit this year, boosted by exceptional gains. He forecast that privatisation of the group would be possible from 1996. In an attempt to reduce the cyclical nature of its businesses and secure a low-cost source of electricity, the French government has sought to form a partnership between Pechiney and CNR. The plan has encountered opposition, however, from local politicians and is complicated by the government's desire to maintain the monopoly of Electricite de France, the state-owned utility.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ye. V. Lesnikov, V. I. Pustovoyt, A. A. </F> Khrimyan; UDC 621.373.826]    [Abstract] A method for determining the quantum  effectiveness of photo-detectors is described. This method is  based on the analysis of the photocurrent dispersion  fluctuations with a priori specified statistics of the radiation  field. Thus, the spectral sensitivity of the photo-detector can  be determined with a single electron formation process of the  photocurrent. A device for experimental determination of the  effectiveness of a silicon photodiode FD-7K was constructed. Its  block diagram is provided and the experimental procedures are  described. Light- emitting diodes AL-307 and AL-107, with  _l_[.sup]max[/]=0.67 and 0.95 m, respectively, were used  as sources of radiation. Before determining the quantum  effectiveness of the photo-detector, curves of the shot current  dispersion for different radiation intensities were first  obtained, and are shown in a graph.

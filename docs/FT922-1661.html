			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Former Lotus chairman is jailed for fraud MR FRED BUSHELL, the former Group Lotus chairman, was jailed for three years and fined Pounds 2.25m yesterday for his part in a conspiracy that defrauded De Lorean Motor Cars, the Belfast manufacturing subsidiary of Mr John De Lorean's abortive sports car venture, of Dollars 17.65m. Lord Justice Murray, sentencing Mr Bushell in Belfast Crown Court yesterday, described him as a key figure in 'a bare-faced, outrageous and massive fraud'. The Belfast venture collapsed 10 years ago after nearly Pounds 78m of taxpayers' money had been invested in it. The government and Cork Gully, the receivers, are still seeking to recover funds from Mr De Lorean and others. So far, about Pounds 14m has been retrieved. The government is also suing Arthur Andersen, the De Lorean auditors, for Pounds 240m, claiming the firm should have been aware of mismanagement. Mr Bushell pleaded guilty to conspiring with Mr De Lorean, the late Colin Chapman, founder of Group Lotus, and others to defraud the Belfast company over a four-year period to December 1982. Lord Justice Murray said both Mr De Lorean and Chapman would have merited a sentence of 10 years for their part in the conspiracy. Mr Bushell was receiving a reduced sentence because of his late decision to plead guilty and his poor health. Mr De Lorean faces arrest should he return to the UK. Mr Bushell was also ordered to pay Pounds 100,000 costs and was warned that his sentence would be increased to four years if he failed to pay the full fine. The judge ordered that Pounds 702,010 frozen in a Swiss bank account - and now part of the Pounds 2.25m - be made the subject of a compensation order. The court was told that Mr Bushell had received Dollars 848,000 in the fraud, much of which had never been recovered. The judge said he was making the costs order because he was satisfied Mr Bushell had engaged in hindering activities. Earlier, the court had heard how De Lorean Motor Company had entered into a Dollars 17.65m contract in 1978 for Lotus to develop the prototype. The work was supposed to have been paid for by US investors, but instead was paid for by De Lorean Motor Cars, the government-funded Belfast manufacturing subsidiary. None of the money was received by Group Lotus. Mr Bushell and his fellow conspirators kept it after it had been funnelled through a Panamanian-registered, Geneva-based company, GPD Services, which had been set up a year earlier by Chapman and Mr Bushell. The work was later carried out by Group Lotus but paid, on another invoice, by the Belfast company. The prosecution said the fraud had inflicted a serious financial loss on the De Lorean company and was one of the factors that led its collapse.</p>

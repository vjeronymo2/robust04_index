			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of 753 foreign-funded enterprises had been  registered across the province by the end of last year. In  order to establish and refine a socialist market economic  mechanism, the province will step up verification of equipment  imported by foreign-funded enterprises, as well as assessment of  assets owned by foreign-funded enterprises. Since last year,  the province has assessed assets owned by 16 groups of  foreign-funded enterprises -- including enterprises run with one  of three types of capital: foreign capital, overseas Chinese  capital, and with both Chinese and foreign capital -- and has  verified a total of $3.076 million in assets.    Owing to the province's belated asset assessment work, only  2.1 percent of the province's foreign-funded enterprises thus  far have participated in the asset assessment process, while  only 0.5 percent of the province's foreign funds, including  those invested in enterprises run with three types of capital,  have been assessed.    In order to guarantee continued economic growth and to  protect the legitimate rights and interests of investors with  relevant laws, the province yesterday held a work meeting on  publicizing and implementing a series of foreign investment and  foreign-owned asset assessment and management measures.    Lin Jingxin, provincial commercial inspection bureau chief,  delivered at yesterday's meeting a speech in which he called on  all units concerned to vigorously publicize and strictly  implement the measures drawn up by State Commercial Inspection  Bureau and Ministry of Finance. Lin urged leaders at all  levels, foreign-related asset assessment offices,  foreign-related accounting offices, and other departments  concerned across the province to attach great importance to,  actively coordinate with, and vigorously support foreign-related  asset assessment work.</p>

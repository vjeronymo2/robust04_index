			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (13): New era dawns for consumers - Christopher Bobinski investigates the rise in foreign trade LONG lines of lorries at Poland's western frontiers bear eloquent testimony to the increasingly important role foreign trade is playing in the country's economy. Over the past two years the availability of formerly unimagined foreign goods in Polish shops has been one of the most important tangible signs for ordinary Poles that a new era has dawned. Exports, too, have taken on a new vitality and export promotion is now at the heart of the government's strategy for economic growth aided by last December's association agreement with the European Community. The EC agreements should see the removal of remaining trade barriers for industrial goods by the end of the century and easier access for farm goods. Trade growth has been impressive since the first post-communist government lowered trade barriers, devalued the zloty and made it internally convertible in January 1990. The share of imports in GNP grew from 13.6 per cent in 1989 to 22.8 per cent last year while the share of exports almost doubled from 9.2 per cent to 15.3 per cent in 1991. The first half of 1991 saw an explosion of private sector trading. Half of last year's Dollars 15.5bn imports were brought in by private individuals and companies and 22 per cent of the Dollars 14.6bn exports were sold by the private sector. Germany, an easy car or truck ride away from most Polish cities, was the source of two-thirds of the private sector's imports and the market for 50 per cent of its exports. At the other extreme the collapse of the Soviet economy, together with the demise of the transferable rouble and its replacement by dollar pricing, led to a collapse in trade with the former Comecon countries to around 10 per cent of turnover last year from 50 per cent. Such a rapid collapse has been painful and disruptive. Poland still needs to import gas and oil from Russia and last year continued to run a deficit with the former Soviet Union while industries such as textiles, pharmaceuticals and engineering were left gasping at the disappearance of a market they had been welded to for more than 40 years. Even private manufacturers such as Mr Andrzej Czernecki, managing director of medical instruments company HLT, accuse the post-communist governments of not doing enough to support trade with the east. Poland's share of the former Soviet Union's imports shrank from 9 per cent in 1990 to 4 per cent last year, the largest fall among the former Comecon partners, while the US, Turkey and even Thailand increased their share of the Soviet market. The loss of the Soviet market has been partially compensated for by trade with the EC which bought more than half last year's exports. Thanks to a 29 per cent rise in exports to Dollars 8.3bn, Poland ran up a Dollars 560m surplus with the EC although imports rose 87.4 per cent to Dollars 7.7bn. But the unprecedented sharp rise in imports contributed to Poland's overall Dollars 823m trade deficit last year and provided the background to a debate about the wisdom of keeping a fixed exchange rate for the zloty in spite of rising inflation. The resulting zloty appreciation against western currencies contributed to an unprecedented influx of foreign consumer goods worth Dollars 4.8bn, 157 per cent more than in 1990. The flow was partially stemmed by a 17 per cent devaluation in May and higher customs tariffs in August. In the autumn Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the then deputy premier in charge of the economy, was persuaded to introduce a 'crawling peg' devaluation. Until then he remained determined to use an overvalued zloty to help control inflation and put competitive pressure on domestic industry. Imports tightened the pressure on domestic producers and increased political pressure for aid to industry and a more actively pro-export policy. This was also advocated by the World Bank which urged that exports should be treated as the only effective source of increased demand to combat the recession and that exchange rate policy should be used to stimulate that growth. The government heeded the message. It approved a 12 per cent devaluation in February and appears ready to devalue again if needed. At the same time wage controls are to be tightened to maintain competitive advantage while depressed internal consumption should also spur manufacturers to look for markets abroad. With GATT predicting a 4 per cent increase in world trading volumes this year, there should be room for the 3 per cent growth in exports for which the government is budgeting. The EC will be the prime target of this export drive which will be concentrated on metallurgical goods, furniture and agricultural products. This will test Brussels's commitment to a gradual dismantling of trade barriers as enshrined in Poland's crucial Association Agreement with the EC. The agreement has yet to be ratified by Poland's parliament where it has its opponents. Polish steel makers are also well aware that they remain very much at the mercy of EC producers who can regulate trade through non-tariff barriers. But the big worry is enforcement of safeguard clauses in the agreement which permit a reversal of specific free trade promises if Poles become too successful in EC markets.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> EX-CANDIDATE FOUND GUILTY OF THREATS  </P> <P> A former Thousand Oaks City Council candidate who proclaimed himself to be  Christ was found guilty Wednesday of sending threatening letters to five public  officials.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Superior Court jury deliberated for 6 1/2 hours before  convicting Norman (Blackie) Jackson, 35, of five counts of threatening public  officials.  </P> <P> Jackson sent letters July 6 threatening to hurt Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer,  Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi  Valley), Thousand Oaks City Manager Grant Brimhall and state Sen. Ed Davis  (R-Santa Clarita) unless they responded to a variety of his complaints about  Ventura County government.  </P> <P> Judge Lawrence Storch ordered a psychiatric evaluation for Jackson to determine  whether he is a danger to the public and whether he qualifies for probation.  The maximum penalty is five years in prison.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get back at anybody. I appreciate everything. It was a fair  verdict," said Jackson, who had quoted Scripture and claimed he was Christ  during a long, disjointed statement to jurors Tuesday.  </P> <P> During deliberations, the jury struggled most with the question of whether  Jackson intended to harm the officials, said one juror, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> "We believed he wrote the letters out of frustration, and he didn't expect them  to change their views," said the juror.  </P> <P> Another juror, Wendy Larner, said the jury thought Jackson's rambling letters  were "wild" and indicated he was mentally unstable.  </P> <P> Storch, however, had ruled Jackson was mentally competent to stand trial and  allowed him to serve as co-counsel to his attorney, Jorge Alvarado.  </P> <P> Jackson is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail in Ventura County Jail pending  his sentencing, scheduled for Jan. 16.

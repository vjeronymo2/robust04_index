			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> NEW CITY HALL FACADE OKD  </P> <P> The Culver City Redevelopment Agency unanimously approved a plan to replicate  the facade of the old City Hall for the city's new municipal building at an  estimated cost of $300,000, substantially less than what it would cost to  preserve the existing facade, as had been originally considered.  </P> <P> After a slide presentation by Roger Cocke, principal of CHCG Architects Inc.,  in which the existing facade was superimposed onto the new architectural  design, skeptical agency members were persuaded to approve the replicated  facade, which will consist of a central arch flanked by two full open wings.  </P> <P> The new facade will be made of concrete and stucco, and will be considerably  lighter in weight than the original masonry version. By constructing a copy,  the city also will be able to move the facade five to 10 feet back from the  street at Duquesne Avenue and Culver Boulevard, making it possible to  straighten the existing curve in Duquesne.  </P> <P> The replicated facade will cost $300,000, Cocke said, compared with $800,000 to  $1.25 million for saving the old one.  </P> <P> The agency also voted Monday night to award a $95,900 contract for asbestos  removal from the existing City Hall building to In-Tek Demolition and  Environmental Services.  </P></p>

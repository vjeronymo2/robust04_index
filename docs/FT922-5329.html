			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: Time to have a debate on Emu and the Bank IN the recent House of Commons debate on the Maastricht Treaties, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, rightly underlined that the issues of European economic and monetary union had been more fully debated in Britain than in any other EC member state. But questions concerning the constitution and responsibilities of the Bank of England as the EC moves towards EMU have so far been given no attention at all. This is a gap in the public debate about Britain's economic future that deserves to be filled soon. Not only are complex issues involved, but timetable factors are coming to the fore. In particular, the term of office of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the present Bank governor, expires at the end of June next year. Whoever takes over from him for what can be expected to be a five-year term will head the Bank through what may be its biggest changes since nationalisation in the 1940s. The Bank's status merits discussion for two reasons. One is a global trend towards making central banks primarily responsible for combating inflation and giving them independence from government to achieve price stability. If the Bank of England retains its current status, it will increasingly be an odd man out among the world's central banks. The other is the Maastricht Treaty itself, which alongside a single currency envisages the creation of a European System of Central Banks made up of an independent European central bank and the central banks of the EC member states. The government's position - frequently articulated by Mr Lamont - is that responsibility for economic policy, including the setting of interest rates, should, as now, stay unambiguously in national hands during the preparatory second stage of Emu which begins in 1994. As long as this state exists, the chancellor has insisted that the Bank should not be given its independence, otherwise there would be no way of making the conduct of monetary policy accountable to parliament. But it is inconceivable that the Bank can stay as it is if government and parliament eventually decide to join the third and final stage of union in 1997, when a majority of EC members will be able to decide whether to go ahead with a single European currency and European central bank, or in 1999 when as few as two states can create the union. If Britain decides to be a full member of Emu, the Bank of England will also have to be independent. The timetable agreed at Maastricht means the UK government and parliament will have to debate whether to move to the third and final stage of Emu before the end of 1996. This is likely to be during the life of the present parliament. Even if the decision goes against joining the third stage of Emu, 1996 would be an occasion for a debate, or even decisions, on the constitution and responsibilities of the Bank of England. A number of thorny issues that cannot wait until 1997 or 1999 are already surfacing. Some are technical, such as the role that the Bank will play in Europe-wide systems for settling payments between banks or supervising banks throughout the EC. Other questions are more hypothetical but fundamental, such as the objectives, governance and accountability of the Bank of England if it becomes part of a European economic and monetary union. One problem with Mr Lamont's present approach towards the Bank and Emu is that it appears to assume that the Bank could move overnight from its present non-independent status to one of independence within Emu. The change would in fact have far-reaching implications. The role of the Bank would have to be clearly defined if it became independent. Would it concentrate on securing price stability, like the Bundesbank? Or would it retain the responsibilities for the welfare of the City and industry or bank supervision that the Bank has today? What should be the decision-making body if the Bank assumes responsibility for setting interest rates, either in the context of a European central banking system or as an independent entity? At present, interest rate decisions are taken by the chancellor after talks between the Bank and the Treasury. But if the Bank became responsible for monetary policy, even as part of a European system of central banks, it would have to restructure its decision-making organs and their accountability. The Bank Court, which includes industrialists, City financiers and trade unionists as well as Bank officials, clearly could not decide on interest rates because several of its members would be exposed to a potential conflict of interest. If such decisions were to be taken by a new group comprising Bank officials, operating most likely with a one-person, one-vote system, the individuals concerned would have greatly increased power, raising questions as to whom they should be accountable and how. Also, who would they represent? Britain, as a unitary state, is peculiarly ill-placed to inject regional interests and influences into its bureaucracies. In contrast to the Bundesbank council or the US Federal Open Market Committee, which give the representatives of the US and German regions a say in monetary policy making, there would be no easy way of reflecting the preoccupations of Scotland, Wales, the west Midlands or the north of England in the decision-making centre of the Bank of England. These are just some of the questions that have to be answered if the UK finally decides to join Emu. The problem is that they are so wide-ranging that they could not be tackled at the last minute. Indeed, it may be that Britain will not become a full member of Emu. But the implications of Emu for the Bank of England should be considered in depth and in advance, lest the Bank be pitchforked into a new environment completely unprepared and with a constitution that does not do justice to the importance of monetary policy for the UK's economic welfare.</p>

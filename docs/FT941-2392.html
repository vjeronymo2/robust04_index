			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Surprise jump in profits for Jardine motor arm Jardine International Motor Holdings, the car distribution arm of the Jardine Group, surprised the Hong Kong market with a 23 per cent jump in net profits to USDollars 73.2m in 1993, from USDollars 59.5m in 1992. Gains were fuelled by strong performances in distribution and service operations in Hong Kong, Macao and China, and helped by a lower tax bill. There was also a turnround in the UK and Australia while sales in China surged despite the austerity drive in place for part of 1993. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'While the year has begun well in China and Hong Kong, with continuing demand for Mercedes-Benz motor vehicles, there remains uncertainty over the impact on car sales of the introduction of new taxation in China.' The new taxes, which come into effect next month, put a 150 per cent levy on top-range big engine cars sold to joint ventures - where around two-thirds of China sales are made. Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to 15.34 US cents from 12.93 cents, and directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.80 cents for a total payout of 7 cents, up 16 per cent.</p>

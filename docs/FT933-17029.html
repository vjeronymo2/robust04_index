			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / 'Ja' we have cheap bananas IF THERE is one true symbol of German unification it should be the beloved banana, they say in the Berlin backstreets. When east Germany left the grim, fruit-free world of Communist rule and joined the bulging materialism of its western sister state, the most extraordinary change came in the consumption of bananas. East Germans proceeded to celebrate their new-found freedom by devouring no less than 26kg per head per year, way over the EC average of 11kg per head. With imports running at 2.4m tonnes a year, Germany is now by far the largest banana-eating nation in the industrialised world. Which is precisely why the new European Community regime to curb cheap imports of so-called 'dollar bananas' from Latin America, and favour the dearer and humbler products of the Caribbean and Africa, is a subject of national outrage. Stickers abound in car windscreens and shop windows, urging fellow citizens in Gothic script to be patriotic and 'eat German bananas'. The decision on Tuesday by the European court of justice to reject Bonn's plea for an injunction to stop the new banana import regime is therefore a new blow to Germany's traditional loyalty to the EC. It comes on the eve of the oral hearing, in Germany's own constitutional court in Karlsruhe, on whether the Maastricht treaty on European union is compatible with the German constitution. Some would see it as an ominous reminder that, when a real German issue is at stake, devotion to the cause of European integration evaporates. They point to the famous battle over the German Reinheitsgebot, which demands that all beer brewed in Germany be free of all artificial additives, as it was in Bavaria in the 16th century. And at the heart of the opposition to Maastricht is the ordinary German's devotion to the D-Mark. The Karlsruhe court is unlikely to decide on Maastricht before September. Few Germans will understand the legal niceties. But they all understand the threat to their money, their beer, and their bananas.</p>

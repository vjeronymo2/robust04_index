			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Delegates take worrying interest in democracy - Disquiet about party accountability FIRST THERE was the scandal over how the Conservative party received funds form foreign millionaires like Mr Asil Nadir. Then the Labour party decided to make its internal structures more democratic by adopting one-member-one-vote. Both events have led some Tory delegates to think that the time is ripe for an open debate on democracy and accountability inside the Conservative party. In theory that debate should happen today, when the conference holds its regular session on party policy and organisation. But it is unlikely the floor will be given to any of the delegates who quietly criticise the party organisation for its lack of democracy. 'The Labour party has recognised the importance of the individual member by passing omov,' says Ms Sharon Spiers, head of a splinter group called the Charter Movement. 'But the Tory party is yet to do this. Individual members have no say in the election of the party chairman and no right to question the accounts, which are in a deplorable state.' The Charter Movement has enjoyed limited support at recent conferences. Campaigning for greater internal democracy is the last vehicle by which anyone climbs the ladder of a political party. Ms Spiers, a party member for 18 years, resigned herself long-ago to life as a campaigner, not a candidate. But she says the number of people quietly offering support is increasing. Early this year, 50 constituency associations signed a petition calling for a debate on party democracy at the Conservatives' central council meeting in Harrogate - although there was no debate on the issue. Charter's supporters feel there are several reasons why they are winning support now. In its 1993 accounts, the party recorded an accumulated deficit of Pounds 19m. Claims that the party received funds from Mr Nadir and other foreign businessmen have tarnished the party's image. But fee-paying party members cannot formally question the accounts or 'Party members have nothing like the power of company shareholders,' says Mr John Stafford, a former member of the Conservative Board of Finance. At a time of uncertainty for the leadership, there are also concerns that Mr Norman Fowler, the party chairman, is not a directly elected official. Instead, he is the appointee of the prime minister. 'What central office is saying is 'You can't trust the members',' says Mr Graham Pycock, a Conservative councillor in Lambeth. Disquiet on these issues has led to the party leadership's openly attacking the Charter Movement for the first time. A fortnight ago, Sir Basil Feldman, the chairman of the Conservatives' National Executive Committee, wrote to every constituency chairman and MP to denounce the group. 'I do accept that (the Charter Movement) sincerely hold their views, but I feel that they are utterly misguided at this time,' he wrote. Sir Basil will probably not need to engage with his critics on the conference floor today. But if Mr John Major's leadership suffers any more difficulties, the issue of party democracy may start to haunt him.</p>

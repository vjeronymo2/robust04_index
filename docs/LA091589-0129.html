			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW CONDUCTORS: CHALLENGES IN SAN DIEGO, INLAND EMPIRE;  </P> <P> ROBERTSON FAVORS A LITTLE MYSTERY  </P> <P> Stewart Robertson believes in the power of mystique.  </P> <P> As newly appointed music director of the Inland Empire Symphony, Robertson will  conduct a five-concert subscription series, beginning Oct. 21, at the  California Theatre of Performing Arts in San Bernardino, as well as lead  ensembles at local schools and universities. But he won't pitch at parties for  funds for the parent Inland Empire Symphony Assn.  </P> <P> "I don't think a music director should go out and actually ask for money,"  Robertson, 41, said in a recent phone interview from Scotland where he was on  vacation. "A lot of American orchestras have gone wrong in seeing their music  director as a supersalesman.  </P> <P> "It's all a question of degree really. I will be involved in fund raising, but  I believe there's a danger in overexposure. A music director has to know the  general feeling and pulse of the community, but it's not necessary for him to  be seen at the checkout stand at Safeway. A little bit of mystery goes a long  way."  </P> <P> A resident of Carmel, Robertson has since 1986 been music director of the Santa  Fe Symphony, an orchestra with an annual subscription series of six concerts,  and the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y.  </P> <P> Wanting to work closer to home, Robertson vied with three conductors for the  directorship of the Inland Empire Symphony and was hired earlier this year.  </P> <P> Robertson's two-year contract calls for him to spend a minimum of 80 days each  season with the orchestra, and also to participate in The Sinfonia Mexicana, a  cultural exchange program presented under the aegis of the Inland Empire  Symphony Assn. Designed to lure Latinos who comprise more than 21% of the  population of San Bernardino and Riverside counties to the concert hall with  performances of classical music by Mexican composers, the program is hailed by  the California Arts Council, which has awarded the orchestra an organizational  grant of $7,020 for 1989-90.  </P> <P> "They have made a real effort to respond to the needs of the community," said  Elliot Klein, the council's music administrator for organizational grants.  "Appealing to Latinos makes a great deal of sense for the future of this  orchestra. That group is their potential future audience."  </P> <P> The Inland Empire Symphony has an operating budget for 1989-90 of $525,000;  $325,000 to be spent on artistic personnel. With 53% of income earned through  subscriptions and ticket sales, additional funding has come from private  foundations, as well as $50,000 granted by the City of San Bernardino, and  $20,000 from San Bernardino County. (The city has awarded an additional $15,000  to the Sinfonia Mexicana, and $10,000 for the Inland Empire Opera, also under  the auspices of the Inland Empire Symphony Assn.)  </P> <P> To expand the Inland Empire Symphony's subscription base of 1,400, and increase  its visibility in the community, Robertson will present informal lunchtime  concerts in downtown San Bernardino and perform "provocative" repertory at  local academic institutions, in addition to conducting at the 1,700-seat  California Theatre of Performing Arts. He plans to program "standard classics,"  plowing his way through the cycles of Beethoven and Brahms symphonies, and  later add a mix of contemporary music and neglected works, such as the Second  Symphony of Edward Elgar, and symphonies by Michael Tippett and Scandinavian  John Svendsen.  </P> <P> "My approach in the past has been to choose contemporary music that is more  immediately palatable," Robertson said, recalling that in his early days in  Santa Fe he programmed Francis Poulenc's "Sinfonia" to much success. "I am not  planning to flood our audience with contemporary works. I think one of the  secrets of programming is to mix and match familiar and unfamiliar elements."  </P> <P> Extensively involved in music education programs both in Europe and the United  States, Scottish-born Robertson also will help oversee the Inland Empire  Symphony Assn.'s successful Music in the Schools program.  </P> <P> Having spearheaded educational efforts for the San Jose and Oakland symphonies,  as well as opera programs for youth at the Scottish Opera and Glimmerglass  Opera, Robertson eschews highly structured programs traditionally offered in  classrooms. Rather, he expects to take smaller ensembles into schools and  universities and art galleries and tantalize young audiences with adventuresome  fare.  </P> <P> "I'm interested in giving youngsters a motivational experience. We need to let  kids know that classical music is fun and exciting and can be a real emotional  experience."  </P> <P> Teacher, motivator, performer. That's how Robertson characterizes the evolving  role of today's orchestral musician.  </P> <P> "No longer do 75 musicians in a symphony orchestra just play as a unit 100 feet  away from the audience," Robertson explained. "The good ones are becoming  flexible. The orchestra as we know it is not dying. It's just changing."  </P></p>

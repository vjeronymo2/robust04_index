			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Critics' Role in Keeping Two Systems"] </F>   [Text] Two cheers for China's new list of Hong Kong  affairs advisers. By including people from the "moderate"  democratic camp, including Meeting Point, the Association of  Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) and even the Hong Kong  Bank's Legislative Council representative Vincent Cheng  Hoi-chuen, Beijing has moved towards broader consultation.    A third cheer would be misplaced. The selection is better  than the uncritical supporters found in the previous lists but  the new list contains no consistent critics of Chinese policy.  It does include a few who could be relied on to argue logically  against flawed ideas in their areas of expertise. The question  which almost certainly will arise, however, is would many be  prepared to speak out publicly against a Chinese position? The  most striking, if not surprising, omission is that of outspoken  supporters of political reform. The ADPL has broadcast its  disagreement with Chris Patten's attempts to broaden the  franchise, as has the newly appointed Elsie Tu. Meeting Point  faces both ways. Mr Cheng prefers to keep his ideas to himself.  Even the appointment of former United Democrats member Lau  Kong-wah appears to be a slap in the face for his old political  allies.    The appointment of moderates and formerly pro-British  figures  is a typical united front tactic. It rewards defection and  makes life in the pro-China camp seem attractive to the  waverers. But as a means of effective, broad-based consultation  it is highly limited. If China really wanted to know how its  policies and pronouncements would affect Hong Kong, it should be  prepared to approach its critics.    This may be an academic point: those members of the United  Democrats China has branded subversives could hardly accept the  position in the unlikely event they were approached. Even lower  profile United Democrats members would regard appointment as a  poisoned chalice. So polarised has opinion become, service as  an adviser might be denounced as collaboration.    But China has contributed to this air of anxiety and  suspicion. Had it appointed and listened to all shades of  opinion from the start, it would not now be faced with such  hostility and distrust.    It should rethink its approach, declaring itself open to all  opinions. Hearing the views of people who are prepared to say  only what they think Beijing wants to hear does not advance  China's understanding of the complexities of Hong Kong society.  Appointing democrats as advisers might be counter-productive.  But inviting critics to give their views -- and listening to  them -- might help heal some of the wounds of the past five  years. It might also lead to more balanced, less  confrontational policy -- for the good of Hong Kong.    One reason for listening to all shades of opinion is to  prevent the further erosion of confidence in the concept of "one  country, two systems" after 1997.    Liberal lawyers were shocked at Duanmu Zheng's recent  prediction that the common law system would gradually disappear.  The Vice-President of the Supreme People's Court of China and  former Basic Law drafter said judgments based on precedent,  instead of the available evidence, relied too much on the  British system. He praised the mainland system as simpler.    Coming from a man of such influence, the remarks were seen  as  a threat. The subtext read into his statement was that the  independence of the judiciary enshrined in the British legal  system (as well as the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law)  would be phased out with it.    Among lawyers appointed as Hong Kong affairs advisers, a  different view prevails. A gradual change is seen as  inevitable. Chinese company law is already copied from Hong Kong  law. Given the relative maturity of the two systems, it is  likely Hong Kong law will continue to influence China more than  the other way round.    The opposing views are not mutually exclusive. It is  possible for Hong Kong to influence mainland law without  preventing the dismantling of local judicial independence.  Phasing out the reliance on precedents would make political  manipulation easier, but not inevitable. Other former British  colonies have stopped relying automatically on English legal  precedents, often following instead the thinking behind relevant  judgments in other common law jurisdictions. What matters is  not the English system per se, but judicial independence, the  presumption of innocence, and the maintenance of the rule of law  over the arbitrary "rule of man".    By listening to all shades of opinion, Beijing could help  assuage local fears of political manipulation. Consulting only  those prepared to give China the benefit of the doubt will  increase the suspicion and fear among those it still excludes.</p>

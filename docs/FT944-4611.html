			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (12): Balance is back in the black - A look at the recovery Drought and trade liberalisation pushed Zimbabwe's balance of payments deep into the red in 1991-92, since when there has been a strong recovery. In part, this reflects sluggish growth and depressed imports, but this year exports should recoup most of their 1992 losses caused by drought and depressed commodity prices. Strong primary export growth in 1994-95 could push the current account into surplus if import demand remains weak, exacerbating the upward pressure on the exchange rate arising from aid and capital inflows, mainly portfolio and hot money rather than foreign direct investment (FDI). Foreigners disinvested during the 1980s, and although there has been a small net inflow (Dollars 35m) since 1990, the country's stock of foreign investment has tumbled from Dollars 7bn in 1980 to Dollars 2.6bn in 1992. Zimbabwe is sub-Saharan Africa's third largest host country for FDI after South Africa and Nigeria. The Zimbabwe dollar, devalued by 17 per cent at the end of 1993 as part of an exchange control liberalisation package, regained 5.5 per cent of its value in the first half of the year, but has since resumed its slide, taking its depreciation to 19 per cent so far this year, including the 17 per cent official devaluation. Given a 12 to 15 per cent inflation differential with Zimbabwe's main trading partners since January, the real exchange rate has been appreciating, thereby compounding manufacturing industry's export woes. Commodity exporters, however, seem happy with the rate for the time being, although a further downward adjustment is expected in 1995, with the rate falling from ZDollars 8.4 to the US dollar to around ZDollars 10 in a year's time. In 1991 tobacco, gold and ferrochrome accounted for just over half of exports. Tobacco has since lost ground but is recovering, as also is ferrochrome and nickel. Gold earnings will increase substantially this year and next and new mineral exports will come on stream with diamonds and platinum making Zimbabwe an increasingly minerals-dependent exporter in the second half of the decade, while there are high hopes that horticulture will recoup some of the ground lost by tobacco. Since the launch of ESAP, Zimbabwe's foreign debt has increased 44 per cent to Dollars 3.8bn at the end of 1993 (from 39 per cent to 69 per cent of GDP). Last year, debt service payments absorbed 30 per cent of exports, but this ratio will fall as exports recover, though it will remain uncomfortably high for the next few years.  -------------------------------------------- MAIN EXPORTS 1991-93 (FIGURES IN DOLLARS M)  -------------------------------------------- Commodity                       1991     1993  -------------------------------------------- Tobacco                          532      365 Gold                             225      235 Ferrochrome                      155      142 Nickel                            97       56 Cotton lint                       65       26 Steel                             29       16 Manufactures                     340      450  (of which, Clothing/Textiles     92     122)  -------------------------------------------- Totals                         1,765    1,555  --------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------- BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 1991-93 (IN DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------                       1991       1992       1993  ----------------------------------------------- Exports              1,785      1,530      1,585 Imports              1,700      1,780      1,480 Trade balance           85       -250        125 Net services          -345       -350       -180 Investment income     -290       -285       -255 Net transfers            -         40         25 Current balance       -550       -845       -285 Capital account*       420        715        465 Overall balance       -125       -130       +180  ----------------------------------------------- * Adjusted for unrecorded flows  -----------------------------------------------</p>

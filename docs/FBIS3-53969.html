			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YEDI'OT AHARONOT public opinion poll conducted by the Dahaf </F> Institute, directed by Dr. Mina Tzemah]    [Excerpt] How would you reply if a referendum was held  today on the question: "Are you for or against full  withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full peace  with Syria and appropriate security arrangements?"    For -- 37 percent; against -- 61 percent; no reply -- 2  percent.    How would you reply if the referendum question was: "Are you  for or against partial withdrawal from the Golan  Heights in exchange for full peace with Syria and appropriate  security arrangements?"    For -- 62 percent; against -- 36 percent; no reply -- 2  percent.    The poll, which was conducted on 19 and 20 January, included  565 interviewees constituting a representative sample of the  entire adult Israeli population.    An analysis of the connection between voting patterns for  the  incumbent Knesset and on the referendum question on  full withdrawal from the Golan Heights indicates that  Labor supporters are almost equally divided between support for  and opposition to full withdrawal.    However, the voting patterns of supporters of other parties  in the Knesset ballot and the poll were obviously comparable,  with only a minority "crossing the lines": For instance, only  12 percent of Likud followers support full withdrawal, and only  14 percent of Meretz followers oppose it. There is a similarly  significant majority of full withdrawal opponents among the  supporters of ultra- Orthodox parties (20 percent for withdrawal  versus 80 percent against among Agudat Yisra'el supporters; 25  percent for and 75 percent against among SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim] supporters).    With the introduction of the question on partial  withdrawal, the trends change: Only 19 percent of Labor  supporters are against it versus 80 percent in favor; partial  withdrawal garners the support of 39 percent of Likud followers,  some 50 percent of Tzomet and Moledet followers, and 44 percent  of the National Religious Party followers.    The maximum margin of error in this poll is 4 percent.  [passage omitted]</p>

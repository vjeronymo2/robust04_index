			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Arts: A 'Ring' on the light side - The new Bayreuth cycle is all image, no substance So The Ring has come full circle, and the designer has ended up wearing the trousers. Rosalie (real name Gudrun Muller), the first woman to design Wagner's tetralogy, set the agenda for Bayreuth's new production from start to finish, decorating it according to her own whim and fancy. The result was a designer-Ring - all image and no substance. Perhaps she should be congratulated for such an apt sign of our times. Siegfried and Gotterdammerung were a marginal improvement on the first two evenings, on which I reported last Friday. The costumes for Siegfried seemed less pushy, and the forest murmurs were memorably re-created on stage and in the pit. John Tomlinson answered his opening-night critics with a glorious performance as the Wanderer, for which he won the biggest ovation of all. The new Siegfried, Wolfgang Schmidt, was as likable as he was dependable. And by softening her stage personality, Deborah Polaski emerged as a commanding Brunnhilde. The festival orchestra continued to play for James Levine with virtuoso, singer-friendly transparence - enough to silence those who insist that the covered pit at Bayreuth prevents Wagner's Ring-orchestration from being properly heard. But this has been Rosalie's Ring. It was she who provided the ideas, stepping into the interpretative void left by the stage director, Alfred Kirchner. Had anyone ever seen a giant, a dragon or a god, she asked during press interviews? No, so she would invent her own, selected from 2000 colour-coded costume-sketches: blue for purity, green for nature, red for blood-and-aggression, black for death. And yet she failed to come up with anything more original for the Rhinemaidens than bikers' outfits, or a vast decollete gown for Gutrune. Like many a static art installation, her designs were an expensive and circuitous way of stating the obvious - dressing up The Ring, and simultaneously trivialising it. Siegfried was the high point of the cycle, largely because Rosalie's futuristic fantasy found a home in the fairy-tale world of forest, Fafner and magic fire circle. The settings drifted towards naturalistic illusion: best of all was the leafy canopy for Act 2, an overhead sea of undulating green umbrellas. Kirchner also found the right context for his satirical touches - the sight of a 'real' bear careering onto the stage on a swing was genuinely funny, like a children's cartoon. And the Siegfried-Brunnhilde scene made an exhilarating climax, because of its restraint and tenderness, and the way the stage direction was a purposeful match for the music. For most of Gotterdammerung, we were back where we started, shifting around the surface of The Ring without penetrating its centre. The opening benefited from scenic minimalism, with the Norns shrouded in amorphous cloaks and the Gibichungs perched on stylised thrones. But Siegfried's arrival had a whiff of knockabout comedy, and just why the Gibichung women were dressed in orange masks was anyone's guess. With the trio of vengeance and Siegfried's dying aria, the production dissolved into grand opera. Nothing symbolised Kirchner's approach better than the final tableau - the same bare, convex platform that had been there from the start, now illuminated by a quiet pool of light. End of one world and the foundation for a better one? It was a tame ending to a tame production, giving the audience nothing to take home and chew. Even Peter Hall's Ring stirred more discussion than this. But we certainly heard more of The Ring than before. Kirchner obligingly lowered the curtain at every opportunity, including the whole of Siegfried's Rhine journey and funeral march. Levine and the orchestra responded with cleanly-sculpted playing and a lilting lyricism which brought Weber to mind. But the price for such musicality was high. Long stretches of Die Walkure and Siegfried were just too slow (though not the Siegfried finale, which had a beautifully-sustained spaciousness). Levine's refined sound-concept made you feel good, but missed the darker drama of Wagner. In this, his interpretation was at one with the staging. No-one can have been more heartened by Tomlinson's comeback than the singer himself. His Wanderer was less inhibited than the opening two nights, and more conventionally dressed. In a sense he was the victim of his success in the Kupfer Ring, and will forever be identified with that production's extremes. For the Kirchner Ring he had to suppress his natural stage expressionism, and we must hope that in time he succeeds. A blander singer like James Morris would have found this production easier to swallow. Schmidt's Siegfried was sunny-faced, cuddly and tireless. His intonation may have been variable, but he was never less than sensitive, delivering 'Ein wonniges Weib' with the grace of a Lieder singer. Polaski's Brunnhilde has at last learned how to express love and compassion. Tall, handsome and dignified, she moved and sang well, without ever quite touching the heart. Manfred Jung's Mime was more comic than characterful, while Birgitta Svenden made an ethereal Erda. Falk Struckmann was the virile Gunther, Eric Halfvarson a charcoal-voiced Fafner and Hagen. Everyone had been well schooled by Levine. New Ring productions at Bayreuth always need time to settle, so perhaps this one will yield more over the next four summers. The 1995 festival will open with Wolfgang Wagner's ten-year old Tannhauser production, and 1996 will see a new Meistersinger, conducted by Daniel Barenboim and again produced by Wolfgang. With the honourable exception of Heiner Muller's staging of Tristan und Isolde (new last year), it looks as if Bayreuth has already run out of ideas for the 1990s.</p>

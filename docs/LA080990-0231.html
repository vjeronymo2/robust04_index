			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE SENIOR CITIZEN BOOM;  </P> <P> SECURITY: A CITY-FUNDED PROGRAM USES THE ELDERLY TO INSTALL SAFETY MEASURES IN  SENIOR CITIZENS' RESIDENCES FREE OF CHARGE.  </P> <P> Celia Ross has had the yellow flyer about "Home Secure" in her Panorama City  apartment for a long time. The flyer promises installation of grab bars in the  shower, new dead bolts and a door viewer, all for free. She figured there must  be a gimmick.  </P> <P> But recently, she looked for that flyer again. Ross' glaucoma treatment wasn't  working, and she was going blind. Suddenly, it was hard to get around in the  apartment where she has lived for 25 years, and she was afraid.  </P> <P> "I'm legally blind now, I don't go out by myself anymore, but I can take care  of myself," Ross said. "I'm just glad these people could help."  </P> <P> Home Secure, funded by the cities of Los Angeles and West Hollywood, is unique  among the country's elderly programs. The program has a team of elderly  employees who install safety measures in homes and apartments of senior  citizens (and low-income families) at no charge.  </P> <P> Since it began almost 10 years ago, the program -- administered by Jewish  Family Services -- has opened an office in the San Fernando Valley, (818)  762-5892), because almost half of its requests come from Valley residents, said  Home Secure Director Leslie Friedman.  </P> <P> To take care of Ross, Home Secure employee Lillian Siff interviewed her to  assess her needs while Al Lynn, a retired schoolteacher, drilled holes to put  grab bars in her bathroom and changed the dead bolt on her door.  </P> <P> "The police recommend an inch-long dead bolt," Lynn said. "And we're giving you  a mat so you won't slip in the shower, and a night light."  </P> <P> "I can't see too much anyway. At one time I could see well enough to do this  work," Ross said, tugging on an intricate lace tablecloth she made. She has a  large-numbered phone and on her sofa was a poster-size card from her  granddaughter Ruth.  </P> <P> Siff explained some safety tips. "This is such a dangerous neighborhood now,"  Ross said. Siff also filled out a "Vial of Life" information card and stuck it  on the outside of the refrigerator in case paramedics ever need to know what  medications she is taking.  </P> <P> The program also provides earthquake safety kits and makes homes less hazardous  for people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Apartment managers  must approve any work done, and the service is free to anyone earning less than  $21,750 a year.  </P> <P> Ross' downstairs neighbor, Rose Klugman, 84, is faced with taking care of her  husband, Alex, 83, recovering from prostate surgery.  </P> <P> "I spoiled my husband," she said. "I've had this whole routine where I wash his  hair in a bowl, then rub him down outside of the tub, then he steps in. I'm  afraid to let him do it himself, though, he'll get hurt."  </P> <P> The Klugmans contacted Home Secure for help. The service installed mats and  bars in the bathroom, so Alex could wash himself on his own.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel so good now," Rose Klugman said when the work was done. "He  doesn't hear well and I don't drive, so we don't go out very much. It's nice to  feel secure in your own place." MICHAEL SZYMANSKI  </P></p>

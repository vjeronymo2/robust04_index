			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Declining US surplus fuels Nafta debate THE declining US trade surplus with Mexico has become a significant element of the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Mexico and Canada. Last year the US manufacturing trade surplus to Mexico rose to Dollars 7.5bn, a feat President Bill Clinton and other Nafta proponents cite as proof that North American trade has already created thousands of jobs. But the growth of US sales to Mexico is slowing. The trade surplus has declined from Dollars 380m in January to Dollars 120m in June as Mexico sinks towards recession. To Ms Thea Lee, an economist in the labour-supported Economic Policy Institute, the trend is 'going the way we predicted; exports are rising but imports are rising faster'. Ultimately, she contends, the trade surplus will be in Mexico's favour, and the US will lose 550,000 jobs. Mr Manuel Suarez-Mier, a visiting fellow at the Georgetown School of Business Administration, believes nervousness over Nafta's prospects in Congress has contributed to the the stagnant trade picture. The slowdown in the Mexican economy is a consequence of high interest rates, in place partly to control inflation and partly to offset the 'Nafta jitters'. But powerful Nafta opponents - followers of Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, labour and many environmentalists - paint a depressing picture of the US-Mexican trade relationship. In his new anti-Nafta book, Mr Perot points out that Dollars 15.5bn of last year's Dollars 40.6bn US exports to Mexico was capital goods. This, he asserts to the uninitiated, means factories. He labels 'a myth' the administration's contention that Nafta will create a lucrative new market. At the Commerce Department's Mexico Office, where US-Mexico trade is analysed, the US trade surplus slowdown is seen as 'a temporary pause', due to slower growth in the Mexican economy. What has been growing are sales of consumer goods. Giant US retailers are undergoing an 'enormous expansion' and helping to renovate Mexico's retail sector. The average Japanese last year spent Dollars 47 on US consumer products. The average Mexican spent Dollars 49 - spurring sales of US-made textiles, clothing, carpets, furniture and sporting goods.</p>

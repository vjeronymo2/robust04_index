			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Remapping US telecoms AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph's planned Dollars 12.3bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications will not only be one of the largest takeovers in US history. The deal may also herald a redrawing of the US telecommunications map, which in its outlines still bears the marks of AT&amp;T's enforced break-up in 1984. The 1984 divestiture, overseen by Judge Harold Greene, split AT&amp;T into seven local telecommunications groups, the Bell companies, and one long-distance company, the continuing AT&amp;T. The Bell companies were prevented from entering the long-distance market, while AT&amp;T was barred from operating local networks. Some lobbyists will no doubt argue that, in buying McCaw, AT&amp;T has found a backdoor route into the local market, as cellular communications were not included in the divestiture decree. They may even say the deal should be blocked as the long-distance market is still a no-go area for the Bells. Policymakers should give such arguments short shrift. At present, cellular communications do not compete head-on with the Bell's local 'wireline' phone services, as they are too expensive. Instead, cellular phones have expanded the overall market by allowing people to make calls when they are on the move. And, while cellular and other forms of radio communication will undoubtedly provide stiff competition for wireline companies as costs fall, the right response should be to sweep away restrictions on competition rather than add new ones. Justified fears Judge Greene's imposition of no-go areas for the Bells probably had some benefit back in 1984 in helping competition to take root. At the time, the Bells controlled access to customers and there were justified fears that, if allowed into the long-distance market, they would channel their customers' traffic through their in-house networks and thus squeeze out rivals. But the no-go areas now look like artificial lines on a map, as a result of technological and commercial developments. Under a system known as equal access, customers are able to choose the long-distance company through which their calls should be routed, with the result that the Bells no longer control customer access. Meanwhile, the Bells' local monopolies are being eroded by the growth of alternative fibre-optic networks in large cities such as New York. The monopolies would be under even greater threat if cable television companies were generally allowed to provide telephone services over their networks. Extra costs The divestiture restrictions have outlived their useful life. The long-distance ban, in particular, has led to a balkanisation of the US telecoms map, often requiring calls to be carried by roundabout routes rather than in straight lines, so imposing extra costs. Competition has also not been as vigorous as it could have been. It is unlikely AT&amp;T and MCI and Spint, its two main long-distance rivals, would have announced price rises last month if the Bells had been able to enter their markets. A bonfire of artificial restrictions would not only do away with those imposed at the time of divestiture. It would also abolish rules banning local phone companies from providing cable television over their networks and foreign companies from owning more than a minority share in any radio licence. The cable TV ban could be deterring telecoms groups from laying fibre-optic cables into people's homes, and hence the development of the 'information superhighways' that makes Vice-President Al Gore so enthusiastic. Meanwhile, the restriction on foreign companies explains why British Telecommunications was unable to acquire McCaw and is now selling its minority stake to AT&amp;T. Such rules provide foreign governments with a ready-made excuse to keep US telecoms companies out of their own markets. Redrawing the US telecommunications map will not be an easy task, given the vested interests in keeping competition out. But the US has already seen benefits from competitive telecoms markets since AT&amp;T's break-up and should have the courage to press on with further liberalisation.</p>

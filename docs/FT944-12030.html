			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed and explosive Sir, The insurance industry is rightly being pilloried for mis-selling personal pensions. When is the government going to accept responsibility for setting up the whole rickety framework? The concept of portable pensions was laudable but the practical realisation has been badly flawed. The Securities and Investments Board should prepare the public and life insurance industry for the explosion of the next time bomb. This will be when the time comes for employees of certain ages in non-pensionable employment who contracted out of state earnings related pensions (Serps) to contract back in. Independent financial advisers who sold them personal pensions have no incentive to provide this advice. Michael Goldman, 1 Lyndale Close, Blackheath, London SE3 7RG</p>

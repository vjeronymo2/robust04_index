			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Conservative quango jobs listed Members of the Conservative party's national executive have a one-in-five chance of being selected to serve on a quango, an analysis for BBC Television's Here and Now programme has found. The research shows that 33 quango jobs have been given to unsuccessful Tory candidates at the last general election compared with only three offered to unsuccessful Labour candidates. The analysis by the BBC's political research unit covers 25,000 appointments on nearly 1,500 organisations.</p>

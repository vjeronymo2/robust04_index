			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Batyrev] </F>   [Text] Paris January 20 TASS -- Our present visit to France  is highly unusual because Georgia is now very much interested in  establishing new relationships with its partners, and we attach  great importance to this trip, Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze told ITAR-TASS upon arriving in France for a  two-day visit.    Georgia became an independent state only recently and quite  naturally we seek to build our new equitable relations with  other sovereign states by developing a solid legal framework for  them, the Georgian leader said about the aim of his visit to  France.    During his two-day visit Shevardnadze will be received by  French President Francois Mitterrand and sign with him a treaty  of accord, friendship and cooperation between the two countries,  as well as sign the Paris Charter for a New Europe.    Journalists who met Shevardnadze in Paris pestered him with  questions about prospects for relations between Georgia and  Russia. "Directly upon my return home, I will begin preparations  for a very important event -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  visit to Tbilisi," Shevardnadze said. Yeltsin's trip to Georgia  is scheduled for the beginning of February.    "We are bound with Russia by many ties, and the Russian  president's visit to Georgia is a major event in many years of  our life," Georgian leader said. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi is  designed to define relations of friendship and cooperation  between the two sovereign states.    "Georgia is now entering a period of stability after the  threat on unleashing a large-scale civil war has been  eliminated", Shevardnadze said. "After we settle the conflict  with, the man task for us is to ensure the country's normal  economic development," he said. One of the principal conditions  needed for progress in this field is Russia's continuous  democratic evolution. If this evolution is disrupted, most  unfavourable developments can ensue, Shevardnadze said.    Also on Thursday [20 January], Shevardnadze met the leaders  of two international organisations based in Paris - Federico  Mayor, Director-general of the United Nations  Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and  Jean Claude Payem, director general of the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development to discuss prospects for  the development of relations between Georgia and UNESCO, Georgia  and OECD. Business cooperation between Georgia and France was  discussed in headquarters of the National Council of French  Entrepreneurs.</p>

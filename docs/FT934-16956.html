			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Conference minefield for Major: David Owen on pitfalls for the prime minister this week at Blackpool CONFERENCE'S first full day on Tuesday could start uncomfortably, with the spotlight firmly on Europe, the issue at the heart of the party's civil war. Tension is unavoidable no matter how soothingly foreign secretary Douglas Hurd urges the party to come together. Mr Major's main headaches will not be confined to the hall. On the fringe, Euro-sceptics Bill Cash, Nicholas Budgen, Richard Shepherd and Teresa Gorman will all be in action, with Mr Cash launching a new Euro-sceptic secretariat: the European Foundation. Lord Tebbit's first appearance of three, at a lunchtime meeting organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward, may produce more problematical headlines. Tuesday is also railway day - when transport secretary John MacGregor may be called to account over the controversial rail privatisation plans. WEDNESDAY THIS could be Mr Major's most comfortable day. His main misfortune is to be deprived of the incapacitated Michael Heseltine to rally the troops before lunch. There may be troubling moments over the government's plans for pensions, tax and public spending in the debate addressed by Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security secretary. On the fringe, the shadow of James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, could haunt Mr Major. It is still not clear what, if anything, the Unionists expect in return for supporting the government in July in a crucial Maastricht vote. The right-left divisions in the party could be highlighted again by Lord Tebbit who will talk to the right-wing Selsdon Group, while two right-wing ministers - Neil Hamilton and Michael Forsyth - will be closely listened to for wayward words when they address Conservative Way Forward. John Biffen, the respected former cabinet minister who is known for speaking his mind, might set the cat among the pigeons at another fringe debate as might Christopher Gill, a Euro-sceptic leader. THURSDAY PROMISES to be the trickiest day so far. No sooner will chancellor Kenneth Clarke have sat down after replying to a debate likely to include calls to rethink plans for VAT on fuel and rule out Budget tax increases altogether, than Norman Lamont, his predecessor, will be on his feet and possibly on the attack. Mr Lamont's appearance is the fringe event the leadership is most fearing, after the former chancellor's criticism of government policy. Baroness Thatcher will also visit the conference, to an adoring welcome from many of the faithful, with her memoirs waiting in the wings. Michael Portillo, the rising star of the right, in fringe appearances on Wednesday and Thursday is expected to map out his agenda on Europe and public spending, which may be different in tone and substance from that of the prime minister. The evening will end with a bust-up to savour: Kenneth Clarke goes head-to-head against Lord Tebbit in a Sunday Telegraph-sponsored debate on the future of Conservatism. FRIDAY THE prime minister's big day. After the divisions of the week over Europe, tax, and the welfare state, Mr Major must give the speech of his life to save his leadership. The prime minister - who is planning to speak without an autocue - is expected to focus on enduring Conservative values such as living within your means and law and order. He is not expected to try to modify his pedestrian style; it is unlikely there will be any rabble rousing. A dutiful standing ovation is guaranteed. But what matters is what the faithful will mutter about his efforts as they munch their sandwiches on the trains home.</p>

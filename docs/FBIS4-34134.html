			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June.    The National Economic Council has decided to cut the  national  investment budget by $198 million because of the international  financial institution's, IFI's, decision to withhold funds from  Panama, including a loan from the Japanese Government that is  tied to a World Bank loan. The reason for this decision is that  Panama has failed to meet certain IFI conditions. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94)    President Guillermo Endara has reported that at a special  cabinet meeting on 9 June, it was decided that there will be  budget cuts in all ministries totalling $269.6 million. Endara  explained that the 1994 budget has been balanced, but that all  ministries will face cuts. The ministries that will be most  affected are health, housing, public works, education, finance,  and agricultural development. The reason for the cuts, Endara  explained, is that the IFI's have suspended the disbursement of  approximately $270 million because Panama has failed to meet  certain requirements, including reducing the state payroll.  Most of the cuts will be in the area of investments.

Preston, president of the  International Reconstruction and Development Bank, detailing  Panama's lingering poverty problem. The letter states that  although the Panamanian economy is making great strides, the gap  between the social classes is widening and poverty remains at  approximately 44 percent. Cardenas and Remon explain that  Panama's economy grew by 9.6 percent in 1991, 8.6 percent in  1992, and approximately 5.9 percent in 1993. In 1992, the  country's per capita GDP rose to $2,412 and investments  increased 20.4 percent. The letter explains that the  government's 1994 investment program earmarks 43 percent of its  resources for social projects and that Panama is one of the  Latin American governments that spend the most on health. The  letter says an effort should be made to reduce poverty to 30 or  35 percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 15A)    The National Bank of Panama collected more than $165 million  in capital during the first four months of 1994, overcoming the  $1.2 million deficit of early 1990. The bank has announced that  its private deposits increased from $158 million in December  1980 to $230.6 million on 30 April 1994. The bank's liquid  assets also increased from 9.7 percent in December 1989 to 61.5  percent on 30 April 1994. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television  in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94)    Federico Humbert, a successful Panamanian businessman, has  accepted President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' challenge to  head an executive office that will promote new foreign  investments in Panama. Addressing members of the Inter-American  Press Association, Perez Balladares said the purpose of the new  office is to change Panama's bureaucratic mindset to one that  will seek foreign capital and be more aggressive. Meanwhile,  Humbert said: "I believe the new government has shown signs that  it will favor a national concerted effort, which is what we all  want to make Panama better for more Panamanians." (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94)    During May, the Colon Free Zone's cumulative sales totalled  $4.131 billion, according to Free Zone statistics. Compared with  the same period in 1993, overall sales increased 15.3 percent;  imports increased 14.1 percent; and exports increased 16.4  percent.

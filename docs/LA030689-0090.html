			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Another Try at Sale: The Philippine government is seeking a negotiated sale for  Nonoc Mining &amp; Industrial Corp., after two public tenders earlier this year  failed to draw an acceptable bid for the mothballed nickel refinery and mine.  </P> <P> The Asset Privatization Trust, which is responsible for the sale, has invited  offers by March 15 from Dallhold Nickel Management, a subsidiary of Australian  businessman Alan Bond's family investment company; Falconbridge Inc. of Canada;  White Rock Corp., which the trust says is acting for South Korean interests,  and Jesus Cabarrus, the 79-year-old former owner of Nonoc, who is claiming in  court that government banks foreclosed illegally in 1983.  </P> <P> The trust rejected bids from Dallhold at the two earlier tenders, which  exceeded the government's $300-million indicative price, because they were not  accompanied by the required deposits.  </P></p>

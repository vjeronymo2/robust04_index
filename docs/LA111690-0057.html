			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH LIKELY TO VETO BILL ON GAS, BIOLOGICAL ARMS  </P> <P> President Bush is likely to veto legislation this week that would impose stiff  penalties on countries or companies that assist in the development of chemical  and biological weapons, White House officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The sensitive legislation has been the subject of a long fight within the  government that has put Bush in a difficult position. As vice president, he  took the lead in proposing global limits on chemical weapons, and as President,  he has continued to press that campaign.  </P> <P> At the heart of the debate is the legislation's use of mandatory sanctions  against countries that produce, acquire or use chemical weapons.  </P> <P> At the White House and State Department, the sanction provisions were seen as  "an invasion of the President's prerogatives" and congressional  "micromanagement" of the Adminstration's conduct of foreign policy, a White  House official said.  </P> <P> "The downside is, you don't want to appear to be soft on chemical weapons when  you're opposing (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein," the official said. Despite  that potential peril, he added, "strong indications are (that) it's going to be  vetoed."  </P> <P> At the Pentagon, officials argued that a veto, coming just as Bush is about to  begin a trip in which he will visit U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving  Day, would demoralize troops already made fearful by Iraq's chemical and  biological weapons arsenal.  </P> <P> The Pentagon agreed that the mandatory sanctions are undesirable, "but it could  be worse," a Pentagon official said. "The bill isn't perfect, but it is  probably as good as you're going to get right now and, if it is vetoed,  Congress could come back with worse."  </P> <P> "We damned it with faint praise, and the State Department was actively against  it," he added.  </P> <P> California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), one of the proponents of the  measure, said the veto would be "a triumph of obstinate ideology over morality  and American interests.  </P> <P> "It will send a signal that chemical weapons use won't be punished," Levine  said in a statement issued by his office. "A veto would undermine the  President's own policy."  </P> <P> The chemical weapons sanctions are contained in a renewal of the Export  Administration Act, which would ease controls on exports to Eastern Europe and  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Bush has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill -- or, as is likely in this  case, let it die because he has not signed it when Congress is not in session,  a so-called pocket veto.  </P> <P> Bush, more than any recent President, has sought to put a public focus on the  issue of chemical weapons. He made the issue a central element in his first  presidential speech to the United Nations in 1989.  </P> <P> Staff writer Melissa Healy contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- At a press conference  tonight [19 April] at the end of the official visit here of  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas, the Bulgarian and  the Swedish foreign ministers were asked to comment on the  latest events in Gorazde.    "We cannot but be concerned by the developments in Gorazde.  We believe that these events have greatly harmed the peace  process and now the international community should be extremely  careful in deciding on its future steps in order to return the  three sides back to the table of talks", Bulgarian Foreign  Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. He recalled the declaration  of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry of April 12, 1994 which says  that the reaction of the international community under UN aegis  in Bosnia is an expression of its determination to do everything  possible for enforcing the respective UN resolutions in defence  of the safe zones and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] personnel  and that this reaction is a signal to the warring sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to start active negotiations for halting the  conflict.    Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said: "The  authority of the United Nations has been questioned in an  unexpected way and what was gained in the agreements around  Sarajevo is beginning to unravel. I think that the United  States, the EU [European Union] and Russia should decide  together on a course of action, that it is extremely important  that this be a joint effort. Certainly the United Nations have  to act with great determination to get the parties back to  negotiations.</p>

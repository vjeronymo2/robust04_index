			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> WEIL WEARS OUT TORRANCE TO BOOST HART INTO QUARTERFINALS, 3-0  </P> <P> In case anyone has doubts, the tireless right arm of Hart High pitcher Kym Weil  still has plenty of innings left in it.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Weil donned her trademark black headband and white hair ribbon, then  blew seven innings worth of fastballs past host Torrance in pitching Hart to a  3-0 victory in the second round of the Southern Section 4-A Division softball  playoffs at Charles Wilson Park in Torrance.  </P> <P> Weil struck out 16 and gave up only four infield singles, improving her season  record to 26-2.  </P> <P> She also added to her Southern Section record for career victories, which  stands at 87.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Hart (27-3) will face Pacifica, a 4-3 winner over Hacienda Heights  Wilson in nine innings, in Friday's quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "The pressure builds every game," Weil said. "Every round we play, the teams we  face get better. But I tend to pitch better under pressure."  </P> <P> Weil pitched a no-hitter last week against Rio Mesa to lift Hart into the  second round, and, Wednesday she lowered her earned-run average to 0.31,  striking out every Torrance batter except leadoff hitter Jenny Yokoyama.  </P> <P> Hart got all the runs it needed in the third. Torrance pitcher Jamie Sibley  walked the first two batters and Nicole White followed with an infield hit to  load the bases.  </P> <P> Yokoyama, Torrance's shortstop, made a throwing error on the next play that  allowed two runs to score.  </P> <P> Hart added an insurance run in the fourth when shortstop Krissy Carpenter drove  home Casey O'Brien with a double down the left-field line.  </P> <P> "We hit the ball hard all game, but mostly it went right at them," Hart Coach  Al Weil said. "So we went to other things, like bunting, to put the ball in  play." STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Senior economists  predicted this week that China's agricultural growth will exceed  four percent this year, the target set by Premier Li Peng in his  government work report in spring this year.    Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and  the State Statistics Bureau said that if there are no serious  disasters agriculture will grow by five percent -- and possibly  by 6.5 percent.    They noted that the output of cereals and cotton will see a  stable growth. For cereals, the rise is expected to be 6.5  billion kg over last year.    Sufficient cereal stockpiles in both state and farmers'  granaries will maintain a balance between supply and demand, the  experts said.    The per capita income of rural people will increase by three  percent to four percent, to reach about 1,032 yuan. And the  total output of rural and township enterprises will grow by 25  percent to 30 percent.    The economists said the expansion of the rural economy is  backed by a set of government policies and measures to protect  farmers' interests, increasing investment in agriculture by the  state, measures to stabilize the planted grain and cotton  acreages, and special government loans to support key counties  producing grain and cotton.</p>

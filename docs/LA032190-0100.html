			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> A REFEREE IN THE CORNER OF L. A.'S ELDERLY  </P> <P> Doris Lindsey of Woodland Hills recalled the time she was summoned by an  octogenarian woman in a nursing home. The problem was a hearing aid.  </P> <P> "She had been having trouble adjusting hers. And for some reason, her  conservator, who was her cousin, would take the hearing aid home with him after  every time he visited.  </P> <P> "She complained to me, and when I had verified that the story was true . . . I  sought out the cousin, and now that woman has her hearing aid with her in the  nursing home all the time." Lindsey is a Los Angeles city volunteer in a  nationwide program that provides residents in nursing, retirement and day-care  homes -- and their relatives or friends -- with someone to turn to if problems  crop up: the Long-Term Care Ombudsman.  </P> <P> The federally funded program has been in effect about 10 years, according to  the city's program coordinator, Charisse Anderson-Rollins, but it has only been  with the recent, continuing increase in the number of older people in the  population that its caseload has grown tremendously.  </P> <P> The city has about 480 licensed skilled nursing homes, residential care  facilities for the elderly and adult day health centers, with about 35,000  residents, according to Natalie Miles-Thompson, associate executive director of  WISE Senior Services in Santa Monica, which administers both the city and  county ombudsman program. And the other incorporated cities and unincorporated  areas of the county have an additional 500 homes and care facilities,  Miles-Thompson said, with about 40,000 residents.  </P> <P> (The toll-free phone number for general program information and to learn the  location of a specific local office is (800) 334-9473.)  </P> <P> According to state law, each facility must conspicuously post a notice  regarding the availability of a public ombudsman, who is empowered to serve as  an advocate and to assist with complaints.  </P> <P> The problem, for example, might involve a person with diabetes who feels he or  she is getting foods containing sugar. The individual will be interviewed,  medical records may be checked. Sometimes the complaints have a basis in fact,  sometimes not, Anderson-Rollins said.  </P> <P> This is the way the city program works, according to Anderson-Rollins (the  county setup is similar):  </P> <P> "When we get a complaint, either by phone or in the mail, we assign a staff  ombudsman or a volunteer to investigate. It is a state law violation per se if  a facility denies access (to the ombudsman) or interferes with the  investigation."  </P> <P> The problem is a shortage of people to investigate complaints. The city, for  instance, has five part-timers on the staff. It has 25 active volunteers -- at  least 90 are being sought. The office receives about 375 complaints a month.  The county averages 480 a month, has 120 volunteers and needs 200.  </P> <P> Volunteers must complete a 36-hour training class and are asked to donate four  hours a week. "The attrition rate of ombudsmen is high," Anderson-Rollins said.  "It's the stress and burnout."  </P> <P> In the state of California, she added, the number of volunteer ombudsmen has  dropped from about 1,000 to 700 last year.  </P> <P> Lindsey, a volunteer for three years, said she usually winds up putting in  eight to 10 hours a week. Although, eventually, everything is investigated, a  facility isn't always found to be at fault:  </P> <P> "One lady in her 70s had bumped her head on the bedrail and had blackened her  eye. A couple of days later, a worker was feeding her, and she bit one of his  fingers. Her daughter called, thinking the black eye had resulted from the  biting," Lindsey said, meaning abuse was involved.  </P> <P> Allegations of elder abuse get top priority, Miles-Thompson said, but in this  instance the ombudsman determined the black eye had occurred two days before  the biting.  </P> <P> Eleanor Countee, one of the city staff members, commented: "We are the foot  soldiers. We go out and do the fighting. Sometimes I have a nursing home  representative, and the patient, and a family member together -- and I act as  the referee."  </P> <P> She added that she currently has 40 cases at different stages of resolution. "I  do only 20 hours a week -- on purpose. After about 16 hours of it, I start  feeling the depression and stress."  </P> <P> Anderson-Rollins said there are occasional cases where some patients "will  decide to gang up on the administration, out of frustration and loneliness.  That is why it is important to have resident council meetings where gripes can  be aired and to have a good social activity calendar."  </P> <P> Julia Biderman, a staff ombudsman whose area encompasses the East San Fernando  Valley, said one of her cases involves a 76-year-old widow who claims that when  she left one retirement facility for another, the former one refused to refund  her $280 deposit.  </P> <P> Biderman said she has gotten in touch with the administrators at the home and  that they have promised to refund the money.  </P> <P> Eileen Greene is a former volunteer who now teaches volunteers during their  required training.  </P> <P> "We need them, but I have to know their motivations. I want to see if they  truly care about older people, if they have compassion, and an average amount  of intelligence."  </P> <P> Years ago, she said, "if there was a problem at a facility, there was nobody  for a resident to turn to. So you didn't rock the boat."  </P> <P> Anderson-Rollins said there has been an increase in complaints regarding  over-medication and the administering of improper medication.  </P> <P> "The residents themselves often don't know, that's the sad part," she said. "We  get complaints from people visiting them and noticing physical or personality  changes. Also, we get anonymous tips from people inside a facility, who are  afraid of retaliation."  </P> <P> Richard L. Thorpe, executive vice president of the Alexandria, Va.-based  American College of Health Care Administrators, noted that good facilities  welcome the presence of an ombudsman.  </P> <P> Thorpe, whose society of long-term care administrators has 6,500 members  nationwide, added that the highest level of care "can be done only with the  collective action of staff, patients, families, and their representatives --  the ombudsmen. We also view the ombudsman as a mediator, not only representing  the patient, but the facility."  </P></p>

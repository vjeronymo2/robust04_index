			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Olivier Provost and Sophie Seroussi: "Industrial </F> Contracts: Arms at Half-Mast, Civil Sector Optimistic"]    [Text] Following the decision by the Matignon [prime  minister's office] to cease arms sales to Taiwan and -- like  Bonn -- to opt clearly for Beijing, two contrasting analyses can  be heard in French defense circles. The first -- defended by  those close to the prime minister -- is that "France has already  sold a good half -- if not three quarters -- of the military  equipment for which it could find a market in Taiwan. Just a  few opportunities remained, helicopters, armored vehicles." The  decision in favor of Beijing does not therefore mean the loss of  future eldorados. In any event, the Taiwanese arms market is  saturated for the next two years and a lot can happen at the  diplomatic level in the meantime. It should also be remembered  that Paris recently sold 60 Mirage 2000-5's and 1,500 missiles  worth 30 billion francs [Fr] to Taipei. Plus 16 frigates worth  Fr28 billion, the arms for which -- worth a further Fr10  billion -- were the subject of the final authorization from  Paris for arms sales to Taipei, in October 1993. This  authorization should not be in any doubt.    The second interpretation is that Balladur has just pulled  the rug out from under the French arms manufacturers such as the  manufacturers of armored vehicles, Panhard or RVI [expansion not  given], but above all the Matra missile manufacturer, which  dreamed of equipping -- in addition to the Mirages -- the 150  U.S. aircraft also purchased by Taipei. There is great  disappointment at Dassault. The aircraft manufacturer was  hoping to be supplying a further batch of 60 Mirages in the long  term. In addition, the France's support for Taiwan --while  Beijing was arming Iran -- served to reassure other possible  customers (Malaysia, Arab states). Finally, the contract for the  60 Mirages contains a cancelation clause "for technical reasons"  valid for the first 18 aircraft, and this could now jeopardize  the complete deal.  <H5>  News Greeted With Enthusiasm </H5>   In the civil sector, French manufacturers are now rejoicing  after having been denied their share of the Chinese economic  boom for the past two years. The images of German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl returning from Beijing in November with contracts  worth Fr16 billion no doubt had a lot to do with the decision.  Not a day has passed without the Matignon and ministers being  besieged by industrialists, furious at not being able to profit  along with their European competitors from China's economic  boom. Last year, the Chinese gold mine brought orders for  foreign firms worth nearly Fr600 billion!    Since the signature of the final arms contracts with Taiwan,  everything had been blocked: loss of the Canton underground  railway market which GEC Alsthom had its eyes on and which went  to the Germans, the blocking of contracts worth Fr2 billion for  Alcatel CIT for telephone exchanges, and of the new nuclear  power station at Daya-Bay which Framatome had hoped to win. In  order to sell any aircraft, Airbus had to go through Deutsche  Aerospace. Today it is celebrating: The 12 planes sold to  Taiwan are nothing compared to the 35 now ordered by the Chinese  and the 200 Airbuses they hope to sell by the year 2005. In  all, according to the CNPF [National Council of French  Employers], between Fr3 and 6 billion were lost in 1993 on major  contracts in China. Which gives some idea of the enthusiasm  with which French manufacturers greeted the news. "The Chinese  market is far larger than the Taiwanese market," Alcatel Alsthom  is pleased to report. Rather than shedding any tears over the  nuclear power station and the Taiwan high-speed train, the group  prefers to look to the future. As do the other French  manufacturers who are counting on winning potential contracts  worth tens of billions of francs in the automobile industry,  railway equipment, environment, telecommunications, and  buildings and public works sectors.</p>

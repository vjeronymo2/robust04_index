			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Celltech to float with Pounds 176m tag Celltech, the emerging bio-technology company, yesterday raised Pounds 50m in a placing of shares at 250p in the largest flotation this new UK sector has yet seen. The size of the float was lower than the company had originally hoped for as market conditions had proved 'quite challenging' and the new issue market had gone off the boil, according to Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive. The company will have a market capitalisation at this price of Pounds 176.5m. While the entire 20m share placing was underwritten by Barings, 7m of the shares were placed subject to clawback by the public. The closing date for applications is December 2. Celltech will retain Pounds 27.3m after expenses while the British &amp; Commonwealth administrator's stake after share sales falls from 36.4 per cent to 19.9 per cent. B&amp;C and the Prudential and Montagu Equity, which also sold shares, have agreed not to sell any more for a year. Mr Fellner said he was pleased with level of interest and the fact that Celltech had raised what it was seeking for its R&amp;D programme. The management is not selling any shares and directors have said they will be applying for 29,000 in the public offer. Just over a quarter of the issue was distributed in Switzerland by Swiss Bank Corporation, and the rest by Cazenove in the UK. COMMENT While the Pounds 50m float is less than the company had hoped for, Celltech has nevertheless successfully raised what it needs for its R&amp;D programme. A bigger float would, however, have led to a smaller overhang in the market from the stake retained by British &amp; Commonwealth. The importance of this is diminished, however, when one considers that no investor should be looking to invest in Celltech - or any of the high risk new bio-technology drug companies - with anything but a long-term view. If the US experience is any guide, one of the newly floated bio-tech companies is likely to succeed with super returns. And Celltech may have gone further than most in reducing the risks by securing a strong source of internally generated cash to slow the rate R&amp;D consumes cash. But it is questionable whether investors really have a big enough choice of companies in the UK from which to construct a truly risk-reducing portfolio. Sophisticated investors might well buy Celltech, but they would be well advised to consider constructing a portfolio that included some US bio-technology stocks as well.</p>

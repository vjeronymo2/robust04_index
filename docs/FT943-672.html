			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Observer: Director's tonic Is Glaxo about to get a grip on its legendary payouts to top directors? Over the past two years it has paid or made provisions to pay more than Pounds 17m to three outgoing directors. The big winner is chairman Sir Paul Girolami, with Pounds 9.6m in pay, bonuses and pension contributions. Then come Ernest Mario, former chief executive, with Pounds 5m, and Arthur Pappas, head of Glaxo's Canadian and Latin American operations until this year, with more than Pounds 2m. Today's team members are comparative paupers. Mario's replacement is Sir Richard Sykes, whose Pounds 930,000 pay package is one third less than Mario's. The company is yet to name a non-executive chairman - there are strong indications that the choice will be Sir Colin Corness, chairman of Redland - at, say, Pounds 100,000 a year. Even so, if any of the new boys slips off his perch or decides to take early retirement, Glaxo shareholders deserve to know the potential scale of the pay-offs before the event, rather than after.</p>

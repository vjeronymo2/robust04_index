			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goals in &sect;135.30 apply to the entire amount of the section 3 covered assistance awarded to a recipient in any Federal Fiscal Year commencing with the first Federal Fiscal Year (FY) following the effective date of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goals in &sect;135.30 apply to ``new hires'' (i.e., that is person in new employment opportunities generated from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance). The interim rule defines ``new hires'' to mean full-time positions that are permanent, temporary or seasonal. The interim rule makes clear that the employment opportunities with which the numerical goal concept is concerned are those full-time positions generated from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance. The Department recognizes that the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance may generate part-time employment opportunities, either of a permanent, temporary or seasonal nature, and these opportunities are addressed in &sect;135.40, entitled ``Providing Other Economic Opportunities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 135.30 provides for the goals to increase in percentage over a period of three years. For example, for FY 1995, recipients of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance must commit to employ low- and very low-income persons as 10 percent of the aggregate number of new hires they make. This percentage increases to 20 percent in FY 1996, and to 30 percent in FY 1997 and thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 135.30 also provides that a recipient that meets the minimum numerical goals set forth in this section will be considered to have complied with the section 3 preference requirements, absent evidence to the contrary. The following provides an example of how a recipient may meet the minimum numerical goals, but found not to be in compliance with the section 3 preference requirements. A recipient meets the 10 percent minimum goals by employing section 3 residents in new entry level positions that the recipient has available in connection with work on a section 3 covered project. However, the recipient made no effort to employ, and does not employ, section 3 residents in more skilled positions that the recipient also had available. That is, the recipient made no effort to make section 3 residents aware that these positions were available, or to encourage section 3 residents to apply for these positions. Again, section 3 requires that, to the greatest extent feasible, recipients and contractors will give  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  employment opportunities generated from the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance to section 3 residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The efforts to employ section 3 residents applies to all new employment opportunities, at all levels. The efforts to award contracts to section 3 business concerns applies to all contracts to be awarded. In the example provided above, if the recipient that met the 10 percent numerical goal, strived, to the greatest extent feasible, to provide all available employment opportunities to section 3 residents, and if the skills, previous work experience, or education of the those residents who applied for the jobs only met the qualifications for entry-level positions, then there is no evidence contradicting that the recipient is in compliance with section 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 135.30 also provides that in evaluating compliance with section 3 as provided in subpart D (which addresses both the Department's compliance reviews, and complaints filed by section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns), a recipient that has not met the numerical goals has the burden of demonstrating why it was not feasible to meet the goals. Such justification would include not only a description of actions taken to hire or contract with low- and very low-income persons, but also impediments encountered despite efforts undertaken. In demonstrating why it was not feasible to meet the numerical goals, a recipient or contractor also can indicate other economic opportunities provided to section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns, as addressed in &sect;135.40 (other economic opportunities provided to residents and business concerns in an effort to comply with section 3 and the requirements of this part).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The inclusion of numerical goals, and the removal of the various types of best effort and good faith effort activities from the rule, respond to commenters' concerns about little flexibility in implementation of section 3, and the uncertainty about what constitutes compliance with section 3. The interim rule increases flexibility by allowing recipients and contractors to determine the procedures, efforts and activities that work for them in meeting the section 3 preference requirements. The interim rule reduces uncertainty about what constitutes compliance with section 3 by providing recipients and contractors with safe harbor levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department emphasizes that the numerical goals in the interim rule are exactly that_``goals'' that recipients and contractors should strive to reach. The goals are not to be construed as requirements, quotas, set-asides or a cap on hiring or contracting with low- and very low-income persons (e.g., recipients and contractors are not to set aside or reserve ten percent of available jobs for low- and very low-income persons). Consistent with the greatest extent feasible requirement, the Department hopes that recipients and contractors will exceed these goals. The goals, if met, constitute a safe harbor for recipients and contractors on the issue of compliance with section 3 (absent evidence to the contrary, as discussed above). The goals, if not met, do not automatically trigger sanctions against the recipient or contractor. However, if challenged on the issue of compliance with section 3, the recipient or contractor should be ready to demonstrate that it strived, but was unable, to reach the safe harbor levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of numerical goals is the principal reason that the Department is issuing this rule as an interim rule. The Department believes that the low percentage goals that are targets to be met for FY 1995 are achievable by the majority of recipients that will undertake hiring or contracting as a result of the expenditure of section 3 covered assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final section 3 rule, which will be based on additional public comment, will be issued before the goals for FY 1996 are applicable. The Department specifically requests comment from the public on the numerical goals set forth in &sect;135.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

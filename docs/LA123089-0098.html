			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER COMMENT ON BACKING SOVIETS NOW CALLED 'HYPOTHETICAL'  </P> <P> After almost a week of silence, the White House seemed to dismiss as  hypothetical Thursday a remarkable statement by Secretary of State James A.  Baker III that offered support to the Soviet Union if it sent troops into  Romania.  </P> <P> "Baker was responding to a hypothetical situation that became more and more  hypothetical thereafter," a White House spokesman said. "He (Baker) was not  making a planned statement of policy."  </P> <P> Baker's comment, made on a television interview program last weekend, caused  some embarrassment in the State Department and sent a ripple of amazement  through the foreign policy community, where such high-level endorsement for a  Soviet military intervention was seen as unprecedented.  </P> <P> On Thursday, one Administration official indicated that Baker's statement was  made off the cuff without consulting his staff.  </P> <P> The White House continued to decline to say directly whether President Bush  agreed with the position. However, a presidential aide said, "I'm not sure that  if asked today, he (Baker) would answer the question the same way."  </P> <P> Baker was replying to a question on the "Meet the Press" program on the NBC  television network about the bloody fighting between the Romanian army, which  supported the new reform government, and security forces loyal to deposed  dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "We would support efforts to assist the Popular Front for National Salvation  there in Romania. . . . So, I think that we would be inclined, probably, to  follow the lead -- follow the example -- of France, who, today, has said that  if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of the opposition,  that it would support that action."  </P> <P> Asked directly if he would support Soviet intervention against the Ceausescu  forces, Baker replied, "That would be my view, yes."  </P> <P> The remark was soon eclipsed by the Romania army's defeat of the security  forces and the arrest and execution of Ceausescu. Also, the Romanians had said  that they wanted no Soviet military help and the Soviets said that they had no  intention of intervening. But the words may well come back to haunt the United  States one day if the Soviet Union turns into a less stabilizing force in  Eastern Europe than Baker now apparently considers it.  </P> <P> To some degree, Baker's remarks seemed an extension of a similar statement he  made several weeks earlier regarding unrest in the Soviet Union. He had  indicated sympathy in case Moscow used force in some circumstances.  </P> <P> The United States would be understanding, he said, if the Soviets imposed  martial law to prevent hostile ethnic groups, such as Armenians and  Azerbaijanis, from killing each other. On the other hand, "we would have great  trouble," he said, if peaceful demonstrators were crushed by Red Army tanks.  </P> <P> Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former senior official in the Richard M. Nixon  Administration who is now at the Brookings Institution think-tank, said that  "Baker seems obsessed with stability and with the idea that only the Soviets  can keep order in Eastern Europe. This is the second time he seemed to invite  the Soviets to use force, and I find his statements uncalled for, unnecessary  and unwise."  </P> <P> Sonnenfeldt, who himself once was accused of seeing too much good in the order  enforced by the Soviets in Eastern Europe, said that "we shouldn't give the  Soviets a blank check," as Baker appeared to do.  </P> <P> "Their reputation for intervention is bad, whatever their present behavior, so  let's not assume they are the policemen for that part of the world. Let's not  cling to that anachronism," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrageurs lift Nikkei as Shanghai fears witch-hunt Share prices gained ground on arbitrage buying and the Nikkei index closed marginally higher, in spite of profit-taking by corporate investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 59.11 to 20,148.83 after a low of 20,042.81 in the morning session and a high of 20,176.64 in the late afternoon. Heavy index-linked selling by financial institutions and profit-taking by corporations depressed prices in the morning, but the index saw later support from arbitrageurs, overseas investors and some individuals. Traders said that some of the increased activity was linked to the October options settlement today. However, the yen's rise against the dollar had little impact on investor confidence. Volume rose above 300m shares for the first time since September 22, totalling 350m against 287m. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 5.56 to 1,606.16 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.96 to 294.18. Advances led losses by 631 to 353, with 182 issues remaining unchanged. In London ,the ISE/Nikkei 50 index climbed 2.25 to 1,324.13. In spite of the rise in activity, domestic institutions remained cautious. However, foreign investors continued to buy steels and chemicals. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y395 and Kawasaki Steel added Y6 to Y452. Mitsubishi Chemical gained Y9 to Y576. Mitsubishi Bank fell Y50 to Y2,570 following the rise on Wednesday after its announcement that it was taking a large stake in Nippon Trust Bank. Leading credit rating agencies announced that they would review Mitsubishi's rating for a possible downgrading of its long-term debts. Other banks were higher, with Industrial Bank of Japan up Y10 to Y3,070 and Sakura Bank adding Y10 to Y1,320. In Osaka, the OSE average rose for the sixth consecutive day supported by small-capital issues backed by good earnings prospects. The index rose 145.50 to 22,431.69. Roundup A mixed day was seen by the region's markets. Hong Kong and Bombay were closed for public holidays. SEOUL, which is considering allowing foreign companies to list their shares, was higher for the fourth straight day on across-the-board buying which took the composite index 6.88 ahead to another record close of 1,096.54. Some blue chips, however, posted losses on heavy selling by institutional investors, worried that an overheated rally may cause the government to implement cooling measures. TAIPEI improved a further 2 per cent, led by a strong electronics sector, but brokers said that they expected a consolidation in the short term. The weighted index rose 130.61 to 6,626.39 in turnover of TDollars 84.97bn. Financial stocks reversed early losses to rise on last-minute buying: ICBC gained TDollars 1 to TDollars 97. Blue-chip electronics led the gains, with the computer makers, Acer and ADI up by the 7 per cent limit to TDollars 97 and TDollars 43.4. In contrast, SHANGHAI's A share index fell 11.1 per cent amid fears that an investigation into the source of last week's rumours about the death of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, could become a witch-hunt. The index fell 81.05 to 647.56 in turnover of Yn2.6bn. The rumours prompted institutions and wealthy investors to launch a sell-off of blue-chip Pudong shares, policy-sensitive Beijing companies and influential large shares like Shanghai Petroleum. Investors had begun to build up holdings in these issues in August, prompting a bull run in the A share index which rose by 240 per cent over five weeks. The Shenzhen A index fell 12.87 or 7.8 per cent to 153.26 and the Shanghai B index of shares available to foreigners, dipped 0.28 to 78.61. SINGAPORE was in retreat at the close on profit-taking after recent gains, although many institutional investors were inactive. Brokers said that trading was sombre ahead of yesterday's US producer price data. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 10.49 lower at 2,357.82. Malaysian stocks traded over the counter shaved some gains but ended firm, the UOB OTC index rising 3.18 to 1,249.36. KUALA LUMPUR saw profit-taking after the strong gains of the previous two days, and the composite index eased 1.33 to 1,135.67, with Hong Kong's holiday curbing activity. MANILA gained ground as domestic investors bought property issues, and foreign funds concentrated on blue chips. The composite index rose 20.29 to 2,990.75. Turnover increased slightly to 1.5bn pesos. SYDNEY fell back but closed down off session lows on renewed worries about the economy and weakness in the bond market. The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.7 to 1,998.9, in turnover of ADollars 428m. The market recovered from a low of 1,987.5 in early trading as investors reacted to September unemployment figures, which came in unchanged at 9.5 per cent. Mining stocks were broadly lower, with BHP shedding 2 cents to ADollars 19.54, while MIM lost 6 cents to ADollars 2.73 and Western Mining 14 cents to ADollars 8.</p>

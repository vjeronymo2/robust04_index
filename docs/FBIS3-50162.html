			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The president of the Republic of Croatia  has received Croatian prefects at the Presidential Palace.  President Tudjman informed the prefects about the basic  outlines of Croatia's policies, especially those conducted over  the past couple of days -- the decision on the normalization of  relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and the  talks on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Addressing the prefects, President Tudjman stressed that  they  were the most important officials in Croatia's state system.  Speaking about the historical significance of the present  moment, and the decision to go ahead with the signing of the  agreement on the normalization of relations with the FRY,  President Tudjman underlined that this creates conditions for  the fastest possible reintegration of Croatian territories under  the protection of the peacekeeping forces, that is, under  Serbian occupation, into the constitutional and legal system of  Croatia.    President Tudjman called on all prefects whose counties  border on these regions to contribute to the creation of  conditions for the implementation of these policies.    [Begin Tudjman recording] As you have seen, the government  has already reached decisions on the establishment of telephone  links. You have heard [Tudjman laughs] that their [Serbian]  representatives themselves said they would agree to the opening  of the highway via Okucani [Serb-held town in Slavonia on the  currently-unused Belgrade-Zagreb highway] and a railway line.  They even mentioned the most sensitive issue -- the opening of  the Zagreb-Split railway line via Knin [capital of Serb  Krajina]. I will not go to any pains to emphasize this -- since  they accept this themselves -- if a citizen of ours can feel  free to travel via Knin by train, then the problem is 90 percent  solved. If they [the Serbs] and their representatives -- who  had boasted about Krajina being an independent state -- if they  acknowledge this, then it is obvious that we are getting close  to a peaceful resolution.    Of course, we should not deceive ourselves into believing  that things will go smoothly and we should not completely  discount the possibility that we might be compelled to resort to  other means. Nevertheless, I believe that we are on the right  track, that we have found a way to solve our strategic problem,  to liberate every square inch of Croatian soil, and to satisfy  the demands of the international community, which had proposed  that we refrain from the use of force at all costs. If we were  to opt for the armed liberation of the UNPA [UN Protected  Areas], the international community would seriously consider the  imposition of sanctions. Therefore, those are our interests,  those are the demands of the international community, this is a  victory for our policy, this accelerates the return of our  refugees, this opens up prospects for development in peace.  [end recording]    [Announcer] Pointing out that we are facing serious tasks at  the beginning of this year, President Tudjman called on the  prefects to fully cooperate with the Croatian Government. This  major political victory should be translated into practice  immediately, to the benefit of the Croatian people and the  Croatian state, the Croatian president said.    At the same time, we are trying to conclude an agreement  with  the Bosnian Muslims in order to end the war they are now waging  against the Croats, with the intention of occupying  Croat-populated territories, President Tudjman stressed.    [Begin Tudjman recording] As serious people who must be  informed, I can tell you that Izetbegovic proposed to me that,  he said: Let western Herzegovina be immediately united with  Croatia. But, he said, allow us to have central Bosnia -- those  areas of central Bosnia which are envisaged to be part of the  Croat Republic in the framework of the Union [of Republics] of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. But they [Muslims] are undertaking  large-scale offensives there. They hoped, even over the  Christmas holiday, to conquer these areas -- Novi Travnik,  Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo. But, you see, in these  talks we agreed that of these areas, Kiseljak and Kresevo,  although these are areas with a majority Croatian population,  [they] would remain [as heard] in that Bosniak Muslim republic  in order to satisfy international demands that this Bosniak  Muslim republic -- in the framework of the Union or  independently -- might have the territorial conditions for an  independent existence. But we insisted, and we are insisting,  that that area of central Bosnia -- Novi Travnik, Vitez,  Busovaca -- be part of the Croat republic, or if there is  demarcation [between separate states] they could become areas  within the Croatian state. [end recording]    [Announcer] Noting that this is the beginning of a year that  promises to be even more successful than the previous three,  President Tudjman stressed that we would realize Croatian state  objectives by our consistent policy. In implementing this  policy, we must achieve the unity of the Croatian people,  President Tudjman said.    [Begin Tudjman recording] Let us be consistent in the  implementation of state policy, and let us work for the unity of  Croatian ranks. There may be political and party differences,  but when it is a matter of state interests, there cannot be  several policies but one policy. [end recording]    [Announcer] Speaking about the success of the Croatian  Government in wiping out inflation, President Tudjman said that  this provides a basis for faith in future economic development.  Analyzing the introduction of a new convertible currency, he  recalled that the kuna -- which was the Croatian currency 10  centuries ago, and which will be something to take pride in  because the people will know that for the first time in their  history they will have their own currency -- is being  introduced.    Finally, President Tudjman wished the prefects full success  in their work for the counties and the whole Croatian state.  Also present at the reception were Nikica Valentic, the prime  minister of Croatia, Josip Manolic, the speaker of the Chamber  of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, and other high-ranking  officials of the Republic of Croatia.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce slides Aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was hit by a credit downgrading, which outweighed the feeling that the US might be about to turn buyer of aerospace stocks. The announcement by Moody's Investors Service that it was considering a downgrade of the company's A2 senior debt prompted the shares to slide quickly. Moody's is concerned about persistent weakness of the commercial and military markets for the company's jet engines and engine spares. Later, the market learned that US investment house Lehman Brothers had turned buyer of Boeing. Analysts said that because US shifts tend to revolve around sectors rather than specific stocks there was a chance of Rolls-Royce benefiting from the change of heart. However, Mr Nick Cunningham from SGST said: 'Moody's is pointing to fundamental problems that Rolls-Royce faces. It is a very late cycle industry and people are being overly optimistic.' The shares closed 4 down at 129p. Drugs issue Wellcome fell 13 to 722p as a press report gave an opportunity to mark down the stock. The article said an Aids victim's widow was suing the company and a health authority over her haemophiliac husband's death, which she believed was hastened by Wellcome's anti-Aids drug AZT. An early rise for BAT Industries, helped by a buy note from Japanese house Yamaichi, was cut back by reports that Philip Morris, of the US, might adopt deeper tobacco discounts if needed. BAT finished unchanged at 838p. Conglomerate Lonrho rose 5 1/2 to 93 1/2 p after stating that it had received an acceptable offer for The Observer, the UK Sunday newspaper, from fellow publisher The Guardian and Manchester Evening News. Meyer International surprised the market by a Pounds 70m rights issue, a one-for-four offer at a deeply discounted 290p, to reduce borrowings. The company accompanied the fund-raising with a profits forecast and a warning that the dividend total will be chopped from 16.5p to 10p. The stock fell to 348p immediately following the news but rallied to end only 3 off at 365p. UBS was said to have been an aggressive seller and to have decided that any positive move in the shares after a big rights issue and a severe dividend cut was perverse. The announcement that France had cut both its key rates again by 25 basis points helped companies with heavy exposure to the country, especially marketing and advertising groups, which are geared for early recovery. Aegis put on 5 1/2 at 29 1/2 p and exhibitions organiser Blenheim rose 15 to 535p. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, which is active in France, closed a penny cheaper at 193p: enthusiasm was tempered by a sector review from Kleinwort Benson which featured the stock as its principal sell recommendation. First-half results from Kwik Save were largely in line with market expectations, profits leaping 19 per cent, although it warned that this degree of performance would not be maintained in a tougher second half. This, together with one leading broker warning of the effects of disinflation, left the shares trailing. However, a more positive analysts meeting brought out the bulls, with the group's strong sales growth being pointed up. The shares turned around 23p during the session to finish 4 ahead at 780p. A positive agm statement from Hillsdown Holdings helped the shares forward a penny to 157p. Volume was a hefty 12m. Some investors took another swipe at Boots, this time over worries it was engaging in a price war with Superdrug, owned by Kingfisher. Superdrug is said to be cutting its sun protection product prices by 25 per cent. Supermarket group Tesco was reported to be also making 30 per cent cuts to its sun care range. However, one stores specialist pointed out that the sun protection business was only 5 per cent of Boots' overall sales and that the effect of stiffer price competition would not be great. Boots shares were badly mauled earlier this week when it announced details of dangers attached to using its Manoplax drug. Yesterday, they fell 11 to 451p. Kingfisher slipped 2 to 588p and Tesco 4 1/2 to 217 1/2 p. Worries about possible litigation instigated by US brokerage PaineWebber unsettled Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, which lost 12 to 389p. SG Warburg fell 15 to 643p, with the market said to be unsettled by concern about the group's tax charge. British Gas dipped 2 to 302p after news of the retirement of chairman Mr Bob Evans. Lasmo continued to move ahead, adding 3 at 151p, still boosted by hints that Total's fund-raising earlier this week could prompt corporate activity in the oil sector. Most of the demand for Lasmo came from the US, according to dealers. Premier edged higher to 28 3/4 p after the latest drilling success off the coast of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Regent Inns, reintroduced to the market by stockbroker Greig Middleton after a company restructuring and a placing of shares at 135p, closed at 151p, having touched 165p. Hotel group Forte eased 2 to 190p. Nomura was advising clients to buy the shares as a cyclical recovery play. Guinness recovered from recent underperformance to end 8 up at 476p. Speculation that a bid for engineering group Fenner might be in the air proved well founded. The group confirmed that it has received indications of interest and the shares shot up to 93p before closing marginally firmer at 85p. Wassall, the mini-conglomerate whose name has been linked by the market, shed 3 to 237p.</p>

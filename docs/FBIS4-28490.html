			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshiko Sakurai, critic and TV personality: </F> "Classified Paper on 'Watered-Down Report' of the Hiraiwa  Committee Reveals the 'Evil Influence' of Bureaucrats"]    [Text] The bureaucracy's resistance is blocking reform and  hurting Japan. An unpublished document carried in the June  issue of THIS IS YOMIURI magazine vividly reveals how the  bureaucrats are casting shadows and throwing cold water on the  political leadership.    Following the establishment of the Hosokawa coalition  government, there were calls for establishing an open economy,  and the Economic Reform Study Committee [commonly called the  Hiraiwa Committee] was organized. The Hiraiwa Committee  submitted the interim and final reports on Japanese economic  reform in November and December last year, respectively. The  Hiraiwa Reports were expected to put forward strong guidelines  and concrete plans to stimulate Japan's languishing economy and  open its markets to the international community. However, the  final report was characterized as "watered down."    The Hiraiwa Committee had had two points to discuss. The  first was which character to give supervisory organs in order to  have them steadily carry out deregulation, a pillar of economic  reform. The second point was where to set the deadline for such  deregulation. If these two points are strictly determined, the  regulations will be steadily relaxed; if in the end they are  loosely set, economic reform ultimately will be only so much  fanfare without results.    Let me cite examples from THIS IS YOMIURI on these two  points  and quote the committee members from the bureaucracy to see how  they worked to protect the interests of their particular  government agencies. Following is an argument over the  character to give a third-party organ to supervise the execution  of deregulation.    [Professor Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University] -- It  is  common sense in advanced nations to have an organization that  raises grievances with a government's administrative branch and  discuss matters. A similar supervisory organization is needed  for Japan.    [Yoshihiko Yoshino, presently governor of the Japan  Development Bank and formerly Ministry of Finance [MOF]  administrative vice minister] -- It is very difficult to set up  a third-party organization for the administrative branch of  government. It is going too far to have one with the character  of the Fourth Estate completely independent of the  administration or one that can go into administrative agencies  and inspect them.    [Kenichi Kakudo, chairman of Norin Chukin--the Central Bank  for Agriculture and Forestry--and Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] vice minister] -- It is an  extraordinarily serious issue for an independent third-party  organ to go into administrative agencies and inspect them.    These arguments well convey the determination of committee  members from the bureaucracy to prevent others from doing  anything to the place of origin, the executive branch. Other  committee members, who were not bureaucrats, made the following  remarks regarding this.    [Toshio Suzuki, chairman of the Nomura Research Institute]  --  It will probably be better for Diet members themselves to  propose legislation on establishing a third-party organ.    Since the administrative branch is responsible for carrying  out deregulation, there is no sense in having a supervisory  organ created on the administrative side. It is self-evident  that the legislative branch should establish such an  organization. But committee members originating in the  bureaucracy again put up a fierce resistance.    [Former MOF Vice Minister Yoshino] -- What in the world do  you mean by your calling for a legislative proposal devised by  Diet members for establishing a third-party organ? If you mean  that the government cannot be trusted, there is no meaning in  having this group make suggestions to the government. It goes  too far to propose a legislative bill.    [Former MAFF Vice Minister Kakudo] -- It is going far too  far.    [Suzuki] The idea did not come from distrust of the  government. I would like to have the legislative branch have  responsibility in this matter.    Through these debates, the third-party organ in charge of  promoting and supervising deregulation was defined as "a strong  organization, based on law, with its own independent office and  the right to making recommendations." But as a matter of fact,  it has become a far less independent entity compared to the Fair  Trade Commission supported by Article 3 of the Law on National  Administrative Organizations.    Next comes the term of carrying out deregulation.    [Suzuki] A five-year term was mentioned on one item. But  there is no other mention of deadlines. I would like to hear  the views of this committee's members.    [Hiroko Ota, visiting associate professor at Osaka  University] It is important to specify deadlines for abolishing  regulations.    [Kakudo] Regulations have their own circumstances and  reasons for how and why they were introduced. So, an  across-the-board deadline (for deregulation) may pose a problem.    In the end, an abstract mention of "a large-scale reduction  in five years" was made in the report.    The report thus was watered down by resistance of the  bureaucracy. The inside document made me feel that the first  step to move away from being a bureaucratic nation is to make  public the circumstances involving the report and to let the  people see for themselves the realities of the bureaucracy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The command of the Russian launch facility of  Plesetsk has admitted that rocket launching causes damage to  nature but has deemed the financial claims excessive. The  Archangel Oblast Environment Protection Committee is suing the  cosmodrome for 1.2 billion rubles over the detachable stages of  launch vehicles that have been falling down for many years near  the coastal village of Koyda carrying remains of fuel.    The case was examined by the arbitration court, which agreed  with the arguments of representatives of the space industry that  the amount of economic damage suffered by the territory should  be calculated more thoroughly. It has been decided to have an  independent inquiry.</p>

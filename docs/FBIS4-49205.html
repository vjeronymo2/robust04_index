			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Shouldering the Historical Mission Straddling </F> This Century and the Next -- In Commemoration of the 75th  Anniversary of the May 4th Movement"]    [Text] Today is the "4 May" Youth Day. We extend our  cordial festival greetings to the young people of various  circles throughout the country!    Young friends, in another six years we will step into the  21st century. At this historical moment, straddling two  centuries, all people who are concerned with the destiny of the  motherland -- and particularly this generation of young people,  who represent the future and hope of the country and nation --  are faced with a question: What kind of attitude should they  adopt in marching toward the new century? In a sense, the  spiritual outlook of this generation of young people will  determine, to a great extent, the future of the Chinese nation  in the coming century. We are faced with tremendous  opportunities for development, as well as stern challenges. The  party and the people ardently hope that the young people of this  generation will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition  of 4 May, have a sense of straddling the centuries, understand  their responsibilities, shoulder the mission, and become a new  generation that has lofty ideals and moral values, that studies  hard, and that builds the country through arduous efforts. In  the years running up to the 21st century, they should let their  youthfulness radiate in the great cause of revitalizing the  Chinese nation.    To shoulder the historical mission of straddling the  centuries, the fundamental thing is to arm the young people with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and to uphold the party's basic line  firmly for 100 years. People can see clearly that the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism for  contemporary China and is the only correct guide for the work of  leading our country toward prosperity. We should stress this  truth frequently and repeatedly, and in connection with vivid  reality, and should tell it to this generation, as well as the  next. From the high plane of the country's future and the  nation's destiny, we should understand the far-reaching  historical significance of applying the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to educating the  generation of young people.    Both comprehensively improving the qualities of this  generation of young people and training large numbers of  outstanding people constitute important tasks for shouldering  the historical mission straddling the centuries. In the final  analysis, competition in the world is one of economic strength  and comprehensive national strength, which is focused on  science, technology, and qualified personnel. To meet the  challenge of the new century, we should vigorously create  conditions to help young people acquire knowledge of science and  technology, as well as of the socialist market economy, and  should endeavor to gain professional proficiency, improve their  labor techniques, and master skills for the modernization  program. Practice is the best classroom for training young  people, and integration with the masses is the only way to raise  young people. We hope that this generation of young people will  inherit the glorious tradition of their predecessors and will go  to the grass-roots levels and hardship posts, the places where  they are most needed for reform and construction. They should  accumulate experience in practice, absorb nutrition, temper  their will, enhance their talents, and make contributions. They  should establish a career and become useful people in the  struggle to revitalize the nation and make the country strong  and powerful.    Molding people with a noble spirit and enhancing young  people's level of socialist spiritual civilization is a major  project that will continue beyond this century. It is necessary  to highlight education in patriotism, collectivism, and  socialism; help young people adopt a correct outlook on the  world and life, as well as correct values; boost their national  dignity and confidence, and the urge to make their country  strong; and resist the corrosion of such decadent ideologies as  money-worship, hedonism, and out-and-out individualism.  Recently, a large number of advanced individuals have come to  the fore among the young generation. Represented by Xu Honggang  and others, they are exemplary in standing up for what is right  and take pleasure in helping others. They have been playing a  positive role in encouraging healthy trends and reversing  unhealthy social trends. It is necessary to guide young people  in learning from heroes and following the correct path; discover  and bring up a larger number of advanced and exemplary  individuals to attract, educate, and inspire the youth; and  greatly upgrade the level of civilization and moral integrity of  young people and of society as a whole.    The Communist Youth League [CYL] is a mass organization of  the youth and it shoulders an important responsibility in  leading young people on their journey into the next century. We  appraise highly the "Youth Civilization Project Beyond This  Century" and the "Young Talent Project Beyond This Century"  being implemented by the CYL. These two projects are in line  with the party's requirements for youth, and with the demands  placed on young people by the reform and construction of the  country. We ardently hope that CYL organizations at all levels  will stand on solid ground, work in a down-to-earth manner,  organize and carry out projects in a painstaking manner, and  strive to gain significant results. Party committees and  governments at all levels should take good care of, and give  energetic support to the CYL in conducting a wide and colorful  variety of activities suited to the characteristics of young  people. Various circles and departments in society should  create still better conditions and environment for the growth of  young people.    Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening  up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the  most important aspects of the work of the whole party and  country this year. The youth-related work should be aligned to  and serve these overall interests. A thousand-mile journey is  begun by taking the first step. From now on, our young friends  should have a sense of urgency which propels them to race  against time. They should have their feet planted in the  present and their eyes on the future, should study and work  diligently with full enthusiasm and a down-to-earth attitude,  and should greet the bell heralding the coming of a new century  by creating excellent achievements that will give them a clear  conscience before the older generations.</p>

Under these three principles the mainland's  overall policy toward Taiwan this year will be -- holding it  back economically, pushing it down militarily, and restricting  its space internationally. As to reunification, the mainland  can take its time. When the economy on the mainland is  developed or even surpasses that of Taiwan in 30 to 40 years,  that will be the right time for a trial of strength.    The mainland's new policy toward Taiwan was discussed and  determined at the national meeting of directors of Taiwan  affairs offices held in Xiamen in December. At the meeting,  participants summed up the year's work toward Taiwan performed  by the Office for Taiwan Affairs and its affiliated departments  and studied the work for further pushing forward the development  of relations across the Taiwan Strait. Qian Qichen, deputy head  of Taiwan Working Group of the CPC Central Committee and vice  premier of the State Council, and Wang Zhaoguo, director of the  Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, delivered important speeches  at the meeting. Their speeches, together with mainland's  assessment of the Taiwan situation and the work orientation  toward Taiwan in the new year, were collated into a document and  transmitted to the Taiwan affairs offices in various localities  level by level.    The document covers several issues, including Taiwan's  political situation, Taiwan's foreign activities, the assessment  of the situation across the strait, the work toward Taiwan, and  so on. In the area of Taiwan's political situation, the  mainland holds that since last year, political developments in  Taiwan have added some unfavorable factors to the reunification  of the motherland. This development is manifested in: 1) the  Taiwanization of the Kuomintang [KMT]; 2) the consolidation of  Li Teng-hui's position; 3) the development of the strength of  the KMT, the Democratic Progressive Party [DPP], the New Party,  personalities of no party affiliation, and so on; and 4) the  increase of the DPP's strength.    Qian Qichen pointed out: The future situation across the  strait is highly variable along with the completion of the KMT's  Taiwanization process and the fulfillment of its reform program  at this stage. Originally, the CPC placed the hope of achieving  the cause of reunification on the Taiwan authorities, but this  should be changed now. We must place more hopes on the Taiwan  people rather than on the Taiwan authorities.    In the analysis of Taiwan's foreign activities, the CPC must  stick to the stand regarding Taiwan's international space for  survival. That is, it is permissible for Taiwan to engage in  economic activities, but Taiwan must be completely excluded from  any political activities. In assessing Taiwan's attempt to  reenter the UN last year, the document stated that "the CPC won  the struggle against Taiwan's entry into the UN," which  indicated that the CPC had a good grasp of Taiwan's strategy in  its analyses. Taiwan intended to rope the Central and South  American countries in with money. Actually, it did not exert  good effects, nor did it yield remarkable results, as some  countries accepted its money on one hand and revealed its doing  to the mainland on the other.    The document mentioned that the talk between the CPC's  General Secretary Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in  Seattle last November meant that the Sino-U.S. relationship had  come out of the blind alley since the 4 June Incident, which  would have a bearing on the mainland's future work toward  Taiwan. Jiang Zemin told Mr. Clinton that China insists on the  stand of one China, and that Taiwan cannot act as a political  entity, only as an economic entity. The document stressed: The  CPC will definitely insist that "there is only one China in the  world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China" as stated in  the White Paper on Taiwan.    According to the comprehensive analysis of the document,  although the situation in Taiwan this year is more complicated  than last year, and the CPC is particularly worried about the  adoption of the direct polls for presidential election and the  voting law for the people, still there are some favorable  factors to the development of relations across the strait as a  whole. These are: The economic growth on the mainland gathered  pace, the CPC's foreign environment took a turn for the better,  there were louder and louder voices for "peaceful contacts"  between the island and the mainland, Taiwan's attitude toward  the "three exchanges" was a bit relaxed, and the "Ku-Wang talks"  were a success.    Besides, Wang Zhaoguo pointed out at the meeting of the  Taiwan affairs office directors: It is necessary to further  step up preparations in various aspects regarding the work  toward Taiwan in the new year, particularly the work toward the  mainstream faction headed by Li Teng-hui. We will absolutely  make no concessions on the issue of the three principles --  insisting on one China, denying international political space to  Taiwan, and refusing give up the use of force. At present, the  conditions of immediately working for political contacts and  "three exchanges" between the two sides of the strait do not  exist. Therefore, what can be done is to hold Taiwan up  economically, improve the mainland's investment climate for  Taiwan investors, make practical preparations for the "three  exchanges," and hold routine discussions to implement the  "Ku-Wang talks." Meanwhile, it is necessary to push Taiwan down  economically while restricting its space internationally.</p>

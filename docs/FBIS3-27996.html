They said LDP President Yohei Kono will meet  with Hosokawa later Wednesday to ask his government to implement  the eight-point package.    The package, adopted by the party's special panel to combat  the recession, includes a proposal for an "early implementation  of major income tax cuts," the officials said.    The proposal did not mention the size of income tax cuts,  but  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the party's Policy Affairs  Research Council, told reporters it should be more than 5  trillion yen.    The program also called for a substantial reduction or a  two-year freeze of the land value tax and urged the  reorganization of financial institutions to improve the nation's  financial system.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> D.C. PLOT NAMED TIAN AN MEN PARK  </P> <P> The Senate voted today to name a grassy plot near the Chinese Embassy in  Washington "Tian An Men Square Park" in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators in  Beijing.  </P> <P> In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the Chinese army,  said Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), who sponsored the legislation, the action  serves "to remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the  ruthlessness and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their  citizen-demonstrators and their aspirations." The amendment was added by voice  vote to a bill authorizing State Department programs for the new budget year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ECONOMY UP AT ANNUAL 2.5% RATE IN SPITE OF TRADE DROP, HURRICANE  </P> <P> The U.S. economy grew at a moderate annual rate of 2.5% from July through  September despite the poorest trade performance in six years and a $4-billion  income loss from Hurricane Hugo, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the increase in the gross national product, the  broadest measure of economic health, matched a 2.5% rise in the April-June  quarter. Third-quarter growth was aided primarily by a boom in consumer  spending that resulted from heavy car sales.  </P> <P> Inflation showed a marked improvement in the third quarter, with a price index  tied to the GNP climbing at an annual rate of just 2.9%, down significantly  from a 4.9% annual advance in the first half of the year.  </P> <P> Michael Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, said the  moderate economic growth and lower inflation offer encouraging signs that the  nation's record peacetime expansion will extend into the next decade.  </P> <P> The lower inflation rate is "creating appropriate conditions for stronger  non-inflationary growth as the decade of the 1990s unfolds," Darby said.  </P> <P> Through the first nine months of 1989, the economy has grown at an annual rate  of 2.9%, exactly on target with the Bush Administration's forecast for the  whole year.  </P> <P> But many analysts are predicting that growth will slump dramatically in the  final three months of this year in the absence of the auto sales boom that  spurred consumer spending from July through September.  </P> <P> Many economists predict the country will flirt with a possible recession over  the next 12 months because of expected weakness in such areas as trade and  business investment.  </P> <P> Signs of deterioration were evident in the third quarter as the U.S. trade  deficit, as measured by the GNP, surged by $22.9 billion. It was the worst  trade figure since the second quarter of 1983.  </P> <P> Trade had been one of the economy's brightest spots as a boom in export sales  spurred a rebound in U.S. manufacturing. However, economists have warned for  some time that hefty increases in the value of the dollar threatened to derail  the trade improvement by making American goods more expensive on overseas  markets.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, imports shot up at an annual rate of 15.1% while exports  did not grow at all, the poorest showing since early 1986.  </P></p>

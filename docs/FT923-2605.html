			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Lobby on performance pay A GROUP of large British companies led by Wellcome, the pharmaceutical company, is to lobby urgently for changes in legislation on profit-related pay after a sudden reversal of Inland Revenue practice last month. In an unexpected statement in July, the Revenue issued a statement of practice that disqualified from tax relief profit-related pay schemes using certain formulae that it had previously allowed. Mr Neville Machin, Wellcome's group employee relations manager, expressed frustration that the Revenue's plans will bar its scheme, which it has drawn up after several years' negotiations with the Revenue. Wellcome had used a formula to calculate its scheme, which was geared to rewarding improved rather than static performance. Although tax relief for the current year is not affected, the scheme will in future be disqualified. Employees in approved schemes can receive the lower of Pounds 4,000 or 20 per cent of their salary tax-free. The number of approved schemes more than doubled from 1,277 to 2,597 in the year to March 1992. The number of employees covered rose from 350,100 to 718,069 during the period. 'If you read between the lines, what happened is the Revenue's advisers said that the schemes they had been approving did not conform to the legislation,' Mr Machin said. 'You should not be using fiscal stimuli to reward static performance. If you make Pounds 100m and have agreed 5 per cent profit-related pay, then make Pounds 100m the next year, you have gone backwards,' he said. Wives can now apply to the Inland Revenue to receive all or half of the married couple's allowance, after changes announced in the budget earlier this year. The Revenue has issued a new document - Form 18 - which should be completed before April 6 next year, when the new system begins. Under the new arrangement, the wife is eligible to receive half - or, with the consent of her husband, all - of the basic Pounds 1,720 allowance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy and Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Liberals and some pro-China figures reacted with  disappointment and regret at China's withdrawal of an invitation  to Anthony Cheung Bing-leung to become a Hong Kong affairs  adviser following his move to align himself with the United  Democrats, whom China considers subversive. The action came  just one week before the Meeting Point chairman was due to be  formally appointed at a ceremony in Beijing.    Frederick Fung Kin-kee, the other leading liberal appointed  as an adviser, said the decision was irrational and "too  leftist." Mr Fung is chairman of the Association for Democracy  and People's Livelihood.    Some pro-China figures also regretted the decision.    Professor Lau Siu-kai, a Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)  member, said it would deal a blow to people who wanted to  improve relations with Beijing, and undermine China's ability to  expand its united front. "If China has made the move in an  attempt to isolate a few members in the United Democrats of Hong  Kong, I regret it," he said.    Another PWC member, Xu Simin, said the sacking would give  Hong Kong people an impression that China was narrow-minded.    China said Mr Cheung's allegiance to the new coalition --  the  Democratic Party -- deviated from Beijing's policy of appointing  advisers on the basis of their personal capacity.    Mr Cheung said the real reason for his dismissal was his  leading role in the Democratic Party, which is being formed by  the merging of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He  described Beijing's decision as "illogical, unacceptable, and  short-sighted".    Mr Cheung said yesterday he was told by a local Xinhua (New  China News Agency) official on Wednesday that his offer had been  withdrawn because his stance was in breach of the principles of  appointment. "It's quite obvious that it (the dismissal) has  something to do with the new party," he said. Mr Cheung said  that Weng Xingqiao, head of Xinhua's department of education,  science, and technology, had told him that China did not share  his view that he should consult the Democratic Party about his  appointment as an adviser.    Mr Weng also told him that Meeting Point's call for an  amendment to the Basic Law contradicted the role of the advisers  to promote the post-1997 charter.    Mr Cheung said he had told mainland officials that he would  have to consult Meeting Point on the appointment well before he  was given the offer. "This applies equally to me when I become  a Democratic Party member," he said. "If I am dismissed on such  grounds, what about Allen Lee Peng-fei of the Liberal Party and  Fredenck Fung Kin-kee of the Association for Democracy and  People's Livelihood? They have both, understandably, consulted  their own parties before becoming China advisers."    Mr Cheung said it would be a pity for Hong Kong if only  those  who stood by the official policies were recruited. "People will  question why, in order to be an adviser, one has to fulfil so  many criteria, and whether one could not hold dissenting views  as an adviser."    China believes that accepting Mr Cheung as a party  representative would turn the advisers group into a  "battlefield" for political forces.</p>

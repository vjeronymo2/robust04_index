			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Roche registers steady growth ROCHE, the Basle-based pharmaceutical group, said consolidated sales reached SFr12.9bn (Dollars 9bn) in 1992, 13 per cent higher than in 1991. There was a 'gratifying improvement' in operations which, together with healthy income from investments, resulted in 'another considerable growth in group profits'. All divisions contributed to the good result. Pharmaceutical sales were up 16 per cent to SFr6.9bn, with sales of Rocephin, Dormicum, Roferon-A, Rivotril and Furtulon showing strong volume growth. Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals rose 13 per cent to SFr3.1bn. Growing scientific evidence of the prophylactic effect of important vitamins led to a rise in the sales volume of vitamin E, vitamin B6, folic acid and beta-carotene. Diagnostic product revenues gained 9 per cent to SFr1.55bn, due to the contribution of US service laboratories. Lex, Page 24</p>

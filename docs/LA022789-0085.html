			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S AND NASAL NERVES  </P> <P> People with Alzheimer's disease show abnormal nerve fibers in the nose, a  finding that may lead to a diagnostic test and a new avenue of research for  finding a treatment, a study suggests. Nasal nerve tissue can be removed under  local anesthetic, which may offer a way to study the brain disease early in its  course, said researcher Barbara Talamo, director of the neurosciences program  at Tufts Medical School in Boston.  </P> <P> That could lead to the first definitive test for diagnosing Alzheimer's in a  living patient and allow studies of the disease in living nerve tissue,  possibly giving hints for treatment, she said. Alzheimer's experts familiar  with the research are skeptical about prospects for a diagnostic test, but they  agree that studying the nerve tissue may be useful.  </P> <P> She described the new research in the British journal Nature with colleagues  there and scientists from Harvard Medical School and the University of  Pennsylvania Medical School. The new study focused on nerves found at the top  of the nose within the inner lining, where they are responsible for detecting  odors. The nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion of the brain  that is affected by Alzheimer's disease, Talamo said.  </P></p>

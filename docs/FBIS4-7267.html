			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- The Hosokawa cabinet,  which resigned en masse on Monday [25 April], was temporarily  resuscitated Tuesday night to deal with issues surrounding the  crash of a China Airlines jetliner at Nagoya Airport in which  some 220 people died.    Setting aside the differences that have brought Japan's  political machine in Tokyo to a virtual standstill, former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ex-cabinet ministers of  different political stripes were busy contacting each other to  keep abreast of developments in the air disaster.    At a hastily arranged emergency cabinet session, Transport  Minister Shigeru Ito, of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan,  SDPJ] (SDP), was appointed head of a special task force to  oversee the government's handling of the plane crash, government  officials said.    Ito and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, also of the SDP,  will arrive in Nagoya Airport early Wednesday by helicopter.    The SDP said early Tuesday it was quitting the post-Hosokawa  coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata due to the  sudden formation by five parties of an intraparliamentary group  of which it was not informed.    Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary under the  Hosokawa cabinet, was also involved in the China Airlines plane  case, telling reporters, "politics is in an unusual stage, but  we want to deal with (the issue) without delay."    Under the Japanese Constitution, the departing cabinet has  the responsibility to handle major day-to-day operations until  the incoming administration is fully in place.</p>

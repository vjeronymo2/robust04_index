			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- According to Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, the German Government intends to adhere to a forces  strength of 370,000 for the Bundeswehr. This figure "is and  remains our basic position," Kohl said today at a conference on  security policy in Munich. The actual Bundeswehr strength will  average 361,000 during the current year, and probably higher at  the end of the year. The personnel level of the Bundeswehr had  fluctuated by 30,000 in previous years, Kohl said. The goal  must be "to stay around the 370,000 level."    Account will be taken of this trend in drawing up the 1994  budget, Kohl announced. At the same time, he countered  criticism from the United States that Germany is doing too  little for military defense. In this context, account also has  to be taken of the other achievements Germany has contributed to  European stability. Kohl drew attention to statistics from the  Canadian Government, according to which: since 1989 Germany has  provided $341 per capita to support the countries of the former  Soviet Union, while Canada has provided $67, France $34, Italy  $31, the United States $30, Japan $5, and Great Britain only $1.    Kohl responded with annoyance to reproaches that Germany is  primarily promoting the dissemination and development of  chemical weapons. It is "disproportionate" for Germany to be  cited on every occasion of this kind, while in the shadow of  this discussion,others are able to continue their deals, the  chancellor said. In addition, Kohl drew attention to the "time  bombs" in the form of dangerous nuclear reactors in eastern  Europe. It is "astonishing" which countries are concluding  energy supply agreements with the countries where such plants  are located. Indeed, the "degree of strange calm" with which  Europe and Japan are accepting these time bombs is generally  "incomprehensible."    Kohl strongly rejected the view that the Russian people are  "incapable of democracy in the long term." It is "completely  absurd" to expect Russia to introduce democracy and the market  economy overnight, Kohl said. If the West denies the Russian  people these opportunities from the outset, "nothing can come of  it." The chancellor again called for western markets to be  opened up to products from eastern Europe. It is a "fairly  hypocritical policy" to hold out the prospect of involvement in  NATO, but to cut oneself off from products.</p>

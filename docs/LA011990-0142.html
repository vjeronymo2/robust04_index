			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Two Competing Pipeline Proposals OKd: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  approved permits for two competing proposals to build a natural gas pipeline to  California. The permits were granted for the Wyoming-California Pipeline Co.  and the Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which both hope to build a line from  southwest Wyoming to Kern County. Both firms still must satisfy the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service that the lines will not damage the California habitat of  the endangered desert tortoise and win the approval of the California Public  Utilities Commission.  </P></p>

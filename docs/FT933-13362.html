			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major tested by establishment thorn in his side - Gillian Tett says simple questions lie at the heart of Lord Rees-Mogg's move for judicial review of the Maastricht treaty EVEN IF short-term politics was the motive for Lord Rees-Mogg's application for judicial review of the Maastricht ratification, his decision to take the political battle to the courts has revived a legal debate which has dogged the constitution for centuries. The questions at the heart of his application are relatively simple. How far can the government operate independently from parliament? And in the absence of a written constitution, who decides whether government or parliament is more powerful? Professor Michael Zander, a constitutional expert at the London School of Economics, said: 'It's a major constitutional issue that has been raised. If Lord Rees-Mogg succeeds it would put the government in very serious difficulties.' Lord Rees-Mogg's case is based on the argument that the bill before parliament does not exactly match the Maastricht treaty signed by Mr John Major last year. Lord Rees-Mogg argues that the government does not have the right to endorse a treaty when only part of it has been approved by parliament. He cites two potential examples of the mismatch. The first is that the treaty signed in Maastricht did not envisage that Britain would participate in the social chapter. So if the Commons endorses the social chapter on Thursday, it would endorse something Mr Major did not sign. The second, more significant, issue is that the treaty contains protocols relating to defence and foreign policy, which do not all appear in the bill. The government claims the royal prerogative - the tradition which gives the executive the right to take decisions - allows it to ratify treaties without parliamentary approval. Mr Leolin Price QC, Lord Rees-Mogg's barrister, who argues that this is 'perhaps the most important constitutional issue to be faced by the courts for 300 years', says the government cannot use the royal prerogative to hand to Europe its powers on decisions such as monetary union or foreign policy. Legal experts were yesterday sceptical about Lord Rees-Mogg's chances of success in the courts - even though the trend in recent constitutional battles has been for parliament to gain powers at the expense of the executive. Mr Paul Craig, constitutional expert at Oxford University, said the issue of 'mismatch' between the treaty and bill was by no means clear cut - parliament does have to approve treaties when they affect domestic British law, but has usually approved an abridged version of such treaties. 'It's quite common for the bills to be shorter,' says Mr Craig, who cites the original EC treaty as a crucial example of this - the full treaty had more than 230 articles, while the 1972 bill passed by parliament was 'tiny, only a few pages'. Professor Trevor Hartley, an expert on EC law, says the tradition of royal prerogative is on the government's side: 'Any British government in theory can more or less act as it wants in foreign affairs. So it could go ahead and ratify it without parliament - although of course that would be politically difficult.' He adds that the problem would only arise with 'internal laws', which could, in theory, be referred to the British courts. The government has said the opt-out on the social chapter means that British law is not affected by the treaty. Lord Rees-Mogg argues that Britain could still be bound by the rulings of the European courts on this matter. For critics of the government this debate illustrates the need for a written constitution to clarify the balance between parliament and government - or even, some argue, to give parliament clear supremacy over the government. Mr Craig predicts that given the constitutional significance of the case it will go all the way to the House of Lords.</p>

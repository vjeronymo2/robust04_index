			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Management: Oxford backs NVQs The success of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) - particularly at higher management levels - is still unproven. So the decision earlier this year to grant awarding body status to a department of Oxford University, should give NVQs a useful boost. NVQs are a competence-based set of vocational qualifications which seek to span the whole gamut of qualifications from low-skill occupations to management and the professions. It is a radical move by Oxford University to enter into the vocational education field, not least when some universities argue that they should not be tainted by vocational qualifications. Research among leading companies by Oxford's Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) - a university department - has shown that NVQ competence-based assessment plays a relatively minor role in internal management development at the moment. But Alan Wilmott, director of the UODLE, is confident more companies will begin to realise the advantages of NVQs at higher levels. NVQs, he says, should not be regarded as the poor relation of traditional management diplomas and MBAs. 'The method of assessment is different but they are not a lesser form of achievement.' Involvement in NVQs, says Wilmott, is a natural extension of his unit's work in educational assessment and its more recent role in validating in-company development programmes. The UODLE was established in 1857 and has since established itself as one of the main awarding bodies for examinations outside the university, including GCSE, AS and A Levels and English as a Foreign Language. In the 1980s UODLE decided to explore other commercial areas where it believed its expertise in assessment and validation could be applied. Hence the interest in NVQs. At present two other organisations, the Royal Society of Arts and the Business and Technology Education Council, are also awarding bodies for these management qualifications.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES OK STIFFER DRUG,ALCOHOL CURBS  </P> <P> The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board has revised its drug and alcohol  policy to provide that students caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol  are automatically transferred to a new school after their first offense.  </P> <P> The student-conduct policy, which administrators refer to as "nearly  zero-tolerance," is designed to serve as more of a deterrent than a five-day  suspension, which was the previous punishment, board member Jim de Boom said.  </P> <P> Suspensions, which for some students meant a chance for a trip to amusement  parks or malls, did not clearly convey the district's stance that use of these  substances will not be tolerated, De Boom explained.  </P> <P> The new wording will mean that the first time a student is found with an  illegal substance, he or she will be transferred to one of the other high  schools or grade schools in the district. A second offense will constitute  grounds for expulsion. Any student caught selling or distributing drugs or  alcohol will be automatically expelled.  </P> <P> The policy calls for education and intervention efforts at the school to which  a student is transferred, and can include counseling for the student and  family. As expected, the board voted unanimously for the new wording.  </P> <P> The school district staff is now preparing to notify parents and students about  the policy.  </P> <P> Throughout board discussions over the last two months, one concern has been  making sure that students are aware of the changes. Board member Rod McMillan  said that he was comfortable with the "clear message" of the new policy but  expected that "somebody might get burned" until everyone is aware of the  severity of the penalties.  </P> <P> The policy is tough but fair, said board member Sherry Loofbourrow, adding that  it is important to let the students know that the district is concerned about  their health and well-being.LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Letter: Indian industrialist warns of danger of divisiveness Sir, The wanton act of destruction at Ayodhya on Sunday will remain as a dark moment in India's history. All right thinking Indians must feel a great sense of loss. Our independence was won through non-violence. As the world's largest democracy India has built an international reputation as being a secular nation where all religions have co-existed peacefully. It is therefore unforgivable that political parties can consciously fan religious fanaticism and hatred to serve their own selfish political ends. The time has come for the people of India to stand up against these divisive forces by fighting communalism and hatred. We should instead all work together to strengthen our common bond of units - we are all Indians. Let us not destroy our heritage. Ratan N Tata, chairman, Tata &amp; Sons, 'Jeevan Bharati', Tower 1, 10th floor 124 Connaught Circus, New Delhi 110 001, India</p>

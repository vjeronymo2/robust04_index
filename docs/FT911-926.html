			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Second-liners feature as first section weakens INVESTORS turned to second-liners yesterday as share prices on the big board were weakened by the fall on Wall Street and the lower yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 32.35 at 26,309.79. The index touched a day's low of 26,178.22 in the afternoon, but arbitrage buying brought a partial recovery and the index later reached the day's high of 26,367.99. Overall activity remained lacklustre as volume rose slightly to 270m shares from 220m shares. Declines outnumbered gains by 669 to 275, with 170 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.67 to 1,987.04, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.69 to 1,499.08. Traders said investors, who had expected a cut in the discount rate after the Golden Week holidays, were disappointed by the stable monetary policy. Concern over high arbitrage positions also depressed sentiment. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that if market conditions failed to recover, heavy selling by investment trusts could push the Nikkei below the important 26,000 level. Small and medium-capital stocks with brisk earning outlooks were sought by investors. The second section rose 8.79 to 3,397.83, while the over-the-counter index finished 17.52 ahead at 3,286.64. The big four Japanese brokerages promoted issues related to Japan Railway's capital investment. Nippon Signal, a railway operation equipment maker, closed Y50 up at Y1,620 after making a record high of Y1,670. Totetsu Kogyo, a track maker, put on Y50 to Y1,260. Companies which announced cuts in the minimum trading units for their shares mostly gained ground. Tachikawa, a curtain and blind manufacturer listed on the second section, finished a net Y120 stronger at Y4,150 after climbing to an all-time high of Y4,320. The company announced that it would reduce the minimum trading unit from 1,000 to 100 shares. Nippon Television Network moved ahead Y400 to Y26,900 on declaring that it would reduce its unit from 100 to 10 shares. On the other hand, Asatsu, the advertising agency which was popular recently for the same reason, retreated Y160 to Y7,830 on profit-taking. Nihon Nohyaku, the day's most active stock, rose Y80 to Y2,540 on speculative buying. The issue has climbed from Y750 since February 1, and some traders are concerned about its high margin level. Liquid crystal display makers were sought on hopes of strong sales, but fell on late profit-taking. Sharp, which has a dominant market position, slipped Y30 to Y1,590, while Casio Computer lost Y10 on balance at Y1,300 after touching a year's high of Y1,340. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 175.39 to 29,185.32 on volume of 21.1m shares. Shima Seiki attracted small-lot buying on stating that it would reduce its trading unit to 100 from 1,000 shares. Profit-taking later pushed the issue down to Y15,200 for a net fall of Y100. Roundup FINE TUNING seemed to be taking over from foreign buying yesterday, although the latter continued to lift shares in Australia, where the Hong Kong Chinese are said to be active, and is expected to return to New Zealand where US activity was perceived. NEW ZEALAND saw profit-taking after a five-day rally, the Barclays index surrendering 23.14 or 1.5 per cent to 1,556.61 following a 7.6 per cent gain in the previous five trading days. Turnover eased from NZDollars 21.4m to NZDollars 20.4m. Brokers said sentiment remained generally bullish. Brierley Investments slipped 3 cents to NZDollars 1.24 on 2.6m share volume, after a rise of 17 cents in the previous two sessions on news that the Singapore government is paying NZDollars 126m for a 4.7 per cent stake in the company, and a further NZDollars 660m for a 30 per cent shareholding in its UK hotels unit. AUSTRALIA attracted more overseas buying as the All Ordinaries index added 7.9 at 1,545.7. Turnover expanded from ADollars 180m to ADollars 294m. Trading volume was boosted by the sale of 25.9m shares in TNT, the transport group, for around ADollars 34.5m by the shipping and coal concern McIlwraith McEacharn. TNT firmed 4 cents to ADollars 1.43 after short sellers had to buy back the stock at a higher price. MANILA's initial gains were shaved by profit-taking, leaving the composite index 12.54 up on the day at 1,113.43. BANGKOK's SET index ended 8.61 better at 848.67, recovering less than a third of Tuesday's 27.94 or 3.2 per cent drop on political worries. HONG KONG, where the vice-chairman of the stock exchange resigned yesterday after advocating preferential treatment for council members in new share issues, closed modestly higher. The Hang Seng index improved 6.29 to 3,747.80; turnover was little changed at HKDollars 1.12bn. SEOUL's increasing concern over political uncertainties left the composite index down 4.05 at 631.12, its fifth fall in a row.</p>

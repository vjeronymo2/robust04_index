This view was expressed to journalists by the former  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who is a member of the State  Duma. He said it would be best if one of his deputies were to  be appointed acting minister. Fedorov believes that such a  person would be able, within certain limits, to keep the ship on  course. At the same time he disclosed that two or three of his  deputies and several departmental heads intend to leave the  Finance Ministry in the near future.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Unilever and Procter open new front in soap war Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble are about to open a new front in their soap wars, with Unilever preparing to test samples of a new product developed by its rival. The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group said it had obtained a draft sales brochure and a sample of a new Procter &amp; Gamble detergent. Procter &amp; Gamble plans to launch its own new generation detergent, called Ariel Future, in Germany in the autumn and then elsewhere in Europe. The two consumer giants have been engaged in a battle for months over Unilever's detergent, called Persil Power or Omo Power. Procter &amp; Gamble claims the detergent could damage clothes after frequent washing. Unilever will later this week publish details of its own tests on its detergent which, it will argue, vindicate the product. Mr Andrew Seth, who heads Unilever's UK detergent business, said the Procter product, Ariel Future, was 'rivetingly similar' to its own detergents in the way the sales literature emphasised better stain removal at lower temperatures. Mr Seth said the apparent similarities between the products "unquestionably' explained Procter's attacks. 'This completed the jigsaw puzzle for me,' he said. Mr Seth said he thought Procter had been working on its new formulation for some time but had been pipped to the post by Unilever: 'I think this is something they've been intending to do for a long time but we got in a bit sooner than they thought we would. You realise how galling it must be to have somebody do it before you.' However, Procter &amp; Gamble is already preparing its defence of Ariel Future. It said yesterday: 'This is not a copy-cat product but a leap-frog product.' It emphasised that Ariel Future would not contain the manganese based ingredient which has been at the centre of the controversy over the Unilever detergents. Procter &amp; Gamble said Unilever's comments on the new detergent were 'pure speculation' since none of the new product has yet left its factories. Unilever is not sure the Procter &amp; Gamble product it is preparing to test will be the final formulation for Ariel Future. But even if the tests were to reveal damaging information on their rival, Unilever says it would not use the same tactics as Procter. Mr Seth said: 'We would let the market work it out.' Mr Seth added that the publication of Unilever's laboratory results on Persil Power and Omo Power was irrelevant to the British market where the reformulated Persil is the market leader with a 30 per cent share, compared with Procter's Ariel's 28 per cent.

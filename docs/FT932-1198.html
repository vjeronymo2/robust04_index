			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Normal' Russian harvest forecast THE RUSSIAN grain harvest will be 'normal' at between 105m and 110m tonnes this year, an International Wheat Council conference was told yesterday. This compares with the IWC's May estimate of 101.6m tonnes for 1992. Mr Andrei Lavrov, general director of Khlebrossi, the leading Russian procurement agency, said that 62m hectares had been sown to grains, with 23m hectares down to wheat. The state would need to procure 23m tonnes of wheat this year, Mr Lavrov said. Last year it bought 13m tonnes internally, and it would not buy more than that this year. Mr Lavrov said the Russian grain sector was finding it easier to adapt to market conditions than many other sectors of the troubled economy. This was because it had experience of the international markets and had built up good relations with its bankers, he suggested. The privatisation of the industry had led to increased trading through exchanges, including the Moscow commodity exchange, where the figures had risen from dozens of tonnes to 300,000 tonnes last year. 'The Russian peasant has for the first time a choice of who to sell his supplies to,' said Mr Lavrov. Profits for grain growers had risen by 400 per cent last year. Mr Vladimir Semenyuk, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian grain products procurement agency, said the Ukraine was launching a campaign to boost its animal feed grain production. Since 1975 the country had been a net importer of grains, he told the conference. But it aimed to become a net exporter of at least 5m tonnes of grain by 1995.</p>

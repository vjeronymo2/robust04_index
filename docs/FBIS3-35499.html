For the time  being, it should be emphasized that no such decision has been  announced in any of the condemnations issued by the PLO. A  member of the Israeli team to talks with the PLO said that the  incident will harm the peace process, but it must not be  stopped. The senior political source said that the horrible  massacre must not play into the hands of the extremists who are  opposed to the political process. We were told by this source:  We could have many reasons, after every terrorist action or  murder in the territories, to stop the discussions with the PLO,  but it would be a terrible mistake to suspend the talks.    The General Staff and defense establishment have held  deliberations and engaged in situation assessments over the last  few hours. The chief of staff instructed the cancellation of  all vacations of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders and  Civil Administration heads. Military elements say that  commanders have been instructed to avoid violent friction with  the residents of the territories, but at the same time, to  maintain law and order at all costs and to prevent a  deterioration of the security situation. It has been reported  that Israeli medical teams are aiding the wounded Palestinians.</p>

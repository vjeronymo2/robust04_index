			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RULING PUTS HARRIS CLOSER TO EXECUTION  </P> <P> A federal judge turned down Robert Alton Harris' appeal of his death sentence  Wednesday, leaving the condemned killer with only the slimmest hope of avoiding  execution Tuesday.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge William B. Enright, who twice before has denied Harris'  pleas for mercy, turned him down again, saying there was no merit to a new  appeal his San Diego lawyers filed Monday.  </P> <P> The judge also sharply criticized Harris' attorneys for the tactics they  pursued in filing the appeal. And he said the 11-year odyssey Harris' case has  taken through the state and federal courts was an abuse of legal process that  has generated disrespect for the judicial system among a frustrated public.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, this case, and all the tragedy it has brought to so many lives,  has fully run its course," Enright said. "The decision that was solemnly and  legally made by the jury 11 years ago should be carried out.  </P> <P> "All things I know of in this world have a beginning. All things have an end.  And this matter should now be concluded."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys appealed Enright's decision immediately after the hearing to  the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the next-to-last step Harris has left.  If the San Francisco-based appellate court also rejects Harris, his sole hope  lies with the U. S. Supreme Court -- which has denied Harris' appeals four  times, most recently on Jan. 16.  </P> <P> Harris, 37, is in line to become the first person executed in California in 23  years. His case has progressed further through the court system than any of the  other more than 270 prisoners on Death Row.  </P> <P> His only hope for reprieve lies with the federal courts because last week he  withdrew a request that Gov. George Deukmejian consider clemency -- that is,  commute his death sentence to life in prison. In a letter to the governor,  Harris said he did not think he could get a fair hearing from Deukmejian, a  longtime advocate of capital punishment.  </P> <P> The state courts repeatedly have denied Harris' pleas for mercy.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court upheld Harris' death sentence in 1981. Two weeks  ago, that court turned down a new appeal that Harris' San Diego attorneys,  Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe, filed Jan. 5.  </P> <P> The federal appeal, filed Monday, essentially relied on the same arguments that  failed to persuade the state Supreme Court to spare Harris.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys contended that new psychiatric evidence shows that Harris  suffered from a variety of mental disorders that played a part in the July 5,  1978, killings of San Diego teen-agers Michael Baker and John Mayeski.  </P> <P> It would be unfair to execute Harris because those conditions were not  considered when he was sentenced, the lawyers said.  </P> <P> Among the ailments was organic damage to the brain, particularly to that part  that controls impulse, defense attorneys said. The murders did not occur  because Harris is an unredeemable sociopath, as prosecutors contended at the  trial, but because he was driven by uncontrollable impulse, defense lawyers  said.  </P> <P> Since the mental disorders were not considered when Harris was sentenced, it  would be unfair to execute him, the attorneys said.  </P> <P> Harris killed both 16-year-old boys after stealing their car for use in a bank  robbery. He abducted them from a fast-food restaurant's parking lot, where they  were eating lunch. Later, he ate their half-finished hamburgers.  </P> <P> No one knew about the disorders when Harris was sentenced in 1979 because the  psychologists who tested him didn't do a good job, the defense lawyers said.  And his lawyer at the trial, San Diego attorney Thomas Ryan, did Harris a  disservice because he relied on the psychiatrists' reports, they contended.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office maintained that the claim of new evidence  was nothing more than an attempt by defense attorneys to put new labels on old  evidence.  </P> <P> Enright said Wednesday that he wondered why Sevilla and McCabe even tried the  tactic. His review of the trial record indicated that the doctors and Ryan had  done a fine job, he said.  </P> <P> It was "very difficult" to understand why the defense lawyers had chosen to  "belittle the efforts and demean the professional reputation of those who have  labored in the same vineyard previously," Enright said.  </P> <P> The judge said he wondered if claims such as the ones raised by Sevilla and  McCabe served only to deter other doctors or lawyers from taking part in  demanding cases. It was no encouragement to work diligently on a case and then  later have "unchallenged" professional reputations "unmercifully pilloried,"  Enright said.  </P> <P> "Now I wonder if this is really part of the normal appellate process in a case  like this," he said. He added, "I am fearful that this approach does  substantial disservice to the profession," referring to the practice of law.  </P> <P> Sevilla maintained after the hearing that he and McCabe were being  professionally responsible and said they were simply trying a tactic that had  proven successful in similar cases.  </P> <P> After questioning the approach the defense lawyers took, Enright also made it  clear that he thought it was without substance.  </P> <P> Harris has "had his day in court as no other" prisoner, Enright said. "No  constitutional error has occurred, no miscarriage of justice has been had.  (Harris) has had his rights fully and fairly preserved at every level of trial  and review."  </P> <P> The judge closed the hearing by discussing the danger that Harris' lengthy  appeals pose to the legal system.  </P> <P> "Regardless of the differing views many of us may hold on capital punishment, I  think it should be said that capital punishment is the law of this state,"  Enright said. "It has been repeatedly and expressly validated by the citizens  of this state.  </P> <P> "It makes a mockery of our law, which is the very fabric of our society, a bond  of a self-governing people, to conclude that capital punishment is incapable,  incapable of being enforced," Enright said. "If judgments are to have any  validity at all, if courts mean anything at all, they must have the ability to  enter final judgments."  </P> <P> There was no indication late Wednesday when the 9th Circuit would take up  Harris' case. It was likely that any hearing in the case would be conducted by  telephone, Sevilla said.  </P> <P> GRIM BUSINESS -- News organizations quietly bid for space near San Quentin  Prison as Tuesday's scheduled execution nears.

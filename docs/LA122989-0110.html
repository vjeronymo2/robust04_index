			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN GIVEN 2-YEAR TERM IN SHOOTING;  </P> <P> COURTS: SHE ALLEGED THAT A NEIGHBOR RAPED HER, AND WHEN DISTRICT ATTORNEY  DECLINED TO PROSECUTE, SHE SHOT THE MAN EIGHT TIMES. HE SURVIVED.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles woman who shot her alleged rapist eight times was sentenced to  two years in state prison Thursday.  </P> <P> Noting that defendant Elizabeth Gooden, 26, "has had a history of not being  able to control her temper," Los Angeles Municipal Judge Gary Klausner denied  Gooden's request for probation and ordered her imprisoned.  </P> <P> Gooden shot her neighbor, Wilson Piquet, outside his Crenshaw District  apartment last July after the district attorney's office refused her request to  file charges against him for allegedly raping her twice.  </P> <P> After shooting Piquet once in the chest at point-blank range, Gooden shot him  seven more times in the arms, legs and buttocks. Piquet, a school bus driver,  survived.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office maintained that there was insufficient evidence  to support Gooden's rape accusations.  </P> <P> Gooden, who originally faced an attempted murder charge, pleaded guilty last  month to a reduced charge of assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Klausner admitted that the alleged rape probably prompted Gooden to shoot  Piquet, but he explained to the defense that it was not enough to keep her out  of prison.  </P> <P> "When you say she is not a danger to society, counsel, I cannot agree with  that," he told Gooden's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mark Zuckman.  </P> <P> Klausner said his decision was based, in part, on the prosecutor's allegations  that Gooden once stabbed another man she accused of hitting her and physically  beat a woman she suspected of secretly dating her boyfriend.  </P> <P> Zuckman maintained that Gooden had never been convicted of any of the alleged  crimes.  </P> <P> "She's law-abiding, and she's intelligent," Zuckman said. "She's not a danger  to society. Now, perhaps she's a danger to rapists."  </P> <P> Zuckman called the sentence "unfair."  </P> <P> "It's disappointing," Zuckman said. "I really was hoping she'd get probation.  She'll be out in about eight months. It could have been worse. She could have  gotten a longer term for the attempted murder charge."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Wilkinson conceded that the rape allegations  complicated the case.  </P> <P> "Any time you're dealing with an individual claiming they have been assaulted,  and they take matters into their own hands, you have a difficult situation,"  the prosecutor said. "But you just can't go out and take the law into your own  hands and shoot someone."  </P> <P> A clinical psychologist who examined Gooden months after the alleged rape  maintained that the defendant was suffering from "rape trauma syndrome."  </P> <P> She said the condition compelled Gooden to shoot Piquet.  </P> <P> "The (sentencing) decision reflects a lack of understanding about the emotional  distress of rape victims," said the psychologist, Dr. Nancy Kaser-Boyd, who  attended Thursday's hearing. "Gooden's action was a result of her mental  state."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REQUEST DROPPED FOR DREXEL EXAMINER  </P> <P> The lead creditor to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. withdrew a request  Tuesday for a court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, as the two sides  neared a deal about who should manage the dissolution of the Wall Street firm.  </P> <P> The firm and its creditors were negotiating about a proposal to allow a  triumvirate of Drexel board members to oversee the firm, with input from  creditors, as it liquidates under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> The decision by lead creditor First City Bancorp. of Texas to withdraw its  request for an examiner was a sign the Drexel board members were likely to  continue directing the liquidation.  </P> <P> Drexel's creditors had sought an examiner in the case because of concerns about  the rapid liquidation of billions of dollars in securities holdings and other  assets by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage subsidiary.  </P> <P> The brokerage firm is not subject to bankruptcy court proceedings but the asset  sales, the movement of capital from the subsidiary to the parent company prior  to the collapse and other links prompted anxious creditors to seek an examiner.  </P> <P> In a bid to prevent the appointment, which Drexel officials contended would  hamstring the company's day-to-day management, Drexel asked U.S. District Judge  Howard Buschman III to allow three board members led by Chairman John S. R.  Shad to oversee the dismantling of the parent and all subsidiaries.  </P></p>

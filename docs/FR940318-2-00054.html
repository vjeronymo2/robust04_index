Specifically, the OTC has recommended that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle program for the entire OTR. The EPA is commencing a review of the recommendation to determine whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove it. The Agency believes that its decision must be made in the context of the Northeast States' overall ozone emission reduction needs to meet the ozone standard. The Agency expects to consider the recommended measure as part of the overall attainment goal for the region, and anticipates gathering information regarding the recommended measure as it relates to the overall attainment effort through consultations and public hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency will hold a public hearing before May 11, 1994, and will receive written comments until 30 days following the public hearing. The Agency will consider all relevant data, views, and comments in responding to the recommendation. The Agency will issue a second notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in late March or early April 1994 that will provide specific information about the time and place of the public hearing and more detail about the process EPA intends to follow in reaching a decision. EPA also expects, in the forthcoming  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, to describe a framework for reaching a decision and to identify and discuss significant issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The recommendation and supporting materials that the OTC submitted to EPA on February 10, 1994 are contained in Air Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;11 at: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. The public docket room is located in room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall (Ground Floor). Materials may be inspected from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.

For moderate, serious, and severe ozone nonattainment areas, under section 182 of the Act the States are obligated to submit demonstrations by November 15, 1994 that their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) will provide for attainment of the ozone standard by the applicable dates. Congress established the OTR in the 1990 Amendments to the Act based on the recognition that the transport of ozone and ozone precursors throughout the region may render the Northeast States' attainment strategies interdependent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

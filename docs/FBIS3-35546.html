According to the Central News Unit's report, the spokesman  referred to this as a horrific massacre that was doubtless  carried out with the backing of the military forces of the  Zionist regime, and he called on human rights organizations and  world public opinion to react seriously to this horrifying  crime. He said: Silence and indifference of the countries  supporting the Zionist regime will encourage that regime to  continue its policies.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed the sympathy of the  government of the Islamic Republic of Iran with the families of  those martyred by this horrific crime.</p>

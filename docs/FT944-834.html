			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drastic consequence of biscuit cut-back (2) Sir, Re your article, 'City thefts take the biscuit', it may surprise everyone that lawyers are not the only firms that experience problems with the dreaded chocolate biscuits. As surveyors we made sure that our clients were well tanked-up with them and, if that also meant that the 'workers' benefited by the odd Jaffa cake to improve their performance, so be it. We took pride in our refreshments. We even provided cappuccinos and, at one stage, hand-made chocolates from my sister's very own chocolate shop. But the heydays of the 1980s gave way to the tightening of belts of the 1990s and, because our waistlines were drooping over our belts, drastic action had to be taken. We decided to go environmentally friendly. Now we offer fresh fruit and caffeine-free fruit-flavoured tea. It has transformed our business. We now have no clients and only one part-time secretary working for us and she brings in her own sandwiches and flask. Have we done something wrong?

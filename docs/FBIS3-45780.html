			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists  have succeeded in the synthesis of a kind of memory-stimulating  peptide found in animal brains, a great step in the study of  neurobiology.    According to the scientists with the Shanghai Biochemical  Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the  memory peptide is a substance existing in higher animals.    On the basis of repeated animal experiments, the scientists  undertook systematic research of the molecular structure and  neural function of the peptide and developed a workable  illustration of its position in the animal brain and the  mechanism by which it enhances memory.    Scientific experiments proved that the artificially produced  memory peptide is able to promote and extend memory and speed up  the recovery of memory damage. As a result, it is expected to  be beneficial in treating senile amnesia and dementia.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS VOTES CONTRA AID, SUPPORTING BUSH STRATEGY  </P> <P> The Senate and the House, seeking to end an era of bitter debate over  Nicaragua, gave massive bipartisan endorsement Thursday to President Bush's  plan for diplomatic pressure in Central America -- as well as $49.8 million in  non-military aid for the Contras.  </P> <P> The Democratic-controlled House, which in earlier years blocked requests by the  Reagan Administration for military aid to the Contras, approved Bush's  compromise proposal by a lopsided vote of 309 to 110. The Democratic-led Senate  approved the Administration's request by a vote of 89 to 9.  </P> <P> "This bill tries to set in motion a united, single-voice policy," said House  Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.). "It ends military involvement and covert efforts  to overthrow governments in our hemisphere . . . (and) it says to Nicaragua  that we are very earnest about you fulfilling these commitments that you made  to internal democratization."  </P> <P> "It was a compromise, and not one that everybody believed was a good  compromise," said a more skeptical Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the Senate minority  leader. "We'll see how it works. If it doesn't work, we'll be back to revisit  it."  </P> <P> "We have embarked upon a bipartisan approach with the Congress," White House  spokesman Steve Hart said afterward. "We are very pleased with the vote and  with this expeditious action by the Congress."  </P> <P> The votes give President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III two  tools that they had requested to get their new Central America policy off the  ground: strong, bipartisan support in Congress and an assurance that the  Contras will be kept alive for at least 10 months.  </P> <P> Bush and Baker, who devised their policy in an unusual round of negotiations  with congressional leaders last month, have told Congress that their goal is to  pressure Nicaragua's leftist government into holding "free and fair elections"  next Feb. 28.  </P> <P> If those elections are fair, and if the Sandinistas enact other democratic  reforms, Bush and Baker have said that they would agree to disarming the Contra  army, estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000 men, and resettling its members in  Nicaragua or elsewhere in Central America.  </P> <P> But if the Sandinistas refuse to reform their internal political system, Bush  and Baker have told members of Congress that they may attempt to revive the  Contras as a military force and seek aid for them to resume their war against  the Managua regime.  </P> <P> "There is nothing in here that precludes the Administration from asking for  military assistance for the resistance," Baker told a Senate subcommittee  earlier this week. He added that he has little confidence that the Sandinistas  will meet the U.S. demands for democratic reforms:  </P> <P> "Their record is abysmal," he said. "They have not kept any of their promises.  But we do have an opportunity here to focus public opinion, world opinion, on  their failure to keep their promises."  </P> <P> The compromise plan provides $49.8 million in U.S. aid for the Contras, to be  used to provide food, clothing, shelter, medical assistance and non-military  training. The Administration pledged that no aid would be granted to Contra  forces that attempt offensive military operations or engage in human rights  abuses.  </P> <P> The law also provides for $7.7 million to pay for transporting the goods, $5  million to administer the program, and $4.2 million in medical aid to civilian  victims of the eight-year-old war.  </P> <P> The aid for the Contras is intended to run for 10 months, until Nicaragua's  scheduled Feb. 28 election day. But in an unusual feature that has caused  controversy among legal scholars, Bush promised in a separate letter that he  would halt the aid in November if any one of eight Democratic leaders in  Congress objects to the way the policy is being carried out.  </P> <P> Baker said that was a key to the plan's adoption. "We probably could have  gotten a six- or five-month deal (without Bush's promise). I think it's better  to have a 10-month deal. . . . It strengthens our hand."  </P> <P> Most members of Congress, both Republican and Democratic, praised the plan in  tones ranging from grudging to positively lavish.  </P> <P> But some conservative Republicans warned that it is a "sell-out" that will  gradually lead to the Contras' disintegration and the consolidation of the  Sandinistas' power in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> "Nicaragua is lost," mourned California Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-San Diego). "The  hope of freedom is gone. The dark curtain of the Sandinista Gestapo has  descended on Nicaragua."  </P> <P> Some liberal Democrats, on the other hand, condemned the plan as a way to keep  the Contras alive and predicted that the Administration never would accept  whatever reforms the Sandinistas enact.  </P> <P> "This accord hinges on winks, nods and handshakes," said Rep. Thomas Foglietta  (D-Pa.). "I'd really like to say I trust this new Administration, the Bush  Administration, for reintegration of the Contras. But how can I when I read . .  . that then-Vice President Bush played a role in supplying covert aid to the  Contras?"  </P> <P> He was referring to documents released in the trial of former White House aide  Oliver L. North that showed Bush playing a part in an effort to persuade  Honduras to help the rebels in 1985, when Congress had banned U.S. aid.  </P> <P> More typical was the measured support of Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), one of  the Contras' most flamboyant champions on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> "I support this bill on the theory that if you can't get dinner, take a  sandwich and keep hope alive," Hyde said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF U.S. AID TO THE CONTRAS  </P> <P> 1981: Congress secretly approves $19 million in military aid for Nicaraguan  Contras. Funds are managed by the CIA.  </P> <P> 1982: Congress allocates another $19 million in covert aid, stipulates the  money cannot be used to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.  </P> <P> November, 1983: Congress votes $24 million to aid the Contras through mid-1984.  </P> <P> 1984: Congress, angered by reports that CIA oversaw the mining of Nicaraguan  harbors, cuts off aid to the rebels.  </P> <P> June 12, 1985: House approves $27 million in "humanitarian" assistance. Senate  approves measure in August. CIA and Defense Department are barred from  administering the aid.  </P> <P> June 25, 1986: House approves $100 million in aid. Senate votes approval in  August. The fiscal 1987 appropriation includes $70 million in military aid and  $30 million in non-military aid.  </P> <P> Sept. 30, 1987: Fiscal 1987 assistance expires, but money and materiel in the  pipeline continue flowing to Contras. Subsequently, Congress authorizes about  $20 million in "non-lethal" aid. Funds expired Feb. 29, 1988.  </P> <P> April 1, 1988: President Reagan signs $47.9-million bill to provide non-lethal  aid.  </P> <P> Sources: Facts on File, Associated Press  </P></p>

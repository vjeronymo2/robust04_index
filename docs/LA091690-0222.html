			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> There were flakes, and then there was our older brother Thomas, the hipster,  who walked around the house spouting Ginsberg, Kerouac and Whitman morning,  noon and night. Wanted everyone to call him Tomas.  </P> <P> It was embarrassing. He had one foot out the door, anyway, so when the Mort  Sahl Incident happened, we weren't surprised in the slightest. We were upstairs  in our room, playing "Love Potion No. 9" over and over again, minding our own  business, and pretty much hoping Dad wouldn't call us downstairs to watch Bob  Hope's latest Christmas show from Vietnam with the rest of the family. We went  downstairs for a snack, and Tom walked into the living room, dressed all in  black. Boy, there was something in the air that night. I heard my Dad say  something like "Bob Hope is the greatest." Tom snickered and said, "He ain't no  Mort Sahl, that's for sure." Then Dad said as long as he was putting the food  on the table he wasn't going to have a Communist living under his roof. And  that was it. Tom hit the road that night, driving out to the West Coast. So  when we hear the name Mort Sahl, we think of Tom, and Dad, who laugh about that  night now. Mort Sahl will perform at Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre,  24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, at 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $22. For  information call (213) 456-4522. R.D.  </P></p>

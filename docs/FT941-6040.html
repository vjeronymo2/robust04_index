			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Perkins completes debt restructuring Perkins Foods has completed the restructuring of its debt profile with a Pounds 30m multi-currency revolving credit facility. This follows a Pounds 32m, 10 year private placement arranged in the US last December. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said the new facility, which lasts for four years and can be drawn in any European currency, would cover the possible redemption of the group's D-mark convertible bonds. It gives the group a more structured debt profile, he said. Both the private placement and new facility have covenants that take account of the substantial goodwill write-offs the group has taken because of its acquisitive past. A large part of the Pounds 150m of goodwill written off is treated in the covenants as an asset. The facility was arranged by Barclays Bank and the other banks involved are Nationale Investeringsbank, ABN Amro Bank and Berliner Handels-und Franfurter Bank.</p>

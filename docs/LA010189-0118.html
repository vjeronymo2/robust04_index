			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHOMEINI REINS IN A HIGH-RANKING COUNCIL  </P> <P> The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Saturday stripped some powers from a  high-ranking council established in February to speed up Iran's decision-making  process, Tehran Radio reported.  </P> <P> Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other radicals that  formation of the 13-member High Council of Expedience was unconstitutional,  Khomeini declared that it will no longer be allowed to legislate independently  of the Majlis, or Parliament.  </P> <P> The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader,  urged a return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy  decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war  with Iraq.  </P> <P> Khomeini, who set up the council in February, said it should revert to its  original role -- settling disputes between Parliament and the Council of  Guardians, a panel of clergyman empowered to block laws they consider  un-Islamic.  </P> <P> "No problem is (now) so urgent as to be debated directly in that council  without being debated in the Majlis and being supervised by the Council of  Guardians," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.  </P> <P> The new decree takes effect Jan. 21.  </P> <P> The High Council of Expedience was founded to stop ideological arguments about  the limits of government power from blocking important legislation. It was also  authorized to issue decrees on urgent matters.  </P></p>

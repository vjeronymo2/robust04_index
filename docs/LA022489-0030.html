			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: A LEG TO STAND ON  </P> <P> Did anyone notice Sigourney Weaver's hosiery the night of the Golden Globe  Awards? We hope so, because Weaver made a special trip to the Fogal hoisery  store in Beverly Hills the day before to get black fishnet thigh-highs to wear  with her gown. Joan Wills, co-owner of the store, tells us the stockings are  worn without garters: "They have elastic and stay up on their own." We were  particularly glad to hear that after Wills reminded us the actress' Globe gown  had "a very high slit up the side."  </P> <P> Clothes Make the Man  </P> <P> After we once wrote about Rod Stewart selecting some trendy threads at Fred  Segal on Melrose Avenue, we heard that a woman dropped by to buy for her  husband everything on the rock star's list. So, dear lady, this detailed update  is for you, but please keep in mind these clothes are meant for working.  According to menswear manager George Grimball, Stewart's latest purchases are  for his South American concert tour. His suitcases will now hold: one pair of  1940s-style (baggy around the hips, narrow at the ankles, small cuff),  cream-colored rayon slacks by Joe Da Hun; a brick-colored Go-Silk shirt and  matching pants to be worn with a 1930s-style Art Deco tie in black and orange  by Format; two oversize cream crinkle-rayon shirts with long sleeves and knit  collars by L'Equipe; one butterscotch Go-Silk shirt with short sleeves, knit  collars and knit cuffs; one teal Go-Silk shirt and a teal, cream and black  Format tie, both to be worn with the above-mentioned cream rayon slacks; one A.  Goldstein brown lizard belt with sterling silver buckle and loop to be worn  with all of the above. Dear lady, we hope this helps. And please say "hello" to  your husband for us.  </P> <P> Designs for Oscar  </P> <P> Fred Hayman, who recently renamed his landmark Giorgio store for himself, has  just been given another name. He is now fashion coordinator for the 61st Annual  Academy Awards presentation. "He'll be responsible for coordinating designer  gowns and accessories to be worn by key nominees and presenters that evening,"  according to store vice president Katy Sweet. News that Hayman would be  offering the loan of European and American designer gowns went out last Friday,  Sweet tells Listen. Geena Davis and Anne Archer have already been in to make  their selections. Davis selected a Bob Mackie gown and Archer has opted for a  design by Bernard Perris.  </P> <P> Revealing Costumer  </P> <P> Robert Turturice, costume designing kingpin, is ready to spill the beans about  the perils of his profession. He's lived through dressing Cybill Shepherd and  Bruce Willis for "Moonlighting," Dudley Moore for "Like Father, Like Son,"  Michael Keaton for "Clean and Sober," even little Pee Wee Herman for "Big Top  Pee Wee." And he'll show and tell how, at a daylong UCLA seminar March 4. He'll  go a few steps further and discuss the dishy details of what it's like to dress  elephants and other circus animals for their roles in feature films. And you  think you've got problems.  </P> <P> Light in the Tennies?  </P> <P> The immaculate athletic shoes of Hollywood actors have become a preoccupation,  ever since Listen spied Timothy Busfield of "thirtysomething" in his perfectly  white high tops. He was wearing them while ordering herb tea to go from a  Beverly Hills restaurant. Ally Sheedy's white tennies were good as new too, the  day Listen spied her in a downtown elevator. And Rosanna Arquette's white,  Olive Oyl oxfords, shoes originally intended for serious walking, were pristine  the day she put them on for a trip to a Venice studio. It begs for a follow-up  report: Where do these people work out?  </P></p>

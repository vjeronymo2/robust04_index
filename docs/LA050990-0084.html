			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HILLTOP ACE REBOUNDS, BEATS SOUTHWEST  </P> <P> Hilltop Coach John Baumgarten didn't have a doubt that his junior pitching  sensation, Jose Silva, would rebound from his worst outing of the year -- a  10-1 loss to Castle Park last Thursday in which Silva allowed six earned runs  in 4 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "He feels bad for about three minutes after something like that," Baumgarten  said.  </P> <P> So Baumgarten went with his ace Tuesday against Southwest, which entered the  day tied with Hilltop and Montgomery for first place in the Metro League.  </P> <P> Silva made his coach look pretty good and Southwest hitters look pretty bad --  striking out 12 and allowing just four hits in a 6-1 victory over the visiting  Raiders.  </P> <P> With Hilltop's victory and Montgomery's 2-1 loss to Chula Vista, the Lancers  are alone in first place with three games remaining.  </P> <P> Center fielder David Chapman provided all the offense Silva needed with three  hits and two RBIs.  </P> <P> Silva, who entered the game with a 1.94 ERA, improved his record to 8-4 and  raised his strikeout total to 96 in just 77 innings. He entered Tuesday one  strikeout behind county leader Danny Miller of Poway.  </P> <P> "I was real pumped up for this after they beat me last time," Silva said.  </P> <P> "The kid pitched a tremendous game," Southwest Coach Tom Hernandez said. "I  knew this game would come down to pitching and he was just better than our kid  (sophomore Salvador Sanchez) today."  </P> <P> Southwest (11-12, 8-3) scored its run in the third on an Adrian Garcia double  and a single by Victor Caracoza. But as the game wore on, Silva's velocity  seemed to improve.  </P> <P> He didn't allow a hit after the third inning and he struck out the side in the  fourth and seventh.  </P> <P> "He just got tougher," Baumgarten said. "He really turned it on when he got the  lead."  </P> <P> Hilltop (18-7, 9-2) took the lead in the third on a Jorge Munoz RBI double.  Sanchez (5-3) kept his team in the game until the sixth when Hilltop erupted  for four unearned runs.  </P> <P> Hilltop followed Southwest center fielder Carlos Sanchez' error with five hits,  two off reliever J.J. Wozniak. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

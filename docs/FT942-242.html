			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Market - not central bank - to supervise NZ banking: Customers, competitors and the press will be system's new watchdogs New Zealand's Reserve Bank is pressing ahead with a revolutionary free market approach to banking supervision. The present system, under which the country's 18 licensed banks provide confidential information to the central bank to enable it to monitor risks, is due to be abolished early next year. In its place comes 'prudential supervision', which rests on maximum public disclosure. The information which had been provided to the central bank confidentially will instead be published each quarter, allowing the public - customers, competitors, the press - to act as watchdogs on a bank's affairs. Locally incorporated banks will have to appoint independent directors, including the chairman, who will have to sign statements attesting to the truth and adequacy of risk management systems. The new system is based on the principle that a well-informed market is the safest, best and least expensive way for a central bank to supervise banking operations. Mr Murray Sherwin, chief manager of the banking system department of the Reserve Bank, says it is designed to ensure banks' directors take a greater interest in 'getting it right'. He says companies will put in place good risk management systems rather than be forced to publicise bad news that might crop up in a particular quarter. 'In future they'll think very carefully of their risks and obligations. And directors will be looking equally closely at their bank's skills and systems, fees, costs and internal budgets.' Mr Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank, says no system of banking supervision is perfect, but he is confident that the new one will reduce the risk of bank failure. The proposals, due to become law in the first half of 1995 after mainly technical revisions of the final draft, should lead to lower compliance costs. Mr Sherwin says under the US system, for instance, regulatory costs might be 6 to 14 per cent of banks' non-interest expenses. 'There is no reason why the costs should be so high.' The new system will build on principles used in establishing the prudential supervision framework over the past seven years. The system, introduced in 1987, kept regulation to a minimum, based on the concept that the incentive for prudent management should come from the discipline of a competitive market, and that the central bank should be the guardian of the stability of the banking system, not the protector of individual institutions or depositors. This 'hands off' approach will mean that the central bank will mainly be concerned with the management of bank failures. The 1990 Reserve Bank Act - which gave the bank independence in setting monetary policy with the aim of securing low inflation - also set in place procedures aimed at ensuring market discipline as the best contributor to a sound financial system. The emphasis was on ensuring the best possible information circulated to prevent bank failure. Mr Sherwin says the new system will offer a number of advantages. It will lead to efficiency gains. Requirements for banks to issue costly prospectuses for money raising will no longer be needed. Banks will no longer have to provide quarterly prudential returns to the central bank, norwill they have to make themselves available for internal reviews. Mandatory risk limits on large foreign exchange exposures will be abolished. So will banking supervision fees. However, banks must provide comprehensive quarterly disclosure statements, which could involve costly preparation. These must be audited at the half-year, which could also be expensive. Mr Sherwin dismisses suggestions that New Zealand is introducing the new system because most of the banks are now overseas-owned. He says the logic of the new system is made even more valid because of the diversity of banks and the difficulties of applying rules that fit their varying activities. In what is expected to be the final draft, the Reserve Bank backed down from its idea that all banks should have a credit rating, although all will be encouraged to get one. The credit ratings, likely to be obtained from Standard and Poors, Moody's or IBCA, are intended to be publicly displayed and will allow retail customers to assess a bank's financial health. The Reserve Bank also decided against an initial proposal to set minimum capital requirements different from the international standards set by the 1985 Basle capital accord. Banks have generally welcomed the latest proposals although they have expressed concern that the plans still represent a radical step that might damage investors' perceptions. A spokesman for one bank - who did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue - warns that international investors might be forced to 'price in more risk' in their loans to New Zealand banks. Banks also worry that some small retail customers may not understand the meaning of the credit ratings. Some are perturbed at the cost of providing quarterly detailed reports, while others say they have an open mind to see how the new system works in practice. Dr Roderick Deane, a leading free marketeer who heads Telecom, New Zealand's biggest company, and has had a big influence on the new strategy, says the private sector should be left to monitor the performance of the banks. 'The bureaucrats can't do the job any better,' he says.</p>

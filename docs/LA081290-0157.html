			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARRY ASKS PROSECUTOR TO DROP RETRIAL OPTION;  </P> <P> DRUGS: THE CONTRITE MAYOR ASKS CHEERING SUPPORTERS FOR FORGIVENESS. HE ALSO MAY  REVIVE PLANS FOR OFFICE.  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry, brushing aside tears a day after a jury convicted him of a  misdemeanor drug charge but failed to resolve 12 other charges, apologized to  the city Saturday and called on the federal government to abandon any thoughts  of a retrial.  </P> <P> "To young and old, black and white . . . rich and poor, I ask you to forgive me  for any hurt I may have caused," Barry, one of the nation's most prominent  black municipal officials, told cheering supporters at a rally televised live  throughout the Washington area.  </P> <P> "Let us come together to heal ourselves and our city," he said. "I call upon  the United States government, too, to join me in this healing."  </P> <P> The government's arrest of Barry on drug charges in a highly publicized sting  operation has inflamed racial tensions in the predominantly black District of  Columbia, where the former civil rights activist is finishing his third term as  mayor.  </P> <P> Some legal authorities predicted Saturday that prosecutors would indeed drop  the unresolved drug and perjury charges against Barry, largely because a  crucial piece of their evidence -- the FBI sting operation -- apparently proved  offensive to many jurors.  </P> <P> Members of the jury who were willing to discuss the case said that in  convicting Barry of one misdemeanor drug possession charge and acquitting him  on another, they were divided on other charges and were split 6 to 6 on a  specific drug charge arising from the FBI sting.  </P> <P> Barry, in a 15-minute speech in a municipal auditorium, made no mention of any  future political plans. But the Democratic mayor, who announced when his trial  began that he would not seek reelection, still could run as an independent  candidate for mayor. He also could seek election to a four-year term as an  at-large member of the City Council, according to some political advisers.  </P> <P> Citing "God's mercy, his grace and his everlasting love," Barry told his  audience he had taken "a giant step toward healing" by spending seven weeks in  substance abuse centers in Florida and South Carolina immediately after his  arrest in the FBI sting last January.  </P> <P> Barry was recorded by a hidden FBI video camera as he smoked crack cocaine in a  downtown hotel room with a former girlfriend, ex-model Rasheeda Moore, who was  cooperating with the government. The 83-minute videotape was a keystone of the  prosecution's case.  </P> <P> Barry thanked his supporters "for your prayers and your compassion when my  private and personal life was paraded before the world." In an apparent  reference to trial evidence that he had affairs with several women who used  drugs with him, Barry said he also had asked for and received the forgiveness  of his wife, Effi.  </P> <P> Referring to U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens' stated intention to study the question  of a retrial for several weeks, Barry thanked jurors for their difficult  deliberations and said: "Let their judgment be our last judgment."  </P> <P> Abbe Lowell, a former Justice Department lawyer, said he doubted that Stephens  would retry the case. "There's no reason to think he'd have any more success  the second time around," Lowell said.  </P> <P> Plato Cacheris, a prominent defense attorney who specializes in white-collar  and political corruption cases, said he also considered a retrial unlikely.  </P> <P> "Given the depth of feelings in this city, the Barry case probably could be  tried to a hung jury ad infinitum," Cacheris said. "The jury apparently viewed  the FBI sting as using an elephant gun instead of a flyswatter to get a mayor  for a bunch of misdemeanors. This guy is no Manuel Noriega."  </P> <P> Cacheris was referring to the deposed dictator of Panama, who is awaiting trial  in a Miami jail on 11 counts of international drug smuggling.  </P> <P> Juror Johnnie Mae Hardeman told reporters the jury was evenly split on the  charge relating to the FBI sting, an allegation that Barry possessed cocaine  last Jan. 18. She said many jurors felt he had been "singled out" for  prosecution by the government, and they doubted the truthfulness and motives of  Barry's chief accusers, who themselves were drug users.  </P> <P> A former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office, who requested anonymity,  agreed that Barry probably would not be retried. He said the sting operation  "seemed a little too much for misdemeanor drug possession," adding:  </P> <P> "When a jury is split that much, and where you don't think it's an aberration,  it's tough to retry a case and get better results."  </P> <P> A high-ranking federal law enforcement official, who also requested anonymity,  said that in sting operations "you always have to be worried about the totality  of the circumstances, how a jury is going to view it."  </P> <P> Although the sting was not entrapment, "there was an appearance that the  government was bending over backward to get Marion Barry more than it would an  average person," the official conceded.  </P> <P> Other lawyers reached for comment said Stephens was likely to consider the  divisive impact that another trial would have on residents of the District of  Columbia, a factor that would weigh against retrying Barry.  </P> <P> Staff writer Ronald J. Ostrow contributed to this story.  </P></p>

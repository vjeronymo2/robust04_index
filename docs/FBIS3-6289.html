There had been speculation that delegates from the other G-7  nations might criticize Japan in connection with its employment  and macroeconomic policies.    Sakaguchi, leading the Japanese delegation to the meeting,  told reporters that the ministerial meeting was highly  meaningful as the first G-7 conference to discuss employment  problems.    Some foreign delegates told the meeting that the other  industrial nations should learn from Japan's low unemployment  rate -- 2.5 percent last year, Sakaguchi said.    He also said there was no criticism against his statement  that Japan is doing its best to stimulate its economy.    U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a speech earlier Monday to  the conference, urged Japan to increase domestic demand as part  of more aggressive macroeconomic policies in the industrial  world.    Sakaguchi also suggested that employment will be an  important  issue at the G-7 summit scheduled to be held in Naples, Italy,  in July.</p>

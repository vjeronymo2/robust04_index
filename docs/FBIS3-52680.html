			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The tough negotiations held yesterday between the  government and representatives of the General Union of Algerian  Workers [UGTA] included numerous trade union issues relating to  the national economy in general and centered on workers' demands  such as increasing the basic wage to 4,000 dinars. The  government has given no details on these negotiations, which  were held in closed sessions. However, the UGTA has given the  government until 15 January to respond favorably to its demands,  according to a statement released by the trade union. It seems  that as far as these demands are concerned Abdelhak Benhamouda  [UGTA secretary general] has not obtained satisfaction. This is  at least what can be inferred from the tone of the statement  released by the UGTA, which says that the negotiations have not  given any results.    Over to Rachid Ould Mohand with a summary of the statement:    [Ould Mohand] In its statement, the UGTA says that the  meeting between the government and the trade union has not given  any results and that both sides stuck to their positions. The  points of disagreement are the refusal of the government to  increase the basic wage to 4,000 Algerian dinars in all sectors  of activity in 1994. The trade union stressed its position by  demanding an increase in wages if prices of consumer goods were  to rise. The government expressed its readiness to create a  national unemployment fund and examine other problems such as  partial retirement [as heard], which is one of the trade union's  demands. The trade union has set 15 January as a deadline for  the government to meet all its demands.    According to the UGTA statement, the government has also  pledged to set up a joint commission between the trade union and  the Education Ministry next week to reexamine the law concerning  teachers. The government also promised to pay 147 billion  centimes to the Federation of Education Workers to cover the  cost of social services and to open financial posts [as heard]  for teachers suffering from work-related illnesses until these  illnesses are included in the national list of work-related  illnesses. Finally, the government has also pledged to pay  teachers for the days they went on strike or to pay them back if  their pay had been docked.</p>

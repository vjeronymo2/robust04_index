			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ex-BCCI unit to float HABIB Credit and Exchange Bank, the revamped subsidiary of the former Bank of Credit and Commerce International in Pakistan, will float 49 per cent of its shares to the general public next month, Reuter reports from Karachi. The Habib Credit and Exchange Bank (HCEBL) was formed from the three Pakistan branches of BCCI, which were merged with the government-owned Habib Bank following an agreement with BCCI's liquidators in February. HBL now owns 100 per cent of HCEBL. HBL will retain 51 per cent of shares in the new bank, which was formally launched in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi on Sunday, Mr Saleem Akhtar, chief executive said. Mr Akhtar said HCEBL would offer 29 per cent of its shares to the public, 10 per cent to former BCCI employees and 10 per cent to the state's National Investment Trust. The shares are to be offered in December. HBL took over the three BCCI branches in March and resumed operations in April.</p>

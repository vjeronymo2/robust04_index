			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Israel was not content with the savage  massacre it committed against the Lebanese citizens in the  western al-Biqa'. It has escalated its attacks on southern  Lebanese villages and townships, and massed additional military  forces and heavy weapons. Israeli officials have made a series  of threats to commit more acts of aggression.    Even the most naive of observers can see that beyond what  Israel gained from the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- direct Israeli  hegemony and real Israeli trusteeship over the Palestinian  people's resources -- Israel wants to deal a final blow to both  the U.S. peace initiative and the peace process based on the  Madrid conference.    As usual, Israel chose Lebanon, in its capacity as the  weakest link in the Arab body, to remove every vestige of the  atmosphere of peace from the region, replacing it with an  atmosphere of war. Only a few days ago, the Israeli prime  minister clearly announced that he sees no benefit in a new tour  of good offices in the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of  state to promote the peace process on the Syrian track, because  Israel does not intend to withdraw from the Golan, while Syria  links peace to this withdrawal.    In fact, Rabin's statement is a flagrant call on the United  States to forget its peace initiative and relinquish its  commitments to achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all  fronts of the conflict, based on Security Council Resolutions  242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle.    This is not the first serious Israeli attempt to undermine  the peace process. At a similar time last year, Israel sent  large forces into occupied southern Lebanon and used various  kinds of weapons to systematically destroy hundreds of Lebanese  villages. At that time, Yitzhaq Rabin announced he wanted to  create a new refugee problem in the region. Indeed, hundreds of  thousands of Lebanese civilians were evicted. If the United  States, through Secretary Christopher, had not quickly salvaged  its regional initiative, and if Lebanon and Syria had not  responded to the U.S. endeavors, the peace process would have  been a memory from the past.    Now, Rabin is doing it again. He has publicly announced he  will not withdraw from the Golan or southern Lebanon and that he  will commit large-scale acts of aggression on the pretext of  protecting Israel's security. Meanwhile, the Lebanese people  are the ones who are being buried under the rubble of destroyed  buildings in savage Zionist raids.    Peace can be achieved only by deeds. Israel's deeds,  however, flagrantly conflict with the simplest fundamentals and  principles of peace. The substance of both the U.S. initiative  and the Security Council resolutions is to exchange land for  peace. Israel, however, refuses to return the land.    If the U.S. initiative aims to spread a climate of detente  and calm in the region that will help parties engage in genuine  peace talks, then Israel is beating the drums of war and  translating its words into action, using its aircraft to attack  defenseless Lebanese areas, and ceaselessly shelling, from land  and sea, the villages and towns of southern Lebanon.    Where is Israel today after the Washington initiative? Where  is Israel after the Madrid Conference and its clear, well-known  principles? Have the Lebanese-Israeli talks taken a single step  forward? Have the Syrian-Israeli talks taken a single step  forward, knowing that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle  East?    By involving the Palestinian side in an unfair separate  agreement, by deceiving the Palestinian side in order to keep  Jerusalem out of the agreement and to maintain the Israeli  occupation, and by waving material temptations at this deceived  side, although they were soon to be discovered to be a big lie  -- by doing all that, Rabin thought he had won a big prize and  could, consequently, undermine the entire peace process,  particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He ignores the  fact that peace is made by peoples, not individuals, and that  peace is strengthened when it is based on principles of justice,  right and UN charters. He also ignores the fact that an  illusionary peace will inevitably collapse in the face of the  people's strikes and struggle for the sake of their usurped  rights and occupied lands. Hence, we can see his attacks on  Lebanon and his flagrant avoidance of the requirements of the  peace process on the Syrian track, that is, complete and  comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan Heights.    This Israeli subversion damages the U.S. peace initiative,  the United States' credibility and its commitments, as well as  the efforts of the world community. It will inevitably lead to  a great failure for U.S. policy in the Middle East. The United  States, Russia, and other parties in the world community have a  rare opportunity to return things to their proper order and to  revive the peace efforts. This can be done by denouncing  Israel's aggression, in a clear and decisive way, especially  because Lebanon has made an urgent protest to the UN Security  Council. Naturally, denunciation alone is not sufficient.  Deeds must accompany words. Israel must be asked to precisely  implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from  all Arab territories.    Syria will always support Lebanon. Israel's threats and  actions will have no influence whatsoever on the two countries'  determination to regain their occupied territories in full,  regardless of sacrifices.</p>

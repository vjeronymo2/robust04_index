			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Mironov: "V.V.Zh Has Disagreements with </F> Pamyat"]    [Text] Mr. Zhirinovskiy is a programmed computer  filled with the positions and postures of all the parties,"  believes Dmitriy Vasilyev, leader of the national patriotic  front Pamyat.    He spoke yesterday at a press conference on the occasion of  the refusal of the Ministry of Justice of Russia to register his  front's charter. Assessing this kind of reaction by the state  organ as "genocide against Russian thought and the Russian right  to a world outlook and a political position," Vasilyev continued  his tirade directed at V.V.Zh. He called absolutely groundless  the suppositions that Pamyat and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] are united. In his opinion, this Liberal  Democrat preaches ideas of national socialism, and his  militaristic statements set the Russian people against other  people and states. The statement that the Russian boot will be  washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean is political  adventurism, if not political provocation.    The Pamyat leader said that V.V.Zh. "likes to call himself a  Russian and speak in behalf of the Russian people. But it is  necessary to be honest and not hide his nationality."</p>

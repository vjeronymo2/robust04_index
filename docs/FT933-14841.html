			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Spanish judge again rejects KIO plea to try ex-chairman SPAIN'S senior financial crimes judge has for the third time this year rejected efforts by the Kuwait Investment Office to open criminal proceedings against the former chairman of the KIO, Sheikh Fahad Mohammed Al Sabah, and the former management of the KIO's troubled Spanish industrial investments. The KIO claims that it lost all Dollars 5bn invested in Spain in the mid-1980s because of mismanagement and that up to Dollars 500m of this was stolen. The judge, rejecting a new KIO writ on Friday, said the Kuwaitis had produced no new evidence and there was no evidence in the writ of criminal conduct. The KIO will appeal, for the second time. The tortuous efforts of the KIO to get an investigation opened in Spain coincide with indications that a civil writ issued against many of the same defendants in London is also likely to become bogged down in arguments over jurisdiction. While the KIO is headquartered in London, most of the allegedly criminal behaviour by former Kuwaiti and Spanish managers took place in Spain. The new rebuff for the KIO in Spain comes alongside publication of a Kuwaiti parliamentary investigation into the KIO's big losses in Spain, in which a senior KIO official is quoted as saying he was told in 1990 by Sheikh Fahad not to speak of a secret transfer of Dollars 300m from Spain to secret KIO accounts as the money was being used to make 'political' payments. The transfer occurred during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when the emirate was looking for international support to help eject the invaders. While the position of the Kuwaiti government is that no funds were used to make political payments and that the money was, indeed, stolen, the parliamentary commission report says it could not find a good explanation as to why it had been decided to make criminal charges in Spain and civil ones in the UK. It recommended that the KIO drop its traditional legal advisers, Stephenson Harwood.</p>

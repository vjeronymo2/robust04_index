			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Management: The real fight in a phoney war - Robert Rice looks at the international counterfeit trade In February 1989, Britain's Department of Health informed Glaxo that counterfeits of its ulcer drug, Zantac, had been found in the UK. This was a serious blow for Glaxo. Zantac was then, and still is, the world's best selling drug with sales of more than Pounds 1.7bn worldwide last year. The last thing the company wanted was a loss of confidence in the drug which was driving its bottom line. Although, officially, this was the first time that fake pharmaceuticals had been discovered in the UK, Glaxo cannot have been surprised. Counterfeit drugs are big business. The International Chamber of Commerce estimates that 5 per cent of the Dollars 100bn of pharmaceuticals sold across borders each year are fake. As an expensive drug in huge demand, Zantac was an obvious target. But it is not just counterfeit drugs which are big business. Just about everything from perfume to motor spares has been targeted by pirates in recent years. In 1990, the Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau estimated that as much as 6 per cent of world trade was counterfeit. Last year, that had risen to 8 per cent. The cost to legitimate business in lost sales and damage to reputation can only be guessed at. In the music industry, 500m counterfeit cassettes, compact discs and records flood the markets each year, costing an industry worth Dollars 25bn worldwide an estimated Dollars 1.5bn in lost sales. The strategies adopted by industry for tackling piracy include: Co-ordinated, industry-wide action at domestic and international level. This approach is common to industries where the scale of the problem limits the impact of unilateral action by individual companies and where there are consumer safety implications. Industry associations formulate and promote anti-piracy policies and co-ordinate international efforts. Containment through customs regimes. Common to most areas of industry where counterfeit imports threaten domestic markets. Involves keeping customs informed of legitimate importers and the use of covert devices by manufacturers in packaging and design to identify the legitimate product. Lobbying legislators for tighter protection of patents, trade marks and copyright through vehicles such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Common to most industries where there is an agreed overall approach to protection of intellectual property rights. The music industry for example believes uniform copyright protection of 50 years in Europe and America would substantially reduce the problem of pirated records, tapes and CDs. Unilateral action by companies to search, seize and destroy counterfeit goods. Common to industries which suffer badly from cheap, mass-produced imitations such as the fashion, perfume, watches and shoe industries. A number of industries use a combination of these strategies. In the pharmaceutical sector, the preference is for co-ordinated industry-wide action. Drug companies are not discouraged from taking unilateral action, says Peter Lumley of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. But because of the potentially fatal consequences of counterfeit medicines, they tend to be wary of saying 'there is a question mark over our product', in case it produces a loss of confidence. Glaxo has experimented with holograms on its packaging and odd shapes for pills which cannot be made easily by standard machinery. Europe has a thriving circular trade in pharmaceuticals, thanks to pricing differentials for medicines in EC member states. France, for example, pays 30 per cent less than the UK for its products, making it highly profitable for importers to buy in bulk in France and import back to the UK. EC competition rules prevent manufacturers from taking action to stop them. This circular trade makes it much harder for wholesalers to spot counterfeits mixed in with bulk consignments of legitimate imports and blunts attempts by manufacturers to tackle the problem through tighter control of distribution chains. Ford which has a growing problem with counterfeit spare motor parts flooding into Europe adopts a policy of containment, working closely with customs and trading standards officers. The company believes there is little point trying to track down the source of counterfeit production. 'Chances are it will be a factory in a third world country employing 300 people which is vital to the local economy,' Ford says. 'You're unlikely to get much co-operation from the authorities in that situation.' Like the drug companies, Ford is working on covert changes to its packaging of spare parts which are sold under the trademark, Motorcraft. It is, however, reluctant to talk about the problem. The counterfeits tend to be high-selling parts, such as brake pads and tyres. The safety implications of poor quality fakes are obvious and the company is not keen to advertise its predicament. A number of industries support the idea of tighter customs controls. Customs controls in the single market are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain around the Community. More than 100 companies including Reebok, Adidas, Apple, Nike, IBM, and Nintendo, support a call for tighter customs controls in the EC. They want EC customs to consult them when they receive shipments from companies outside the community, not authorised to import their products. Other companies use private investigators or their own in-house investigation units. Lacoste spends FFr15m (Pounds 1.72m) a year on combating piracy. Yves Saint Laurent group has set aside Pounds 3.3m a year to tackle the problem and hired its own investigator. It believes this approach has paid dividends. In the first half of 1990, it carried out 600 raids in Bangkok, Malaysia and Taipei, seizing documents establishing a connection between counterfeit producers of YSL, Chanel and L'Oreal goods, and companies in France which it is suing. In a recent public display of its tough new approach, it ceremoniously destroyed part of a counterfeit haul of its perfume, Opium, with a street value of Pounds 11m, seized in north London. The company is a long way from eradicating the problem, but says that if you know the source of the counterfeits, it's an approach which makes sense.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Canada cancels airport sale Canada's newly-elected Liberal government has cancelled a CDollars 700m contract to privatise Toronto's international airport, the country's busiest, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. The deal, which involved a long-term lease over two of the airport's three terminals, was signed with a property development and construction consortium in the last days of the previous Progressive Conservative government. But the contract has been strongly criticised on both commercial and political grounds.</p>

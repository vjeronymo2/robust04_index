In an  interview with EL TIEMPO he explores his political future and  says that he and Andres are both endowed with the essential  qualities to beat [Ernesto] Samper and Humberto De la Calle.    [EL TIEMPO] There are those who say that your nomination to  the vice presidency does not add, but on the contrary, could  represent a setback to Andres Pastrana...    [Ramirez] No. We are a young team that represents this  country's future. The Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is not merely an  election maneuver that intends to fall back on party principles  and platforms as has occurred in other cases. What we have here  is an affinity of opinions; there is a program we both share and  no fissures. The vice president does not criticize the  presidential candidate, nor is the vice president to the  presidential candidate as water is to oil. What takes  precedence here is both our interest in having a coherent and  viable platform.    [EL TIEMPO] Concretely, you as a technocrat without any  broad  grass-root followers, how can you benefit Andres Pastrana?    [Ramirez] Success no longer depends on any specific  traditional politician but on the performance of those officials  in public service. I believe that Andres Pastrana and I are  both perceived as persons who do not speak much but execute a  lot. What we have promised we have honored. That has been a  constant throughout Andres' career: his word is sacred. That  has also been my line of conduct. We promised we would carry  out social security reforms and we did. This law will allow a  more balanced and fair income distribution.    [EL TIEMPO] Yet the reform has been somewhat controversial  and the law has created dissatisfaction. Don't you believe that  this could prove to be a disadvantage to Pastrana's campaign?    [Ramirez] This is the most substantial social reform that  has  taken place in Colombia in the last 50 years. This reform  guarantees wide-ranging health service coverage. The law  provides a retirement pension, and provides senior citizens as  well as the homeless with half of the minimum wage... This is  something that has never been seen in Colombia.    [EL TIEMPO] What specific support will you contribute to  Andres Pastrana?    [Ramirez] It would be worthwhile keeping in mind that I have  been a public official for the past 14 years, and despite being  young, I still have more experience than many older persons in  the government. I have been working shoulder to shoulder since  1986 with persons such as President Gaviria. I was part of the  president's economic team and took part in the economic, foreign  trade, and labor reforms. In other words, we participated in  those reforms that brought about institutional changes. We took  part in decisions that benefited the country.    We are evidently devoted to progress and willing to bet on  this country's future. I am a person who likes to work and that  has been a constant throughout my life. I come from a low  income household; a son of farmers currently living in Santander  and from that perspective I represent that department. I am not  a product of the oligarchy or the aristocracy.    [EL TIEMPO] It is being said that your father's kidnapping  could benefit Andres Pastrana's campaign. What can you say  about that observation?    [Ramirez] The kidnapping and the campaign are two completely  separate issues. Most naturally, the kidnapping has affected my  attitude and it is something I will have to overcome. This type  of experience prompts one to want to make good decisions; the  ones leading to critical changes that will ensure that it does  not happen to any other family. The experience does have an  effect, and it is in terms of earnestly seeking for Colombian  society to be more egalitarian.    [EL TIEMPO] What are the most positive qualities you see in  your strongest opponent, Humberto De la Calle?    [Ramirez] I have the best opinion of Mr. De la Calle and  agreed with most of the things he said. During the past eight  months he continuously explained why we should not vote for  Ernesto Samper. He said that Samper is a populist, and I agreed  with that. He has indicated that the Samper-De la Calle ticket  is like water and oil and I agreed with that. Now the country  can't understand why he suddenly changed his mind and became a  populist.    [EL TIEMPO] What are the most significant differences  between you and Humberto De la Calle?    [Ramirez] We never relinquish our convictions or abdicate  our  government programs for the sake of election objectives. The  Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is a ticket where there is symmetry in  opinions and no splits.    [EL TIEMPO] What do you consider to be the biggest blunder  of  the Samper-De la Calle slate?    [Ramirez] To believe that an election is simply a matter of  adding up votes. If they are merely interested in votes, then  many of them will now lose. The people who were backing Samper  are now dissatisfied as a result of having handed over their  platform to De la Calle, and those who supported De la Calle are  also dissatisfied because of the same reason.    [EL TIEMPO] You have suggested a public debate with Humberto  De la Calle. What would be the primary topic of that debate?    [Ramirez] We would do it based on each ticket's government  platform. Voters want to examine the programs being suggested  by each candidate, to evaluate which is more convincing and to  decide on which is more loaded with election promises.    [EL TIEMPO] In case of winning, are you prepared to take  over  as president if Pastrana is forced to be absent for whatever  reasons?    [Ramirez] I will give you one clue. I have held many  positions, and I have probably been involved in government  service more than Mr. De la Calle. Without any doubt I am quite  prepared to handle the government issues this country needs. I  have been part of the Executive Branch during the past three  administrations. I am quite clear on the changes that have been  taking place during the past decades. I have also worked  closely with congress. While a minister affiliated with the  Conservative Party, I led a reform program in a congress  controlled by the liberals.</p>

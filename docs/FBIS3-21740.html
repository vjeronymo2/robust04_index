			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Excerpt] A spectacular blow was dealt to the drug traffic  yesterday by the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR]. In several operations conducted in five of the  Federation's states, it seized 11 tons and 215 kg of dried and  packed marijuana worth over 200 million new pesos. In addition,  22 presumed drug traffickers were arrested, and 15 automotive  vehicles confiscated.    During the same operations, Federal Judicial Police [PJF]  personnel seized 92.5 kg of ephedrine, a chemical precursor used  to manufacture amphetamines and to "cut" cocaine, so as to make  that stimulant more potent.    The institution of federal justice cited a report from  Sonora  State, on the largest seizure of drugs, totaling 5,304 kg of  marijuana, in an operation carried out in the vicinity of  Benjamin Hill, at a PJF highway checkpoint. The PGR's  representative in that state noted that the drugs were found on  a tank truck bearing the label "nitrogen," which had left  Guadalajara bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. The  Federal Judicial Police discovered the ephedrine together with  the marijuana.    The vehicle's driver, Juan Silva Saenz, claimed that the  drugs had been packed in Jalisco State, and stored in a false  bottom of the tank truck's structure. [passage omitted]</p>

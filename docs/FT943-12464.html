The Lazard Birla fund will aim to raise about Pounds 100m from retail and institutional investors this autumn. The UK's first Indian investment trust, launched earlier this year by Fleming Investment Trust Management, attracted Pounds 84m. BK Birla is one of India's largest industrial groups, and has interests in many sectors but has not previously been associated with fund management. Mr Adrian Collins, a Lazard director, said Birla's contribution to the fund would be advice based on its depth of knowledge of Indian companies, and understanding of the nature of business in India. Investments will be made in a wide range of Indian equities, with a probable slight bias towards medium-sized and smaller companies. A Lazard team has been working on the project for nine months, and believes it has now resolved the tax complications for foreigners investing in India, which has a favourable tax treaty only with Mauritius. Fleming's India fund developed a structure which invested via Mauritius.</p>

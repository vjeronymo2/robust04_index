			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Delta Air Lines in move to lay off 600 pilots DELTA Air Lines, one of the 'big three' US carriers, yesterday announced plans to lay off 600 pilots - the first temporary lay-offs of permanent staff the carrier has implemented in 36 years. Delta sought to place the lay-offs in the context of a 'fleet simplification' plan, although the move also appeared to be a warning shot across the pilots' union's bows. The plan, Delta said, would involve the retirement of 21 Airbus A310 aircraft which the company took over when it acquired assets - including transatlantic routes - from the now-defunct Pan Am in 1991. However, Delta would accept nine new A310s which it has on order, and the net loss of 12 A310s will help to accommodate a reduction in the carrier's transatlantic schedules next autumn. The carrier is also planning to retire 16 Boeing 727 aircraft, most of which are employed on the east coast 'shuttle' routes. They will be replaced on these routes by newer 727s, plucked from elsewhere in the domestic network. The aircraft retirements represent a 3 per cent reduction in transatlantic capacity, and a 1 per cent reduction for the group overall. Delta said the moves made surplus 600 pilots, and said it planned to begin laying off employees - on a last-in, first-out basis - from June. Mr Ron Allen, Delta chairman, was quick to deny that the staff cutbacks were related to the carrier's long-running dispute with the Air Line Pilots Association. However, pilots are the only employees at Delta who are unionised, and the only group which has stood out against the carrier's recent request for wage cuts. According to Delta, about 11 per cent of its pilots have offered to take pay cuts, despite the fact that their union has not been able to agree terms on a pay reduction package with management. An application to start a new airline, called Friendship Airlines, was filed with the US Department of Transportation yesterday. The carrier would be headed by Mr Stephen Kolski, a former president of Continental Express, and backed by Mr Frank Lorenzo, the controversial former owner of Continental. Mr Lorenzo, who was renowned in the airline industry for his hard-nosed labour tactics and reviled by the unions, would also be a director of the new airline.</p>

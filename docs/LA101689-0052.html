			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PALO ALTO;  </P> <P> CUSTOMER PUTS RING ON FINGER AND FLEES  </P> <P> A customer at a Palo Alto Neiman-Marcus department store slipped a $102,000,  five-carat diamond ring on his finger and then bolted from the store, fleeing  in a vehicle driven by another man, police said. The suspect, about 30 to 35  years old, 200 to 220 pounds with brown hair, walked up to the jewelry counter  at the swank store in the Stanford Shopping Center and asked to see several  rings. A store security camera photographed him as he tried on the diamond ring  and ran out the door.  </P></p>

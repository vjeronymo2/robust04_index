			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Accountants in ascendancy TEN TIMES as many senior executives of quoted British companies are chartered accountants as are engineers or surveyors, the latest edition of the Arthur Andersen Corporate Register, published by Hemmington Scott, shows. From a database of more than 15,000 directors and senior officers in the 2,000 quoted companies, 2,100 or nearly 15 per cent are qualified accountants. Just over 200 are either chartered engineers or surveyors, while only 41 have MBA degrees. Less than 3 per cent of the total are women, and less than 5 per cent of them hold executive directorships. Nearly 900 went to Oxford or Cambridge University, and the single most common school - with 194 former pupils - was Eton. There are 730 with some sort of honour, including 320 with the CBE, 347 knights and 104 lords. There are also two princes and two reverends with positions on boards. The average male director is aged 53. The oldest is Lord Shawcross, the non-executive director of Caffyns and a director of the Observer, who is 90. The youngest, at 26, is Mr Jean-Jacques Murray, director of US operations for Nu-Swift. Golf is the most popular recreation, which was mentioned by 1,532 people. Arthur Andersen Corporate Register. Hemmington Scott, City Innovation Centre, 26-31 Whiskin Street, London EC1R 0BP. Twice a year, Pounds 150.</p>

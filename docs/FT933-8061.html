			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Coming down English Heritage has agreed to the demolition of a 200ft listed cotton mill chimney at Skipton, North Yorkshire. Sylko cotton thread was made there from the early 1800s but the now redundant landmark is deteriorating. It will be taken down brick by brick in a six-week operation because of its proximity to the Leeds-Liverpool canal and surrounding buildings</p>

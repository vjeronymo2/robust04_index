			<p>BFN     [Text] High-ranking Army officers who are serving in the  central barracks of Brasilia have been worrying all day about  the adverse reaction of troops who refused to obey the orders of  President Itamar Franco and Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de  Lucena to intervene in the Federal Police [PF] strike.  Commenting on the low PF salaries, an Army officer asked: How  can we intervene in the PF strike if they are demanding the same  rights that we have for some time been struggling for?    PF strike leader Francisco Carlos Garisto, who is an expert  in drug enforcement and the president of the Federal Policemen  National Federation, today commented on the Army's intervention  in the strike. He rejected the possibility of clashes, but  asserted that the PF will not give a single inch.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Trade talks plea at Madrid summit LEADERS from Spain, Portugal and Latin America closed the working sessions of their summit in Madrid yesterday, expressing concern that failure of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations would jeopardise economic reforms of recent years. The second day of the summit - the second held by the leaders of the Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula  -was taken up by economic issues. The leaders were expected to reaffirm the importance of their economic reforms, but also expressed a preoccupation with protectionist trends. Many countries in Latin America have unilaterally lowered trade barriers, but meet frustration in selling products to industrialised countries, including the EC. Seventeen Latin leaders including Cuba's Fidel Castro attended the summit, which was expected to back a declaration underlining the importance of 'representative democracy' and respect for human rights. Despite openly expressed pressure on Mr Castro to reform his political system, the Cuban leader was apparently unrepentant. He used his speech to the opening session for an attack on the US, accusing it of trying to govern the planet and through its 'blockade' of Cuba of 'genocide'.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Letter: Statistical change-over Sir, I would like to correct some impressions given in Economics Notebook (December 14) about trade statistics. First, Intrastat, the new trade system, is a European Community-wide system developed by the European Community. Decisions were taken Community-wide not to overlap the new and the old customs-based trade statistics systems. The reason for doing so was not to impose a very onerous reporting burden on the bigger companies which will now be filling out the monthly trade statistics returns. Second, it is grossly unfair to infer that this decision not to overlap the two systems is in any way related to what has happened to the UK economy at the moment. I simply draw your attention to the fact that this pause in publication of economic trade statistics was first announced in February this year. Third, to be certain that statistical returns of the Intrastat system are complete and accurate, the period up to June will be used to check intensively that the data meet our usual high-quality standards, including checks against equivalent VAT returns. If other member states actually do publish statistics before the UK, users would be advised to check their quality very carefully.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Warmongers' Reckless </F> Military Reinforcement Maneuvers"]    [Text] These days, the South Korean puppets are all the  more viciously stepping up maneuvers to prepare for a new war.  According to broadcast reports from Seoul, the puppet defense  ministry is reportedly examining a plan to bring in Patriot  missiles from 1997 as part of the next-generation antiair  defense project.    The puppet defense ministry and the headquarters of the  joint  chiefs of staff are reportedly pushing ahead with the plan to  bring in the Patriot missiles because Nike Hercules and Hawk  antiair missiles were brought in more than 20 years ago and,  furthermore, there is the need to counter the North's missiles.  It was also learned that the puppet defense ministry secretly  informed lawmakers of the national defense committee of the  puppet national assembly of its plan some days ago. Before the  national assembly interpellation session, an opposition lawmaker  distributed a script that proved that the puppet defense  ministry had included introduction of the Patriot missiles in  the SAM-X project starting in 1997.    In addition, it was known that the South Korean puppets are  carefully examining the introduction of the Russian S-300 PMU  missiles. In a script distributed for the national assembly  interpellation in advance on 21 February, the puppet defense  ministry revealed that it will decide on the ultramodern weapon  systems, after conducting a comparative study of similar weapon  systems from around the world, and thus hinted that the purchase  of the Russian S-300 PMU missiles is under review.    This clearly shows how much the South Korean puppets are  running amok in the military reinforcement to prepare for a new  war and reveals the rascals' antinational, bellicose colors. As  is already known, in connection with the criminal acts of the  U.S. and South Korean puppets to deploy the Patriot missiles, we  cleared our stance on 31 January through the Foreign Ministry  spokesman's statement.    Voices opposing the deployment of the Patriot missile to  South Korea are also strongly resounding among the South Korean  people. One example of this is that on 19 February, hundreds of  youth, students, and people in Seoul carried out demonstrations  shaking their fists to protest the plan of the United States to  deploy the Patriot missile to South Korea. They shouted slogans  of "Yankees go home!" and "Do not import weapons!" and carried  out demonstrations.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are planning to drag  in the Patriot missile to South Korea at any cost and are even  planning to drag in Russian-made missiles. This shows very well  what the situation of the rascals' maneuver to prepare for a new  war to invade the North is.    The maneuver to indiscriminately import missiles by the  puppets is an intolerable challenge toward all the people who  desire the country's peace and peaceful reunification. It is  also an act that can be carried out only by a group of war  maniacs running toward the road of war and confrontation.    It is clear to anyone that the deployment of up-to-date  missiles including the Patriot missile to South Korea will bring  about a very dangerous situation in which it will all the more  aggravate the tense situation in our country and increase the  danger of war. Moreover, launching a criminal maneuver of  dragging in up-to-date missiles at a time when violent remarks  that enhance war mania are being made everyday among the  bellicose elements in the United States and South Korea cannot  but be regarded as a grave matter.    The Kim Yong-sam ring which is even planning to drag in  missiles which are murderous weapons because it lacked even  dragging in some 1,000 various nuclear weapons to South Korea to  change it into the largest nuclear advance base of the Far East,  is a very wicked nation-seller and a warmonger's group that  greatly surpasses his predecessors, the military fascist  dictatorial maniacs.    All facts prove that if the bellicose group such as the Kim  Yong-sam ring that does not even hesitate to push the nation  toward nuclear calamity is left alone, the danger of war cannot  be eliminated in our country.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the remainder of  its dirty doomed life by clinging to the outside forces at the  price of advancing as the shock brigade of the aggressive  policy. However, this is a foolish act. This will only advance  their destruction. The Kim Yong-sam ring must contemplate over  the grave consequence which the reckless war maneuver will bring  about, act with discretion, and immediately stop the maneuver to  bring in up-to-date missiles including the Patriot missile.</p>

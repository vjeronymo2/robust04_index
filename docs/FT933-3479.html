			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Public backs pension equalisation at 65, says CBI A MAJORITY of the public is in favour of the qualifying age for state pension benefits being equalised at 65, according to an opinion poll conducted for the Confederation of British Industry. The poll, by Gallup, suggests that while most people support a phasing-in period - so that women now approaching 60 should not have their retirement expectations disappointed - most also appreciate the potential impact on the social security budget of universal retirement at 60. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the findings 'show that people have a much better understanding of the realities of this important issue than is generally appreciated. 'People recognise that the ultimate costs of equality in the state scheme at 60 are insupportable. Older people, who have been expecting women to be able to draw their pension from 60, are understandably less keen to change. But even in the 45-64 age range, four in every 10 do not want to see age 60 adopted for everyone.' Mr Davies added: 'The figures offer clear pointers for government policy. The public is ready to support a long-term strategy to move to equality at 65, combined with a reasonable transition period. That would be firmly in line with moves in other major economies.' The poll showed that 52 per cent of respondents do not wish to see 60 adopted as the retirement age. However, 48 per cent said they would contenance the extra cost or face cuts elsewhere in the social security budget to introduce universal retirement at 60.</p>

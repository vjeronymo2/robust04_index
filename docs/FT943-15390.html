			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wates Pounds 31m rights issue meets lacklustre response Sub-underwriters, led by Mercury Asset Management, have been left with up to four fifths of the shares in Wates City of London Properties' Pounds 31m rights issue. Only 21 per cent of the shares were taken up, according to Cazenove and SG Warburg Securities, brokers to the issue. MAM had agreed to sub-underwrite up to 100 per cent of the issue on behalf of discretionary clients. On this basis MAM's stake in Wates could have risen to about 25 per cent, although it is believed it was not the sole sub-underwriter. The outcome was not unexpected given that the 2-for-7 issue was at 73p, only 7p lower than the previous day's closing price. Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 71p. It is the company's second rights issue in less than 12 months. Wates raised Pounds 24m last September when the proceeds were used to cut borrowings. This time, the company said it intended to use the cash to take advantage of rising property values by carrying out new developments and allowing it to retain existing buildings.</p>

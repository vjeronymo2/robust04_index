			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AMERICAN TO BE FREED IN EL SALVADOR;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: NO EVIDENCE THAT CONN. WOMAN HELPED HIDE WEAPONS, PRESIDENT  CRISTIANI SAYS.  </P> <P> President Alfredo Cristiani said today that an American accused of storing  weapons for leftist rebels will be released from prison because there is no  evidence that she helped conceal the weapons.  </P> <P> Cristiani said that Jennifer Casolo, 28, of Thomaston, Conn., will probably be  released later today and deported Thursday but that she will be asked to remain  available as a witness in the case.  </P> <P> However, Cristiani told a news conference that he thought Casolo probably had  in fact cooperated with rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front, who launched a major urban offensive in San Salvador last month.  </P> <P> Cristiani said she is being released only because of lack of evidence.  </P> <P> "I am morally convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty," Cristiani said.  </P> <P> The president said he had not been pressured by the government of the United  States to order Casolo's release. The United States is a key financial  supporter of the rightist government in its war with the rebels.  </P> <P> Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) said earlier today that he had been told in  telephone conversations with Salvadoran officials, including Cristiani, that  Casolo will be released and expelled from the country by Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Cristiani "informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the  charges against Jennifer were not fully supported by the evidence, and that she  could not thus be fairly prosecuted under Salvadoran law," Dodd said.  </P> <P> Casolo went to El Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian Education Seminars, a  group that organizes tours for Americans to learn about the 10-year-old civil  war.  </P> <P> Casolo and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a police raid on  her house in San Salvador. From the walled garden behind the house, police  said, they uncovered 103 mortar grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405  detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for  Soviet-made automatic rifles.  </P></p>

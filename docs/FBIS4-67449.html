SEGODNYA has already reported about the book the  minister helped write, a book that sets forth a new  environmental concept for Russia. The concept is based on  avoiding environmental crimes characteristic of nascent  capitalism and preserving the natural reserve we inherited from  the centralized administrative system. A golden mean is always  desirable but almost never attainable in practice. By contrast,  the idea of a special Russian path seems forever popular.    Frolov: Viktor Ivanovich, can it be that the idea  of a so-called unique Russian path is attractive to  environmentalists as well?    Danilov-Danilyan: I am absolutely against viewing  Russia as an exclusive country, in any case in the sense of its  searching for ways to harmonious coexist with its own nature.  Everybody has to review approaches of protecting the  environment--the United States, Europe, Japan, third-world  countries. Russia's uniqueness consists in that virtually  one-third of its territory has never been subject to economic  influences. We are confronted with special problems from the  standpoint of protecting it, but we will have to solve them. In  doing so, we should by no means pit ourselves against the rest  of the world. On the contrary, we must integrate our own efforts  into the environmental protection efforts of mankind. The Rome  Club's famous slogan urging people to think globally but act  locally has become obsolete to a significant extent. In any  case, there is not a single post-industrial country that has not  already used this path. Nevertheless, pressures on the biosphere  continue to mount.    Frolov: Why is it that in Russia, with its  devil-may-care attitude toward the environment, to put it  crudely, the situation is not as disastrous as commonly thought?    Danilov-Danilyan: We are saved only by the  circumstance that Russia occupies 12.5 percent of the world's  land mass, while just 2.5 percent of the world's population  lives on its territory. Meanwhile, Russia's "contribution" to  the pollutants produced throughout the world is 10 percent,  which is four times greater than average indices. If other  countries allowed themselves to do the same, the Earth could not  withstand it. It is very fashionable to talk about geopolitics  these days, but most of those who discuss this topic do not  realize that this in particular is its chief aspect.    Frolov: It is equally fashionable to say today the  Russian population is declining. Wouldn't the reverse process be  an even greater problem, considering the harm we have caused to  the environment, and consequently to ourselves?    Danilov-Danilyan: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov also  talked about "genocide" and said the blame for it rested with  the Gaydar government. Such ignorance may be excusable for a  military man, but for a doctor of economics? Rejection of the  principle of high birth rates occurred in the 1920s and 1930s.  What is happening today was, if not 100 percent, then 90 percent  foreordained by the preceding development of demographic  processes.    Traditional perceptions of a favorable or unfavorable  demographic situation are flawed from an ecological standpoint.  We are now confronted with the need to take into account the  factor of relative overpopulation. It is not enough to simply  look at the ratio of the able-bodied to non-able-bodied  population; we must take into account the possibility of higher  productivity on the part of the able-bodied segment of society,  something that will be able to support more "dependents."    Our problem is that Russia, while experiencing relative  overpopulation as expressed in overconsumption of resources,  does not have an efficient economy or efficient production.    Frolov: But modern science-intensive, energy- and  resource-conserving technologies are the primary means of  protecting the ecosphere from the onslaught of civilization. In  this respect Russia doesn't have too many chances.    Danilov-Danilyan: Nonscience-intensive production  is dying out, regardless of what anyone might like. For the  simple reason that it is worn out. Its continued use is becoming  either physically impossible or economically ruinous. More and  more money is needed for repairs, and such production consumes  more and more raw materials and energy and produces more and  more wastes, for which we are also having to pay today. In  addition, it is no longer profitable to produce obsolete  equipment today--it is extremely materials-intensive, and  enterprises that produce such equipment are the main ones that  are failing economically. And so we see here a mechanism of  natural selection, even though, of course, one might like to  artificially stimulate it. The claim that nothing is being  modernized or built in our country is nonsense. Last year alone,  environmental experts analyzed 64,000 design documents. We sent  only 4 percent of them back for further work. Not one of the  others failed to meet environmental-protection requirements. And  so in contrast to many people, I see no grounds for deep  pessimism.    Frolov: So the current state of our science, which  is instrumental in the emergence of new technologies, doesn't  make you pessimistic?    Danilov-Danilyan: In recent months all I hear is  that science is dying. The same thing was said over and over in  the United States about American science 30 to 35 years ago. At  that time the USSR launched the first satellites, and the  Americans panicked. They calculated that we had 10 times more  people going into science that they did. Then they began talking  in utter seriousness about the intellectual death of the nation.  People in our country are saying in horror that scientists are  going into business. I don't see anything wrong with that. Now  when they leave the country--that is indeed dangerous.    Moreover, we have an enormous backlog of research projects.  And even if we are experiencing a pause--so what, we'll survive.  In general, we underestimate the role of social  self-organization. We are used to regimentation and rigid  planning, but no society lives like that in a transitional  period.    Frolov: Unfortunately, not only do we have an  obsession with planning; we have also failed to outgrow our  passion for classifying anything and everything. We have learned  the truth about the environmental situation in Russia thanks to  the fact that many documents have been declassified. Now a  presidential edict has authorized the Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources itself to be a "classifier."  How do you intend to exercise that right?    Danilov-Danilyan: First, we never petitioned to  obtain that right. Second, we view it not as an opportunity to  classify things, but on the contrary, to lift the ban on  publishing information that does not constitute a state secret.  For example, we intend to publish the declassified section of  the Russian register of radiation objects. But it would be  absolutely naive to think that the text is utterly devoid of  secrets.    In general, environmental information can be used to gather  a  great deal of information affecting national security. For  example, a great deal can be learned from satellite surveillance  of the behavior of birds carrying sensors about the size of a  thimble. Naturally, more traditional methods are also widely  used. So the decision adopted doesn't surprise us in the least.</p>

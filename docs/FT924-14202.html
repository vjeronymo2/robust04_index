			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Fashion: One small voice is heard in the land of the giants  -Why London is such a worthwhile launchpad for talented young designers to show their potential TWICE A year, between the ready-to-wear giants of Milan and Paris, the London designer shows flare briefly over a weekend, invariably amid trade and media soul-searching as to whether they are necessary and viable. The British Fashion Council says the clothing industry is healthy, worth Pounds 6 1/2 bn, including Pounds 2bn in exports, an increase of 8 per cent this year. The industry employs 180,000 even in this deep recession. So why the designer worries? The problem is that 'clothing', rather than 'fashion', sums up most of the British industry. John Wilson of the BFC estimates that the high-profile designers revealing their wares for next spring this weekend account for only about 2 per cent of the total and that any of them turning over more than Pounds 1m per year are doing well. Yet, ever since the Swinging Sixties put London creativity on the map, they have exerted an influence out of all proportion to the size of their businesses. Britain's talented and underfunded designers must try to attract as many international buyers and press as the vast, industry-backed circuses of Milan and Paris. They export nearly 70 per cent of their production, against 26 per for the rest of the industry. British designers who take their shows to the other capitals in an attempt to tackle the wider market are reviled as unpatriotic. This year the annual British Designer Awards has become embroiled in controversy over what is 'British'. Some designers have declined nominations because they disagree with the entry criteria. This dispute risks making the one British fashion event of the year that gets serious national TV coverage look ridiculous. It also risks the accusation that British fashion is about nothing but squabbling in a very small arena. But all is far from gloomy. The London Designer Show is the most attractive, best-organised exhibition and catwalk venue in Europe and, by clever juggling of sponsorship, the organisers are able to keep prices at a level to which designers without vast backing can at least aspire. Those who choose to show elsewhere in London still attract buyers, either because, like Jean Muir, they have shown in the same place for years and their customers know where to find them, or because they are young, new and impecunious in which case the buyers will come lest they miss a new talent. The buyers' eye for creativity may be even more important this year - so far the international response looks more promising than for some time and the devalued pound must help. Annette Worsley-Taylor, show organiser, says: 'Now the longer skirt is well-established there is a feeling that fashion needs something else new and exciting. The buyers' hunch is that London may possibly offer it. Designers here aren't into big, glitzy, supermodel-packed shows but buyers have had enough of those and there is now a recognition that British fashion is not just tweed and knitwear on the one hand and wacky street fashion on the other. We are increasingly known for well-designed yet interesting, beautifully-cut clothes.' Worsley-Taylor insists that government and industry support for designer-fashion exports is essential if British designers want to move into the European market. Yet this is where the quandaries start. Once backing, sometimes from international companies, is provided, there is a tendency for designers to show abroad, especially if that is where their collections are made. As John Richmond, who shows spectacularly in London and is for the first time a nominee for Designer of the Year, says: 'In the end you have to go to the centre, and that is Paris. I am looking for agents to sell my diffusion range in Europe in a year's time. If that works out and we expand as a result then we will probably move the show.' But those moving on from London clear the stage for newcomers. This season several excellent designers, such as Jasper Conran and Ally Capellino, who have not been able to afford a show for some years, have corporate help - from Marchpole, part of the French Biedermann group, and Coats Viyella respectively - which will give them the well-deserved exposure that a catwalk show brings. Industrial support for European designers helps explain Continental fashion's gloss and efficiency. Finally the same kind of links are happening in the UK, though they will work only if they are light-handed enough to allow the designers full creative play. Meanwhile, young and as yet unsponsored talents arise and London is a comparatively inexpensive launch-pad. John Richmond has been pushing for years to make London an international showcase for young designers. 'We haven't the resources to be the same as Paris or Milan', he says, 'so we need to establish ourselves as something different. As we are known for creativity we should move in that direction.' As a huge fashion-selling powerhouse Britain may always be outgunned by France, Italy and Germany. But as a breeding ground for innovative designers Britain seem to have arrived.</p>

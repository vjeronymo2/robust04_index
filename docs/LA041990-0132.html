			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE: THE CLUB SCENE;  </P> <P> WEIRD FUN;  </P> <P> LOOK OUT! HERE COMES THE DEVOLUTION  </P> <P> The rock band Devo features five weirdos from Ohio who have moved to  California. Of course, New York and Texas, along with Ohio, are empty states  now -- everyone from there is here, but that's another essay.  </P> <P> How weird are these guys? How weird is there? As weird as eating beans before  your dream date with Kim Basinger. Look in the dictionary under "weird," and  Devo's picture is there.  </P> <P> Maybe these Akron natives spent too much time breathing all those rubber fumes  or maybe it's just more proof that it's no fun if you can't complain. And Devo  has been complaining. For years.  </P> <P> "We are pro-information and anti-stupidity," says guitarist Mark Mothersbaugh.  "It is the lack of the human mind, not nuclear bombs that we fear."  </P> <P> So what's the point? Maybe it's just a way of getting people to think about  things. Or perhaps its the old Can music save the world? question. But if the  Moody Blues couldn't save the world, how can a bunch of artsy-smarty rockers  from Ohio?  </P> <P> Devo is best known for a series of totally bizarre videos beginning with "Jocko  Homo" in 1976 and continuing to the present. There was also a memorable  robotic-rock version of "Satisfaction" on an episode of Saturday Night Live.  The theme of most of the videos is coming to grips with the impact of  technology coupled with basic human stupidity.  </P> <P> For Devo, the mission is to derail an alarming trend they see -- devolution.  According to Mothersbaugh, "Devolution is the process where the human species  will soon be a victim of self-genocide brought about by its own stupidity. . .  . Devolution seems to explain what's happening after observing life on planet  Earth."  </P> <P> Devo may never play any Optimist Club gigs. But devolution nonetheless rolls on  -- the destruction of the rain forests, rampant pollution, the 49ers beating  the Rams.  </P> <P> One thing is certain, not a lot of people will be going to the Ventura Theatre  Thursday night to take notes. Most will dance. Devo rocks. It's techno-pop with  a beat. And who knows, maybe they'll sell enough $22 T-shirts to afford a  watch. Because if one of the band members had returned my last call, this  would've been much longer. . . .  </P> <P> There's a real rock 'n' roll dilemma tonight -- how can you be in four places  at once when you're not anywhere at all? Devo's playing the Ventura Theatre,  but if you've gotten this far, you knew that. Michael on Fire is in Thousand  Oaks; Spencer The Gardener is in Santa Barbara and Elvin Bishop and others are  in Isla Vista. If you somehow end up home watching "the Cosby Show," rock 'n'  roll has passed you by.  </P> <P> New albums you need right now: Eleventh Dream Day, The Stone Roses, That Petrol  Emotion, The Chills, Ben Vaughn, Sinead O'Connor, House of Love, The Hangman's  Beautiful Daughters and about a zillion more. . . .  </P> <P> And finally , unpack those flak jackets and steel pots and don't forget those  dancing shoes, looks like Raging Arb and the Redheads will be at Charlie's on  Cinco de Mayo.  </P> <P> The following local acts have tapes available at their gigs or else from the  usual suspects: The Mudheads, Nothing, Durango 95, Spencer the Gardener, The  I-Rails, J. Peter Boles, The Lion I's, and Evans and VanLoan.  </P></p>

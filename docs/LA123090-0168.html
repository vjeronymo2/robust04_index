			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS: RESALE MARKET PROPOSAL FOR FEE-SHY INVESTORS  </P> <P> In recent years, the distinction between load and no-load mutual funds has  become increasingly blurred. If Jack White has his way, investors will find it  even harder to tell one from the other.  </P> <P> White, president of Jack White &amp; Co., a San Diego-based discount brokerage,  is working to create a resale market where fee-shy investors can purchase load  mutual funds without paying the standard sales charge. If this market develops  as he hopes, people who have traditionally gone the no-load route might start  nibbling at various load products too.  </P> <P> Simply put, White's plan involves matching a person who wants out of a load  fund with another individual who wishes to purchase those shares. The buyer  pays the 'net asset value' or NAV, as he would when investing in a no-load,  plus a flat $100 transaction fee, regardless of the size of the order. The  seller gets the NAV price, plus a portion of that transaction fee (most likely  $25) as an inducement to unload shares in this manner.  </P> <P> All this comes as a welcome development for fee-conscious investors. For while  load funds as a group don't perform any better than their no-load counterparts,  there are certainly individual standouts that would make a nice addition to  anyone's portfolio.  </P> <P> White's brokerage has already started to match load-fund buyers and sellers on  a limited scale. To get greater exposure and bring in more buyers and sellers,  the company has applied for listing on the OTC Bulletin Board, a new electronic  quote system operated by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers.  </P> <P> Through the Bulletin Board, stockbrokers around the country would be able to  instantly look up bid prices on funds their clients might want to sell. "It  will increase the size of the market by making our bids visible to the entire  industry," says White. "(Brokers) won't have to call us to get a price." His  company expects to receive listing approval by the end of January; the NASD  confirms the application is under review.  </P> <P> Assuming White gets this approval, he next needs to secure the cooperation of  brokers, so that they will offer the shares of clients for sale in this market.  That's where the $25 payment to the seller comes in. Brokers have a fiduciary  duty to get the highest price for their clients, White argues, and a bid of NAV  plus $25 would beat what's available by redeeming through the fund company.  </P> <P> Even so, there's some question as to how enthusiastically a broker working for  a competing company, especially a full-service firm, might want to use the  system.  </P> <P> Also uncertain is how independent load-fund companies, who market their  products through brokers, will react. The giant Franklin Group of Funds in San  Mateo, Calif., so far has adopted a neutral stance to White's program. "This  kind of transaction doesn't show up at Franklin as either a sale or  redemption," says spokeswoman Virginia Marans. "In our eyes, it's just a  transfer of assets from one investor to another."  </P> <P> One reason fund companies might not care much is that they generally don't keep  the load anyway, says Dan Jamieson, editor of Registered Representative, the  Irvine-based national trade magazine for stockbrokers. "Fund companies pay out  anywhere from 70% to 100% of that load," he says.  </P> <P> Brokers, who split this commission with their firms, could be hurt if their  customers suddenly started to shop for load funds on the resale market.  However, Jamieson doesn't think this will happen to any large degree. "The  reason people buy load funds is that they need help choosing among different  investments," he says. "That sales-charge market will always exist."  </P> <P> Others agree. "If you can't fix your car, you go to a mechanic and pay a large  hourly rate," says A. Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services, a  fund-tracking company based in Summit, N.J. Similarly, people who don't know to  define their investment goals, select funds and monitor performance go to a  broker and pay a sales charge. "The load is not a particularly significant  amount of money if you don't know what you're doing," Lipper says.  </P> <P> As it is, no-load buyers account for only about 36% of all mutual fund sales,  according to figures compiled by the Investment Company Institute, the mutual  fund industry group.  </P> <P> White says the people most likely to shop for load funds on the resale market  aren't the typical clients of full-service brokers but rather sophisticated,  knowledgeable individuals who like to make their own decisions -- in other  words, no-load customers. By opening up load products to these cost-conscious  investors, White predicts his plan could help load-fund groups increase their  assets under management and thereby boost their fee income.  </P> <P> As good as it all sounds, there are certain limitations that could turn off  people from purchasing load funds on the resale market. For starters, smaller  buyers might find the $100 transaction fee more of a hurdle than the regular  sales load. You would pay just $80, for example, when making a $2,000 purchase  through the standard channels in the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund, which  carries a 4% load.  </P> <P> In addition, not all load funds would be available for purchase in the resale  market -- just those that carry an up-front sales charge. "Back-end load funds  won't qualify for our trading," says White. And keep in mind that you still  would have to pay the annual 12b-1 charge if you bought a fund that imposes  this fee.  </P> <P> Then there's the problem of finding what you want. Until the resale market gets  large, there could be a limited availability of popular funds. It's conceivable  that some orders could take weeks to fill.  </P> <P> And don't underestimate the possible legal or regulatory challenges to the  notion of buying load funds without a load. Lipper suspects the idea could run  afoul of certain securities laws that have governed mutual funds since Congress  passed the Investment Company Act of 1940.  </P> <P> From the standpoint of investors, however, White's resale idea appears to be a  good one. Sellers of load portfolios would benefit by receiving a slightly  better price for their shares. And buyers would enjoy a wider selection of  funds from which to choose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHY PAY A SALES CHARGE  </P> <P> The efforts of Jack White &amp; Co. to open up load funds to no-load buyers  raises a fundamental question: Why are some people willing to pay a sales  charge in the first place?  </P> <P> A 1988 survey of 1,000 fundholders by the Investment Company Institute in  Washington provides some answers. The ICI asked people to rate various  attributes in terms of importance when investing in a mutual fund. As this  table shows, individuals who buy load funds through a stockbroker, insurance  agent, financial planner or bank tended to rate attributes such as advice and  personalized service as relatively important.  </P> <P> For example, 33% of the people using brokers considered "initial/ongoing  advice" as important, and 71% of the individuals buying through banks rated  "advice on a range of products" as important. By contrast -- and to no surprise  -- investors who buy no-load funds indicated that they are more fee-conscious.  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (2): Fillip for the county - Toyota, Local economic impact TOYOTA'S arrival in Derbyshire, the rapid construction of its Pounds 700m motor manufacturing plant at Burnaston, south of Derby, and the smooth build-up to the first production of Carina cars next month has given a fillip to the county economy, especially in the south. The latest East Midlands business survey by Price Waterhouse, accountants, and Nottingham Business School indicated that business leaders in Derbyshire are the most confident in the region about recovery: a confidence which Price Waterhouse ascribes at least in part to the presence of Toyota. Earlier surveys from the same source had shown that Derbyshire, again because of Toyota, went into recession later than other counties in the East Midlands. Yet, although Toyota's decision to establish a plant in Derbyshire was one of the inward investment coups of the 1980s, it promises no instant bonanza. There had been hopes that component manufacturers might follow the car maker to the county. But this has not yet happened. It is true that hope remains that Toyota will be a nodal point for economic growth. The Derby City Council is expecting some population growth over the next decade. The County Council is hoping that once the recession ends and when the Stoke-Derby link road is in place and a supply of nearby serviced industrial land becomes available, growth will be assured. Over the long term, noting the surplus land on the Toyota site, the County Council also hopes that another Toyota plant may be built. But now, when the question of jobs is paramount, the number of people that Toyota is employing is less than the number being made redundant, because of recession, by companies in Derby and the immediate areas. Toyota's presence may ameliorate the worsening employment situation; it certainly does not cure it. Not surprisingly, Toyota has received about 20,000 applications for production jobs. By March, its labour needs will reach 1,250 people as it enters the first phase of its production plans to make 100,000 cars a year by 1995. Although eventually Burnaston is expected to employ 3,000 people as production moves up to 200,000 units a year, the rate of expansion after the first phase depends on the state of the market. Few, under present conditions, would wish to predict that. Of the 20,000 applications, more than 50 per cent come from within a 15-mile radius of Burnaston, serving testimony both of the perceived job security at Toyota and of the increasingly difficult job situation in Derby itself. But it is clear from the qualifications which Toyota demands of its employees that it will be competing for the cream of the labour force. Thus, as recruitment continues, there is likely to be a local reshuffling of the pack of those employed rather than a dent in the numbers of unemployed. The average age of the 1,000 employees so far taken on is 32. Toyota said: 'The type of people we look for are flexible and willing to learn and need not necessarily have a background in the car industry unless of course it is vital for the job concerned. These characteristics will help them work in an environment of mutual trust and respect where quality and safety are chief concerns.' But the significance of Toyota goes beyond the numbers it directly employs. Two years ago, Derbyshire County Council produced 'an impact study', the conclusions of which, it believes, remain valid. This study suggested that, assuming Toyota builds up to a production of 200,000 units a year, a further 4,000 jobs will be created in addition to the 3,000 employed at Burnaston. This 4,000 would be made up of 1,000 among local component suppliers, 2,000 from the indirect effect of Toyota's investment - largely those involved in providing services and materials to the plant - and a further 1,000 would come as a result of the extra spending resulting from the jobs growth. But the main effects will come after 1995. Meanwhile, Toyota has been following a policy of local purchase, largely for non-technical purposes. Earlier this year it said it had agreed local contracts worth Pounds 133m related to construction and installation work. Certainly the local construction and construction supply industries in south Derbyshire have weathered recession better than most of their peers elsewhere. Once production reaches 100,000 units a year, Toyota will be buying in components worth more than Pounds 100m a year from companies within a radius of 50 miles. One immediate effect has been a stimulus to the housing sector. Wilson Bowden, a property group with national interests, and Birch, a growing Derby construction company, are starting work three miles from Burnaston on a development which could provide 2,000 new homes over the next 10 years.</p>

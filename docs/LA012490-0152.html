			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SANTA FE RAILWAY TO CUT WORKERS  </P> <P> Santa Fe Pacific Corp. plans to reduce employment on its railroad by 2,700 jobs  over five years, officials of the company said.  </P> <P> The reductions will take place through job buyouts, attrition and possible  layoffs and will affect both union and white-collar workers, according to a  spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe.  </P> <P> The cuts would likely affect Santa Fe Railway across its 11,500-mile system.  There is no specific timetable for the cuts, which would reduce employment with  the railroad from 18,000 to about 15,300, according to the company.  </P> <P> The Santa Fe Railway has been steadily reducing employment for several years.  About three years ago, it took 85 crew members to run a Santa Fe train from  Chicago to Los Angeles. The railroad currently uses 40 crew members on the same  run, and company officials expect to cut that number to about 30, the spokesman  said.  </P></p>

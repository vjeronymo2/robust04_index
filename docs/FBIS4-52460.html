			<p>BFN     [Text] Burma is ready to open the country to foreign  tourists in 1996, with the number of visitors per year targeted  at 50,000 from the year 2000 onward, said the Thai Ambassador to  Burma, Wira Futrakun.    He said Thailand is happy to be the gateway for visitors  wishing to visit that country.    The Burmese government has signed a contract with a Thai  company to invest in accommodation in Burma. A number of hotel  projects financed by foreign investors are underway to cope with  the growing number of tourists.    Two first-class hotels are scheduled to be built in Pagan  and  another in Ranong, the ambassador said.    Thai Airways International's flight frequencies will also be  given a boost provided agreement with the Burmese government is  reached. There is now in effect a plan to double the length of  stay for visitors from two to four weeks.    The Burmese government also proposed to grant "visas on  arrival" to tourists travelling to the old capital of Mandalay,  Mr Wira said.    The foreign visitors, however, have to pay US S300 to  purchase coupons which can be redeemed for accommodation and  other service facilities in place of money, said the Thai  ambassador.</p>

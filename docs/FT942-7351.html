			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Boeing looks east in project for smaller jet Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up efforts to enter for the first time the market for smaller 70-100 seat jets. The US group, which has traditionally dominated the large airliner market, is working with the Japanese and Chinese aircraft industries to study the development of a new commercial jetliner smaller than its current Boeing 737 family of 100-170 seat narrow-body aircraft. Boeing yesterday said it had appointed Mr Richard James, its former vice-president of marketing for commercial aircraft programmes, to a new position of vice-president to study the development of a new small aircraft. 'His assignment will be to explore the market feasibility and structure of a new small aircraft programme,' said Mr Ron Woodward, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft operations. Boeing said representatives from Japan Aircraft Industry and the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation had begun work with Boeing in Seattle to examine the market requirement and potential configuration for a new commercial jet aircraft slightly smaller than the 737. The move is expected to intensify further competition in the small jet airliner market which is scrambling to restructure itself in the face of large-scale over-capacity in that sector. It would pitch the world's leading aircraft manufacturer against companies such as Fokker, British Aerospace and Saab in that market. Boeing sees strong demand for smaller jet airliners emerging during the next 20 years in the Asia-Pacific region. The small aircraft project will extend Boeing's close links with both the Japanese and Chinese aircraft industries. Japanese companies already participate on all Boeing airliner programmes, including the latest 777 wide-body aircraft, while China produces parts for the 737 and the 757.</p>

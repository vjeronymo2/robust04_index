They state as the reason for this request the fact that they  have proof that these representations have been spreading lies  about the entire Croatian people and organizing the delivery of  equipment and mercenaries, as well as espionage, for the benefit  of Muslim forces which are fighting against the Croatian people  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They claim that they have the following  documents as proof of such activities: Muslim passports with  falsified data, video shots of the training of Muslims in  Slovenia, video shots of anti-Croatian speeches by current  Reis-ul-Ulema Ceric at the Zagreb mosque, video shots of the  recruitment of mojahedin among Turks and Arabs in Germany,  photographs of mojahedin who arrived in Bosnia via Zagreb, video  shots showing a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] officer giving  permission to a Muslim unit to carry out an attack, video shots  of Muslim criminals of the `Crni Labudovi' [Black Swans] unit,  and so forth. It is stated in the protest that data will  continue to be gathered and that there are people in the  Croatian Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Defense  who are concealing these facts for money.</p>

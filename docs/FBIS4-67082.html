It  is part of Hom District in Vientiane Province. In the past the  production and the life style of the people were very close to  nature: they engaged in slash and burn agriculture, 90 percent  of the people were malnourished, and they died from malaria and  diarrhea. Their condition was very serious. But because of the  efforts of the central echelons of the party and state the Lao  89 project was started. This development project of the UN drug  prevention organization has continued from 1989 to the present  and has brought a change of direction. Pha Lavek has begun to  develop, overcome its past troubles and progress toward a new  life. There has been development on many sides, both material  and spiritual, for the progressive Hmong.    Mr Wanna, the deputy district leader of Hom District,  Vientiane Province reported to me that Pha Lavek included 10  villages and a population of 4,500. Before 1989 the  communication routes between the localities and central  authority were broken. The government used aircraft to transport  food and medicine to help the people each month. But with the  start of the drug prevention project, funded at no cost by the  United Nations, there has been development for 3 years, and Pha  Lavek has made progress. Goods production has been developed  substantially, for example: an economic base has been built, and  a communication route reaches from Vientiane to Pha Lavek--the  road from Tha Bok to Pha Lavek is 42 km long and vehicles travel  it conveniently both in the dry season and the rainy season. Now  there is daily passenger service from Vientiane to Pha Lavek to  Long San. Project officials also completed a new road 29 km long  from Pha Lavek to Nam Gnouak (Vang Gnasai) which could be  traveled in the dry season, and they completed a 44 km road from  Pha Lavek to Ao Sai in Sai Somboun District which could be  traveled in the dry season. As for agricultural production,  before 1989 there were only 60 hectares of wet-field rice land  while there were 386 hectares of dry-field rice land, and 90  percent of the population was engaged in slash and burn rice  cultivation and opium cultivation for which they moved on every  year. Now the area of wet-field rice has increased to 208  hectares, and the Hmong people have generally come down to build  permanent homes on the plains and cultivate wet-field rice and  raise animals and commercial crops more and more. Only 100  hectares of dry-field rice land remain in Pha Lavek. There are  more than 3,000 head of cattle and buffalo being raised, and  there are many pigs and poultry of various kinds.    With regard to commercial crops the people in some villages  are working to raise coffee on 2 hectares, peanuts and soybeans  on 6 hectares, and are raising Job's tears experimentally on 2.5  hectares. They are also raising many hectares of various  vegetables. Another outstanding development is that in addition  to raising the wet season rice crop on wet-field rice land, in  Ban Pha Lavek Village and Nam Pang where conditions are right  for irrigation they experimented with raising dry season rice on  2 hectares, and it appears to have been very successful. All  this has allowed them better to meet the demand for food of the  people of Pha Lavek--they can supply 70 percent of their food.    Education and public health are being broadened. In Pha  Lavek  now there is one secondary school. In the 1993 to 1994 school  year there are more than 40 students in the first through third  years of secondary school. There are six primary schools, and  there are more than 1,000 students in the first through the  fifth primary grades. Public health and education in hygiene for  the people are being expanded broadly. A hospital was built  according to standards with funds from the project and the  people from three locations. In addition many houses have  toilets. There are medical personnel and medicine assigned to 10  villages. Therefore it is clear that illiteracy among children  of school age and illness and death among the people have been  attacked and reduced. Another outstanding development which  occurred in early 1994 was that 21 drug addicts received  treatment to end their addiction completely with assistance from  the project and the Thai drug prevention organization.

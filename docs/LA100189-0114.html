			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEMSON STUNNED BY DUKE  </P> <P> Duke Coach Steve Spurrier last week said his Blue Devils had a one-in-a-million  chance of beating No. 7 Clemson.  </P> <P> "We were probably the only ones that believed we could win," Spurrier said  after Duke, a 15-point underdog, defeated Clemson, 21-17, Saturday in an  Atlantic Coast Conference game.  </P> <P> "I said before the game that we needed to get a lot of breaks, but we didn't  get a whole bunch of breaks," Spurrier said.  </P> <P> Junior quarterback Billy Ray, a transfer from Alabama, completed 24 of 43  passes for 262 yards and threw for two second-half touchdowns as the Blue  Devils came back from a 14-0 halftime deficit.  </P> <P> Ray threw five interceptions, three in the first half, but his seven-yard  scoring pass to Chris Brown with 3:18 left was the difference.  </P> <P> The last time Duke defeated Clemson was in 1980, when the Tigers were 2-9. They  lost to the Blue Devils, 34-17, that year.  </P> <P> Duke, 2-3 overall, is 1-1 in the ACC. Clemson is 4-1 and 1-1.  </P> <P> The victory was Duke's first over a top-10 team since 1971, when the Blue  Devils defeated ninth-ranked Stanford, 9-3.  </P> <P> On the play before Duke's final touchdown, Spurrier noticed that Brown was  open.  </P> <P> Said Ray: "I just took a seven-step drop and looked left like I was going to  throw it in the 30th row somewhere. Next thing you know, those linebackers had  taken a fat drop.  </P> <P> "I turned around, threw it and I just prayed to God he'd get in the end zone --  fall in if he had to -- and let us get up by four. By God, he did it."  </P> <P> Duke went 72 yards in 11 plays for the winning score.  </P> <P> Clemson got as far as the Duke 38-yard line on its final possession, but it was  unable to convert a fourth-and-12, and the Blue Devils got the ball back with  less than a minute left.  </P> <P> Early in the third quarter, Ray had a long pass intercepted by Clemson  cornerback Dexter Davis, but Davis fumbled and Duke split end Darryl Clements  recovered on the Clemson 23. Fullback Randy Cuthbert scored four plays later on  a five-yard run with 7:53 left in the quarter.  </P> <P> Duke tied the score, 14-14, with 2:09 to play in the third quarter on Ray's  18-yard pass to Clarkston Hines, who broke the ACC receiving record of 2,431  yards held by Wayne Baumgardner of Wake Forest. Hines, who had 96 yards  Saturday, has 2,453 yards.  </P></p>

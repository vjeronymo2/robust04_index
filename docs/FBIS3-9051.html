The minister and his group were taken to the Sarajevo  Presidential Palace in the armored tanks of UN peacekeepers to  have talks with Bosnian Vice-President [Presidency member] Ejup  Ganic, Foreign Minister Irsan Ljubijankic, as well as Arif  Smajkic, minister responsible for refugees and social welfare.    Hungary supports a canton system in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Long-suffering Sarajevo could show the world an example of how  people can live together in peace, despite different national  and religious backgrounds, Jeszenszky said.    Lubijankic thanked Jeszenszky for the visit and expressed  the  Bosnian government's willingness to expand interstate  cooperation.    After official talks, Jeszenszky met representatives of  Sarajevo's 300-strong Hungarian community, mostly connected with  the university there, and handed over some of the aid sent for  the Humanitarian Association of Hungarians in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

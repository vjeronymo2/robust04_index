			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DRIVER IS ATTACKED AFTER CAR HITS 2 BOYS;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: SOME SEE RACIAL OVERTONES IN BEATING OF LATINO MAN IN BLACK AREA OF  SOUTH L.A. POLICE ARREST 4 MEN.  </P> <P> A Latino immigrant was beaten and badly injured after a traffic accident in  South-Central Los Angeles in which his car struck and injured two black  children, police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Members of the man's family and police said the incident had racial overtones,  but relatives of the children and the four men arrested after the beating said  their anger was sparked by what they saw as a callous attitude on the part of  the driver.  </P> <P> Police said the incident Tuesday shows how easily underlying cultural tensions  can erupt into violence -- especially in South-Central Los Angeles where large  numbers of Latino immigrants have been moving into traditionally black  neighborhoods over the last decade.  </P> <P> Police said Guillermo Alvarado, 43, was backing his car out of a parking space  behind his apartment building on West Colden Avenue when he accidentally struck  a black child, 7-year-old Daveyon James, who was passing by on a skateboard.  </P> <P> Soon, according to police accounts, a group of black men had gathered, at least  one of them armed with a broomstick. Racial epithets were uttered. Alvarado  panicked, police said, and while trying to escape in his car he struck another  black child, pinning the boy against a wall.  </P> <P> When it was all over, four black men were in jail and Alvarado lay in a  hospital bed, his face bruised and bloodied, police said. The two boys, who  suffered broken bones, were treated in hospitals and released.  </P> <P> Black residents said the beating was sparked not by race as much as anger over  the injuries to the two children and the fact that Alvarado seemed not to care.  Latino residents were reluctant to discuss the incident, but members of  Alvarado's family said they believe it was racially motivated.  </P> <P> Although it is not uncommon for traffic accidents in Los Angeles to lead to  fistfights and shouting matches, police said cultural differences may in fact  have been partly responsible for the Colden Avenue accident's escalating into a  beating.  </P> <P> "The neighborhood is changing and those things tend to happen," said Los  Angeles Police Detective Steve Sullivan, who is investigating the case. "You  have these black neighborhoods and you have people thinking other people  shouldn't live there."  </P> <P> With the assistance of police officers Tuesday night, Alvarado's wife and two  children moved out of their apartment.  </P> <P> They had moved into the neighborhood only a month earlier to be closer to the  South-Central factory where Alvarado works as a janitor, said Rosa Rodriguez,  Alvarado's wife.  </P> <P> They now are living with Rodriguez's sister in predominantly Latino East Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "My husband and I are not sure what brought about the beating," Rodriguez said  Wednesday. "I think it was racial. That's why we moved out.  </P> <P> "All I know is that my family is afraid," she added, "and we don't want  anything like this to happen again. We came back to East L.A. to stay --  permanently."  </P> <P> Police and witnesses agree that once Alvarado struck Daveyon James, his car  continued backing up, with the boy pinned under the car.  </P> <P> Alvarado then struck another child -- David Jennings, also 7 -- and kept going  until the car hit the wall of the apartment building, pinning David against it  and injuring his leg, police said.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said a group of men, some of them relatives of the two boys, came out  of apartment buildings lining Colden Avenue. They ran to the car and began  beating Alvarado "with sticks and fists" as he sat in the driver's seat,  Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> According to police, one of the men yelled out "those (expletive) Mexicans"  while beating Alvarado with the broomstick and the skateboards of the injured  boys. When Rodriguez emerged from her apartment to pull the assailants away  from her husband, she was also struck, Detective Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Ever Lou Deal, 48, said the men directed their anger at Alvardo not because he  is Latino, but because he did not stop to help the children he had injured.  </P> <P> "He should have stopped the car and got out to see about the child he hit,"  said Deal, Daveyon's grandmother, "Any time you hit a child by accident, you  see if he's O.K. This (man) just kept going."  </P> <P> Daveyon's mother, Phyllis Perryman, added: "The little ones who were playing  with Daveyon started hollering and screaming at (Alvarado) to stop, so somebody  could pull my boy out. "After he hit the second boy, hey, that's when the  trouble started."  </P> <P> A large crowd had gathered at the scene by the time a police patrol car arrived  about 6:30 p.m. Four men -- John Childress, 27; Pierre Nutall, 26; Kevin Keys,  28, and Ronnie Rosenthal, 27 -- were arrested and booked on suspicion of  assault with a deadly weapon. However, some witnesses questioned whether police  had arrested the right men.  </P> <P> Police said they did not pursue charges against Alvarado because they  considered the injury of the children to be an accident. However, Sullivan said  the district attorney's office would review the case today.  </P> <P> Daveyon suffered a broken leg and David's arm was broken.  </P> <P> Alvarado was also hospitalized and later released. Reached at his  sister-in-law's East Los Angeles home, relatives said he could not speak  because of his injuries.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said she and her husband cannot speak English fluently. Before  Tuesday's accident, they had little interaction with the non-Spanish-speaking  residents in their apartment building.  </P> <P> "Our daughters play together with all the children in the apartment," she said.  "But the older Latino people who can't speak English, we keep to ourselves."  </P> <P> Residents of both groups said there have never been any serious conflicts  between blacks and Latinos.  </P> <P> "We won't be starting any mess with each other because of this," said Roslee  Nutall, the wife of one of the arrested men. "The Latino people here will be  going about their business, and we'll be going about ours."  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Rivera contributed to this story.  </P></p>

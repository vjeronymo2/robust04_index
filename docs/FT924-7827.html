			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Collor charged with corruption Brazil's suspended President Fernando Collor de Mello was charged yesterday with corruption in the kickback scandal that forced him out of office, AP reports from Rio de Janeiro. Mr Aristides Junqueira, the attorney general, charged Mr Collor and eight others in connection with an influence-peddling ring that allegedly extorted Dollars 55m (Pounds 36.4m) from businessmen in exchange for government contracts. If convicted, they could face eight years in prison. Mr Junqueira also charged Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's long-time friend and 1989 campaign treasurer, with running the influence-peddling ring. The 55-page indictment alleges that Mr Collor accepted Dollars 6.5m from the ring. The lower house of congress voted to remove Mr Collor from office on September 29, charging him with 'lack of decorum.' He was ousted on October 2 for 180 days while the Senate holds an impeachment trial. If the Senate votes to impeach him, he would be barred from holding office for eight years.</p>

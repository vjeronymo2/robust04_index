			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Milken likely to be released next March MR Michael Milken is likely to be released from a California prison next March after a federal judge yesterday sharply reduced the disgraced financier's minimum sentence because of his co-operation with government prosecutors in a number of recent fraud cases. Judge Kimba Wood, who in November 1990 sentenced Mr Milken to 10 years in jail for securities fraud, reduced the amount of time Mr Milken will have to serve in prison before he is eligible for parole from 40 months to 24 months. Mr Milken has already served 17 months of his sentence, so he should be freed, assuming continued good behaviour, in early March 1993. After that he will still face three years of probation and community service. Judge Wood said she reduced Mr Milken's minimum sentence because of his 'substantial assistance' in the successful prosecution two months ago of Mr Alan Rosenthal, a former colleague at securities house Drexel Burnham Lambert, and because of the help he had given the Securities and Exchange Commission in bringing other enforcement actions. The judge said Mr Milken had been a 'model prisoner'.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Coal shake-up claims more pits British Coal yesterday signalled the closure of two pits as it began the final phase of a rationalisation programme which will leave the industry with about 15 working pits for privatisation this year and next. The pits, Goldthorpe and Silverwood, both in British Coal's northern area, were among 19 pits previously considered core collieries. They were not named for closure in October 1992 when the government wanted to close three-fifths of the industry, but was forced to backtrack by a public outcry. British Coal's announcement is the first in a series this week which will leave the industry with even fewer collieries than it envisaged 15 months ago. The announcements will result in about half a dozen closures among the 22 remaining working pits. This will leave about 16 pits in operation excluding Asfordby in Leicestershire which is due to open this year. The total is likely to decline by one or two prior to privatisation later this year because reserves of some pits will become exhausted. Announcing a review of 12 pits in its northern group, based around the Yorkshire area, British Coal said yesterday it wanted to close Goldthorpe colliery, where 410 men are employed, and merge Maltby with Silverwood, which employ 220 and 550 staff respectively. The merger is seen within the industry as the closure of Silverwood. The Maltby-Silverwood merger is to take place once tunnelling works between the two pits are completed. British Coal is expected to signal tomorrow the closure of its Manton pit, near Worksop. Other closure or merger announcements are likely this week as the corporation reviews the future of its Nottinghamshire coalfield and various satellite mines including Tower in south Wales and Ellington in Northumberland. Tower and Ellington have both been viewed as relatively safe until recently because they are the only deep mines in their regions. However, there are concerns in both areas that the two pits could be mothballed before privatisation and offered in that state to the private sector as part of the regional packages in which British Coal is being sold off. British Coal says closures are necessitated by the size of the market. Contract sales to electricity generators are expected to fall by 25 per cent in the year starting April 1994. Mr Alan Houghton, northern group director, told unions yesterday that the likelihood of large additional sales to generators was remote. Failure to reduce the levels of pit-head stocks would threaten the survival of even some of the best collieries. Coal Products, British Coal's solid smokeless fuels and coking subsidiary, yesterday recorded a retained profit after exceptional items and interest of Pounds 4m on a turnover of Pounds 132m for the year ending last March. An operating profit of Pounds 8m was reported compared with Pounds 2m the previous year. The company said that this was its best trading performance since the 1970s. Mr Bob Ellis, managing director, said the company was on course for a further improvement in financial performance this year. The results confirmed that Coal Products was well placed to compete successfully in the private sector, he said.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRAND JURY PRAISES ORANGEWOOD BUT OFFERS SUGGESTIONS  </P> <P> After a nine-month review, the Orange County Grand Jury concluded Monday that  managers of the Orangewood Children's Home are sometimes too aloof from shelter  counselors and that new employees need better training.  </P> <P> But overall, the report praises the staff for their professional and caring  attitude toward children at the 166-bed Orangewood shelter, which provides a  temporary home for abused and neglected children in Orange County.  </P> <P> "I was pleased that they were thorough in looking at the facility," Orangewood  director Robert Theemling said. "For the most part, I can live with their  recommendations."  </P> <P> The grand jury recommended that managers keep closer ties with counselors, that  open staff positions be filled as quickly as possible to reduce the amount of  overtime hours worked by counselors, and that better training and resource  materials be available to the staff.  </P> <P> The grand jury began its study of Orangewood last August as part of its  responsibility to monitor children's facilities operated by the juvenile court  system, said Irvin T. Lathrop, chairman of the grand jury committee that  evaluated Orangewood. No complaint or allegation prompted the review, he said.  </P> <P> Until last month, however, Orangewood had been under investigation by the  county Juvenile Justice Commission after complaints were lodged that a male  counselor had mistreated a teen-age girl and that staff members sometimes  treated residents with too much regimentation.  </P> <P> The commission's report, released May 14, concluded that no evidence existed to  support the allegations.  </P> <P> The grand jury committee assisted in the commission's investigation by  interviewing several people connected with the allegations. However, the grand  jury committee passed the information on to the Juvenile Justice Commission,  Lathrop said. The grand jury committee restricted its report to an overall  review of the Orangewood shelter.  </P> <P> "I want to divorce this report from that (the Juvenile Justice Commission  investigation) because it had nothing to do with it," Lathrop said.  </P> <P> The grand jury review uncovered no major problems with Orangewood, he said.  </P> <P> "They are doing a good job and they have a lot of dedicated, caring people over  there," he said. The jury's report focused on "things that could make it run  better and smoother," he said.  </P> <P> Theemling said he disagreed with a criticism in the report that he and Gordon  Andahl, the home's program manager, are rarely seen around the residential  units and are unavailable to discuss problems with counselors. Since staffing  has been short at Orangewood, he and Andahl have regularly filled in as  counselors during vacant shifts, Theemling said.  </P> <P> The jury recommended that training time for new child-care supervisors increase  from one week to two weeks -- a plan that has been in the works now for several  months and might be implemented this fall, Theemling said. Orangewood has  always wanted to offer more training to new and current staff members, he said,  "but it doesn't come cheap."  </P></p>

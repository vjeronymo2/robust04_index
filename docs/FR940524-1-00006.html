			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document proposes to retain &sect;201.86 in its present form because neither the P&amp;S Act nor &sect;201.86 of the regulations authorize or restrict the inspection of brands. Section 201.86 provides the mechanism for collecting fees authorized by the P&amp;S Act for inspecting brands at stockyards. Restrictions on the collection of fees are imposed by the statute and not the regulation and it is not permissible to change by regulation that which is prohibited by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments concerning &sect;201.94 were received from livestock producer associations. This regulation requires those persons subject to the P&amp;S Act, upon proper request and within a reasonable time, to provide business information to authorized representatives of the Secretary, in writing or otherwise and under oath. Two comments recommended the regulation be amended to require that businesses over a certain size be required to provide to the Agency certain contract and other business information. One comment supported the regulation in its present form. The Agency has concluded that the current requirements of &sect;201.94, coupled with the provisions of the P&amp;S Act, are adequate to provide sufficient access, at this time, to business information of larger firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments were received concerning &sect;201.96. This regulation provides assurances to persons under investigation that their business records will be treated confidentially and employees of the United States cannot make unauthorized disclosures of those records. Comments were received from a livestock producer association, a trade association, and an individual representing livestock marketing interests. Two comments recommended amending this regulation to provide for a penalty. One comment supported the regulation in its present form. Section 10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which has been made a part of the P&amp;S Act by incorporation (7 U.S.C. 222), provides penalties for unauthorized disclosures. In addition, P&amp;SA considers the criminal penalties provided by the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 205, adequate deterrent to the unauthorized disclosure of business records and, therefore, no changes are proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments were received concerning &sect;203.5. This statement of general policy informs market agencies selling on commission that P&amp;SA regards the payment of business expenses of buyers attending their livestock sales as violative of the P&amp;S Act. Comments were received from a livestock producer association, a trade association, and an individual representing livestock marketing interests. Two comments recommended that practices addressed in this statement be prohibited only when they result in anticompetitive behavior. One comment supported the statement in its present form. P&amp;SA believes that this statement reflects the correct formulation of its policy toward such activities and the legal effect of that policy and that, therefore, no changes are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in &sect;201.61 does not impose or change any recordkeeping or information collection requirements. Existing requirements in this regulation have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0590&hyph;0001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this proposed amended rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and a statement explaining the reasons for the certification is set forth in the following paragraph and is being provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this proposed amended rule impacts small entities, it will not have a significant economic impact on any entity, large or small. The primary effect of this rule is to remove restrictions on purchases by dealers from consignments of a market agency that provides clearing services to that dealer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This amendment does not impose any new paperwork requirement and does not have Federalism implications under the criteria of E.O. 12612.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed amendment has been reviewed under E.O. 12778, Civil Justice Reform, and is not intended to have retroactive effect. This amendment will not preempt State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this amendment. Prior to judicial challenge of the amendment to rule, a party must first be found by the Secretary to be in violation of the P&amp;S Act and in violation of the accompanying regulation. Second, the party must appeal that finding and the validity of the regulation to the Secretary in the course of the administrative proceeding. Only after taking these steps, may the party challenge the regulation in a court of competent jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 201  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accounts and records, Brand inspection, Buyers expenses, Definitions, Industry rules, Jurisdiction, Purchases from consignment, Proceeds of sale, Rates and charges, Stockyard services, Tariffs, Trade practices.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done at Washington, DC this 17th day of May 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Calvin W.

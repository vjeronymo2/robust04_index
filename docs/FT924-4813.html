			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Socialist link in fraud trial The issue of political corruption in Spain came out into the open yesterday when a brother of the deputy leader of the governing Socialist party faced trial in Seville on fraud charges, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The hearing is the first of several involving Mr Juan Guerra scheduled in the coming months. The cases allege links between his enrichment during the 1980s and his post as private secretary in Seville to his brother, Mr Alfonso Guerra, then deputy prime minister. The trial comes at a particularly sensitive time, with general elections due within the next year. The prosecution claims that Mr Guerra, together with three associates charged with him, used his political contacts to buy real estate owned by public companies and to change zoning laws. Other charges range from obtaining catering contracts at airports to allocating public health service patients on kidney machines to private clinics.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Lloyd's meeting not all plain sailing YESTERDAY'S two-hour meet-ing of MPs and Lloyd's executives was not all plain sailing, according to some politicians who attended. Senior executives from the insurance market were taken aback by the aggressive nature of initial questioning from a small minority of the group of about 25 parliamentarians who attended the meeting at the Lloyd's building in the City. Mr Hugh Dykes, Conservative MP for Harrow East, said the forum 'was used by a number of people who had suffered themselves' in the market. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said: 'We were there to learn about Lloyd's and not for the pursuit of private vendettas.' In spite of this setback, most MPs said the meeting had been useful both as a briefing on the workings of the market and as an opportunity to emphasise the collective view that regulatory reform was needed. According to Mr Richard Page, MP for Hertfordshire South West and vice-chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, Lloyd's representatives were left 'in no doubt whatsoever' that an independent regula-tory body was required. Among other subjects discussed were the technicalities of reinsurance, the prospect of more favourable tax treatment for Names and the possible introduction of a system of limited liability incorporating an investor protection fund levied from all to guard against excessive losses. Participating Lloyd's representatives included Mr David Coleridge, chairman, Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, and Mr David Rowland, chairman of the Rowland task force that recently completed an extensive review of Lloyd's market structures. MPs who attended included: Mr James Arbuthnot (C Wanstead &amp; Woodford), Ms Rosie Barnes (SDP Greenwich), Mr John Biffen (C Shropshire North), Dame Peggy Fenner (C Medway) - in whose constituency Lloyd's is a big employer - Sir Anthony Grant (C Cambridgeshire South West) - who piloted the Lloyd's Act through the Commons in 1982 - Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman (C Lancaster), Mr Paul Marland (C Gloucestershire West). Also attending was Mr Peter Viggers (C Gosport) who suggested the meeting.</p>

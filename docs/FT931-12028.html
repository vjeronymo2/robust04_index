			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Serbian ship again defies Romanian and Bulgarina controls A Serbian ship, carrying oil, has again defied Romanian and Bulgarian controls on the Danube and passed into Serbian waters breaking the UN embargo, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. The Velebit was the third Serbian tugboat pushing barges of oil loaded in a Ukrainian port of Reni, along the Danube, to break the embargo in the past three days. Romanian coastguards said Romanian and Bulgarian motor boats had circled the Velebit for two hours yesterday but had backed off when the tug nearly collided with one of their boats. Two more tug boats, following not far behind, were last night also expected to try to reach the Serbian port of Prahovo. Despite continuing US pressure to stop the ships, Romania yesterday repeated it was unwilling to take further action alone. Romania was particularly concerned at the ecological consequences of any conflict with the ships. The captain of one tugboat threatened to blow up or discharge his cargo into the river, polluting the sole water supply of many ports, rather than surrender.</p>

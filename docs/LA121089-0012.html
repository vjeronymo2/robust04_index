			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE JAZZ AFICIONADO'S HOLIDAY WISH LIST  </P> <P> Traditionally, this space has been reserved, as the holiday season approaches,  for gift recommendations of records or books. As a rule, they are dealt with  separately, but this year the proliferation of jazz literature and CDs has made  it possible to suggest several matched sets, in which a given artist is  well-represented both on record and in a recent addition to the bookshelf.  </P> <P> "The Benny Goodman Yale Archives, Vol. I." Music Masters CIL 60142Z.  </P> <P> "Benny Goodman and the Swing Era" by James Lincoln Collier (Oxford University  Press: $22.95).  </P> <P> Three days before his death in 1986, Benny Goodman donated his memorabilia and  many master tapes to the music library archives at Yale. Vol. I is of rare  interest, spanning 1955-86 and taking in live sessions (at the Rainbow Grill,  Basin Street East and the Brussels World's Fair) along with several studio  groups. Aside from two pieces by Bobby Gutesha, a Yugoslavian composer, these  are mostly retreads of material Goodman recorded often before, but the great  diversity of personnel provides for constant surprises: next up may be Teddy  Wilson or Roland Hanna or Dave McKenna on piano, Flip Phillips or Zoot Sims or  Paul Quinichette on tenor, etc. The maestro is in generally impeccable form.  </P> <P> The Goodman biography succeeds, despite the extensive shelf of material already  available, in shedding new light. Collier has done his research well. Moreover,  he deals very fairly with Goodman's strange personality and evokes the  Zeitgeist of the pre-swing and swing eras. This is far superior to his too  often negatively slanted Armstrong and Ellington studies, and may well stand up  as the definitive Goodman reference work.  </P> <P> "Mostly Blues." Lionel Hampton. Music Masters CIJD 60168 K.  </P> <P> "Hamp" by Lionel Hampton with James Haskins (Warner Books: $19.95).  </P> <P> Because Hampton is seldom heard in an intimate setting, the two 1988 quintet  dates here are of special interest. The title is misleading; only three of the  nine cuts are actually blues, but Hampton's unflagging energy and inspiration  are consistently on display. The rhythm sections are not up to his  requirements, despite some generally helpful piano by Bobby Scott.  </P> <P> The problem with ghost-written autobiographies is that the authors seldom seem  to read them. Haskins reconstructs Hampton's childhood in Louisville and  Chicago, his early bandleading career and subsequent discovery by Benny  Goodman, but his research is badly flawed. He has Hampton saying, "I played  vibes on 'Evil Gal Blues' and 'Salty Papa Blues' " (with Dinah Washington),  when in fact he played nothing on either. Worse, Haskins has Hampton making LPs  with his own band in 1944, five years before LPs existed. Still, the story of  Hampton's late wife steering him relentlessly and acquisitively into fame and  millions (which he has since multiplied) makes for fascinating reading.  </P> <P> "At the Jazz Band Ball" Eddie Condon/Muggsy Spanier/Bud Freeman. RCA Bluebird  6752-2-RB.  </P> <P> "Crazeology" by Bud Freeman as told to Robert Wolf (University of Illinois  Press: $15.95).  </P> <P> Starting with two early, obscure Condon cuts (with Jack Teagarden as vocalist),  the traditionalist CD proceeds to the classic 1939 sessions by cornetist  Spanier, among them the blues "Relaxin' at the Touro," named for the New  Orleans hospital where he came close to death in 1938. Even more interesting  are the final four cuts by Bud Freeman's Summa Cum Laude octet, with Pee Wee  Russell, Condon and Max Kaminsky. Freeman's was the only tenor sax sound to  achieve, in those days, a sound and style as distinctly personal as Coleman  Hawkins'. "The Eel," his original blues, is a miniature masterpiece.  </P> <P> Freeman's use of a ghost writer is curious, since he had already written two  books without help. With a foreword by Studs Terkel, he tells his story  succinctly (only 90 pages of actual text), recalling frankly and incisively  everyone from Bix Beiderbecke and Louis Armstrong to Benny Goodman ("Working  for Benny was the most miserable experience of my life"). Freeman, the world  traveler, now back in his native Chicago, is still playing at 83.  </P> <P> "New Life (Dedicated to Max Gordon)" Thad Jones/Mel Lewis. A &amp; M CD 0810.  </P> <P> "Barney, Bradley and Max" by Whitney Balliett (Oxford University Press:  $19.95).  </P> <P> The reissue of an album made in 1976, when the Jones/Lewis band was at its  creative zenith (aided on some cuts by a French horn section and tuba), offers  a reminder of how valuable Max Gordon was in keeping this ensemble alive  through a series of weekly dates at his Village Vanguard. The originals by  Jones (also by Jerry Dodgion and Cecil Bridgewater) are peppered with vital  solos. The notes on the CD require several magnifying glasses to be legible,  but forget it; the music speaks grandiloquently for itself.  </P> <P> Max Gordon is the subject, along with Barney Josephson and Bradley Cunningham,  in the title of Whitney Balliett's latest collection of pieces (all three  bonifaces died within a year or so before the book was assembled). Balliett  brings them vividly back to life, alongside portraits of Buddy de Franco  (previously unpublished), Goodman, Charlie Parker and 10 others. Written  between 1971 and 1987, these evocative essays make one regret that the author  appears so rarely in the New Yorker these days.  </P> <P> If Balliett is second to none in his field, Gene Lees is second only to  Balliett. His "Singers and the Song," just reissued in paperback (Oxford  University Press: $8.95), begins with a wonderfully witty and perceptive  chapter on how to write (and how not to write) lyrics, proceeding therefrom to  examinations of the artistry of Johnny Mercer, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra and  others. The final chapter is an intriguing autobiographical account of Lees'  trip to Cologne to record an album with Sarah Vaughan and Lalo Schifrin.  </P> <P> Lees wrote the foreword for Doug Ramsey's "Jazz Matters: Reflections on the  Music and Some of Its Makers" (University of Arkansas Press: $22.95), a  miscellany of generally perceptive pieces on dozens of jazzmen. Some of the  older essays from the 1960s have diminished in value, but Ramsey is a sensitive  and entertaining writer.  </P></p>

This replacement will probably be made easier following the  end of the Cold War in Europe and the disarmament treaties  signed in that continent, which means a large number of very  good quality tanks are being sold at very low prices or even  being given away.    Like other National Defense branches, the Army is undergoing  a modernization process that includes the replacement of its old  armored vehicles, which currently do not surpass 300. Most of  them are Sherman and M-41 tanks that were in use at the end of  Second World War.    Through agreements with other countries, our country has the  necessary technology to co-manufacture artillery systems,  trucks, short-range weapons, and rocket systems like the  "Lightning."    Asked about possible plans to replace Army hardware, General  Augusto Pinochet, the Army commander in chief, replied that the  Army neither comments on nor publicizes its acquisitions.    "We do not display our things ... we would rather be  discreet," he noted.    It was leaked that a European nation may soon supply Chile  with a fleet of medium-sized French AMX-30 or German Leopard-1  tanks in a number comparable to the Sherman tanks that are now  in service.    Meanwhile, the Army has decided that, until a deal is  finalized, it will refurbish its oldest hardware.    Brigadier General Luis Iracabal, the Famae [Army Ordnance]  director general, has said there have been preliminary talks  about replacing the tanks but there has not been "a real  institutional need" to close any deals.    He pointed out that "Famae has refurbished several tanks and  jeeps, fitting them with anti-tank cannons with the help of the  Army's War Material service."    Gen. Iracabal said the only alternative for an Armed Forces  without large resources at their disposal is to maintain their  equipment in good condition.    "We are now working at full speed on the manufacture of an  armored personnel carrier -- the Mowak 8 x 8 -- since this  project is behind schedule," he noted.    Asked about the presence of Famae at the FIDAE  [International  Aerospace Fair] '94, Gen. Iracabal said Chilean Army's most  important military manufacturer is exhibiting a new  anti-aircraft system, which was entirely designed in Chile.    The "Lynx" was developed in partnership with Linxtronic [not  further identified] and consists of a defense radar mounted on a  truck, which can be fitted with up to 16 different systems of  anti-aircraft weapons, such as missiles and rapid-firing  cannons, even of Russian origin.    He explained that the system, which is totally computerized,  can track anything at a distance of 40 km and aim the  interconnected weapons at the target.</p>

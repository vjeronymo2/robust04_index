			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Labour acts on union votes THE Labour party has moved closer to radically reducing union influence in policy making with plans to give votes at its annual conference to MPs, MEPs and possibly local councillors. However the Labour/Trade Union Review Group, which met yesterday, decided not to end union influence from the selection of local candidates and the election of the party leader and deputy leader. Instead of the idea of 'one member, one vote' in such elections, the review group has backed the creation of a new category of 'registered supporters' for union members paying a political levy who are not members of the party. Registered supporters would have to be consulted in elections for the party leaders and in local selection elections. The paper presented to yesterday's meeting was not formally approved but is expected to go virtually unchanged to a meeting of the party's National Executive early next year. ever'. The paper recommends cutting the unions' block vote from 70 per cent to 50 per cent and ensuring that votes are cast by actual delegates rather than through card votes wielded by union leaders. On the role of MPs and MEPs the paper says: 'In virtually all sister socialist parites elected representatives have a direct, individual, vote at conference'. MPs have no vote at the Labour conference and many say they would prefer not to have one so as to avoid potential conflict with their constituency parties.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAN IS ARRESTED AFTER FULLERTON WINS, 21-12  </P> <P> The aftermath of a Freeway League football game turned ugly Friday night when a  Fullerton High School fan allegedly struck Buena Park Coach Martin Luczaj.  </P> <P> The fan, identified by police as Joey Hernandez Sr., 38, was detained and then  released at the scene by Fullerton police officers.  </P> <P> According to Sgt. Neal Baldwin of the Fullerton Police Department, the man was  released on signed promise to appear in court. Baldwin said the district  attorney's office would determine if there is sufficient grounds to file  charges.  </P> <P> Baldwin said Hernandez was apparently a parent of a Fullerton football player.  </P> <P> Luczaj, who coached at Fullerton from 1981 to 1986 before stepping down as a  high school football head coach until this season, appeared unhurt as he  lingered on the field describing the incident to police officers.  </P> <P> Luczaj told officers he was congratulating Fullerton players after the 21-12  Fullerton victory when a man hit him with his forearm.  </P> <P> "He just walked up to me and hit me," Luczaj told an officer. "There was  absolutely no provocation whatsoever."  </P> <P> The game, which was the finale of the regular season for each team, decided  second and third place in the league. Fullerton (8-2, 4-1 in the league)  finished second; Buena Park (5-4, 3-2) finished third. Both teams have  qualified for the Southern Section Division VI playoffs, which start next  Friday.  </P> <P> Fullerton's defense held Angel Barrios, who entered the game fourth in the  county in rushing (1,030 yards), to 35 yards on 11 carries -- all in the first  half.  </P> <P> The Indians also sacked quarterback Mark Medellin five times for 75 yards in  losses.  </P> <P> Fullerton quarterback Daniel Chacon threw for two touchdowns in the first half,  including a 51-yarder to his twin brother, David, with 20 seconds remaining in  the half. That gave the Indians a 13-6 lead, which they increased to 21-6 on a  three play 68-yard drive to open the second half.  </P></p>

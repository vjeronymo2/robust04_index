			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Coca-Cola prepares to fight off rival brand challenger Coca-Cola is going to war in the UK. The world's biggest soft drinks company is about to launch a multi-million pound advertising, public relations and political campaign claiming that that there is only one 'real' cola. The enemy is a company which has only recently arrived here: Cott Corporation, a fast-growing Canadian bottler and marketer of private label soft drinks for supermarkets. Cott is at an advanced stage of negotiations with J Sainsbury and hopes the supermarket chain will launch a cola sub-brand - one which incorporates both the Sainsbury name and a newly invented trade name - by the end of May. Coca-Cola believes it under-estimated the threat from Cott in the Canadian and North American market three years ago, when the Canadian company began to launch a series of supermarket sub-brands. Since then, Cott has acquired a 20 per cent share of the Canadian grocery market and Coca-Cola has been relegated to third place. Coca-Cola Beverages, the 49 per cent owned Canadian offshoot of Coca-Cola, made net losses of CDollars 143m last year and closed half its 16 production plants. Now the UK operation has hired a raft of expensive consultancy firms: Bartle Bogle Hegarty to do television and newspaper advertising; Brunswick for public relations; and Lowe Bell for strategic marketing advice and political lobbying as a new trademark bill goes through the House of Commons. Coca-Cola's war cabinet includes its solicitors, Clifford Chance, whose aim is to prevent Sainsbury infringing the company's trademarks. Goldman Sachs has also been approached, although the US investment bank's role has 'yet to be decided', said one Coca-Cola adviser. According to the marketing consultancy AC Nielsen, Coca-Cola was the top-selling grocery brand in the UK last year, with sales of Pounds 247m. This represents more than 60 per cent by value of the UK retail cola market, well ahead of Pepsi Cola with more than 20 per cent and supermarket labels with less than 10 per cent, said OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants.

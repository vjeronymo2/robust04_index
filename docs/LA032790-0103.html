			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 15 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON A MAJOR MAFIA FAMILY;  </P> <P> CRIME: INDICTMENTS AGAINST 21 PEOPLE TARGET THE NEW ENGLAND MOB ORGANIZATION.  THORNBURGH SAYS EVIDENCE INCLUDES TAPE OF BLOOD-OATH RITUAL.  </P> <P> FBI agents began arresting 21 alleged mobsters Monday after Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh announced three indictments naming "virtually the entire active  leadership and membership" of the New England Mafia.  </P> <P> By Monday afternoon, 15 of the 21 members of the Patriarca Family were in  custody. The indictments accused the alleged mobsters of 113 counts of murder,  conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, kidnaping, drug trafficking, gambling,  wire and mail fraud, obstruction of justice and intimidation of witnesses.  </P> <P> The case "represents a stake in the heart of a major organized crime family  from the boss on down," and "establishes beyond doubt the existence of a  secret, clandestine operation" -- that is, the Mafia, Thornburgh told a news  conference here.  </P> <P> Evidence obtained by federal law enforcement officials includes what Thornburgh  termed "an unprecedented" audio tape of a blood-oath induction ceremony last  October.  </P> <P> According to the indictments, Patriarca Family "boss" Raymond J. Patriarca Jr.,  of Providence, R.I., was present as four inductees had their trigger fingers  cut to draw blood for the ritual. Speaking in Italian, they solemnly vowed: "I  want to enter into this organization to protect my family, and to protect all  my friends. I swear not to divulge this secret and to obey, with love and  omerta." Omerta refers to a code of silence.  </P> <P> A holy card with an image of the Patriarca family saint was then burned, with  the inductees intoning: "As burns this saint, so will burn my soul. I enter  alive into this organization and leave it dead."  </P> <P> Thornburgh cited "numerous occasions where witnesses have testified as to  ceremonies of this type," but "they have always been subject to the charge that  they may have been embellishing on the situation."  </P> <P> The tape "should lay to rest once and for all any doubts that La Cosa Nostra is  a figment of law enforcement imagination," Thornburgh said. He declined to say  how the tape was obtained.  </P> <P> Patriarca, 45, was taken in handcuffs before a U.S. magistrate in Providence  early Monday and was ordered transferred to Boston for arraignment. Alleged  underboss Nicholas Bianco and Mafia captain Matthew Gugliemetti were also  arrested in Providence.  </P> <P> The Patriarca Family conducted its operations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and  Massachusetts, federal authorities said.  </P> <P> The charges against them reflect more than five years of investigation by the  FBI, as well as various federal, state and local law enforcement agencies  working in New England, Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> FBI Director William S. Sessions said the indictments by grand juries in Boston  and Hartford, Conn., demonstrated the bureau's "ability to invade the inner  sanctums" of organized crime "with the intent to destroy them."  </P> <P> Thornburgh said "newly developing groups," from the "Colombian drug cartels to  the Crips and Bloods in Los Angeles to the Asian organized crime groups that  increasingly seek to control heroin distribution" face similar enforcement  efforts.  </P> <P> FBI officials in Washington said Monday's indictments represented a heightened  drive that began in the early 1980s against major organized crime groups,  especially the Mafia. The Justice Department contends that there are 25  separate Mafia "families" in the United States, including Los Angeles, each  varying in size, strength and influence.  </P> <P> In the last two years alone, federal prosecutors working with FBI agents have  obtained more than 1,200 organized crime convictions, mainly on charges of  political corruption, labor racketeering, illegal gambling and loan-sharking.  </P> <P> The President's Commission on Organized Crime four years ago estimated that the  illicit activities of organized crime groups accounted for an annual income of  more than $100 billion. That represented a loss of $6.5 billion in tax revenues  and a loss of 414,000 jobs in the American work force, the commission said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bob Jackson contributed to this story from Washington.  </P></p>

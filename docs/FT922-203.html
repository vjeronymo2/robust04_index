			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Disabled smoker to sue Gallaher GALLAHER, the US cigarette manufacturer, is to be sued by a smoker with a rare circulatory disorder. The case, believed to be the first of its kind in the UK, is expected to go before the Northern Ireland High Court in 1994. Mr John Dean, 37, from Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease, which causes the veins and arteries to close. He claims he had to quit work as an electrician seven years ago because of the disorder, allegedly caused by smoking since he was a teenager. Mr Cormac Fitzpatrick, his solicitor, said yesterday that the action could have far-reaching implications for the tobacco industry. 'There are at least three other cases pending in the background,' he said. 'Other solicitors will be looking to the result of this hearing.' Gallaher said it would defend the case vigorously. 'We are confident that we have a good defence,' it added.</p>

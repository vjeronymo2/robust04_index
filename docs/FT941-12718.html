			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bosch turnover suffers downturn Robert Bosch, the electronics and vehicle parts maker, made a net profit last year despite operating losses and the first fall in turnover in 26 years. The private concern, which earned DM512m on sales of DM34.4bn in 1992, said yesterday that turnover declined 6 per cent to DM32.3bn (Dollars 18.4bn). All business sectors were affected, it added. No earnings details were given for 1993, but the positive result was mainly attributable to noticeably improved results from foreign business and a tax credit associated with last year's capital increase from DM1.2bn to DM1.5bn, the company said. Bosch, one of the stricken German automotive industry's biggest suppliers, said that while foreign sales remained virtually unchanged at DM16bn, domestic turnover fell 11 per cent to DM16.3bn. Despite continuing unsatisfactory market conditions, it was cautiously optimistic that sales would rise this year. However, an important precondition for positive progress was a pay settlement which helped cut German manufacturing's considerable cost disadvantages. Pay negotiations with the IG Metall union, which has threatened to start warning strikes next week, appeared to be deadlocked yesterday. Two thirds of last year's 13,000 job cuts were made in Germany, and reductions in bonuses, benefits and other extra payments saved some DM250m. Further economies came from a cut of DM400m to DM1.6bn in capital expenditure, while spending on research and development was unchanged at DM2.3bn. In common with other companies heavily dependent on the automotive industry, Bosch is working to extend its manufacturing and distribution networks into developing foreign markets.</p>

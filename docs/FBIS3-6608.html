			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government has decided on new measures--plus  topics for further study--to be included in the overall foreign  economic measures which will be finalized by the end of March.  Key points of the new measures are seeking to assist expanded  imports of foreign-made automobiles and auto parts, to promote  market access by increasing the investigative staff of the Fair  Trade Commission, for instance; and to strengthen competition.    Macroeconomic topics which will be given further study  include the issue of whether to continue tax cuts into 1995 and  thereafter, as well as the possibility of revising the public  investment basic plan. Specific measures on these matters will  not be finalized until June. The government wants to break the  ice in relations with the United States before the  industrialized nations summit in July (Naples summit) by coming  up with a series of measures.    The overall foreign economic policies are composed of: 1)  macroeconomic measures; 2) voluntary liberalization plans having  four points: deregulation, import and investment promotion,  strengthening competition, and expanded government procurement;  and 3) market-opening measures in the priority areas of the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks such as government  procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment;  insurance, and expanded imports of automobiles and auto parts.  As for those points which cannot be finalized by the end of  March, the government will inform the United States that it will  continue to study them and will work to finalize them by June,  before the Naples summit.    In a new measure with respect to expanded imports of  automobiles and auto parts, Japan is to provide information on  auto registrations (individual registration data) -- the  information under the control of the Transportation Ministry --  for a fee to foreign auto manufacturers through the Japan  Automobile Imports Association. Using the information on sales  activities per se will be prohibited from the perspective of  protecting privacy, but the information is believed to be useful  in carrying out surveys and analyzing the Japanese market. As a  way of helping expand the imports of auto parts, an office for  consultations on foreign-made parts will be created at the Japan  Automobile Maintenance Companies Association, which is the  industrial organization representing auto servicing companies.  In addition, the government will sponsor receptions and  business meetings of foreign auto manufacturers' missions to  promote the exports of their products to Japan, as well as  seminars on Japan's service parts market. The government will  also issue instructions to the auto service industry asking it  not to discriminate against foreign-made parts.    Because auto companies plan to announce starting from this  week their own plans, aside from the government's measures, on  expanded purchases of foreign-made auto parts, the government is  thinking about referring to these private sector plans in its  measures as well. In the area of strengthening competition --  the area in which the United States is interested -- the  government wants to announce an increase in investigative  personnel at the Fair Trade Commission to help improve  capabilities for uncovering instances, such as bid rigging, of  violating the Antimonopoly Law. Another measure requires  guidelines on public works bidding to specifically warn against  violations of the Antimonopoly Law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Farm Minister Eijiro Hata  said Monday [24 January] that Japan's decision to partially open  its rice market to imports does not necessarily mean it has  agreed to begin adopting a tariffication scheme for rice from  the seventh year under the GATT accord.    There is room for negotiations on whether or not Japan must  take that step, Hata said. The agriculture, forestry and  fisheries minister was addressing the Japan National Press Club.    The draft farm trade accord proposed by the General  Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows Tokyo to resume discussion on  the issue before it enters the seventh year, he said.    In December, Tokyo accepted without modification the GATT  accord, which calls for Japan to open 4 percent to 8 percent of  its domestic rice market as the minimum access for imports in  exchange for a six-year moratorium for replacing all import  restrictions with tariffs. The proposal requires Japan to make  additional concessions in order for the special treatment to be  extended beyond the sixth year.    Specific commitments or conditions for extending the  moratorium beyond the sixth year are also negotiable later, Hata  said.    Hata said he will not resign as farm minister over Japan's  accepting the opening of its rice market. He said he will  devote himself for the time being to laying the groundwork for  his successor to effectively handle possible problems after the  rice market opening.    "That's the way I will take the responsibility," he said.    Hata forecast about one-third of the nation's three million  rice farmers will leave farming in 10 years, affected by the  opening of the rice market.    Hata proposed using imported rice under the minimum access  clause mainly for four areas -- stockpiling for emergency rice  for shortages, using it in processed foods such as rice  crackers, experiments for development of new rice products, and  supplying it to foreign countries as part of economic  assistance. He said it has yet to be decided whether or not  imported rice will be used as staple food.    Ha said imported rice, if consumed as staple food, would  "hopefully" be blended with Japanese rice.    The amount of domestically produced rice to be provided for  four months from March, for example, is only 30 percent of total  supply capacity due to the poor harvest last year, Hata said,  adding that supplies of domestic rice would run short quickly  unless it was blended with foreign rice.</p>

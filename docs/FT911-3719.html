			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Iraq accused of holding Kuwaitis KUWAIT accused Iraq yesterday of continuing to hold more than 5,400 Kuwaiti civilians and soldiers and of failing to return stolen property, as required by a United Nations Security Council resolution. The Kuwaiti ambassador to the UN, Mr Mohammad Abol Hassan, wrote to the Council saying that Baghdad's failure to adhere to Security Council resolution 686 'puts the credibility and motives of the Iraqi regime under suspicion'. In accepting the resolution, adopted two days after the end of the Gulf war, Baghdad had pledged to carry it out 'swiftly and honestly'. The regime of president Saddam Hussein has said it accepts all Security Council resolutions adopted since the invasion of Kuwait, including two that impose financial liability on Iraq. But Baghdad has not explicitly announced that it accepts liability and will pay damages. The letter also complained that Iraq has failed to begin returning goods it plundered from Kuwait during the seven-month occupation. Iraq has agreed to return gold, currency, Kuwait Airways aircraft and museum collections and antiquities. Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, said yesterday during a visit to Kuwait that he had received assurances from the Emir that human rights abuses against minorities in the country had ceased. He said that Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah had conceded during talks that there had been some human rights abuses in the days after liberation and that the Emir 'made it clear the extent to which the government of Kuwait regrets that'. Mr Baker said that Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the prime minister, and the Emir had told him that they would be 'pleased to invite human rights organisations to interview minorities - Palestinians and others'. Amnesty International, the human rights group, said in a report last week that there had been many substantiated cases of abuse against Palestinians by Kuwaitis since the liberation and that there was evidence that such abuses continued. Only hours before Mr Baker's arrival, the Kuwaiti government refused permission for opposition groups to hold a news conference and ordered the lights to be turned off in a Kuwait City hotel ballroom where the event was to be held. Opposition figures said that the incident showed that the ruling al-Sabah family was not sincere about allowing greater democracy and free speech. Kuwait's dark side, Page 4</p>

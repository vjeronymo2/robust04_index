			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: The Fril of European growth - Hays' plans for transforming distribution BRITISH companies are poised to transform continental Europe's retail distribution industry over the next few years, according to Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, the business services group. Hays is one of the small group of companies which provide distribution, through dedicated warehouses and transport fleets, on contract to leading retailers such as J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Tesco. Mr Frost believes it was the strategic decision taken about 25 years ago by British retailers to take control of their own distribution which has given them the whiphand over manufacturers, and allowed them to enjoy profit margins double the level of their European counterparts. 'The retailer can't get too aggressive with price if the manufacturer controls the distribution, because if you do the manufacturer says 'well, in that case I won't let you have my product',' Mr Frost says. His belief that continental retailers are bound to move in the same direction lies behind Hays' recent acquisition of Groupe Fril, a privately-owned French distributor. The Pounds 37.5m deal is the first overseas move by Hays, which was floated in 1989 and has been growing steadily towards membership of the FT-SE 100. Hays would eventually like to have 30 per cent of its earnings outside the UK, but Mr Frost insists: 'We will only buy businesses which fit perfectly, and are good businesses. I won't rush around and buy companies for the sake of it.' The UK group is still looking to make acquisitions in Germany, Spain and Portugal. It hired a management consultancy to select businesses in France and Germany, albeit less sophisticated than British distributors, which were good companies but not necessarily sellers. Mr Frost says: 'They came up with a list of 100 names. We met 12, selected three, progressed on Fril and are still talking to the other two.' British distribution companies do not have an unblemished record of expanding into Europe. Christian Salvesen last year wrote off Pounds 12.9m on an unrealistically priced contract with a German frozen food subsidiary of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group. Hays has sought to avoid such mistakes by keeping the existing management of Fril, with the present chairman and chief executive working on a three-year earn-out. Mr Frost says: 'What is important in acquiring a continental business is that you do need local knowledge and local culture, which means you have got to keep the management. This is the mistake that other British companies have made over the last four-to-five years. They have all acquired, paid cash and within six months the management has gone. 'With Fril we got extremely close. We were able to advise and help them, even before we bought the business. We then agreed a price and liked the two managers. We're looking for European management in the future, and we believe the two people are good enough to be part of that structure.' He added: 'We wanted them to earn as much from the business as possible, so we persuaded them that cash down and an earn-out was the best way, particularly as they wanted to stay with the business. It was very difficult, because in France this earn-out principle isn't known at all. Introducing them to people in Hays who had done earn-outs persuaded them this was the best thing to do.' Hays' acquisition efforts are led by Mr Graham Williams, the group's corporate development director, who was finance director until the beginning of this year. Before joining Hays in 1983 he was deputy managing director of Barclays Development Capital and prior to that he worked for Charterhouse, representing the bank on corporate boards in France and Germany. Mr Williams speaks fluent French and German, and Hays is aware of the importance - and perils - of dealing with different languages within the group. Although Fril's main board meetings are conducted in English, an interpreter is always present so that executives can make, and hear, important points in their own language. Fril mainly distributes for manufacturers, in common with other French distributors, although it also does work for retailers such as Carrefour, the hypermarket group. Mr Frost says: 'I can see Fril still working for the manufacturers for a long while yet. But for any retailer that wants to go the dedicated, sole-distribution route, we could set up facilities for them, still under Hays Fril. 'This could go into non-food directions, clothes and the like. We've got some UK customers involved in France that are looking for UK-style central distribution.' Hays is also interested in making European acquisitions on the commercial side, such as archive storage, document exchange and postal systems. Mr Frost does not rule out making acquisitions in the third area of his group, personnel, but says the present legal framework makes that a much less immediate option. The UK group can bring immediate benefits to Fril, such as the huge discounts which Hays can obtain on commercial vehicles, trailers and refrigeration equipment. However, Mr Frost clearly has much more ambitious plans, on a European scale. Hays has sole agency in the UK for Seagrams, the Canadian drinks group, and also for Moet Hennessy, LVMH's champagne and brandy businesses. Fril has the same arrangements in France, for which it has designed and produced a computer system to control stock at both companies and other companies. 'What both of those companies would like to do is have a European network of stock, not to have dump stock in each country, but have stocks in the most convenient country for the whole of Europe, says Mr Frost. 'If you're going to have spirits, the UK is the place, if you're going to have wine - obviously France. Computer-controlled movement of stocks between warehouses could be built into a pan-European distribution network.' Hays has spent a total of Pounds 65m on acquisitions since it was floated in October, 1989 - all being commercial and distribution businesses in the UK, apart from Fril. Since then, the market value of the group has grown from Pounds 393m to its current level of Pounds 825m. Pre-tax profits have also grown from Pounds 34.4m to Pounds 57.4m, although their rate of advance has been checked by recession. The group's distribution and commercial activities have continued to perform strongly, but profits from the personnel businesses - specialising in recruiting accountancy staff - have fallen sharply since 1990.</p>

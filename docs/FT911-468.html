			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Luxury route out of recession - The renewed interest in mechanical watches Like every other industry, the watch market is in recession - but recession for some watch manufacturers would be the envy of their counterparts in other trades. Take, for example, Cartier and its sister brands, Piaget and Baume &amp; Mercier. Just days before April's European Watch Clock and Jewellery Fair in Basle - generally considered the most important of its type in the world - they organised their own break-away up-market trade exhibition in Geneva. The Cartier brands invited only their most important customers so that they could buy in luxurious, dignified surroundings, without the noise, crowds and bustle of the very much larger Basle Fair: yes, even in recession, the watch halls of the Basle Fair were bustling. Imagine the expense of flying 2,500 guests from around the globe to Geneva for a few days. Add the cost of luxury accommodation, meals and entertainment, not to mention limousines to collect guests from the airport and shuttle them between hotels, entertainment and, not least, the exhibition. What results would be needed for such an exercise to be judged a success? Speaking for the three Cartier group companies and the two top independent brands (Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth) which joined the new show, Cartier president Alain Perrin said they were very happy: the number of buyers greatly exceeded expectations and sales for the five brands in the first two days of the five-day exhibition totalled Dollars 166m. Compared with the first two days of the Basle Fair last year, before recession had begun to bite and before the Gulf war had savaged demand from the Middle East, sales by the five watch companies in the Geneva show were up almost 18 per cent. On top of this awesome performance, the same brands were also exhibiting in Basle and no doubt picked up further orders from those customers who were not invited to Geneva and from those unable to visit the new luxury show. Mr Perrin has already confirmed that the International Salon of Fine Watchmaking will take place next year and the organising committee will be prepared to consider accepting up to four more participants. However, any expansion of the Geneva venture would cause considerable political upheaval in Switzerland's normally tranquil industry and no major company will make such a move lightly. Mr Perrin and his associates undoubtedly want to attract Rolex and Patek Philippe to join them in the sophisticated surroundings they have created for their new exhibition, but it seems that neither company is likely to fulfil his dream - at least until the new salon is firmly established. In Geneva and in Basle, it was clear that interest in mechanical watches is returning, but it would be wrong to suggest that quartz timepieces have had their day. As Cartier's managing director, Pierre Hacquet, explains, some of his clients want a watch only as a piece of jewellery. They do not care about the technical side; but others are now more concerned about what is inside a watch. 'We could not ignore the evolution of technology. Demand for some years has been for more precise watches. Today, the trend is towards mechanical movements. I would now like clients to recognise that the movement of a watch is as important as the case', he says. Quartz watches are certainly far more precise than mechanical watches will ever be, but buyers are beginning to rediscover the satisfaction of knowing that inside their watch is a marvel of mechanical engineering, often decorated and polished by hand to make it almost a work of art. Perhaps such buyers also realise that whereas spare parts for many quartz watches will not be available in 10, 20 or 30 years' time, a good watchmaker should still be able to produce a single spare part for a mechanical watch in 200 or 300 years' time. Quartz watches do not have built-in obsolescence, but with such rapid progress in electronics, it is evolution which will make quartz watches obsolete as each model is superseded by a more advanced replacement. At the moment, mechanical watches account for only 10,000 of the 300,000 watches sold by Cartier each year. Pierre Hacquet now anticipates expansion of Cartier's mechanical watch production at the rate of 25 per cent a year until it reaches 25,000 pieces - far higher than is achieved by any of the top firms which specialise in fine mechanical timepieces. This year's other trend, also noticeable in Geneva, was towards the production of limited editions of special watches. This year, for the first time, Cartier are producing four, including a reversible version of the classic 'tank' design. Philippe Leopold-Metzger, Cartier's managing director in the UK, says that Cartier now plans to produce three or four limited editions of mechanical watches every year. Each series will be limited to between 250 and 350 pieces. The author is Editor of International WristWatch</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Chinese demands cast doubt on HK port project CHINA'S row with Britain about democracy in Hong Kong took a turn for the worse at the weekend when senior Chinese representatives in the colony attempted to cast doubt over the future development of Hong Kong's container port. Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador to London, has been summoned to the Foreign Office today to receive a toughly worded note from Mr Alastair Goodlad, a foreign office minister, after Beijing demanded to be consulted on the proposed development of the port's ninth terminal. Officials in Hong Kong said the latest intervention by China was an attempt to undermine confidence in the colony. Beijing has claimed the proposed development of the port's ninth terminal cannot proceed without China's agreement on terms under which government land to accommodate the terminal will be sold to the terminal operators. The government recently made a proposal to three operators, each of which has substantial mainland Chinese links, over terms for proceeding with the HKDollars 8bn to HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 854m) project. The Hong Kong government denied the Chinese needed to be consulted over terms of the sale of the land - permission for which was agreed with China earlier this year. It pointed out that no government contracts or franchises were being awarded. China last year secured the right to be consulted on contracts and franchises which span June 1997 - when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty - when it agreed to the construction of the new airport. It has since refused to agree to financing arrangements for the airport because it disagrees with Britain about the development of democracy in Hong Kong. The Chinese demand for consultation on the terminal was voiced by Guo Fengmin, Beijing's chief representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. It coincided with a vote by the colony's Legislative Council to approve the administration's request for additional finance for the new airport.</p>

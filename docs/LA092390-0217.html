			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATEST MIDDLE EAST LOTTERY CRAZE: PICK A START DATE FOR WAR  </P> <P> Pick the correct date for fighting in the Persian Gulf to break out and you  could win big money -- if you're one of the American business people in Saudi  Arabia trying to relieve tensions by holding war lotteries.  </P> <P> The buildup of U.S.-led forces in the gulf has fueled speculation that a clash  with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces is inevitable.  </P> <P> The lotteries developed because almost every conversation wends its way to that  topic.  </P> <P> In one such game, players put up nearly $200 to choose a calendar day when  fighting might erupt.  </P> <P> Heavy favorites so far are concentrated in mid- to late October. Bets for  November are not yet being accepted.  </P> <P> Players tend to avoid choosing Fridays and Sundays, the Muslim and Christian  holy days. Many have chosen Mondays.  </P> <P> One group has formed what it calls an Actual Hostilities Committee to determine  what level of clash is sufficient to qualify for the prize.  </P> <P> This particular group takes into account the possibility of a diplomatic  solution.  </P></p>

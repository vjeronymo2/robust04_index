			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / The Long View: Fiendish booby traps If the financial markets are a minefield, derivative instruments such as swaps, futures and options appear to be the most fiendish of new-fangled booby traps. Consider the growing number of casualties inflicted in recent months by these most volatile of financial tools. First we have the collapse in March of Askin Capital Management, a Wall Street hedge fund operator whose boss David J. Askin contrived to lose hundreds of millions in a matter of weeks, using supposedly 'risk neutral' derivative trading techniques. One thing that is not in dispute is that Askin himself was baffled by the sheer complexity of his own trading strategies. His end was swift. Then we saw Procter &amp; Gamble, veteran of soap and detergent wars, admitting that its high-powered treasury department had stumbled in its derivative dealings with Bankers Trust. Brokerage house PaineWebber quickly followed with news of loss-making derivative trades in one of its mutual funds, which was supposed to invest in boring, rock solid US government securities. It felt obliged to reimburse investors out of its own resources. Nor is the list, which can be extended almost at will, exclusively American. Europe's biggest banks have been badly hit by the collapse of their derivative trading profits in the first half of this year. This week brought news, too, of gilt-edged losses and a spot of derivative difficulty at Union Discount in the City. The discount house's troubles were hardly significant, when compared with Allied Lyons' Pounds 150m currency option losses of not so long ago, but in some ways they were more evocative. For almost as long as most of us can remember discount houses have sporadically declared huge losses in their core business of bill broking and gilt-edged dealing. The normal pattern has been for them to raise money from shareholders to plug the resulting hole in their capital and to invest in diversification away from their core operations. All too often the diversification turns out to be more risky than expected. Union, for example, which declared an interim loss this week of nearly Pounds 800,000, lost several million in 1991 as a result of its move into an equipment leasing business. The traditional response is for the houses to raise yet more money from shareholders, while declaring a new-found aversion to risk. Alternatively they conclude that the game is not worth a candle and merge or sell out, which is why only a quartet of the old names from the London discount market survive as independent quoted concerns: Cater Allen, Gerrard &amp; National, King &amp; Shaxson and Union. The experience of the discount houses is worth recalling because it helps identify what is different in the novel world of derivatives trading. And the difference is not as much as instinct might suggest. For while the techniques are new - though not all that new by now - the source of this year's problems is old hat. The really big trouble, of which there has not, in reality, been that much to date, comes from taking large positions as principal on the basis of inadequate capital. Market making and position taking, which is how more and more banks in the US and Europe expect to make their profits, are exceptionally risky activities. As the discount houses found out time and again, it is possible to generate respectable returns in this business for a while, only to be overtaken by overwhelming losses when hit by shocks like the 1987 stock market crash. The novelty in today's markets lies in the complexity, the lack of liquidity and, especially important, the lack of transparency. Balance sheets in the financial sector have always been mildly distorted by hidden reserves and window dressing. But now they are next to worthless as a guide to the creditworthiness of institutions that deal heavily in derivatives because the degree of risk in the balance sheet can fluctuate wildly minute by minute. Published data are thus inadequate and out of date. It is impossible to tell whether people are engaging in low-risk arbitrage or high-risk position taking. The result is that we are back to a world that has surprising similarities with the 19th century. Then, partnership was still the City norm, published balance sheets were a rarity and traders judged creditworthiness on a combination of reputation, rumour and past record. People acted as both principal and agent without a welter of regulations to govern conflicts of interest. What are the rules for survival in such a world? In the late 20th century we do, admittedly, have credit rating agencies, on whose judgments the derivatives trading edifice is uncomfortably dependent. Yet rating agencies are not infallible. So rule one is not to rely on rating alone. Rule two is to recognise that this market is best left to professionals, as is investment in the shares of market makers. For them, caveat emptor applies with deadly seriousness in view of the conflict of interest in which many players are involved. The final rule is to pay even more attention than usual, in judging creditworthiness, to capital and good parentage. Without parents with deep pockets several Wall Street investment banks would have disappeared over the past decade, including First Boston, Lehman Brothers and, in the light of its recent derivatives upset, Kidder Peabody. Drexel Burnham did disappear, precisely for want of such support. And without a godparent at the Bank of England, many of London's discount houses would certainly have failed. Yet private investors can still become unwittingly embroiled in derivative problems - witness the way in which US mutual funds sought to increase their returns through derivative trading without disclosing this to clients. Once again the rule is: be boring. A fund manager will not make good the loss in a mutual fund or unit trust unless it has a reputation to protect and the resources to do it. There are times, in financial markets, when it pays to play safe.</p>

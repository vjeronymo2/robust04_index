			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Acid rain plan would not hit coal Sir, In Bronwen Maddox's article, 'Dilution measures for acid rain' (August 31), she indicates that fears about the future of the coal industry lie behind the UK government's reluctance to commit itself to adequate reductions in sulphur emissions at last week's pan-European negotiations in Geneva. It was for this reason that the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF UK) commissioned its own last-minute research. That research reveals that the future of the British coal industry and effective measures to reduce acid rain deposition are not mutually exclusive. It shows that, even with 80 per cent emission reduction (the level recommended by scientists), the UK could burn 37.5m tonnes of British coal without committing itself to flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) construction. With 12 GW of FGD (the original UK commitment), the UK could burn 46.2m tonnes of British coal (50 per cent higher than is likely to be used in 1993-94). The report also shows that there could be up to 30 per cent more acid rain damage in some parts of Europe if the UK government insists on reductions of 70 per cent rather than 80 per cent in sulphur emissions. This discrepancy could spell disaster for sensitive European ecosystems. Under such circumstances Britain will surely have earned its reputation as 'the dirty man of Europe' and encourage yet more 'dritt-sekk' type comments.

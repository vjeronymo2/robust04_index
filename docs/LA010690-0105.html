			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 150 IN BEVERLY HILLS PROTEST MALATHION  </P> <P> Wearing gas masks and waving signs, about 150 people chose an exclusive Beverly  Hills neighborhood Friday evening to demonstrate against the aerial pesticide  spraying used to combat the worst Mediterranean fruit fly infestation in  Southern California history.  </P> <P> Passing cars on Santa Monica Boulevard and Rodeo Drive honked as actors,  singers and the mayor of Monterey Park protested.  </P> <P> Their signs read: "Stop Spraying Us With Poison," "Malathion Bug Off" and  "Downey Says No to Nazi Nerve Gas."  </P> <P> The event was organized by Valley Citizens Against Urban Spraying and was  attended by residents of Temple City, Sherman Oaks, Lakewood, Northridge and  Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills was chosen for the demonstration because residents of the wealthy  city have not been sprayed after receiving an initial application of malathion  late last year, said Michael Bell, an actor and one of the event organizers.  Bell alleged that Beverly Hills had successfully blocked further sprayings.  </P> <P> But agricultural officials said the city was not sprayed again because no more  fertile Medflies were discovered in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Demonstrators from a variety of environmental and community organizations  described becoming ill with headaches and flu-like symptoms after sprayings  took place in their neighborhoods. The sprayings are now occurring every three  weeks over the 300-square mile Medfly infestation area.  </P> <P> Officials battling the Medfly infestation say the amounts of pesticide being  sprayed are far too small to adversely affect people or animals. But the  demonstrators were unconvinced.  </P> <P> Monterey Park Mayor Patricia Reichenberger said her son, who was recovering  from head injuries suffered in a motorcycle accident, experienced severe pain  after going outside the day after spraying. She said her son's doctor  attributed the pain to "an environmental reaction."  </P> <P> In another development, the state of Florida has agreed to send agricultural  experts to California to help in the eradication effort.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / An opportunity to end adversity: Shirley Williams says the European elections will be a vital step in redefining UK politics after John Smith's death The Labour party sometimes seems to be dogged by misfortune. In 1963, on the edge of a breakthrough into government after 13 years in the desert, Labour lost its great leader Hugh Gaitskell. In 1974 the second Wilson government took office just after the huge increase in oil prices; Labour then went out of office just as oil was beginning to bring in millions of pounds of additional revenue from the North Sea, a God-given bonus now largely dissipated. Now, at the moment it is once again poised to return to office, it has lost another remarkable leader, one who built on the foundation Neil Kinnock laid: aiming to recreate Labour as a potential party of government. For there is an antibody at work in the body politic, a suspicion of the Labour party that is based not just on memories of the 1979 winter of discontent, but on perception of Labour as interventionist, obsolete, and union-dominated. The perception is not altogether fair. But it is extraordinarily persistent. John Smith's qualities, of prudence, common sense, seriousness, experience and integrity, over and above his remarkable gifts as a parliamentarian, went a long way to reassure people that Labour had put its wild ways behind it. It was the need to show that the party had changed fundamentally that led John Smith to risk so much on getting a form of one member, one vote through the 1993 Labour Party Conference. A cautious politician, he understood that more was at stake from not attempting the reform than from failing to win it. But John Smith's legacy is not just to his party. It is to his country also. At a time when the government and the Conservative party are in near-terminal disarray on Europe, he provided an example of steady commitment to Britain's European future. He was never a fanatic; but he understood, through all the ups and downs of Britain's stormy relationship with the European Community, that there was no other way to go, that Britain's economic future depended upon our membership. From his vote for entry in 1971 against a three-line whip, a very brave act for an aspiring and ambitious young politician, John Smith never wavered. He was a devolutionist, a man who understood that harnessing the energies of the countries and regions of Britain would stimulate enterprise and innovation, that Westminster and Whitehall needed to be open to new ideas from beyond their own tight and incestuous circle. His roots deep in Scotland, and in the Labour culture of Strathclyde, fed that strong sense of regional autonomy. The former Labour leader saw how local government is being eroded by the authoritarianism of central government, and he deplored it. He could, however, never bring himself to support proportional representation for local elections, even though that would almost certainly have ended the domination of certain local councils by the 'loony left' - or, for that matter, the loony right. John Smith was a man who believed in the ethos of public service. Nothing exemplified that better than the concluding words of his last speech, the day before he died. His sense of public service ran much deeper than words in speeches. Again, at a time when the tradition of public service and of civic integrity seems to have been relegated to history, abandoned even by some of those charged with upholding it as the evidence to the Scott inquiry shows, John Smith's example deserves to be honoured and followed. The genuine response of grief at his death seems to demonstrate a hunger for more substantial and more constructive politics, for an end to the media frenzy over sexual and financial scandals, and to the political behaviour that feeds it. In choosing his successor, the Labour party will make a fateful choice. It will choose its political strategy up to and beyond the next general election. It will close or open doors to co-operation with other parties in areas where Labour cannot command a majority. John Smith believed the Labour party could win a majority at a general election; or, at least, he behaved as if he believed that. Yet the local government results on May 5 cast further doubt on the validity of that belief. While an apparent triumph for Labour, the truth of the matter is that the only winners were the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists. As The Economist pointed out this week, in England it was not Labour that picked up disillusioned Tory voters, a further 5 per cent drop on the Conservative party's already low share of the vote in 1990. It was the Liberal Democrats. And it was in the Tory heartlands that the largest proportion of previous Tory voters defected to the Liberal Democrats. Whatever the opinion polls show, Labour finds it difficult to get above a 40 per cent share of the real vote. It has not done so at a general election even once since 1979. Furthermore, its position is slowly eroding, not so much because of marginal losses as a result of boundary changes, but because demography and industrial organisation work against it. Ours is an ageing society; it is also one in which the manufacturing industry and the public services on which trades unionism depended are losing jobs to an individualistic and fragmented private service sector. In consequence, Britain is becoming a three-party country, four in Scotland; or more accurately, a country in which two parties contend in particular constituencies and regions, but not the same two parties. It is the Liberal Democrats who are now the main opposition party in the south and west, Labour in the north and in London, though even that is beginning to change. Given that neither national opposition party may win an overall majority, and given too the need for an effective and convincing challenge to a government that has run out of time, ideas and morale, how should we proceed? Some advocate an electoral pact, but any such pact would be passionately opposed by many in both of the main opposition parties. Nor is it clear that party headquarters could make their local parties adhere to any such pact. Many dissillusioned Tories would find such a pact reason for not voting at all. What is needed instead is to build habits of co-operation, to move Britain away from the politics of confrontation to at least some element of consensus on the country's most important goals. In the effort to save local government as an important and valuable part of the body politic, that is already happening. Up and down the country, especially in the shire counties, Liberal Democrats and Labour, sometimes Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, and even in a few places Labour and Conservative, are working together. On local government reorganisation, a very large part of the Conservative party finds itself closer to the other parties than to its own government. In a recent debate on the Local Government Commission in the House of Lords, only the ministers, one backbench Conservative peer and three Labour peers spoke up for official policy. Every other Conservative, Independent, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peer spoke on the other side. The most important issue of all for the country's future is the role we will play in the European Union. The shape of that Union will be profoundly affected by the two enlargements now envisaged, for Austria and the Scandinavians, and beyond that for the Visegrad group of central and east European countries. It will also be affected by the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996 which will determine the institutional changes needed to cope with those enlargements. Britain has a significant interest in the outcome of the IGC, but the truth of the matter is that little constructive input is likely from a deeply riven government. One senior German official said to me at a conference earlier this week: 'From London, we get nothing.' Yet Britain has much to contribute to the IGC. Among politicians of all parties who believe in Britain's continued membership of the Union, there is a concern to build a stronger democratic base, to involve national parliaments more closely, to make subsidiarity meaningful, and to open up the deliberations of the Council of Ministers so that governments cannot evade responsibility for their decisions. Indeed, the attack on 'the faceless bureaucrats of Brussels' is often a diversion from the unaccountable actions of ministers, including our own. The European elections are likely to produce for the first time a group of Liberal Democrat MEPs, and probably a number of additional Labour members. On these MEPs, and on re-elected MEPs, some of whom have made a distinguished contribution to the European Parliament, will fall the responsibility to consult, discuss and formulate, together with their parties at home, proposals for the IGC. These will not be official proposals, but constructive ideas from British opposition parties - and indeed from European-minded Conservative MEPs - are likely to be heard by other governments in the Union, and perhaps even by our own. Britain's contribution must not be allowed to go by default. The issues now at the heart of British politics are too important to be left to a weak and discredited government. John Smith cared about issues in politics that mattered. His successor will, if he or she is wise, be able to do something about them. The author is a former Labour education secretary</p>

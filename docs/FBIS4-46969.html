			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion at the editorial office of HOLOS </F> UKRAYINY, moderated by HOLOS UKRAYINY editor in chief Serhiy  Pravdenko and prepared for publication by L. Kokhanets, A.  Kraslyanskyy, and V. Tuhluk, with the participation of Supreme  Council deputies Yevhen Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr  Mukhin (Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh), Mykhaylo  Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan  and Stepan Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen  Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy Yermak (the  Reform deputy group); statements by V. Mukhin and Ye. Marmazov  are printed in Russian: "Roundtable Discussion at HOLOS  UKRAYINY. We Are Held Together by the Main Point: The Fate of  Ukraine, the Fate of Our People"]    [Text] Elections in the spring of this year were  complicated and tense. If nothing else, the fact that but a  handful succeeded in "breaking through" to the Supreme Council  on the first try indicates this. Nonetheless, the election was  held despite everything. The people made their political choice  by clearly saying that they attach hopes to the Ukrainian  parliament. At the same time, during the election campaign the  people demanded that certain unfavorable elements in the  operation of the supreme legislative organ be abandoned, that  its operations be greatly improved, and that the coefficient of  its effectiveness be raised.    So the editorial office invited for a "roundtable  discussion"  representatives of various political forces, deputy groups, and  factions of the Supreme Council in order to share their thoughts  about the following questions:    1. What is your vision of the process of improving the  operation of the Supreme Council? To your mind, what aspects of  its prior operation should be rejected and what aspects should  be borrowed?    2. Deputy factions as a new element of the structure of  the Supreme Council--will they become an instrument of accord in  the parliament or, on the contrary, aggravate a political  confrontation? What is your projection?    3. Do your parties and factions have a clear-cut vision  of how Ukraine is to overcome the economic crisis? What priority  draft laws will you introduce for consideration by the Supreme  Council to this end?    4. The Supreme Council and its newspaper.    The following took part in the conversation: Yevhen  Marmazov (Communist Party), Volodymyr Mukhin  (Socialist Party), Oles Lavrynovych (Rukh),  Mykhaylo Ratushnyy (Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists), Pavlo Movchan and Stepan  Volkovetskyy (the Statehood deputy group), and Yevhen  Zherebetskyy, Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and Anatoliy  Yermak (the Reform deputy group).    The "roundtable discussion" was moderated by Serhiy  Pravdenko, editor in chief of HOLOS UKRAYINY.  <H5>  "We Have Come To Work Rather Than Fight" </H5>   [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Observers estimate that even the first week  of operation of the Supreme Council was considerably more  productive than with the old set of deputies. They have  succeeded in taking care of the initial organizational problems  and proceeded toward resolving the main issues. The deputies  have actually rejected political controversy and the settling of  accounts, and have devoted their entire time solely to what is  the most important. Nonetheless, the process of improving the  operation of the Supreme Council still calls for major efforts.  What is your view of this?    [P. Movchan] I would like to note the following essential  aspect to begin with. It is yet another illusion that the  current Supreme Council has come in, formed itself, and will  quickly solve the problems that we are facing. We should not  encourage among the public the illusion that the current Supreme  Council will set things right all at once and will neatly  resolve everything. We should get rid of these illusions,  because they facilitate a new period for the accumulation of  negative energy, which may end in an assault on the Supreme  Council--the way it began in previous years. To me, it is  unimportant whether this might come from the west, the south, or  the east.    It should be understood that the period of collapse that  Ukraine is going through will not end all that soon. Ours was  not a Ukrainian economy, it was a colonial economy; as a matter  of fact, it has to be built anew. All hopes that the Supreme  Council will come and announce that a union with Russia begins  today, and everything will become marvelous right away is a  political speculation. Thus, a great, very strenuous effort  awaits us.    The best way to ensure this, to have no speculation in this  chamber, may be to split into factions, which we are already  doing. Ensuring minority rights is yet another essential aspect.  At present, there are various colorings in the  chamber--blue-and-yellow, Red, or some other, but this is not  important. It is important that without ensuring the  constitutional rights of the minority in this Supreme Council,  we will not get rid of strictly political precedents. Therefore,  we need to make relevant amendments as soon as possible and lay  a legal foundation for the functioning of groups that represent  the minority in the parliament.    [H. Omelchenko] I represent the Reform deputy group, which  was established on the initiative of a group of  deputies--officers, lawyers, and economists. I subscribe to a  number of fundamental statements just made by People's Deputy  Movchan. However, to my mind, global problems also exist at  present along with this. First of all, it is carrying out  economic reforms that would make it possible to improve the life  of the people and offer an outlook--as the saying goes, the  light at the end of the tunnel. The second is the adoption of  the legislative base and the creation of an entire system of  state organs that could genuinely fight corruption and organized  crime. As I see it, in the process there should not even be a  discussion of whether or not Ukraine is to be an independent  state. The Ukrainian people have made their choice, and there  may not be any political unions at the expense of independence.    [Ye. Marmazov] [statement printed in Ukrainian] We should  approve clear-cut by-laws and strictly adhere to them in order  to improve the work of the Supreme Council. Unfortunately, our  by-laws were violated all the time, even the provisional  by-laws, which were passed last year. This is the first point.  Second, we should make sure that our Supreme Council works, that  a person comes along who would organize the operation of  factions, groups, and circles. It should not so happen that a  leader of the Supreme Council pursues his policy contrary to the  will of deputies. All people's deputies should work, no matter  how different they might be. The task at hand is to get the  maximum from everyone in order promptly to pass laws aimed at  overcoming the catastrophe that Ukraine is now facing.    In the old Supreme Council, nobody was interested in how  commissions operate and whether someone reports for work or not.  We should now categorically reject such practices. It was indeed  possible to work through the commissions, through the  territorial groups of deputies. However, not even attempts at  that were apparent.    At present, we have an extremely difficult situation. There  will be work for everyone, just come join in. The operation of  the Supreme Council should be organized in such a way that  everyone without exception would work on a permanent basis. One  submitted a petition when he ran for deputy; let him now quit  his previous job. Tell me honestly: Did we frequently see  Zvyahilskyy and other leaders at the sessions? At present, too,  the minister of agriculture, his two deputies, and the chief of  material and technical supplies are deputies. Are they really  going to sit here? If 50 people fail to show up for a session,  the parliament will be paralyzed. Everybody should work on a  professional basis.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Could it be that these difficulties would  be  successfully overcome if the leaders of factions work  efficiently, if there is professional agreement and solidarity?    [Ye. Zherebetskyy] I, for one, am very happy that comrade  Communists agree that the parliament must be professional.  Frankly, all of us were afraid that the leftist blocs would  advocate something different.    I would like to second the thought of Pavlo Movchan that the  minority in the parliament should enjoy clearly specified  rights. In recent years, the actual structuring of society has  occurred; consequently, it is all the more necessary for the  parliament to have its own new structures.    At present, there is the center, the right, and the left,  but  they are not structured among themselves. To be sure, as I see  it, a parity between them has already been reached, and this is  very important in itself. Preparatory groups operated very  productively before the session began. They proposed regulations  on factions which we passed and which suited everybody. This  indicates that all of us wish to work productively.  <H5>  By-Laws Are Not a Luxury, but Rather the Rules of the Game </H5>   [O. Lavrynovych]I worked in the group that considered the  draft by-laws. It is a pleasure now to hear a favorable  evaluation of our effort from a deputy colleague. Of course, the  effectiveness of operation of the Supreme Council depends on the  rules of the game that it adopts. On several occasions, I worked  with the representative of the Communist Party in this group and  rejoiced at finding a common ground on procedural issues. This  is the case, first of all, with the developed clear-cut rules of  behavior of each people's deputy and all parliamentary organs at  the time of decision-making. Therefore, the regulations that we  have adopted are the first step for the Supreme Council of  Ukraine to acquire a civilized appearance in general and to  complete its structuring into factions and deputy groups in  particular; this is precisely the process that can and must give  us an opportunity to work much more effectively than before.    These conditions must first of all make our society feel  that  the deputies are responsible for the laws that they pass, and  that there are political forces that assume responsibility for  the decisions that they will make within these walls.    [V. Mukhin] I took part in the work of the preparatory  group.  At the first stage, we tried to lay a foundation for the normal  operation of the Supreme Council. To this end, the idea of the  need for clear-cut structuring was proposed because the fact  that the previous Supreme Council was essentially a nonparty one  was its substantial drawback. Although they frequently refer to  the "group of 239," life has shown that individuals who actually  adhered to particular party policies were few and far between in  this group. Everybody else amounted to an indefinite political  force and voted on each occasion, whichever way he saw fit. This  made it impossible to clearly structure operations, due to which  they discussed issues for hours and days, without being able to  arrive at a common decision.    If someone followed attentively the first day of operation  of  the current parliament, he noticed that within just a few  minutes, we plowed through issues that the former Supreme  Council would have discussed for an entire day. The idea of  clear-cut structuring is bearing fruit.    This issue simply ties in to the issue of factions. The  Supreme Council will be at a political impasse forever in the  absence of factions, in the absence of clear-cut political  divisions. The situation is very simple: If they succeed in  quickly coming to a compromise among the leadership of the  factions, a compromise among all deputies will be found  automatically. For this reason, when the question [rendered in  Ukrainian in the original] "Are the factions of deputies a path  toward accord?" I will confirm that this is indeed a path toward  a precise and clear understanding of what we want, after all. I  think that there will not be harsh confrontations between  factions--we are going to come to agreements.    [M. Ratushnyy] I would like to revisit the thought with  which  P. Movchan began. Indeed, the several days of operation of the  Supreme Council make it possible to draw certain favorable  conclusions. However, it bothers me that the agreement of the  deputies to quit their previous position only until 1 July has  gone unnoticed (perhaps deliberately unnoticed). This means that  some deputies do not want to just be deputies but also to remain  directors or heads of oblast councils. They still want actually  to influence elections to local councils, and I think that such  a trend is dangerous.    What else may improve the operation of the Supreme Council?  To my mind, it would be the existence of strong executive power  in Ukraine, paradoxical as this might be, because until such  exists, it will be impossible to carry out the adopted laws.  Effectiveness of our actions is out of the question in the  absence of this. Rules of the game were mentioned here. We cheat  one another all the time. I worked in the working group for the  development of by-laws. We made great efforts to provide a  greater opportunity for one or several deputies to somehow show  initiative and fully partake of the process of law creation. The  leader should improve the work of the Supreme Council and mainly  prevent it from rolling back. All differences that may be  eliminated in the Supreme Council, be they on tactical or some  other grounds, may be resolved if the goal of the parliament is  the same: to prevent the liquidation of Ukrainian independence.  If other trends prevail, this Supreme Council is not worth  talking about....    [S. Volkovetskyy] To my mind, the role of the speaker is to  designate the middle, or the idea on which the Supreme Council  agrees. Finding this idea is not all that easy, because it may  not become apparent for everyone right away. A certain mastery,  even the talent for advocating this position, is necessary. Of  course, the speaker, just like any people's deputy, is entitled  to his own point of view on all issues, but he has a special  role to play. He must find an optimal solution on which the  entire parliament would agree.    What we have adopted cannot yet be called good by-laws: This  is a temporary move in order to ensure the further operation of  the Supreme Council. In all parliaments of the world, their  chairmen do not have the extensive rights that our previous  chairman had formally or informally (I have studied these  issues). Of course, attempts will be made to extend these rights  further. This should not be the case. The chairman should be  restricted through by-laws, and may allow himself only the  things that the by-laws allow. Each deputy should know his  rights, know what he can and cannot do, including deputies that  constitute the minority, whether or not they belong to factions.    If we discuss what practices of the old Supreme Council it  would be worthwhile to reject, I think that it is first of all  poor discipline and, once again, the excessive role of the  chairman. How many cases do we remember in which deputies did  not speak to the point, but were not stopped! In keeping with  the by-laws, they should have been resolutely interrupted: This  would have taught a good lesson to other deputies, they would  have made decisions faster. The endeavor would have gained, and  their authority among the people would have been greater. Who  from among these deputies was punished? There had to be some  kind of sanctions, but we did not see anything like that. Also,  there were altogether impermissible things, such as voting in  place of someone else.    Generally, I believe that we, the new membership of the  Supreme Council, should raise our operations to a new level,  taking into account the experience of foreign partners.    [A. Yermak] I think that a rigid confrontation between  political parties, circles, and structures will hamper the work  of the parliament. This will not benefit the state of Ukraine.  This is why I would like representatives of various parties and  movements to agree on a moratorium on political discussions from  the very first days, at least for a certain period of time,  until we improve economic conditions. Political debate in the  parliament will bring about still greater polarization of  society, and you know that it is quite perceptible to begin  with. The people just will not endure all of this. Our regular,  harmonious work will provide an opportunity to complete the  election to a full-fledged parliament. If there is accord  between the representatives of various parties and movements,  the right, the left, and the center will be able to make a  determination and agree to focus their efforts on economic  issues, on fighting corruption and the mafia, but on the  condition of grasping that all of us are working for the same  independent Ukraine. This is the foundation of foundations, the  cornerstone.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] I ask that those who wish to do so respond  to the second question: "Deputy factions as a new element in the  structure of the Supreme Council." They may not be an entirely  new element; an attempt to create them was made in the previous  parliament, too, when it was divided into the majority and the  minority, but later all of this fell apart. Therefore, will  factions become an instrument of accord in the parliament? Your  projection?    [P. Movchan] Whether there will be accord in the parliament  will depend on how the statehood forces act. If all of these  forces work for the same cause, the state, accord will always be  reached. If we once again encounter anti-statehood forces, a  conflict cannot be avoided. However, it is understood that  anti-statehood forces will propose all manner of unions, and  this will bring about the resuscitation of the old Union.    There are very powerful forces in Russia that speak out for  the restoration of the Union. It is no secret that such forces  also exist here. You witnessed yourselves a demonstration with  the requisite slogans on Khreshchatyk. These are the hidden  explosives that could split the parliament and cause a split in  our state itself. All of these economic programs (I have read  them and am familiar with them) further the resuscitation of  colonies, and this is the path of provocations and clashes,  which would begin here and transcend the confines of the  parliament. It is precisely for this reason that amendments  should be made to the Constitution right now, including those  concerning the powers of the Supreme Council chairman, on which  Volkovetskyy has touched: The speaker is not the chairman. The  speaker is a regimented individual; if these amendments pass, it  would be desirable to already make proposals as to the functions  of the Supreme Council chairman. Relevant amendments should be  made to the Law on the Chairman, and the head of the parliament  should be elected later. As far as we are concerned, we are  doing everything the other way around.    The programs of the center-right and the center are  absolutely identical. The left is an exception. Perhaps they  used this as a move in the elections, but now have other  approaches and their own vision. The fate of the parliament will  depend on these programs: accord or discord, controversy or  agreement. One more point--amendments should be made to the  by-laws in order to ensure the rights of both the minority and  the majority: They should be codified. If this is not done,  conflicts are also possible.    Do you know what the previous Supreme Council was to blame  for? For there being neither a majority nor minority law. So  they could not agree. I support the idea of Anatoliy Vasilyovych  Yermak about the introduction of a moratorium, but on the topic  of independence of Ukraine rather than on political discussions.  If we agree that we do not touch on or consider this problem, we  will always find a common point of view on economic aspects.  <H5>  The Ideas May Be Different, But the Goal the Same </H5>   [Ye. Marmazov] We believe that the creation of factions is a  step forward in the operation of the Supreme Council. In  principle, factions can play a major role in achieving "accord"  [word rendered in Ukrainian in the original] in the operation of  the Supreme Council. This "accord" will come when factions work  in the way which is outlined in the by-laws. We are now taking  measures for our faction to become constructive and disciplined.  I like it very much that the by-laws provide for the  "conciliatory group of deputies" [phrase rendered in Ukrainian  in the original] to which a major role is assigned. If we keep  to all of this, there will be "accord" [rendered in Ukrainian in  the original] in our parliament. As far as "statehood" [word  rendered in Ukrainian in the original] is concerned, the program  of our Communist Party, incidentally, as well as that of the  Socialist Party, clearly says that we support the policy of  building a sovereign, independent Ukraine. We have a clear-cut  platform, which we have released to the public, and everyone  knows this. This is not a maneuver, as Pavlo Movchan said; it is  our position. However, whether someone likes it or not, we  should boldly proceed to establish an economic union. How can it  be viewed? The European Union is now being created in Europe,  which is proceeding toward just one monetary unit, the ECU  [European Currency Unit]. If we take this path, in the long run  there should also be a common unit, and so on.    [G. Omelchenko] I hope that deputy factions and deputy  groups  offer a real chance to achieve a compromise on the most readily  solvable problems. The parliamentary practice of the world is  unimaginable without the activities of factions, but this same  practice is also inconceivable without elections on a multiparty  basis. Therefore, if we are to be completely logical, factions  indeed would play the role they do in developed countries if we  held elections on a multiparty basis. Alas.... One more point.  The parliamentary majority may take advantage of its numerical  preponderance and demand the adoption of solutions to which the  minority will not agree. So if these demands fit within the  confines of parliamentary culture and of the possible upholding  of minority rights, work will be constructive.    [M. Ratushnyy] I agree. We could refer to a favorable role  of  party factions only in the event that an election has been held  on a multiparty basis. More than 180 deputies of the current  Supreme Council are nonparty members. This is more than  one-half. Therefore, it is feasible to refer to groups rather  than factions. Three such groups have already emerged. The first  group draws those who clearly advocate the restoration of the  colonial status of Ukraine in some new forms. This group  includes approximately one-third of the deputies. The second  group, which clearly advocates statehood positions, has already  emerged: They are also a conventional one-third. The third group  likewise accounts for one-third. They are those who make a  determination depending upon the situation. Consequently, the  danger of changing the rules while the game is in progress  exists. At present, someone wants to splinter these groups into  some kind of factions and manipulate these small, 25-strong,  party factions, to haggle, promise, and actually stage the  entire behind-the-scenes performance. I am already seeing how a  "hunt" is beginning for certain independent deputies. They try  to drive these deputies into some kind of trap, whereas the  deputies run toward the center, because there an opportunity  exists to stand closer to power. They see that the leftists are  getting the upper hand; therefore, they should flee from the  center in that direction. This is precisely why the factions,  due to their fuzziness, will not clearly reflect the reality  that exists in our society. If there is no accord on any terms,  this will amount to suicide for the parliament. The very  instinct of survival, of self-preservation, should force us to  come to an agreement: "Guys, let us work constructively;  otherwise we will waste time, and the people will start asking  questions as early as the fall...."    [O. Lavrynovych] Let us hope for this. I also think that  associations of deputy groups and factions the possible  existence of which is envisioned precisely by the provisions of  by-laws will play a great "peacemaking" role. The unification of  these factions and deputy groups will occur precisely in keeping  with the principles to which, incidentally, Mr. Ratushnyy  referred, perhaps with corrections of some kind. I would like to  see a majority that would amount to an association of deputy  groups and factions to appear as soon as possible, so that we  could clearly know who belongs to the majority, who forms the  government, and who precisely is politically accountable for the  things that are done in this chamber.    I would like a common-sense group, a pro-reform group, a  group for establishing legal order in our society, to be formed  as soon as possible. This would make it possible to reconcile  all opposing sides and to not make enemies of one another, but  to cooperate and make the most urgent decisions. Why does nobody  want to say that, in essence, there are two factions in this  parliament: one in favor of statehood, independence, and  sovereignty in full, and the other in favor of economic unions  that ultimately mean the restoration of the empire. It is  possible to talk about this in various ways, but it should be  clearly understood what is what in reality. You do know that  Zvyahilskyy is giving the Lisichansk Oil Combine to Russia  toward the debt. Therefore, there is an attempt at present to  liquidate our sovereignty by way of economics. Here is the  "struggle for an independent Ukraine but within an economic  union" for you.  <H5>  Let Us Start With the Main Link--the Economy </H5>   [HOLOS UKRAYINY] So, do you see a way out of the economic  crisis, and what draft laws to this end will you propose to the  Supreme Council for consideration in the immediate future?    [Ye. Marmazov] Proceeding from the platform of our party,  we,  the Communist deputies, firmly advocate the social choice of the  sociopolitical system. We are not abandoning this, and we are  convinced that this is the only way to go. We advocate the  primacy of all people's state property in politics and  economics. This is why I consider creating conditions for the  regular operation of state enterprises and collective farms to  be the main point. It is on them that our entire economy hinges.  However, virtually no attention has been paid to these  components lately: We have been left to our own devices.    Ukraine will not be fed by either private farmers or joint  ventures; all of this will not come to pass soon. It is also  necessary to pass first of all a number of laws, in particular  those on putting the finance and credit policy in order.  Generally, we have an absolute mess in this area. The economy  has now been paralyzed because the finance and credit system has  been messed up.    Hence our paralysis. Such a situation has now developed that  in our country enterprises and sectors cannot settle among  themselves. The absence of the money supply is one of the  burning issues. Something else: I support the comrades in that a  major, carefully developed law on fighting corruption, mafia  structures, speculation, and bribery should now be developed.  Omelchenko has raised this issue. By now, the supreme spheres  here have been afflicted with corruption; how are we going to  put things in order? Take a look: It is not houses but rather  palaces that are being built in the vicinity of Kiev. This is  how arrogant people have become while taking advantage of  impunity. Even the president's advisers did not refrain from  this--they have also been involved with the mafia. One has run  away, another has come to take his place, and has started doing  the same thing. So, has corruption been elevated to the status  of policy here?    [G. Omelchenko] Long ago.    [Ye. Marmazov] The following issue, although not everyone  likes it: We will have to put everything aside and proceed to do  the thing that is advantageous to Ukraine--establish an economic  union. In the absence of it, we will not be able to restore  normalcy in the operation of the national economy of Ukraine.  Sooner or later we will proceed to do it anyway, but without  encroaching upon sovereignty and an independent policy.    [G. Omelchenko] What needs to be done in order to overcome  the economic crisis? First of all, the tax system needs to be  changed urgently. Manufacturers must pay 30 percent in taxes at  the most. It is possible to introduce a nominal tax of 5-7  percent for five years. Further on, strict order should be  restored in the credit and finance system and currency  regulation. Likewise, a law on fighting corruption urgently  needs to be passed. As early as 26 January 1993, the Supreme  Council issued a decree in the second point of which it  committed itself to approve, within one month, the legal and  legislative notions of such phenomena as corruption, the mafia,  organized crime, the shadow economy. However, this decree has  not been carried out to this day. The next law is about a ban on  the involvement of people's deputies in commercial and banking  activities personally, through intermediaries, or through  individuals fronting for them, which is not being complied with,  either. The law on fighting corruption and organized crime  should specify the level of liability--from ethical and moral to  criminal. Yet another law in this area is the law on the  dismissal of officials by virtue of a lack of confidence, which  would indicate clearly for the commission of which violations an  official, beginning with the president and on down to a clerical  worker of the lowest rank, would be dismissed and no longer have  the right to work in state organs and government organs. It is  also necessary to pass a law on the recall of people's deputies  and on stripping them of their powers, which would clearly  regulate in what cases this would be done.    We have developed these priority draft laws. If such is the  will of the Supreme Council, we may put the draft laws on the  table in a month and a half. It is also worthwhile to write the  following into the law on the recall of people's deputies and  stripping them of their powers: "If a deputy has committed  violations he shall be deprived of the credentials of deputy and  shall never again have the right to run for the Supreme Council  or another representative organ." People should know that by  transgressing the law they rob themselves forever of access to  the sphere of state power. This is what should be done and  adopted first of all.    As far as the economic union is concerned, it is possible  that at some point it will be an integrated structure on the  model of the European Union. However, both Russia and Ukraine  must be built up as states first. If Ukraine grows strong, we  will have more confidence. However, for now it is premature to  talk about a union, a common economic space.    [Ye. Zherebetskyy] This issue is a new, camouflaged tactical  move by our Communists.    [O. Lavrynovych] The logic is simple in this instance.  Russia  does not want the Union to be restored; it wants to restore the  classical version of an empire. To this end, it needs a colony,  its own Communist colony, because it was always easier to deal  with a Communist colony. However, the world would look at  Ukraine as something that does not merit serious attention  because the owner exists--the patron that would set the  direction for that state.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] That is, Russia.    [M. Ratushnyy] Of course. To prevent this, we should always  ensure economic independence first of all rather than an  economic union, as those want who desire to bury the Ukrainian  state. Economic independence may only obtain in a complex with  the structural opportunity to influence the processes of change  in the forms of property. That is, this cannot be politics in  itself. At present, the most urgent task for us is to change the  structure of power and to clearly determine its functions. With  state property accounting for 93-95 percent, legislative acts on  precisely state power and self-government will be crucial. What  does the economy begin with? With property. Who is administering  property at present? The state authorities.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Officials. These are the best conditions  for  corruption. They steal what is owned by the state.    [M. Ratushnyy] How else? Why do they want to keep kolkhozes?  The people who work there steal a kopek's worth, the chairman  steals 10 karbovantsy's worth, those who manage in the rayon  steal thousands, and those who are at the top--millions.    Those who make policy today do not think about the day after  tomorrow. Few think even about tomorrow. Since we are talking  about the initial steps, we should first of all make legislative  decisions concerning changes in the structure of property, the  generation of budgets at all levels, and taxation. High taxes  especially contribute to smothering the economy. Nobody looks at  analogies that have occurred in other states. One gets the  impression that nobody has read economic textbooks and nobody  knows that production begins to be depressed above 35 percent,  and at above 5 [as published] percent, production already begins  to collapse. What do we have?    We, the Ukrainian nationalists, are precisely in favor of  introducing firm order in the economy; ours is the position of a  social market economy. I think that nobody is talking about the  pursuit of a protectionist policy with regard to our national  producers, with the exception of Pynzenyk. The policy of  neocolonialism is not carried out only from the east, but is  effectively implemented from the west. Everything is being done  to destroy production in Ukraine and the producer. I believe  that the strict monitoring of export and import operations is  necessary.    I agree with Omelchenko that it would be more moral to still  make amendments to the law "On the Status of People's Deputies,"  in which to give up immunity. Deputy immunity is the armor  behind which various fraud is frequently perpetrated. It is also  necessary to make an amendment concerning arrangements for the  real recall of deputies.  <H5>  A Union, but Only an Economic One </H5>   [S. Volkovetskyy] When there is talk of an economic union,  it  is obvious that they misuse it, and misused it for 70 years by  calling the state a union.    We are not against an economic union with Russia, but a  union  such as with Germany, France, Japan, or the United States, on a  mutually advantageous basis. I believe that we should think  about how to replenish the budget, where to get money, and how  to manage it correctly.    If we indeed proceed to introduce reforms, offer incentives  to our national producers, and create conditions whereby it is  profitable to manufacture products, the budget will be ensured,  too.    It is also important to pass the law "On Local Authorities."  Being the chairman of an oblast council and understanding how  imperfect this system is, I think that it is certainly necessary  for us to not frustrate the forthcoming elections to the local  organs of power. In a word, we need to work, rather than waste  time.    [H. Omelchenko] It would appear that there is nothing  frightening: an economic union or some other union. However, I  will say what I know by virtue of the specifics of my work. It  was fall 1992. A group of people's deputies of the former Soviet  Union got together.    A part of the group consisted of active-service generals and  senior officers. The generals who spoke stated that in Belarus,  Kazakhstan, and Ukraine there were many military men in  leadership positions who were prepared to carry out an order to  create the united armed forces of the Soviet Union and to  restore it. The decision was also made there to do everything in  order to discredit President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk,  Minister of Defense K. Morozov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet  of Belarus Shushkevich, and President of Russia Yeltsin. Now let  us look at what we have as of now: Morozov is gone, and so is  Shushkevich.    A couple of months ago, the Union of Officers of Russia got  together with the people's deputies of the State Duma in the  Moscow area; a plan for the restoration of the Soviet Union was  developed there. Officers who serve in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine also attended. That is to say, the development of the  military-political scenario from the fall of 1992 continues. Is  it an accident that the former general Rutskoy states that we  will celebrate the 50th anniversary of victory over German  Fascism in a unified Soviet Union? We should grasp the fact that  neither the United States nor other highly developed countries  need Ukraine as an independent, strong state. This is why we may  be offered, in whatever packaging, a slice of the ruble zone and  something else of the kind in order to deprive Ukraine of  independence.    On 1 December 1991, we said for all time: Ukraine is a  state.  Therefore, let us do everything for it to indeed be great,  prosperous, and rich.    [V. Mukhin] As far as the issue of overcoming the crisis is  concerned, I can say the following: Our Socialist Party has an  anticrisis economic program, which Moroz proposed at one point.  We submitted it to the Cabinet of Ministers and to the  president. At that time, the president responded thus: "If you  come to power, you will then implement your programs." I think  that the economic program that we have developed and that both  the Communist Party and the group of the Peasant Party perceive  correctly will be approved by the Supreme Council because it is  aimed at improving the life of the people.    It will be best for Ukraine to overcome the crisis if there  is an economic, industrial-defense, and political union with  Russia. Why? Well, mine is a very large district, and all  enterprises that are located there are defense enterprises.  These are enterprises of the highest standard, which could  manufacture marvelous products that Russia badly needs. We could  substantially improve our standard of living owing solely to the  Russian defense orders. However, the situation is such that  Russia is saying: "Let us sign a relevant agreement." As they  explained to me, to this end at a minimum 50 agreements  concerning a defense union need to be signed.    Now let us look at another aspect of the issue--do we have  an  actual defense union with Russia or not? Everyone turns a blind  eye to the fact that actually this union exists. We have a  common defense system, a common system of weapon supply to the  troops, common intelligence and counterintelligence systems if  we take the pertinent agreement into account; we have a common  system of staff command, and so on. The defense union actually  exists, but it has not been formalized legally and politically.  Annually, we lose tremendous funds because of this.    As far as the defense sector is concerned, many people  understand that this is a huge complex that employs about 7  million people. It concentrates colossal profits for  Ukraine--this is a lack of understanding, I would say national  tunnel vision, which causes us to suffer enormous losses. We do  not lose "independence" [word rendered in Ukrainian in the  original]! As far as our bloc is concerned, we are preparing a  draft law on issues that are the most important for the people.  The first issue that is of great concern to all is: How will  compensation be provided for the deposits of the population that  the state actually took away shamelessly, primarily from old  people?    I am not an economist, but I am studying, and for this  reason  I believe that a law on taxes is also very important. I am a  proponent of the need to support large state enterprises, being  aware that they will generate enormous profits for the state if  everything is structured intelligently.    Now about the newspaper. Personally, I do not like the  newspaper. Recently it has been one-sided, and the editor has  taken a one-sided position, although he did state at the  beginning that he would be objective and would cover the  positions of various structures. We would like the people's  deputies, especially the factions, to cooperate with their  newspaper closely. It should reflect objectively all the events  that happen. Some deputies say that they even look at HOLOS with  caution, although it is the newspaper of the Supreme Council. It  does not matter who dislikes which news, but these views should  also be reflected in the newspaper.    [P. Movchan] Apparently, a public editorial board should be  put together, which would be formed on certain definite  principles: either along factional lines or in another manner.  However, let us not forget that the newspaper does not belong to  either the majority or the minority--it is a newspaper of the  Supreme Council, and the entire spectrum of political life  should exist in its pages. The ultimate task of both the  parliament and its organ is to facilitate the strengthening and  building of the Ukrainian state. This is the mainstay.    It appears to me that this newspaper needs to have a  supplement. As I see it, there is a lack of theoretical pages  within it, theoretical articles on a certain aspect of what is  going on in the state. I am certainly curious about the dubbing  situation. We have a state language. An altogether different  newspaper should exist for the Russian-speaking population.    Apart from everything else, a Russian newspaper is needed in  order to provide information on life in Ukraine in the CIS area.  Its nature might be that of a digest.    [V. Mukhin] I think that the Supreme Council and the  newspaper should cooperate and bring truthful information to the  reader as much as possible.</p>

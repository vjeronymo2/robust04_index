			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Food Markets FOOD markets are wonderful, exciting and evocative. The colours they generate, their scents and smells and bustle all paint a picture of how, not so long ago, we all used to shop. If you go with an open mind as to what to buy, markets can be inspirational and vividly demonstrate just how the year is evolving - from the first bundles of English asparagus to the first summer fruits (in France, the first cherry crop is still despatched from Ceret in the Pyrenees to the Elysee Palace) to the melon market of Cavaillon, to wild mushrooms and the onset of autumn and the truffle markets of Piedmont. Over the next few months Weekend FT food and drink writers will be visiting some eye-catching markets, starting this week with Giles MacDonogh in Venice . . .</p>

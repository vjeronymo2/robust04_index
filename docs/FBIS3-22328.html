The organization says that it has received a Russian report  according to which nuclear submarines to be scrapped from the  Russian Pacific Fleet are also being brought to a submarine  shipyard near Archangel. According to Bellona's information,  this concerns 150 submarines which have a total of 278 nuclear  reactors. The Norwegian environmental organization assumes that  Russia will continue dumping reactors into the Kara Sea in the  summer. According to Bellona, this is indicated by the fact,  among other things, that Russia did not sign the London treaty  banning the dumping of nuclear substances into the sea, which  became valid at the beginning of last week. Bellona today  published in Murmansk its extensive research report on  radio-active emissions in the Kola area.</p>

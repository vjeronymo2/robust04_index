			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Bosch workers agree to surrender fringe benefits ROBERT BOSCH, the electrical and engineering group, has struck a ground-breaking bargain with its German workforce which will cut employees' fringe benefits and other 'voluntary' payments by around DM180m (Pounds 72m) a year. The deal, announced yesterday, will hearten other leading industrial companies which are negotiating for similar payroll savings with engineering union officials. The Bosch settlement followed eight months of discussions and intermittent protest strikes aimed at reducing personnel costs by DM250m a year. The group has already acted to cut materials and capital costs by a similar amount. Around DM70m was saved in April when directors' and non-unionised employees' salaries were cut, and management unilaterally announced that a previously agreed 3 per cent rise for hourly-paid workers would apply only to the basic rate. Annual increments are usually applied to the total pay package. Yesterday's agreement included cuts in shift premiums and canteen subsidies, and spelt the end of interest-free home loans and spa cures at the company's expense. Although Bosch calculates that social, educational and other benefits and bonuses will still cost it DM750m a year, the settlement marks an important breakthrough in industry's efforts to restrain costs. Success at Bosch, Germany's leading vehicle component supplier, will raise hopes of progress in generally secret negotiations under way, especially in the motor industry. Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, has over the years negotiated a substantial array of costly benefits for its membership, which are now under scrutiny as management seeks to restore competitiveness. These include free travel to work, anniversary bonuses, cures for paintshop workers, beer allowances, extra sick pay and an extra month's payment at Christmas. Also under debate are the day-long workers' assemblies, usually held at least twice a year, in which production stops entirely. The opening of negotiations in the Daimler-Benz group has already been marked by protest strikes. On Tuesday this week more than half the workforce at its Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary downed tools for an hour. Similar moves by the government have also stirred unrest. IG Bau-Steine-Erden, the construction industry union, for example, has called a nationwide demonstration for this Saturday against Bonn's plans to cut benefits paid when site work is stopped by bad weather.</p>

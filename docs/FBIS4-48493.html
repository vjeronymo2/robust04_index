			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] In its veiled efforts to destroy democracy in  Angola, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]  government is seeking to silence the only voice opposed to the  regime -- Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel] --  and then use its disinformation apparatus to bamboozle the  Angolan and international opinion at will. How many times have  the Angolan and world opinion not been deceived by the news  media in the service of the MPLA government? How many times has  that news media not insulted those Angolans who do not subscribe  to the ideology of the ruling party? How many blatant  falsehoods carried by the Angola National Radio and the People's  Television of Angola have to be corrected by Vorgan?    Vorgan is here to tell the truth to the Angolan people.  Vorgan is here to inform the Angolan and international opinion  about the program of action of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] that the MPLA government wants to  silence. Vorgan is here to expose the historic crimes that men  in the service of Eduardo dos Santos commit daily against  Angolans. Vorgan can be received on your radios to  counterattack the dirty and slanderous propaganda disseminated  by the news media in the service of the totalitarian and  insensitive ruling party -- the MPLA. Vorgan is here to protect  the Angolan people and to challenge the rumors spread daily by  Eduardo dos Santos' gang who would like to see supporters of  UNITA and its leaders on the run.    Vorgan is here also to back other voices opposed to Jose  Eduardo dos Santos' totalitarian regime. Vorgan has for many  years now been the conduit of God's message to all Angolan  Christians. Vorgan is the link uniting all Angolans who want a  united and single Angola which is equal for all, in a real and  genuine democracy free of hatred, treason, and division.    Vorgan is the free voice of free Angolans. Only detractors  of democracy and dictators like the MPLA government leaders are  interested in silencing UNITA's radio station -- the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel -- in order to serve their  Machiavellian interests.    Forward with a free press! Long live peace, freedom, and  democracy! Long live our president, Dr. Savimbi!</p>

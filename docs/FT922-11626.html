			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Banco Santander offer adds to derivatives growth BANCO Santander de Negocios yesterday issued 5m warrants on the 10-year Spanish government bond, the latest sign of the growth of activity in derivative markets by Spanish banks. Earlier in the week, Banesto launched a similar transaction. The first such warrants were issued last year by Banco Bilbao Viscaya. The American-style call warrants issued by Banco Santander, which run for a year and a half, were authorised by the Spanish authorities. The deal, arranged with Kidder Peabody, was aimed at international investors, whose participation in the Spanish bond market has increased dramatically since the removal of withholding tax early last year. Growing participation by international banks, which actively trade the market, has helped boost liquidity. In addition to a growing market for warrants, both futures and options on Spanish government bonds are now traded on Meff, the Spanish derivatives exchange, and there is a broadening market in over-the-counter products. A handful of warrant issues on Spanish government bonds is currently awaiting approval from the Spanish authorities.</p>

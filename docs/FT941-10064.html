			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Roof bolts cleared in mine fall probe The Bilsthorpe Colliery accident last August in which three miners were killed was not caused by any defect in its roof-bolting system, according to a report into the accident published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive. The roof fall at the Nottinghamshire site occurred in a roadway being driven through coal close to an exhausted area. This practice is known in the industry as 'skin-to-skin' working. The report said the roof fall was caused by rock movement 'probably' triggered by 'the relatively high rate of advance of the working in the roadway'. It recommends stopping 'skin-to-skin' working. It exonerates the use of roof-bolts at Bilsthorpe, even suggesting their presence may have helped men to escape from the rock fall. Mr John Rimington, HSE director-general, said the accident had 'not been reasonably foreseeable'. The Health and Safety Commission welcomed the report but added that it was appointing Sir Bernard Crossland of Queen's University, Belfast, to 'hear publicly, any new or further views or evidence that may exist'. The commission will wait for that report before considering further action. British Coal welcomed the report's findings and said it was already implementing its recommendations. 'For many years BC has driven similar roadways as that at Bilsthorpe, particularly in the midlands, without major incident,' said a spokesman. 'All such developments have now been stopped'.</p>

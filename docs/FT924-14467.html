			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Personal View: How to repair the Anglo-German rift In the relationship between the British and Germans, something has gone badly awry. The primary source of discord is money. But currency matters are also questions of politics. As a result, the pound's collapse has sent the Anglo-German political barometer plunging. We must try to avoid the storm turning into a permanent climatic downturn. It is time that the British government and the Bank of England - as well as the newspapers in both countries - become aware of the political damage wrought by thoughtlessness on both sides. For some important causes of the dispute, we must turn to Germany. There are sharp discrepancies between the fiscal policies of the government and the monetary policy of the Bundesbank. The differences have their roots in Bonn's decision in 1990 - against the advice of the then Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl - to introduce the D-Mark into East Germany at a rate which amounted to a large revaluation of the East German mark. The apparently generous one-for-one conversion rate was one of the reasons for the speedy collapse of the East German economy, leading to large financial demands from the east and enormous German public-sector borrowing. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, stresses that growth in the borrowing requirement of German central government has been relatively small. At best, this is naive self-deception. If we include all the special funding vehicles introduced since unification, as well as the budgets of the states (Lander) and municipalities, it is clear that public-sector borrowing is still accelerating. This unparalleled call upon private savings both in Germany and abroad represents a burden on badly needed corporate investment and on residential construction. Additionally, since the proceeds of the loans are channelled above all into consumption in eastern Germany, long-term capital is effectively being converted into cash spent on consumer goods. The increase in money in circulation has understandably unsettled the Bundesbank, which long warned of the consequences of Bonn's apparently 'painless' fiscal policies. This was the fundamental reason for Mr Pohl's resignation last year. The Bundesbank has been trying to use high interest rates to keep money supply under control - without success, because high D-Mark interest rates have attracted considerable amounts of foreign liquidity to Germany. The Bundesbank has thus itself contributed to the increase in the money supply, and has also brought the D-Mark under revaluation pressure. Last month central banks sought, through massive intervention, to avoid the devaluation of other European currencies. In the case of sterling and the lira, this was unsuccessful. But the transactions of the Bundesbank and other central banks nonetheless led to a gross increase in domestic D-Mark liquidity (before allowing for money market sterilisation) of about DM100bn during the past few weeks. The Bundesbank council must now concede that its tight money policy has been counterproductive. Germany's monetary watchdog has bitten its own tail. The Bundesbank's monetary policies are powerless to counter the inflationary impact of Germany's overall public sector deficits. With record interest rates, however, the Bundesbank can deepen the recession. A dramatic resignation of the Bundesbank president would, perhaps, do more to bring about a fiscal about-turn than a continuation of monetary strangulation. The present gulf between monetary and fiscal policy is unparalleled since the foundation of the federal republic in 1949. The main blame lies with the federal government. It must recognise that budgetary spending, subsidies and tax allowances must all be cut - in areas from defence expenditure to agriculture. If further funding is still needed, then tax increases must take priority over a further rise in indebtedness. A vital condition for this change in course is the successful conclusion of the 'solidarity pact' Chancellor Helmut Kohl is trying to negotiate with trade unions and employers to hold down the costs of unity. What are the lessons for the UK? With enormous effort and sacrifice, Britain won the war against Hitler's Greater Germany. Since then, however, Britain's economic prowess, relative to international competitors, has gradually but continuously fallen. France, Germany and other countries long ago exceeded its per capita economic output. Britain's chancellor has made 'speculators' responsible for pressure on sterling. He also blamed Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, whom he accused of provoking speculation through indiscreet comments. This sparked off a journalistic and political broadside against Germany; the German counter-fire was hardly less wounding. It is true that, on the money markets and foreign exchanges, speculators are indeed at work. Constant rumour-mongering leads to a climate bordering on mass hysteria. That is one reason why fixed exchange rates are preferable. Such a system was in force until 1973 for the entire industrialised world. In a modified form, fixed rates have also been in place since 1979 in Europe as a result of the European Monetary System. Of course, the rules of such a system foresee occasional changes in parities when economic fundamentals are no longer in equilibrium. Up to last month's realignment, EMS governments kept exchange rates fixed for several years, above all for prestige reasons  -a motivation which particularly guided the British government. Mr John Major and his chancellor are not magicians. In the short time since Britain became a full EMS member in October 1990, they have not been able to improve the fundamental state of the British economy. So their resolute attempt to maintain the sterling parity was doomed, sooner or later, to fail  -corresponding to the pattern of the past 40 years. I only hope the search for German scapegoats soon gives way to good old-fashioned British commonsense. The Germans must also find their way back to the path of reason. They must learn to avoid arrogance. They must restrain themselves from making indiscreet remarks in interviews, even when these comments happen to be factually correct. Criticism may be directed at the UK government. But I must emphasise that, as a consequence of their budget policies, the German chancellor and his finance minister are also in the dock. The Bundesbank has to realise that the rise in the D-Mark is damaging Germany's exports. And the central bank's president and vice-president must learn the art of discretion; they have handed too many cheap arguments to British opponents of Maastricht. Above all, everyone must realise that monetary policy is also foreign policy. If we are to avoid further misfortune, all concerned should conduct themselves accordingly.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by UK Science Minister William Waldegrave on 11 </F> February 94, place not given: "Withdrawal of Gene Patents Good  For the UK"]    [Text] The withdrawal of patents for cDNA sequences for  unknown functions will encourage further research into this  important area, separating the exploratory research phase from  the exploration phase, Mr Waldegrave said today.    He was speaking following today's decision by the Medical  Research Council (MRC) and the US National Institutes of Health  (NIH) to withdraw their patent applications for cDNA sequences  of unknown function, filed in 1991.  <H5>  Mr Waldegrave said: </H5>   "The MRC and NIH patent applications were filed in order to  protect the interests of the UK and US taxpayers, with least  damage to the international research effort in genome mapping  which requires the free flow of information.    "However, The Medical Research Council, with the support of  the Government, has always argued that these applications should  not be granted. I welcome the co-operation between the UK and  the US on this important issue and look forward to further  developments in this important area of research."    This announcement backs up MRC's decision in October 1993  not  to file any further patent application on newly-obtained cDNA  sequences of unknown function unless accompanied by knowledge of  the gene function.  <H5>  Sir Dai Rees, Secretary to the MRC said: </H5>   "We feel this withdrawal of the patents is a correct step,  and we are delighted to be able to co-ordinate our actions with  those of the NIH."  <H5>  Note To Editors </H5>    Further information on this announcement can be obtained  from: Press Office; Medical Research Council; 20 Park Crescent;  London; W1N 4AL; Tel: 071 636 5422; Fax: 071 436 2665    Issued by: Press Office; Office of Public Service and  Science; Cabinet Office; 70 Whitehall; London; SW1A 2AS; Tel:  071 270 0207/0393; Out of hours telephone 0399 1133 and ask for  pager number 721338</p>

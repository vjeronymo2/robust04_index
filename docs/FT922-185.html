			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Swiss estate agents excluded from Spain The Rome Treaty's right of establishment rules may not be relied on by non-Community nationals to override national laws of an EC member state, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The case, which involved the same Spanish estate agency law considered by the ECJ in a recent case involving the right of British estate agents to set up in Spain (FT, May 12), highlights the benefits enjoyed under the Rome Treaty right of establishment rules by EC nationals. Mrs Michele Laderer, a Swiss national, was prosecuted for practising as an estate agent in Alicante without the requisite professional qualifications and relevant authorisation from the Spanish authorities. The ECJ ruled that EC law did not prohibit national laws reserving certain activities to estate agents. But the Court would not answer the question whether particular aspects of the Spanish rules were compatible with Community law as the question arose in proceedings concerning a Swiss national. Mrs Laderer was not a national of a member state and therefore was not entitled to take advantage of the rules relating to freedom of establishment within the EC. C-147/91: Ministerio Fiscal v Michele Ferrer Laderer ECJ 2CH, June 25 1992. British Gas and Tachometers In the latest of a long line of cases involving tachographs referred to Luxembourg by UK courts, the ECJ last week imposed a very narrow interpretation on an English exception to the general EC rule that all vehicles used for carrying passengers or goods must be fitted with a 'spy in the cab'. English law, in implementing EC law, generally prohibits the carriage of persons or goods in vehicles not fitted with tachographs, but contains an exception for vehicles used in connection with certain public services including those relating to the supply of gas. In a case involving British Gas vehicles used to carry products connected both with the supply and distribution of gas, and the selling of gas appliances, the Court ruled that the exception related to public services only and the selling of gas appliances to the public was not a public service. Vehicles used for both purposes must be fitted with tachographs. British Gas has an exclusive right to supply and distribute gas, whereas it competes with other companies in selling gas appliances to the public, the Court said. If British Gas were allowed to enjoy the benefit of the exception for its gas appliance activities, it would have an advantage over its competitors who must fit tachographs to their vehicles. The ECJ said it was irrelevant that internal UK legislation contained provisions similar to the EC provisions on driving time, breaks and rest periods. British Gas would still have a competitive advantage from saving the cost of installing and maintaining tachographs in their vehicles. The court interpreted the public service exception to mean that only those vehicles wholly and exclusively used in connection with the production, transport or distribution of gas or for the maintenance of installations used for that purpose could benefit from the tachograph exemption. C-116/91: Licensing Authority South Eastern Traffic Area v British Gas plc, ECJ 2CH, June 25 1992. Greek cash register restrictions removed In enforcement proceedings brought by the Commission against Greece, the ECJ held that Greek rules on the certification and purchase of cash registers infringed the free movement of goods rules in the Rome Treaty. The Greek law prohibited the sale of cash registers in Greece if the percentage of Greek value added to them was less than 35 per cent. The European Commission twice asked for information and explanations from the Greek government. After two years, the Greek government gave the information reque-sted. This, however, was outside the time period allowed by the Commission for replying. As the Greek government did not contest that the law, which has since been repealed, was contrary to Community law, the Court had little difficulty in finding an infringement. Moreover, the behaviour of the national authorities, in failing to reply in time to the questions put by the Commission, constituted a breach of Greece's general obligations under the Rome Treaty. C-137/91: Commission v Greece, ECJ FC, June 24 1992. Uniform EC law In a highly technical case relating to the determination of the price of certain quantities of olive oil stolen while in intervention storage in Italy, the ECJ reiterated the principles applicable to a legal situation purely internal to one member state. Where the relevant rules to be taken into account were EC provisions, it was essential that these provisions were uniformly interpreted by the ECJ notwithstanding the internal situation to which they were being applied. C-88/91: Federazione italiana dei consorzi agrari v Azienda di stato per gli interventi nel mercato agricolo, ECJ 4CH, June 25 1992. Italian Lottery ECJ President Ole Due has refused to review an earlier interim order made by him that Italy should take the necessary measures to suspend national provisions giving the concession for the automatisation of the national lottery to a particular consortium. The president held that Italy had not provided evidence of a material change in circumstances as required under the ECJ's Rules of Procedure for a successful review. The position in Italy had changed, to the extent that the national provisions had been amended. However, the public tender and the grant of the concession to the consortium in question were still irregular in terms of Community law. The basis for the original order requested by the Commission remained unchanged, therefore. C-272/91R: Commission v Italy, ECJ, Order of the President June 12 1992.</p>

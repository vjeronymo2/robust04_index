			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Newly-appointed Justice  Minister Hiroshi Nakai is known as an advocate of environmental  problems in the House of Representatives.    Nakai, a 51-year-old lower house legislator of the  Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP), replaced Shigeto Nagano, 71, Saturday  after Nagano resigned over his remarks denying the 1937 Nanjing  massacre and Japan's aggressive role in World War II.    Nakai has served as the DSP's deputy secretary general and  as  chairman of the lower house Committee on Commerce and Industry.    Nakai, born in the Chinese northeastern province of Jilin,  was elected to the lower house for the first time in 1976 and  has since been reelected six times from the No. 1 constituency  of Mie Prefecture. Before embarking on his career as a  politician, Nakai worked as a secretary for his father who was a  lower house legislator of the Social Democratic Party.</p>

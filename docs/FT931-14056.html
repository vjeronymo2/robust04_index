			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plan for India's biggest copper smelter STERLITE INDUSTRIES, an Indian copper rod producer, is to develop the country's largest copper smelter project at a cost of Rs7bn (Pounds 16m). The plant, on a 550-acre site at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, is scheduled to start commercial production at its 60,000 tonnes-a-year design capacity by July 1995. Annual capacity could rise to 100,000 tonnes for an additional Rs1.5bn investment. MIM Holdings of Australia will supply copper smelting and refining technologies to Sterlite, and arrange the import of necessary equipment. The main plant and machinery will, however, be manufactured in India to specifications provided by Davy Power Gas. The Australian company has supplied similar smelter technology to 15 operations around the world and says they are performing well. By the time the Sterlite smelter, the first in the private sector, goes on stream, Indian demand for copper will have increased to 200,000 tonnes from 150,000 tonnes. The government-owned monopoly Hindustan Copper produces only about 45,000 tonnes. India's annual copper imports amount to more than 100,000 tonnes. The country has more than 8m tonnes of copper reserves. But the copper content in ore of most deposits is less than 1 per cent - with small traces of precious metals - making the mining of ore for producing copper economically unviable. To maintain the viability of Hindustan Copper, the federal government imposed a duty of nearly 90 per cent on imported copper. Sterlite's policy of producing copper from imported concentrate has a better chance of proving profitable.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Adidas sale gives Pentland Pounds 47m gain PENTLAND, the UK-based sporting goods distributor which last month pulled out of negotiations for the purchase of sports shoe maker Adidas, has sold back its interest in the company to Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) SA, the holding vehicle for the controversial French businessman Mr Bernard Tapie. Pentland said it made a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 47m on the investment and related foreign exchange gains. Mr Stephen Rubin, chairman, said he was disappointed the Adidas takeover had failed but 'delighted' the stake had been sold at a profit. In August last year Pentland paid Pounds 46m for 20.05 per cent of BTF GmbH, the German holding company which owns 95 per cent of Adidas. In July this year it said it would buy the remaining shares in Adidas from Mr Tapie's holding vehicle. But three months later it halted the process claiming it had discovered 'serious problems' which were never spelled out, apparently because of confidentiality agreements. The sale back to BTF frees that company from certain restrictions imposed when Pentland took the 20 per cent stake. Pent-land's stake carried 25 per cent of the voting rights and also gave Pentland first right of refusal for any sale of Adidas shares. Mr Tapie was believed to be short of cash and a spokeswoman for BTF was unable to comment on how the deal was financed. BTF was left with a FFr900m (Pounds 109m) cash surplus after its asset disposals in August. Pentland's stake was sold back for Pounds 61m, giving a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 13m after acquisition and disposal costs of about Pounds 2m. The company also made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 34m on foreign exchange dealings carried out in expectation the full acquisition would go though. The profits mainly stem from the rise in the D-Mark compared with sterling following the UK's withdrawal from the ERM. Profits on the deal take Pentland's net cash holding to more than Pounds 300m. The shares gained 8p to 125p. A London analyst said this rise reflected relief that the sale of the stake to BTF removed the possibility of recrimination between the two parties.</p>

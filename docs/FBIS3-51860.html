			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Indians and peasants of Chiapas have converged on  San Cristobal de las Casas for the Second Meeting of the State  Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [Consejo Estatal de  Organizaciones Indigenas y Campesinas]. On behalf of dozens of  Indian and peasant organizations in Chiapas State, Marcelino  Gomez Nunez, a leader of the National Coordinating Board of the  Ayala Plan, invited President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to visit  Ocosingo or San Cristobal de Las Casas as soon as possible. The  visit would allow the president to get first-hand knowledge of  the situation from those affected and offer him the opportunity  to encourage the people to find a solution to the problems  facing them after the New Year's conflict.    The meeting between Indians and peasants and Social  Development Secretary Carlos Rojas took place at a warehouse  complex known as El Pajal on the outskirts of San Cristobal, on  the road to Rancho Nuevo. Eraclio Zepeda and Andres Fabrega,  members of the National Commission for the Overall Development  and Social Justice for Indian People were present, as well as  Rigoberta Menchu, Beatriz Paredes, and Jose Narro Robles. All  Indian and peasant leaders and representatives repeatedly  expressed their desire for progress through dialogue. The  leaders asked Secretary Carlos Rojas to set up a meeting between  the Indian and peasant organizations and Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis in an attempt to reach agreements that will  guarantee justice in Chiapas. One of the more important  proposals made during the meeting was the establishment of a  produce wholesale program for the conflict area.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Sex, religion, politics - and acting / Interview with actor Gerard Murphy IN 1982, the opening production at London's Barbican Arts Centre was Trevor Nunn's Henry IV, in which Gerard Murphy made an achingly adolescent Hal. Ten years on he returns to the Barbican, playing under Adrian Noble as Oedipus in Sophocles' Theban trilogy, which is currently previewing in London after last year's successful season at Stratford-upon-Avon's Swan. It opens at The Pit on September 10. It is Murphy's first venture into classical tragedy, although he has appeared opposite Glenda Jackson in two later reworkings, O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra at the Glasgow Citizens and Racine's Phaedra at the Old Vic. He is acutely aware of what is lost in translation: 'Even in Timberlake Wertenbaker's excellent version, I miss the music of the Greek. No one has ever captured it. Even Yeats made the decision only to write the choruses in poetry, the rest in prose.' But the production style is no mere heightened naturalism; he describes how Noble has aimed to capture the spirit of the original. 'It's easy to forget that all the plays, apart from Oedipus at Colonus, were first performed at festivals. They had the jubilance we associate today with musicals. Three actors would come and join a group of amateurs who'd been preparing the choruses for 18 months - like the local operatic society rehearsing the numbers for a show.' In today's theatre, where music with everything often seems to be the watchword, a far more daunting element may well be the theology. 'The plays are inhabited by the gods. The religious element is crucial, and it's equally crucial that it's not Christian. Oedipus has to reject his son to fulfil his destiny; it's essential to show that this is the right thing to do in the religion of the play. . . But then all interesting plays are about sex, religion and politics, which as a Northern Irish gay Catholic interests me a lot.' The three plays, Oedipus Tyrannos, Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, were not written as a trilogy - indeed the latter, which is the last to be performed, was written first - but Murphy finds the juxtaposition fascinating, both for actor and audience. He relishes the chance to age in the course of an evening and, like Derek Jacobi, is one of the rare actors who is equally convincing young and old. If the age range of Oedipus is great, the emotional range is still greater. It is the latest in a long line of mammothly taxing roles which have led from his salad days at the Glasgow Citizens through Webster, Williams, Marlowe, Sartre, Genet and countless Shakespeares for the RSC. He is one of few younger actors who is happy to work on large stages. Though he talks of his love for comedy and the camera, it is always the classics to which he returns. 'I'm very attached to heightened work because I think it's dying, and it shouldn't. One reason a lot of actors say that they don't ever want to do the big parts in big spaces is because it's so exhausting. But I need it. I'm a drug addict and my drug is adrenalin; as soon as the adrenalin tap is switched off, I collapse. And I know nothing that gives you more adrenalin than to play big roles on big stages.' But the cost is clear. 'With a part like Oedipus, I have to understand and at some level touch his emotions during the evening. Simply to do it technically, which any skilled actor can do, is cheating. I've learnt most about acting from great singers: Bette Midler, Van Morrison and, especially, Lena Horne. They make every audience feel as if it's special. I have to do the same. I have to expose my emotions. That can make you loved or hated, because some people don't like seethings that are so raw.' He learnt his credo, along with his craft, at the Citizens, which he joined in the late Seventies after studying music, his first love, in Belfast. There was no theatrical background in his family, who were all sailors and farmers, but 'Ireland is very theatrical anyway.' The Celtic connection was maintained in Glasgow, where the artistic triumvirate of Giles Havergal, Robert David Macdonald and Philip Prowse became his mentors. The work was famously challenging and he was encouraged to take as many risks in his acting as the company took in its repertoire. Indeed Havergal's belief that, as a subsidised theatre, they had a duty to be adventurous has influenced him ever since. And, though he has worked in it almost exclusively and for the past decade the RSC has been his second spiritual home, it is the subsidised theatre's timidity that he sees as the cause of the current malaise. 'Theatre is becoming terminally safe. Everything is constrained by profitability. The RSC and the National were built as centres of excellence - and there's a lot of excellence there - but what they really are are centres of success.' Like other actors in their late thirties, and some notoriously younger, he has diversified into directing, with Deathwatch, The Maids and a highly acclaimed Edward II for the RSC. This is not fuelled by dissatisfaction with established directors but respect for them: 'Acting is a bit like prostitution, which is not a job I demean at all. Although I know that many disagree violently, I truly believe that it's the actor's job to do the director's version of a play, even if it means making a fool of oneself. And so to do a production myself is a great joy.' In March he goes to Japan to direct and design The Merchant of Venice. He is rapidly learning Japanese, as much to socialise with the actors in the pub as to discourse with them in the rehearsal room. 'I originally intended to do a very visual production; but then they can do that so much better. So I thought I'd do a Western-style production, which meant getting to grips with the text.' He has commissioned a new translation. There are 42 versions of the play in Japanese and each is in some way unsatisfactory; generations of elocution students would be dismayed to discover their favourite speech transcribed as 'Mercy doesn't come through muslin, but falls directly from top to bottom.' Acting remains his primary focus: 'I love my job. It's only because art in this country is so undervalued that people like me are put in the position of wondering whether what we do is worthless. I love going to the theatre: I can feel more revived from that than anything, whether I laugh, think or cry.' A welcome affirmation from an actor who boldly breaks rules and boundaries, giving reality to the largest of emotions and clarity to the most complex of men.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Lira at record low amid political fears FEARS that talks between Italian political parties on broadening the ruling coalition could undermine Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's eight-month-old government yesterday pushed the lira to a record low of L950 to the D-Mark. The parties are discussing a broader coalition to provide greater authority for reform of Italy's unmanageable system of proportional representation. A parliamentary commission has proposed a new first-past-the-post system for electing the majority of the two houses. But big differences remain on the details and a strong government is needed to cope with the question of whether to go along with calls for a referendum on the reform. The coalition, of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, has only a narrow parliamentary majority, and increasingly lacks legitimacy as Italy's political class falls foul of the ever-widening corruption scandals. The proposals for widening the coalition centre on bringing in the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the small Republican Party and the populist Lombard League. The PDS is making tough demands, urging a softening of the austerity budget to halt rising unemployment, while Mr Umberto Bossi's the Lombard League wants a commitment to early elections. Both parties, and the Republicans, would also prefer to join a government with a new prime minister. Magistrates yesterday told Mr Gianni De Michelis, former foreign minister and currently deputy head of the Socialist party, that he was under investigation over two incidents on top of the allegations of kickbacks in the Veneto region for which he is being investigated, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The new allegations concern Italy's aid programme to developing countries and the investigation into alleged political corruption in Milan.</p>

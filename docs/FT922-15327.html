			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / German companies see upturn next year GERMAN companies are expecting the current downturn in the domestic economy to come to an end next year, according to a poll of 401 mainly large companies conducted by the IFO, the Munich-based economics research institute. The details of the poll, published today, suggest that German businessmen are confident that by the summer of next year they will have put high interest rates, poor profitability and high wage demands firmly behind them. Manufacturing companies are expecting a nominal 4 per cent growth in domestic sales and a 7 per cent rise in exports for the whole of next year. To help meet expected demand they are planning to increase investment by 7 per cent next year, compared to just 1 per cent planned for the current year. The poll shows that German companies expect net production to fall by 2 per cent during the first and second quarters of the current year. Mr Helmut Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice-president, yesterday voiced anxiety as to whether there was enough political will in Europe to ensure the success of economic and monetary union. He predicted that widely divergent financial policies among EC members could test monetary policy and Emu 'to the limit'.</p>

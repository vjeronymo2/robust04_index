			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity returns to black with Pounds 5.8m Trade Indemnity Group, the credit insurer, reported a return to profit in 1993 and a positive view of the current year. The shares rose 4p to 94p. The company is forecasting business failures, as reported by its customers, will fall 10 per cent during 1994, following a 26 per cent drop to 6,303 (8,470) last year. TIG, which is 77 per cent owned by a group of leading European insurance companies, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m (losses of Pounds 4.9m). The proposed final dividend is 0.5p, its first payment since 1990. Earnings per share were 4.5p (losses 1p). Gross premium income from continuing operations fell marginally to Pounds 145m (Pounds 147m), reflecting a decline in customers' sales levels. Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said premium income increased significantly in the second half, and had continued to grow in 1994. There was also a 24 per cent increase in UK export insurance business. Net claims paid fell 17 per cent to Pounds 48.2m, enabling a release of Pounds 1.7m to be made to the profit and loss account.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Carmaker ratings under pressure THE CREDIT quality of the world automotive industry is likely to remain under pressure through to the mid-1990s because of slow demand for new cars, shortening product life cycles and stiffened global competition, according to Moody's, the US credit rating agency. In its annual report on the motor industry, Moody's says there will be greater variation in the financial strength of stronger and weaker players in the US, Europe and Japan. American manufacturers are expected to face a particularly difficult time. The report says General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler face huge worker healthcare and retiree benefit costs and will continue to have significant disadvantages relative to Japanese companies which have set up plants in the US. The Japanese share of the US car market, currently running at 31 per cent, is expected to continue rising as Japanese plants in North America gear up to full production. However, 'renewed competitiveness of US automakers, combined with the diversion of Japanese expansion in Europe, should slow the pace of Japanese expansion in North America during the second half of the decade or earlier'. The most vulnerable US manufacturer will be Chrysler, which has the lowest Moody's rating (B2) of any of the world's leading car groups. The report says the company's recent equity sales will help support operations while the company's new LH range of cars are introduced this year. But it adds that unless these new models 'achieve strong market acceptance, a strategic alliance may prove critical to Chrysler's long-term survival'. In each of the major markets, it adds, companies must invest large sums on new models and production efficiency at a time of slow demand and increasingly global competition. This will be a particular challenge to medium-sized manufacturers and those with primarily national sales. The industry's average credit quality, which slipped from Moody's Aa range in the mid-1980s to A2 now, is forecast to deteriorate to A3 over the next year or two.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARCH FOR ANCESTORS LEADS MANY TO UTAH;  </P> <P> GENEALOGY: EVERY DAY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING THEIR ROOTS PORE OVER THE  EXTENSIVE GLOBAL RECORDS IN THE MORMON CHURCH'S FAMILY HISTORY LIBRARY.  </P> <P> For more than a decade Paul Isaacson has labored to save the souls of his dead  ancestors, patiently searching miles of microfilm and stacks of catalogues in  the Mormon Church's Family History Library.  </P> <P> Mormon missionary work isn't limited to the living, and each day thousands of  the faithful flock to the library, the world's largest repository of  genealogical records, to fulfill the church's determination to baptize every  person who ever lived.  </P> <P> "There's something spiritual to it," said Isaacson, a Mormon who often devotes  his days off and evenings to genealogical research. "Also, it's your roots,  your family. It's kind of like a mystery, trying to track someone down. It's a  puzzle to be solved."  </P> <P> But as the popularity of tracing one's roots has grown, the Family History  Library of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has become a prime  resource for non-Mormon professional and amateur genealogists.  </P> <P> Of the 3,000 people who use the library each day, about 40% are non-Mormon,  said Tom Daniels, the library's director of information. Often they come by the  busload in tours organized by genealogical societies from throughout the United  States and Europe.  </P> <P> The most recent survey, conducted in the winter of 1988, indicated that senior  citizens made up about 40% of the library's users -- a figure consistent with  other surveys of recent years, Daniels said.  </P> <P> Seniors also make up the majority of about 250 church volunteers who supplement  the library's 200 full-time staff members. Daniels said the seniors are  "called," or asked by the church to work at the library for a limited time.  </P> <P> Use of the library is free, and those who come have access to birth and death  records of an estimated 1.5 billion to 2 billion people, culled from the  archives of about 100 nations.  </P> <P> Business is sufficiently brisk that the church's genealogical department, which  operates the library, has outgrown a three-story building constructed five  years ago across the street from the Salt Lake Temple in downtown Salt Lake  City.  </P> <P> Several of the department's divisions are housed in an office building a block  away, and the library will expand to occupy a portion of the old Hotel Utah,  which is being renovated to house a chapel and administrative offices.  </P> <P> Daniels said library usage has increased 60% since 1984 -- the greatest period  of growth since the early 1970s, when Alex Haley's book "Roots" turned  thousands of people to genealogy as a hobby.  </P> <P> Daniels said he cannot explain the latest surge in genealogical activity. The  church has always encouraged its members to research their ancestry and submit  names of their forebears to temples, where such ordinances as baptism are  performed by living proxies.  </P> <P> But in recent years more people have been taking advantage of the archives, and  that may have induced more church members to get involved.  </P> <P> "Why the large number of non-Mormons are coming, I don't know. Maybe it's just  a natural increase in hobbyists," he said.  </P> <P> Mormons believe that spirits of dead people should have the opportunity to  accept Mormonism in the afterlife. Members are encouraged to have the faith's  ordinances performed for all their ancestors in the hope that they will embrace  the faith.  </P> <P> The doctrinal injunction for genealogical work is strong. The church's founder,  Joseph Smith, told his followers more than 100 years ago, "The greatest  responsibility in this world that God has lain upon us is to seek after our  dead."  </P> <P> The church has taken Smith's charge seriously. About 200 photographers are  regularly dispatched overseas to photograph records of birth, death and census  records in any country that will permit it.  </P> <P> Records have been copied extensively in Europe. More recently the collection  effort has shifted to Latin America and Asia.  </P> <P> For eight years church photographers have been copying Chinese records,  including some lines that reach back more than 1,000 years.  </P> <P> "They're far superior, far more accurate, than European records," Daniels said.  "In Oriental records, 65 generations (of continuous record-keeping) are not  uncommon. In Europe, you're lucky to find 10."  </P> <P> To ensure that nothing is lost, master copies of the microfilm are kept in the  church's Granite Mountain Records Vault, carved deep into a mountainside about  20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Designed to withstand a nuclear explosion, the vault features an  archive-quality air filtering system, a complete microfilm processing  laboratory and six storage rooms, each 200 feet long and 25 feet high.  </P> <P> Ready to process records as they arrive from overseas is a library staff that  collectively is fluent in nearly every major language. On the library floor,  staff linguists are available to assist patrons.  </P> <P> "There's nothing comparable to the library in terms of its comprehensive  nature," said Jay Hall, director of Global Research, a Salt Lake City-based  professional genealogical service affiliated with Everton Publishing, which  produces a directory of genealogical sources called the Genealogical Helper.  </P> <P> Hall said 98% of his business is with non-Mormons living outside of Utah.  Likewise, most of the Genealogical Helper's 50,000 subscribers are not Mormon  and do not live in Utah.  </P> <P> "There's a vast amount of interest," Hall said. "A lot of people think it's  totally fascinating to learn about their ancestors. It gives them a feeling of  heritage. For the professional, the most important thing is to have the  detective feeling.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like the thrill of the hunt."  </P></p>

Besides former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislators are believed to have  exercised their influence around late 1991 to bail out Kajima  from a possible criminal charge over the bid-ridding case in  Saitama Prefecture, the sources said.    Nakamura, 44, was arrested Friday on suspicion of taking a  10  million yen bribe from Kajima in January 1992.    Nakamura is suspected of taking the money for exerting his  influence as deputy head of an antimonopoly lobby to help block  the possible accusation by the FTC. The LDP was in power at  that time.    Prosecutors are likely to question Kajima executives  including Chairman Rokuro Ishikawa within this week in a bid to  probe the whole picture of Kajima's political maneuvering over  the case, they added.    The prosecutors also plan to question Takashi Inoue, an  opposition LDP member of the House of Councillors, as a witness  in connection with the bribery case involving the bid-rigging  affair.    Prosecutors intend to prove a statement by Kajima's former  vice president, 67-year-old Shinji Kiyoyama, who claimed he  asked several Diet members, including Inoue and Nakamura, to  help his company.    The sources said soon after the FTC made the second round of  on-the-spot inspections in October 1991 on companies involved in  the bid-rigging scheme, Kiyoyama asked Nakamura to dissuade then  FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa from filing the criminal accusation.    Besides Nakamura, Upper House member Inoue also met Umezawa  in late 1991 trying to help block the accusation, the sources  said.    Around them some 10 LDP legislators from both houses  separately met senior FTC officials in a bid to ask about the  progress of the investigation, the sources said.    The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an  accusation with prosecutors and instead ordered the contractors  to stop the collusive activities.</p>

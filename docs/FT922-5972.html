			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Japanese industrial output declines further JAPAN'S industrial production fell last month for the seventh month in a row, reflecting the continuing weakness in the country's economy. Industrial output fell 5.5 per cent compared with the month in 1991, according to figures published yesterday by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti). Despite the decline in production, inventories rose 6.2 per cent year-on-year. A senior official from the ministry said the figures indicated that the current economic downturn could last longer than had been expected. The government - including Miti - has been forecasting a recovery in the economy in the second half of the year. If inventory levels remain high, companies will be unwilling to raise output in time for the government's hopes to be realised. Mr Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming, the securities house, said yesterday's figures were an unpleasant surprise. 'Production is falling but inventories are still rising. I don't know anyone who expected that at this stage.' On a month-to-month seasonally-adjusted basis, Japanese industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent, the first increase in seven months. However, shipments fell 0.5 per cent, indicating that demand is still weak. After falling steadily since the beginning of the year on a month-to-month basis, inventory levels did not change at all in April. The index of inventories to sales rose 0.7 per cent.</p>

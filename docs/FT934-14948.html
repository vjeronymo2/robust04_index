			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Nine arrested in customs raid NINE people were yesterday arrested in dawn raids by customs officers following an investigation into insolvencies, including some linked to London and Provincial Factors, the debt trading company which collapsed owing almost Pounds 7m in March. About 70 officers took part in Operation Garden which followed an eight-month investigation. They seized several vanloads of papers and computers from six business premises in west London. Mr Michael Rowan, 44, of Hampton, Middlesex, was charged with evading payments of value added tax - thought to be in the region of Pounds 2m  - under section 39 (3) of the 1983 VAT Act. He was being held overnight and will appear at City Magistrates Court today. Customs and Excise investigations division released the other eight men on police bail pending further investigation. The collapse of London and Provincial Factors surprised other companies in the industry. Debt trading companies - known as factors - provide services ranging from taking over management of clients' sales ledgers to lending them a percentage of the value of their invoices. Clients are usually liable for bad debts and it is rare for a factor to go bust. At least five companies, which were all clients of LPF, are known to have gone into liquidation since July 1990, owing more than Pounds 3m to the factoring company, according to liquidators' estimates. LPF's collapse has prompted the Association of British Factors and Discounters to urge the Bank of England to regulate independent factors more tightly. The association's members account for more than 90 per cent of the industry's turnover. LPF, now in the hands of receivers, is not a member.</p>

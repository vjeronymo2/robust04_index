			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' GROUND CREW AIMING TO BAT 1,000;  </P> <P> STATISTICS: PRO BOWL LINEMEN DETERMINED TO HELP GREG BELL GAIN THE 73 YARDS  NEEDED TO JOIN 1,000-YARD CLUB.  </P> <P> Here's a standing headline for the 1980s: Rams Place Three Offensive Linemen in  Pro Bowl.  </P> <P> It happened again this week, only this time it raised some eyebrows. The Rams'  line, so long a faceless bureau of impressive rushing statistics, faces an  identity crisis. It enters Sunday's season finale against the New England  Patriots blocking for a tailback who might not reach 1,000 yards for the  season.  </P> <P> This isn't DiMaggio's streak here, but the Rams are working on seven  consecutive seasons of placing someone in the 1,000-yard club.  </P> <P> Greg Bell needs 73 yards against the Patriots to keep it alive. He hasn't  gained that many in one game in seven weeks. Don't count him out yet, Bell  insists.  </P> <P> Still, be advised: This is John Robinson's 14th season as a coach, his seventh  with the Rams after seven years at USC. Guess how many times he hasn't had a  1,000-yard rusher in his backfield?  </P> <P> Robinson guessed none. Actually, it happened during his last year at USC, 1982,  when Todd Spencer led the Trojans with 596 yards. You remember what Robinson  did next. He left USC to start another streak.  </P> <P> Seven years later, the Rams' running game, once the fabric of their existence,  is run of the mill. The team is averaging 111 net rushing yards a game, four  below the league average.  </P> <P> In 1984, Eric Dickerson averaged 131.5 yards on his own.  </P> <P> Some blame Bell for the decline -- a natural choice. Yet the Rams averaged 125  yards in 1988 with him in the backfield, Bell gaining 1,212 yards to finish  fourth in the league.  </P> <P> In fact, most of the running holes have been merely cracks this season. At  times, Bell would have been better off carrying a pickax.  </P> <P> Yet, there has been no real panic among the Ram linemen, no calling for heads.  Why? Because the Rams are 10-5 and headed for the playoffs, barring an  unexpected attack of cold feet in New England.  </P> <P> Still, it surprised some Wednesday when tackle Jackie Slater, center Doug Smith  and guard Tom Newberry were named to the NFC Pro Bowl squad.  </P> <P> Were the selections made on reputations alone?  </P> <P> "Personally, my year wasn't an outstanding year, by any means," Smith said  Thursday. "But it kind of depends on how everyone else in the league performs.  There's a lot of variables involved in it."  </P> <P> Newberry argues that the line only pleads guilty to changing with the times.  Where they once built their reputations as run-blockers for the team's former  star, Dickerson, they've now become more proficient pass-blockers to protect  quarterback Jim Everett, the present and future star.  </P> <P> It seems a logical progression.  </P> <P> "Our pass protection has been better this year than it's ever been," Newberry  said. "The big emphasis now is on pass-rushers, and a lot of emphasis is being  put on them in the media. I think maybe the pass-blockers are getting more  respect from the pass-rushers, by doing a good job against them."  </P> <P> The running game will probably never be what it was because the Rams will not  likely be graced with another back the caliber of Dickerson. Besides, with  Everett, who has time to run?  </P> <P> The Rams have become a finesse team that rarely practices in full pads, once a  midweek tradition to reaffirm their physical style. Today, three of their  linemen -- Smith, Slater and Irv Pankey -- are well into their 30s, so some  preservation techniques are welcomed.  </P> <P> The result? The Rams aren't running as much or as well.  </P> <P> "The biggest adjustment is that we're not as sore on Mondays anymore," said  Slater, dean of the line at 35. "So it's been real smooth. We strive to have  balance on our line and we're going to constantly strive to run the football.  We feel like we have to run the football to be successful. I think we kind of  got back to doing some of that this past week (against the New York Jets). If  we're going to be where we want to be when this is all done, we're going to  have to run the football well from this point on."  </P> <P> Slater hasn't been able to pinpoint the problem.  </P> <P> "A lot of things have gone wrong," he said. "You can't put your finger on one  particular thing. But I think we've got to do it. We will do it."  </P> <P> Smith said you can't help think pass when that's all you do.  </P> <P> "We kind of just started doing it, throwing the ball a lot on first down," he  said. "It kind of gets a bit frustrating, but we've always been a good  pass-blocking team. Now, we're just doing it more often."  </P> <P> Another reason could be the strategies employed by opposing defenses. Despite  the undeniable success of the Rams' passing game, teams persist in stopping  their running game with eight- and nine-man defensive fronts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Rams are averaging 263 yards through the air.  </P> <P> Bell suggests if teams want to stop the run while surrendering that kind of  yardage, he's willing to get pounded through the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> "They're winning the battles but we're winning the war," Bell said.  </P> <P> Bell said opponents have copied the nine-man fronts used against the Rams by  the New Orleans Saints, the NFL's No. 1 team against the rush.  </P> <P> At what price? In the Rams' 20-17 overtime victory over the Saints in the  Superdome Nov. 26, Bell was held to 17 yards in 11 carries. Elsewhere, Flipper  Anderson was setting a single-game receiving record with 336 yards in 15  catches, and Everett was passing for a career-high 454 yards.  </P> <P> "The thing New Orleans does is put nine people up front and bring the free  safety up, and he makes a great deal of tackles," Bell said. "A lot of teams  that have played us have gradually snuck that guy up in the middle, and he  causes a lot of problems with the running game. At the same time, Flipper  Anderson and Henry Ellard are going crazy."  </P> <P> If Bell does gain 73 yards, it would give the Rams a 4,000-yard passer, two  1,000-yard receivers and a 1,000-yard rusher.  </P> <P> Any more eyebrows out of place?  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The Rams announced the signing of free-agent linebacker Jerry Leggett, from Cal  State Fullerton, a ninth-round draft pick of the New Orleans Saints in 1989.  Leggett will join the developmental squad.  </P> <P> RUNNING WITH GRAND STYLE  </P> <P> 1,000-yard rushers under John Robinson.  </P> <P> USC  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.66IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eric Dickerson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,808  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eric Dickerson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,105  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eric Dickerson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,234  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eric Dickerson  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,821  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Charles White  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,374  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Greg Bell  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,212  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

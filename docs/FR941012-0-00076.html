			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters said that ANSI standards were not known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to most loggers, were not readily available, and were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written in language that the average logger would comprehend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 5&hyph;27; Tr. OR 118). One of these commenters said OSHA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, should put its requirements in the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than requiring logging employers to obtain and read  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another document (Tr. OR 118). He added that placing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in the regulatory text would increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, many commenters supported a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that all chain saws be equipped with chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brakes rather than just referencing the ANSI standard. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, these commenters said chain brakes were the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective device to protect operators from kickback and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide extra protection when the saws are carried between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutting jobs. In addition, one commenter supported a chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake requirement for the following reason: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. should follow the lead of other countries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (European) and require that all saws have an operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain brake if purchased after the adoption of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The cost would be minimal since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of saws now come equipped with these devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would also help deter the disabling of the brake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system by operating personnel (Ex. 5&hyph;19). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agrees with commenters that the final standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should include requirements on chain-saw protective devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule does incorporate by reference the ANSI B175.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus standard, but the Agency believes that the ANSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard alone does not provide the necessary degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety for logging employees. Accordingly, for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, the final rule also requires that chain saws placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into initial service after the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard be equipped with chain brakes. First, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable evidence in the record that chain brakes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective and the most used device to prevent kickback.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, they have strong acceptance by logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals, and as a result, already are standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment on almost all chain saws currently manufactured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, chain brakes do not have the disadvantages of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other protective devices. For example, unlike bar tip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guards, chain brakes are not removed by operators. Unlike  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced-kickback guide bars and low- or reduced-kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chains, chain brakes do not affect production efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, other countries also have adopted provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring chain saws to be equipped with chain brakes (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;19).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, OSHA agrees with commenters who are concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in order to maximize compliance, the standard be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensible to the average loggers. This is especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important for chain-saw safety, since many employees provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own chain saws. These employees and their employers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need plain and simple direction about what protection must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided for each chain-saw operator. OSHA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that the ANSI standard contains the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information needed by those operating the chain saw. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the use of sophisticated equipment and exacting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures that are beyond the expertise of the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging employer. Much of the ANSI standard deals with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer program for simulating chain-saw kickbacks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests to determine the accuracy of the computer program. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such, the ANSI standard is primarily directed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers of chain saws, rather than employers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees in the logging industry. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this standard is to establish minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety requirements with respect to the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portable, hand-held, gasoline-powered chain saws (Ex.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4&hyph;66). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of the ANSI standard are primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the unique purview of manufacturers, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the throttle control system, handles, pull-type starters, fuel tanks and oil tanks, exhaust systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sound levels, and vibration. Only the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are directed at the employer: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the chain saw in accordance with the instructions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner's manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chain saws shall be used in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating instructions and safety precautions listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner's manual. It shall be the responsibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner to see that such instructions and precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are given to every operator who uses the saw (Ex. 4&hyph;66). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the ANSI standard does not require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer to ensure that each chain saw used in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace is equipped with kickback protection. That is, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI standard does not require the employer to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kickback prevention devices are not removed or disabled by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators. By specifying that chain saws used by logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees be equipped with chain brakes, OSHA emphasizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that responsibility for compliance with OSHA standards rests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the employer, not the manufacturer or the employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

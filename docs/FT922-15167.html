			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Lib Dems must target at local level THE Liberal Democrats' best chances of making gains next Thursday depend on riding the swing in support away from the Conservatives and Labour but - far more critically - on targeting effectively at a local level. Very few Conservative-held seats would be won by the party if the swing shown in the latest opinion polls - including last night's two polls - was applied uniformly across the UK. But the Liberal Democrats have an established reputation for fighting individually tailored campaigns and for building a strong personal vote for their candidates. Mr Des Wilson, campaign director, is confident of holding the 22 seats the party is defending. That includes saving 10 seats in Scotland, where Liberal Democrat support fell to 10 per cent in a Mori/Sunday Times poll last weekend, compared with 19 per cent of votes cast at the 1987 election. Mr Wilson is also optimistic - perhaps too much so - about retaining seats like Southwark and Bermondsey, Rochdale and Liverpool Mossley Hill, which appear vulnerable to Labour. The most likely gains for the Liberal Democrats are seats where exceptional local factors are enhancing the national swings in support. Electoral geography means those gains would come almost exclusively from the Tories. Mr Wilson yesterday confidently predicted taking from Labour the seats of Sheffield Hillsborough, Glasgow Hillhead, Bow and Poplar, and Liverpool Broadgreen, but this may reflect a desire to counter charges that a Liberal Democrat vote would let in Labour. Broadgreen would need a swing of 6.3 per cent from Labour and depend on the candidacy of Mr Terry Fields, the expelled former Labour MP, splitting the Labour vote. Among the 375 seats the Conservatives won in 1987, the SDP/Liberal Alliance was second in 228. Cambridge, Colne Valley, Stevenage, Stockton South, Plymouth Drake and Conwy must now be regarded as three-way marginals as a result of the Labour revival. But there are 18 other seats, shown on the accompanying map, where the Liberal Democrats are clearly the challenger to the Conservatives and which they would win on a swing of around 6 per cent. Successful targeting would make many winnable on a much smaller national swing. Liberal Democrats have been able in the past to transfer support from local to parliamentary elections. In Hazel Grove, where Conservative Sir Tom Arnold defends a majority of 1,840, the Liberal Democrats have 14 of 18 council seats. The party has 23 of 25 council seats in Richmond and Barnes, a seat it failed to win by 1,766 votes in 1987. Another factor favouring the Liberal Democrats is their ability to squeeze the Labour vote in their crucial target seats. In a Harris poll in March, more than a quarter of those questioned said they would vote for another party if their preferred party could not win the seat. Liberal Democrat supporters are more likely than the supporters of other parties to vote tactically, but the Liberal Democrats are by far the greatest beneficiaries when Conservative or Labour voters do the same.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 TARGET SEATS FOR ASHDOWN'S FORCES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % = percentage swing required with a judgement as to whether their chances are better (+) or worse (-) than the bare figures suggest  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative-held seats 1   Portsmouth South      0.2%  - Former SDP seat, former MP Mike                                   Hancock standing again 2   Stockton South        0.7%  - Three-way marginal, but former SDP MP                                   Ian Wrigglesworth not standing again 3   Cambridgeshire NE     1.3%  - No Clement Freud (lost 1987) 4   Edinburgh West        1.3%  + Well-known candidate 5   Hereford              1.4% 6   Bath                  1.4% 7   Colne Valley          1.5%  - Three-way marginal, but Liberals                                   slipping since Richard Wainwright                                   retired in 1987 8   Hazel Grove           1.8%  + Strong in local government 9   Richmond &amp; Barnes     1.9%    Strong in local government but close                                   before 10  Conwy                 3.8%  - Three-way marginal 11  Cheltenham            4.0%  + Black Tory candidate 12  Plymouth Sutton       4.0%  - Former SDP vote 13  Plymouth Drake        4.0%  - Former SDP vote three-way marginal 14  Devon North           4.1%  + West country 15  Isle of Wight         4.1%  - Former Liberal MP retired 1987 16  Oxford West           4.5%  + Probable repeat of 1987 tactical                                   voting (link with Oxford East) 17  Falmouth &amp; Cambourne  4.7%  + West country, Tory outsider 18  Cambridge             4.7%  - Three-way marginal, strong Labour                                   revival, candidate no longer Shirley                                   Williams 19  Stevenage             4.8%  - Three-way marginal, strong Labour                                   revival 20  Cornwall North        4.9%  + West country, candidate Paul Tyler                                   former MP for Bodmin 21  Leeds NW              5.0% 22  Crosby                5.2%  - Shirley Williams MP (1981-3) effect 23  Chelmsford            5.7%  - Swing to Con in 1987 24  Winchester            6.1%  + Deselected Conservative MP standing as                                   independent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- By-election gains since 1987 from Conservatives* 1   Kincardie &amp; Deeside   2.2%    Poor poll showing in Scotland 2   Eastbourne           15.1%  + Strong in local government 3   Ribble Valley        19.8%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Labour held-seats 1   Blyth Valey           0.9%  - Collapse LD organisation 2   Islington South       1.0%  - Former SDP MP George Cunningham not                                   standing 3   Sheffield Hillsborough2.8%  - Collapse LD organisation 4   Glasgow Hillhead      3.9%  - Former SDP seat, Roy Jenkins 5   Newcastle Under Lyme  4.8% 6   Liverpool Broadgreen  6.3%  + Former Labour MP standing as                                   independent 7   Bow &amp; Poplar          6.8%  + Hard left Labour, LD's strong in local                                   government  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Swings needed based on 1987 results, therefore Liberal Democrat task is easier than suggested by these figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

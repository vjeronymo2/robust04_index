			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm close to another volatile trading session - Market Report The Ascension Day closure of nearly all continental European markets left London to make the first response to two significant developments in the US bond markets; their reaction to Wednesday's auction of Federal securities, and to important economic data announced yesterday. UK stocks followed the US lead closely. They fell initially on overnight weakness in New York bonds and equities. But they rallied strongly in the afternoon when unexpected falls in US producer prices and retail sales appeared to ease pressures for a tightening of Federal Reserve credit policy. The Footsie maintained its recent record for volatility, dipping 25.2 before recovering when it approached the 3,100 mark, and moving into positive territory towards the close. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,137.8 for a net gain of 7.3. There was little response to the death of Mr John Smith, leader of the opposition Labour party in the UK. UK shares opened sharply lower in the wake of the setback overnight in both US Federal bonds and the Dow Average which, in turn, reacted to the bond auction in New York on Tuesday. With no effective guidance on bond prices from elsewhere in Europe, London stocks followed early losses in UK gilt-edged securities. Attempts were made to rally following the announcement of a UK global trade deficit of Pounds 730m for February, slightly better than expected. But this had little effect and the Footsie was down to 3,105.3 before it steadied. There was little recovery until, at the New York opening, the favourable US economic statistics flashed across the trading screens. UK stocks quickly extended their recovery and, with the Dow Average 26 points up in UK hours, London closed very near the best of the day. Analysts were impressed to see the market bounce convincingly again in the Footsie 3,100 area. Some institutional interest was seen and the session reaffirmed the underlying resilience of UK equities at current levels. The volatility of the Footsie suggested that buyers were never far away. Some argued that recent intervention to support the dollar, as well as Wednesday's rate cuts in Europe, had 'opened the door' for the Federal Reserve to tighten credit and markets would welcome such a move. Mr Edmond Warner at Kleinwort Benson Securities said a 'substantial increase' in the Federal Funds rate might spark the bond rally which remains critical for the health of UK equities. Second-line stocks followed the blue chips although at a slight distance. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 0.1 off at 3,742.4. Seaq volume of 722.5m shares was restrained by the lack of business from other European financial centres. Wednesday's 744.3m shares through the Seaq network was worth Pounds 1.4bn at retail level. Company results provided some features but gave no guide to the market overall. The trading statement from Royal Insurance reaffirmed the improvement in insurance in the UK and also the effects of the storms and bad weather in California. Today, London is likely to be poised, together with other European markets, for the US consumer price statistics, which will provide the latest test of confidence in near term prospects for US interest rates.</p>

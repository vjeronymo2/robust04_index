			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Doubts deepen over Slovak sell-off Mr Vladimir Meciar became prime minister of Slovakia for the third time last night, assuming almost complete control of the country's privatisation policy amid widespread confusion over the immediate future of a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.28bn) sell-off of state assets scheduled to begin tomorrow. His appointment as privatisation minister of Mr Peter Bisak, a virtually unknown nominee of the radical leftwing Workers' party, one of the three coalition partners in the new government and a fierce opponent of selling off state companies, signals a serious downgrading of the ministry. It leaves policy in this crucial area in the hands of Mr Meciar and Mr Sergej Kozlik, his new finance minister and chief economic adviser. A lame duck privatisation ministry also suggests a much greater role for the National Property Fund, the body that administers companies being readied for privatisation and which Mr Meciar has packed with his own supporters. During September's election campaign the prime minister said he would introduce wholesale changes in the way state assets are sold, and to whom. Mr Meciar is expected to push for sales to existing company management, many of whom are supporters of his populist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the dominant coalition partner. The third coalition member is the extreme rightwing Slovak National party. Mr Meciar's new government has 83 of parliament's 150 seats. It was the pursuit of this policy that forced Mr Meciar and his last government from office last March amid allegations that he was diverting sales proceeds to finance the HZDS. He has long argued for delaying the first sell-off of companies in a programme of coupon privatisation under which Slovak citizens exchange vouchers, bought for a nominal sum, for shares in companies of their choice. More than 3m Slovaks have already bought vouchers in the scheme, put together by the outgoing government. The most significant change to the voucher programme is likely to be the removal of shares in what Mr Meciar has termed strategic industries, including Slovakia's electricity and gas companies, which represent at least 10 per cent of the total value of Sk60bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and almost certainly damp investor sentiment. Investment managers, who are hoping to invest the vouchers on behalf of hundreds of thousands of Slovaks in privatised companies through specially created investment vehicles, are in the dark as to the government's intentions. Many say, however, that they have prepared the new funds on the assumption that there would be at least some delay to the coupon programme, and have continued to woo potential investors. A delay in starting the so-called 'zero round' of the coupon programme, during which investors allocate their vouchers to fund managers, is less important than a change to the list of companies on offer. That list has already been changed five times since the process began in September, and nobody yet knows which companies are included. A lot of administrative work still has to be done to prepare the final list for sale. The NPF has made board changes at some of Slovakia's biggest companies, including the petrochemical giant Slovnaft, since Mr Meciar succeeded in placing his nominees on its management board after a parliamentary session in early November that has become known as 'Bloody Thursday'. He also secured control of Slovak radio and television by the same means.</p>

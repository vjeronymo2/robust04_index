			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> READERS EXPLAIN UPROAR OVER 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS'  </P> <P> Once again, the Costa Mesa City Council has revealed an alignment with  extremist and intolerant attitudes in a blatant disregard for democracy,  freedom of expression and the separation of church and state ("Stage Uproar  Could Haunt Playhouse," Oct. 3). Just months after the enactment of a policy  restricting the types of works that qualify to receive arts grants, the Costa  Mesa Civic Playhouse comes under attack for alleged violations of the policy  for (its) presentation of the play "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for  You." What prompted this investigation? Once again, the unsubstantiated and  hysterical opinion of one citizen, John Feeney, joined by his wife Ernie, who  claim that this play was a "religious activity."  </P> <P> The Feeneys' attack on the arts, free speech and diversity of thought is  substantial. We are all affected by this crusade. The Feeneys are free to  express their opinion, but their attitude is that only their opinion counts,  and if members of the community have opinions other than theirs, or participate  in activities that offend them, those are wrong. Where was the public outcry  against the Civic Playhouse or South Coast Repertory? The Feeneys attend a play  they know in advance will offend them, invite the "carpetbaggers for morality,"  the Eagle Forum, as their guests and proceed to fabricate an arts controversy  because they are supposedly "offended." The fact that a theatrical production  or a flyer "offends" the Feeneys does not mean it is offensive to the entire  community!  </P> <P> The arts community continues to be viciously attacked by the Feeneys and the  members of the Costa Mesa City Council. Now the Feeneys and council member  Sandra L. Genis claim to be "under harassment" from the arts community. To  them, participation in this democracy is harassment, as they want no other  voices to be heard. When these individuals create public hysteria, they are  hardly seeking a dialogue about community issues.  </P> <P> The Feeneys say they don't want their tax dollars used to fund anything they  don't believe in. In reality, the Feeneys have forced our tax dollars to be  spent on worthless investigations of organizations such as the South Coast  Repertory Theatre and the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse. The play "Sister Mary" is  about fanaticism, and so is this entire episode, with the Feeneys and the City  Council cast in leading roles.  </P> <P> The city attorney was correct that the play was not religious activity. This  latest incident highlights the absurdity of the council's policy and  underscores the fact that it should be removed immediately.  </P> <P> THE MEMBERS OF THE  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY COALITION  </P> <P> FOR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION  </P> <P> The letter was signed by 16 Orange County residents.  </P> <P> </P></p>

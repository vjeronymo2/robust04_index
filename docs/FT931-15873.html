			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Break-up of oil tanker could aid salvage effort, experts say THE shipwrecked oil tanker Braer was starting to break apart yesterday after further pounding by high seas on the coast of Shetland. But salvage experts believe the separation of the ship into two sections could help the rescue effort by stabilising the oil carrying portion. Smit Tak, the Dutch marine salvage company contracted by the Braer's operators, plans to remove the remaining oil from the vessel into an 8,000-tonne barge which will arrive on Monday night. Work cannot begin until the severe weather subsides. The Scottish Office has also announced a ban on catching fish and harvesting farmed salmon from an area of sea embracing the southern end of the main Shetland island. Earlier, the Shetland Salmon Farmers Association and the Shetland Fishermens Association voluntarily introduced a ban covering 400 square miles. This includes about 15 salmon farms accounting for about a third of Shetland farmed salmon output of about 10,000 tonnes. Bad weather once again restricted efforts to contain oil pollution from the tanker which went aground on Tuesday. It is thought that at least half the ship's 84,000 tonnes of light crude may still be on board. Mr Geert Koffeman of Smit said that there were indications that the ship's stern was beginning to separate from the main section containing the oil tanks. Mr Koffeman said he planned to use salvage vessels to install pumps on the Braer and pump the oil into a barge. Although dispersed crude from the Braer is gradually movingnorthwards up the west coast of Shetland, the oil slick has not reached any salmon farms. Small pockets of surface pollution, known as rainbow sheen, have been seen up Clift Sound but salmon swimming deep in their cages are not affected by it. When the ban is lifted, rigorous health and quality checks on fish produced in the area will be implemented, Mr James Moncrieff, chief executive of the Shetland salmon farmers association, said. Marks and Spencer said yesterday it had stopped buying salmon from farms in the Shetland Islands as 'a temporary precautionary measure'. Other supermarkets said they were monitoring the situation.

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELIBERATIONS TO BEGIN IN GAF STOCK DEAL CASE  </P> <P> Jury deliberations are due to begin today in the GAF Corp. stock market  manipulation trial, which has been under way in federal court in Manhattan for  more than five weeks.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe spent much of Friday instructing jurors  on the legal issues in the case. They were then to be sent to a hotel for the  night. The judge has ordered the jury sequestered, meaning that jurors won't be  allowed to go home at night, to avoid any exposure to press coverage of the  trial.  </P> <P> GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are accused of arranging  with the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm Jefferies &amp; Co. to illegally bid  up the closing price of Union Carbide's stock in late 1986, at a time when GAF  was preparing to sell a big block of Carbide shares.  </P> <P> Eight criminal counts are pending against GAF and Sherwin, including  conspiracy, stock market manipulation and securities fraud.  </P> <P> Depending on how long it takes the jury of nine women and three men to review  the evidence, a verdict could come as early as this weekend.  </P></p>

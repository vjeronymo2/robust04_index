			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Delta seeks approval for NY-Heathrow service DELTA Air Lines, one of the 'big three' US carriers, yesterday submitted a request to fly daily between New York's JFK and London's Heathrow airports - just four days before Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, is due to meet his US counterpart, Mr Federico Pena, in London. The current US-UK bilateral aviation accord gives only two US carriers - American and United Airlines - the right to fly into Heathrow. United acquired Pan Am's Heathrow route authorities for Dollars 290m, while American paid Dollars 445m for routes between three US cities and Heathrow from TWA. Greater access for US carriers to Heathrow was one of the most contentious issues raised last year, when possible revisions to the US-UK aviation agreement were being proposed in the context of British Airways' planned investment in USAir, a smaller US airline. These talks ended in deadlock, and BA went ahead with a scaled-down investment in the US carrier. However, the question of liberalising the accord remains on the table. Aside from the meeting between the two ministers, formal talks on possible revisions to the agreement are tentatively scheduled for next month. Delta made its request in a filing with the US Department of Transportation yesterday. It said it was prepared to begin the one-flight-a-day service by July 15. It also claimed that 'prompt British approval of the New York-London application would be a good-faith gesture by the British toward the full liberalisation (of air services) which the US government must require'. Delta enlarged its presence at New York's JFK when it acquired Pan Am's transatlantic route authorities, along with its terminal at the US airport, in 1991. However, because Pan Am's Heathrow access had already been sold to United, Delta did not acquire any New York-London authorities as part of the deal. Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent, adds: The UK government will insist on establishing new rules to ensure large airlines do not abuse their market power by squeezing out smaller competitors as a prerequisite of any further liberalisation of air services between the UK and the US. Mr MacGregor is expected to discuss this proposal as well as renewing demands for an easing of existing US restrictions on foreign ownership of US airlines during his talks with Mr Pena. Both ministers appear anxious to revive negotiations to liberalise air services between the two countries, interrupted after the US presidential elections last year.</p>

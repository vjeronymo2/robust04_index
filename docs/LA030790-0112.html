			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> UNDAUNTED: Although Ron Kovic has announced that he will not run for Congress  (B1), Democrats here still hope to reclaim two marginal local districts. . . .  Party analysts say there may be as many as 36,000 "unregistered potential loyal  Democrats" in Curt Pringle's (R-Garden Grove) 72nd Assembly District, which  overlaps with the congressional seat held by Rep. Robert K. Dornan. . . . Now,  Democrats say, they must find these voters and register them. Kristina Lindgren  and Mark Pinsky  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.2&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accrediting agency. While the definition in the proposed regulations eliminates the language in the current regulations describing the type of entity that may comprise an agency, the Secretary wishes to make clear that the legal entity that is an accrediting agency may be an association, council, commission, or corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designated Department official.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While this term is not used in the current regulations, the Secretary proposes to use it in subpart B on recognition and termination procedures to describe much of what has, in fact, been the Department's practice with respect to the accrediting agency recognition process. For example, the Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education has, on occasion, presented the summary of the preliminary analysis of an accrediting agency to the Advisory Committee; on other occasions, the Assistant Secretary has delegated that responsibility to a member of the Assistant Secretary's staff. After the Advisory Committee meeting, the Assistant Secretary has routinely forwarded to the Secretary the Advisory Committee's recommendation on an agency's application for recognition, along with the Assistant Secretary's recommendation. Finally, the Assistant Secretary has routinely advised the Secretary on issues related to the recognition of agencies. The Secretary believes that the inclusion of the term ``designated Department official'' and its use throughout subpart B clarifies the longstanding involvement of individuals other than the Secretary in the accrediting agency recognition process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Representative of the public.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary wishes to make clear that under an agency's policy on conflicts of interest, a representative of the public may not participate in any accrediting decisions pertaining to an institution or program with which he or she may have any direct or indirect affiliation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.21&blank;Administrative and Fiscal Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consensus was reached by negotiators regarding the provisions specified in this section for demonstrating that an accrediting agency has the necessary administrative and fiscal resources to carry out its accrediting responsibilities. However, the Secretary is concerned that the provisions contained in this section do not adequately address whether an agency's personnel and fiscal resources will continue to be adequate during any recognition period granted. The Secretary invites suggestions on how to address this concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. An assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the various requirements contained in the proposed regulations has been incorporated into the relevant sections of this preamble. The Secretary notes that, as these proposed regulations were subject to negotiated rulemaking, the costs and benefits of the various requirements were discussed thoroughly by negotiators. The resultant consensus reached on a particular requirement reflected agreement on the best possible approach to that requirement in terms of cost and benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small number of entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are accrediting agencies that apply for recognition by the Secretary. The regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the institutions affected because the regulations would not impose excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal supervision. The regulations would impose the minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper implementation of the Secretary's statutory mandate to recognize accrediting agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 602.4, 602.10, 602.26, and 602.27 contain information collection requirements. In addition, section 602.21(b)(7) contains specific record retention requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These proposed regulations contain substantial information collection requirements for accrediting agencies applying for recognition by the Secretary, as well as additional requirements for recognized agencies during their recognition period. The Department needs and uses the information collected to determine whether an agency seeking recognition by the Secretary meets the requirements for recognition and whether, if the agency is recognized, it continues to operate in compliance with the requirements for recognition throughout its recognition period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Invitation to Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in room 3069, ROB&hyph;3, 7th &amp; D Streets, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comments on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the accrediting agency recognition process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

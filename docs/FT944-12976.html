			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Aitken acts to clear name with hotel letters: Confusion over payment of bill blamed on an accounting mistake by Ritz Mr Jonathan Aitken, the treasury chief secretary, last night published confidential documentation with a view to clearing his name of allegations that a business associate paid his bill at Mr Mohamed Fayed's Paris Ritz hotel. In a statement issued by the treasury, Mr Aitken said that confusion over his FFr8,010 (Pounds 956.71) bill for a two-night stay at the Ritz was caused by a mistake by the hotel, rectified five months later. The statement, accompanied by photostat copies of letters and a cheque for Pounds 426.88, followed allegations by The Guardian that part of Mr Aitken's bill was paid by Mr Said Ayas, a former business associate. Mr Aitken had been cleared of impropriety by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, after disclosing that his wife paid half the bill in cash. But the government had refused to publish documentary evidence said by Sir Robin to prove that Mr Aitken had paid the bill in full. Mr Aitken said his bill was drawn up, without his knowledge, in the name of Mr Ayas. He said his wife was asked to pay FFr4,257 in cash, and several months later 'when I went over the documents again', it emerged that Mr Abdul Rahman, another guest whose room was booked by Mr Ayas, had paid FFr3,753 too much and Mrs Aitken the same amount too little. Mr Aitken said he sent a cheque for the sterling equivalent (Pounds 426.88), and a letter of explanation to Mr Rahman. He said the letter, a copy of the cheque, another letter from the hotel manager and the hotel receipt were passed to Sir Robin more than six months ago. 'I hope that it is clear that my bill was paid in full by my wife and myself in the circumstances I have described, and that I made the full documentation available to the cabinet secretary, as he has confirmed,' he said. The cabinet office inquiry was established by the prime minister, Mr John Major, after an unnamed informant allegedly acting for Mr Fayed made allegations against a number of ministers. Two, Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, later resigned. Mr Major told the Commons on Tuesday that the intermediary threatened to publish allegations of ministerial wrongdoing unless a critical DTI report into Mr Fayed's acquisition of House of Fraser, Harrods parent company, was withdrawn. A detailed note of the prime minister's conversation with the intermediary has been sent to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, and is being investigated by the police. Mr Aitken's decision to release the evidence supporting his denial of the allegations followed a further exchange of letters between Sir Robin and Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian. Sir Robin said the documentation in his possession was a personal matter for Mr Aitken, suggesting that the chief secretary was coming under pressure from Downing Street to end speculation by releasing the evidence. Mr Aitken won the full backing of his constituency association in Thanet South last night. But his statement left some questions unanswered: principally why the balance of the bill was paid five months after the hotel visit - and after The Guardian began to inquire into the apparent discrepancy. Questions about the series of allegations of improprieties dominated the prime minister's visit to Wales yesterday. He rebuked reporters who questioned him about Dame Angela Rumbold's decision to resign from a lobbying firm.</p>

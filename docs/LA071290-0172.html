			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DU PONT TO EXPAND PEROXIDE CAPACITY  </P> <P> Du Pont Co. will spend $106 million over the next three years to build and  expand hydrogen peroxide facilities to capitalize on increased demand for the  nontoxic alternative to chlorine.  </P> <P> Chlorine, used in industry as a whitener, produces two toxic by-products --  dioxin, which causes cancer, and chloroform gas.  </P> <P> By contrast, hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen.  </P> <P> Du Pont will increase its peroxide-producing capacity by 76% the next two  years, expanding plants in Ontario and Memphis, Tenn.  </P></p>

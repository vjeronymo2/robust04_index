			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALE OF TURTLE SHELLS SPURS CALL FOR PROBE  </P> <P> The Mexican Maritime Confederation, an ecology watchdog group, is demanding  that the government investigate shipments of hundreds of pounds of turtle  shells to Japan last year, despite the fact that turtle hunting is banned.  </P> <P> Confederation officials were quoted Saturday by the newspaper El Universal as  saying the government has failed to respond to accusations that it authorized  the shipment of 1,150 pounds of turtle shells to Japan in 1989.  </P> <P> The shells are widely use for making expensive combs, key rings, eyeglass  frames and transistor mounts.  </P> <P> Sea turtles are an endangered species in Mexico and, by law, people are barred  from hunting them or collecting their eggs.  </P></p>

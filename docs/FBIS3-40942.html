			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Rukh-Press reported on 13 January that  People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] Chairman Vyacheslav  Chornovil has described Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's  signing of the treaty on removing Ukraine's 176 nuclear missiles  as a national betrayal. "This treaty will mean the full nuclear  disarmament of Ukraine in as far as it embraces not only liquid  fuel missiles, but also modern solid fuel missiles, which do not  come under the 'START- I' Treaty, the Rukh chairman emphasized.  [no closing quotation mark as received]    This is a shameful capitulation, for Ukraine will receive  neither a single guarantee of its security, nor serious  compensation. Two world superpowers -- the United States and  Russia -- have combined their efforts in order to bring Ukraine  to its knees. And this is easy for them to do because, having  plundered the state, the rotten Communist regime headed by  Kravchuk is prepared for any kind of betrayal as long an  economic catastrophe is averted and they hold on to power at the  expense of American and Russian handouts. Evidently Kravchuk  expects the nomenclature to win in the March elections and the  Supreme Council to ratify this shameful treaty. If we do not  remove the traitors from power, Vyacheslav Chornovil warned,  then that is the end of Ukraine. They will not stop for  anything -- they will give up nuclear weapons, the Black Sea  Fleet, the Crimea, and then even Ukraine itself. Then, I fear  that Ukraine will for the second time this century lose a  God-given chance to consolidate its statehood." [no opening  quotation mark as received]</p>

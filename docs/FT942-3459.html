			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Today's rail strike likely to hit London hardest Britain's rail network was facing a widespread 24-hour shutdown from midnight last night as bitter exchanges erupted between the RMT union and Railtrack, which runs the national network. London, which normally has about 400,000 rail commuters each day, is likely to face the worst disruption. Other cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow expect minimal extra congestion on roads. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT leader, accused Railtrack of 'reneging' on a 5.7 per cent pay offer for the network's 4,600 signalmen and said that this had provoked today's strike. 'Railtrack have dealt a body blow to industrial relations and the integrity of the company is in tatters,' he said. But Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, denied that the company had ever offered such a rise. In the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, condemned the strike and said extra parking would be made available in London. The Department of Transport said there would be 10,000 more spaces at locations such as Hyde Park and Regents Park. Despite the strike, most of London's Underground system will be running. Police and motoring organisations advised people to share cars or stagger journeys. The London Weather Centre has forecast another sunny day today which could persuade people to stay away from work. Some big City companies were making arrangements to help employees get to work. Lloyds Bank, which employs 8,000 in Greater London, has organised 100 coaches to bring in up to 4,000 people from as far as Chelmsford and Cambridge. KPMG Peat Marwick, however, which employs 3,000 in London, had made no contingency plans. A spokeswoman said: 'We expect the vast majority of our employees will be able to get in.' Only 15 Underground stations will be affected out of a total of 273. London Transport said there would be no Tube services on the northern stretch of the Bakerloo Line from Queens Park to Harrow and Wealdstone or in south London on the District Line between Turnham Green and Richmond and East Putney and Wimbledon. Out of London's two main airports, Gatwick is expected to be hard hit as its main service into the capital is a Railtrack line to Victoria. It is expecting 54,000 arrivals today, of which 24 per cent would normally travel on the Gatwick Express. Extra coaches have been laid on. Heathrow will be less affected as it is connected to London by Underground. However it expects extra pressure on car parking. The strike represents the first serious challenge to the new railway system which is being fashioned from the framework of British Rail. If Railtrack, which was set up last April to take over BR's track signalling and stations, fails to provide a working railroad, it must compensate the train operating companies. Railtrack accepts that the signalmen have a genuine grievance over their pay position. However Mr Leah said last night that any extra rise beyond the proposed 2.5 per cent for all Railtrack employees would have to come through negotiation on a new productivity package. Another 24-hour strike has been planned for next Wednesday. Railtrack faces first serious test, Page 10 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

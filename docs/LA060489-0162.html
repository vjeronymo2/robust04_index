			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DINING IN NICE  </P> <P> I read Beverly Beyer and Ed Rabey's article on Nice ("Footloose," May 21) with  interest because I was there in March and happened to eat at La Belle Nicoise.  It was good, but I enjoyed the fish and selection more at Grand Pavois-Chez  Michel, 11 Rue Mayerbeer, near the Promenade des Anglais. Elegant atmosphere,  and the owners really made me feel welcome. Highest recommendation.  </P> <P> LORI SANDERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The rising yen: it was not always thus - William Dawkins tracks the Japanese currency from Dollars parity in 1874 Japanese exporters who complain about their currency's historic break through Y100 to the dollar might cheer themselves up by looking back 120 years. For the yen was as mighty as the dollar itself when it was born as a gold-backed internationally negotiable currency in 1874, by order of the young Emperor Meiji. Since then, it has neatly moved from a yen to the dollar to a yen to the cent. The first gold yen coins were minted on presses imported from Hong Kong when Japan was running a heavy trade deficit to feed its breakneck modernisation from medieval to industrialised country. The name yen, meaning 'round', was introduced by educated urbanites in the 1950s to replace the untranslatable ryo, the forerunner of the modern yen. The ryo and the multiple rival paper notes issued by warring daimyos, heads of feudal clans, were of such uncertain value that traders and financiers used a parallel tender, Mexican dollars issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's Yokohama branch. These, still in circulation until the turn of the century, were the precursors of the first yen notes issued by commercial banks in the late 1870s, followed by government issued paper with the foundation of the Bank of Japan in 1882. The emperor fixed the 1874 yen at 1.5g of gold, the same as the dollar of the time. Today, the same weight of gold is worth Dollars 586. Of course, the yen has been revalued several times since then and Japan's currency has been as volatile as the country's own fortunes over the past century. From its mighty birth, the yen steadily grew mightier, so that it was worth Y0.23 - or 23 sen - to the dollar by the outbreak of war with the US in 1941, according to Japan's central bank. The yen came out of international circulation during and just after the war. Hyperinflation caused its value to collapse dramatically, forcing the authorities in 1946 to redenominate, by slicing two zeros off the face value. The debate over whether to redenominate the yen again - which would restore parity with the dollar - has resurfaced several times, most recently after the 1986 round of yen appreciation, or endaka. Proponents believe it might stimulate consumer spending by making people feel their yen are even more valuable, but bankers in Tokyo scoff at the idea. In 1949, the US occupying forces fixed the Japanese currency at Y360 to the dollar, its rate when Japan entered the International Monetary Fund three years later. At first, Mr Ralph Young, the US Federal Reserve's emissary to Japan advised a rate of Y270 to Y300. In the event, Japanese industry was let off lightly. Japan's rapid industrialisation in the 1960s made Y360 clearly undervalued by the time the US abandoned the gold link in 1971. It shot up to Y270 in less than a year, at which it hovered for nine months, a rare period of stability, until the first oil crisis. The surge in oil prices hit the economy so hard - even causing the neon lights to go out in Ginza, Tokyo's prestigious shopping area, recalls one seasoned observer - that the exchange rate slumped quickly back to Y300. The yen dipped again after the 1979 oil price shock, tantalisingly suggesting a pattern: that it should go down when commodity prices go up, as they are doing now. 'High commodity prices are very bad for Japan's terms of trade. That's one of the reasons why I fail to get excited by the yen's present strength,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo. The yen started to climb again with the 1980s export boom, as Japanese cars and cheap high quality consumer electronics swept Europe and the US. The easing of US monetary policy, reinforced by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb the value of the dollar, caused the yen to shoot off again to around Y140 by the end of the decade, its value virtually doubling in the 1980s. The yen was supported for a while by Japan's economic 'bubble'. And then, perversely, the onset of recession at the start of the 1990s pushed it up even higher, to nearly Y100 last August, as a fall in imports caused the export-dependent economy to record an increasingly wide current account surplus. In contrast to previous sharp rises, the latest surge, to Y99.85 at one point, has more to to with the dollar's weakness against European currencies than with any inherent talent of the yen for defying gravity. On Tuesday the Asahi Shimbun electronic newsboard, on top of a Ginza towerblock, flashed the news to the crowds below that the yen had crashed through Y100. For the viewers below, the figure could have been a symbol of short-term complications for the economy or as one more indicator of the country's economic rise.</p>

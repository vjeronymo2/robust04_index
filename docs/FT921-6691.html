			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: WPP wins Dollars 115m Mercedes contract MERCEDES-BENZ of North America has signed an advertising deal worth some Dollars 115m (Pounds 65.7m) with the New York agency Scali McCabe Sloves, part of the UK-based WPP group. The deal, by far the largest signed in the US for many months, makes Scali responsible for all forms of Mercedes' North American advertising, including direct marketing. Scali's success provides a much needed fillip for WPP, the world's largest marketing services agency. It is also welcome news for Scali. In November 1990 it resigned Volvo's Dollars 40m account, which it had run for 23 years. This brought about a sharp fall in WPP's share price, and followed revelations that one of Scali's Volvo commercials had been rigged: Volvos had been strengthened before undergoing a test in which trucks were driven over them. Negotiations are still proceeding over WPP's disposal of Scali, a move which was agreed when WPP first acquired the agency in May 1989 as part of its purchase of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather group.</p>

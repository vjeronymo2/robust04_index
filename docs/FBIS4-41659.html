			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, Russian deputy prime </F> minister and leader of the Party for Russian Unity and Accord  [PRUA], by Sergey Vasilyev under the "First-Hand" rubric; place,  date not given: "From Commonwealth to Confederation. Sergey  Shakhray Believes That the Situation in the Post-Soviet Space Is  Related to Internal Processes in Russia"]    [Text] [Vasilyev] Sergey Mikhaylovich, Nursultan  Nazarbayev has put forward the idea of creating a Eurasian  Union. A few months ago the Party for Russian Unity and Accord  [PRUA] published its own draft Confederal Agreement...    [Shakhray] Our interest in the problem can be said to be  "transparent." First, the party's course toward deepening  integration was stated in the PRUA electoral platform, and we  think we are obliged to deliver on the pledges given to our  voters. Second, these processes are directly related to what is  going on inside Russia itself. The Russian Federation is far  from indifferent to how our compatriots feel in the "new  abroad." And finally, third, entirely new economic and  geopolitical foundations have now had time to emerge in order to  bring closer together peoples who have traditionally been linked  for historical and economic reasons.    [Vasilyev] What specific steps are you going to take in that  direction?    [Shakhray] You probably know that literally a week ago we  held a "roundtable" of scientists and politicians devoted to the  problems of the new integration within the post-Soviet space.  It luckily coincided with the initiative by our Kazakhstani  colleagues -- Nursultan Nazarbayev's blueprint for a Eurasian  Union. The roundtable brought together representatives of  nearly all Commonwealth republics, some delegations were  represented by deputy prime ministers and ambassadors. We  discussed all sorts of aspects of the emerging integration  process.    Matters of the legal formalization of these processes and  phases of agreed actions were also discussed. Participants in  the discussion agreed that only consistent, businesslike, and  balanced talks on forging new interstate relations can help set  up a rational basis for cooperation, whether it is called a  European Union or a Confederal Commonwealth.    [Vasilyev] Don't you fear that initiatives of this kind may  "explode" the existing Commonwealth of Independent States by  proposing in its stead still vague forms of a new, albeit  closer, integration? After all, any fruit must be given time to  ripen....    [Shakhray] What you call the "fruit" has long been overripe.  It is another matter that it would by no means serve our  interstate interests to allow processes to unfold outside  official collaboration channels. Following up on your  metaphorical argument, one might say that the fallen fruit  should be picked up by the "right" partners suited for  international relations, namely official structures and  officials entitled to resolve these matters.    I state with the utmost responsibility that the logic of the  new unification must fit in with the logic of the development of  cooperation within the CIS regardless of whether 5 or 10 states  are willing to form the confederation. We insist that the  Commonwealth be maintained and enhanced, and we see agreements  within the CIS as the sine qua non for holding talks on setting  up a confederation. The Russian leadership should finally name  official participants in the process so as not to leave this to  extremists. This is our first condition. Second, we oppose a  rash, "across-the-board" solution to the problem. A decision  based on considerations of political expediency. Third, we do  not think it possible to hold talks within so "narrow" a circle  of participants, even if it is made up of historically and  ethnically close countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.  Russia is more than just an Orthodox country. Moreover, Muslim  peoples account for one-third of its population. Here there can  be no prior "selection" on the basis of ethnic or political  criteria.    [Vasilyev] How do you see this future state alliance so far  cautiously called a form of "further deepening of integration"?    [Shakhray] The initiatives of the PRUA and the Kazakhstani  president have sparked an unexpected discussion of the following  question: What is preferable -- a confederation or a Eurasian  Union? We do not think that these initiatives are in any way  opposed to each other. The project of our counterparts from  Kazakhstan effectively also entails a confederal form of  integration. This is the reason why Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Russia is certainly ready to  hold talks on a confederation, but as for the Eurasian Union  plan, it will do so only after "specific decisions are made by  parliaments and political leaderships" does not appear valid.    The problem lies completely elsewhere: What forms of  confederal cooperation are currently acceptable -- economic,  political, or security collaboration? Can one set up new  confederal structures covering the entire range of interstate  relations or not? In that regard, the practice of the current  CIS institutions, including its Executive Secretariat, can give  us lots of hints.    Evidently we should pick and choose among agreements within  the CIS that have already been signed: Some of them have  already surpassed the level of interstate agreements and evolved  into confederal ones without asking for permission; some  documents do not work at all; in other areas "virgin territory"  from a legal point of view is emerging, and so forth. This  expert appraisal of sorts, for starters, will make it possible  to single out the legal framework for effective integration and  to identify "bottlenecks" and "blank spots" in the treaty  foundation.    Just as important for the search for the foundation of a  confederation is analysis of agreements concluded at the  interregional or, if you like, "border" level between the CIS  countries. For instance, between Russia's Omsk, Orenburg,  Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Novosibirsk Oblasts and Altay  Kray and Kazakhstani oblasts bordering them; between Russia's  Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Rostov, and Voronezh Oblasts and the  neighboring Ukrainian oblasts. In many instances these are  readymade "prototype" models for the regulation of future  relations. It is the border areas closely tied together by the  need to pursue a coordinated economic policy, intensive trade,  and, in a way, "regional diplomacy" that have brought into being  forms of cooperation that come closest to the model of a  confederation.    Finally, we should make up our mind with regard to medium-  and long-term tactics in solving the following problem: Who  will be integrated and on what basis, and also when and in how  many stages can the integration be carried out?    [Vasilyev] Are you also a proponent of giving the economy  priority in integration?    [Shakhray] Not quite. At present, the new confederation's  most urgent task is finding a solution to the problem of crime,  which, as is well known, does not recognize borders. The second  most important task is to ensure the CIS states' collective  security. Economic cooperation sort of "permeates" these  clusters of problems, ensuring that urgent economic and  financial matters are resolved. In particular, the problem of  nonpayments and mutual settlements with the states where the  Russian ruble still "operates" has yet to be resolved.  Something else that is on the agenda is joint investment in  projects of "Eurasian importance," for instance, those same  problems of border protection or the struggle against crime.  But large-scale economic integration will become possible only  when we are able to harmonize the legal foundations of economic  activity, which have already "run far away" from each other, and  to settle mutual debts. There should be no illusions here.    [Vasilyev] To what extent are the CIS countries' new  entrepreneurial structures and banking capital interested in the  new integration?    [Shakhray] There is no need to rack one's brain for  examples. For instance, back in April there was an international  conference of central and commercial banks of the Commonwealth  countries. They called for an Interstate Bank and a payment  union within the CIS. They are already drawing up independent  proposals on these matters. From this point of view, we should  welcome and give every possible support to private and state  initiatives by industrialists, entrepreneurs, and financiers  objectively aimed at "sewing together" the economic fabric of  the CIS countries, which has come unraveled.    It is important to support the particular trends that have  emerged very recently that I would call manifestations of  personal freedom. The new entrepreneurs, new economic managers,  and new financial-industrial groups are interested in such  integration just as much as those who still feel nostalgia for  "the greater homeland." These people born of the new epoch can  devise forms of economic integration that cannot be broken by  any "iron fist" or someone's nationalist logic.    Our multinational working group is ready to cooperate with  all business leaders who see integration as something they have  a long- term personal stake in. After all, these are the  interests of the Russian state.    [Vasilyev] What other forms of dialogue at the interstate  level could you suggest?    [Shakhray] Why shouldn't we suggest that the presidents of  our republics -- members of the CIS Council of Heads of State --  set up a new deliberative body at this level modeled on the  Presidential Council? Why shouldn't this "CIS Presidential  Council" set as its main goal the enhancement of the strategy  and tactics of reintegration? Let this council be formed not ex  officio, but by mutual consent by those who can really  contribute to taking efficient, effective, carefully weighed  steps along the path of integration between the Commonwealth  countries. In that regard it is important that it include not  only public figures, scientists, experts, and analysts, but also  industrialists, bankers, and also distinguished mass media  leaders, those of them who have already made significant headway  in creating a single cultural-information space in the CIS  countries.    [Vasilyev] At what other levels can the negotiating  process also unfold?    [Shakhray] This is already happening in reality. Our  "roundtable" and a number of other forums devoted to this  particular problem held in a whole range of the CIS countries  within the past month alone have shown that the main sponsors of  the movement are citizens themselves -- members of political  parties, public organizations, scientists. If we manage to set  up an interstate commission, it will be tasked with preparing an  analysis of the entire body of CIS documents with a view to  enhancing integration and working out an official stance on  forming confederal bodies that will be presented in a report to  a CIS summit. Another group that will operate in parallel with  the interstate commission is the multilateral working group to  be set up in accordance with the results of the "roundtable."  It will be assigned the role of a civic expert on confederation  matters. We invite representatives of political forces in all  the CIS countries, not just Russian public groups, to take part  in its activity.    A significant number of public action centers have already  emerged -- they are reintegration's "spearheads," as it were:  the multinational working group, the Eurasian Commonwealth  Charter, the "Eurasia 21st Century" project, and others. Given  the lack of a coordinating strategy, this multipolar movement is  already giving rise to jealous fears that "everyone is beginning  to grab more than their fair share of the Eurasian cake."    I think that there should be no such fears. As for me, I do  not cling to priorities or personal trappings of distinction.  It will be good if the multinational working group makes an  effective contribution to furthering the ideas of a confederal  Eurasian Union, but it will be not bad, either, if the forum  called "Toward a New Accord" sends strong impulses in that  direction as well. Let us join forces and try to raise our  civic, public initiative to an even higher level.    [Vasilyev] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has  chosen the idea of Eurasia as the ideological component for the  new integration processes. Do you think it will be a sufficient  basis for an effective future confederation?    [Shakhray] There is no denying that the idea of Eurasia in  itself symbolizes the unity of the destinies of the peoples in  the current so-called "post-Soviet space." It cannot be ruled  out that public opinion might more naturally accept some other  integration ideology -- this is still a matter open for  discussion. But at present it is clear that Eurasianism, as was  the case earlier, has again become the banner of a very  difficult, "transition" period. It has yet again reminded us of  "the desire for a common cause" typical of our peoples, a desire  that tends to awaken at the direst moments of history. Let us  hope that this time around the idea will serve as a reminder of  common roots, traditions, and joint, fruitful policy.</p>

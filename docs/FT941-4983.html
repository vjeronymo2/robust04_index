			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Congress embarks on health bill draft Congress yesterday took its first tentative step towards putting together a healthcare reform bill when a House of Representatives panel sat down to try to draft legislation. The subcommittee, a healthcare panel of the influential Ways and Means Committee, is chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, whose own proposal for reform is somewhat to the left of the plan put forward by President Bill Clinton's administration. Mr Stark wants to add a new category to the government-run Medicare programme which now provides health insurance for the elderly, to cover both the poor and unemployed, including those now included in the parallel government Medicaid programme. The new Medicare category would also be open to companies with up to 100 employees, who would, if they chose this option, have to pay 80 per cent of the premium for their employees. Controversially, Mr Stark also proposed yesterday a 0.8 per cent payroll tax to raise Dollars 24bn a year, on top of the tobacco tax increase advocated in the Clinton plan, to pay for some of the cost of expanding health insurance to cover the entire US population. While Mr Stark's proposal is seen by many members of Congress as redolent of the kind of state-run medicine that provokes goosebumps among US doctors, patients and politicians alike, its strength is that it is built on Medicare, which is not only familiar but also generally popular among the groups it serves. Although the proposal differs in many respects from Mr Clinton's ideas, which are based on health alliances to purchase insurance, White House officials appeared happy that the Ways and Means subcommittee was at least setting the legislative ball in motion. Other subcommittees which have jurisdiction over parts of the healthcare reform package have deadlocked, and the entire issue of reforming the system has lost momentum. Further complicating the task is the current preoccupation with the WhiteWater financial affair, which has not only absorbed all the energies of a good portion of the senior White House staff in recent days, but also cast an unfavourable light on Mrs Hillary Clinton, who has been the administration's principal spokesperson on health reform. Mr Clinton yesterday expressed his optimism that a health care reform bill will, in the end, pass the Congress.</p>

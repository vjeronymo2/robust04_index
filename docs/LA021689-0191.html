			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4-AA PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO SURVIVES BAD NIGHT TO WIN;  </P> <P> DIABLOS ARE BOTHERED BY TUSTIN PRESSURE BUT MANAGE 51-46 VICTORY  </P> <P> Anyone wondering why he or she paid $5 to see the Southern Section 4-AA  first-round playoff game between Mission Viejo and Tustin high schools  Wednesday night might take consolation in the fact that, as a fan, a bad game  can be easily forgotten.  </P> <P> But it's tough for a coach to forget, even when he walks away a winner. Mission  Viejo Coach Bob Minier knows the feeling, especially after watching his Diablos  settle for a 51-46 victory over Tustin Wednesday night at Mission Viejo High  School.  </P> <P> "All I can say is we played good the first half, but tonight we just played  terrible in the second," Minier said.  </P> <P> Of course, some of the credit for Mission Viejo's troubles must go to Tustin,  which, after trailing, 32-22, at halftime, came out in the second half with a  frenetic, full-court press. The Tillers forced nine turnovers in the third  quarter, throwing the Diablos off their favored slow-tempo game. In that  quarter Tustin outscored Mission Viejo, 6-4.  </P> <P> Had Tustin -- which played without standout guard Cheavly Ly, who was taken out  of the game midway through the first quarter and did not return because of  disciplinary reasons -- been able to capitalize on offense, the Tillers might  be meeting Inglewood (15-8) in a second-round game Friday night. But Tustin  shot only 30% in the game, including a 3-for-16 (19%) effort in the third  quarter. Mission Viejo shot 47.5% in the game.  </P> <P> Matt Tanner scored 14 points and Greg Amaya 11 to lead Mission Viejo (12-12).  Jason Moore had 16 points to lead Tustin (13-13).  </P> <P> Torrance 59, Servite 52 -- Host Torrance overcame a sluggish performance by  opening the fourth quarter with a 10-0 run to take the lead for good at 48-42.  Servite, dogged by the Tartars' full-court pressure, did not score until 4:05  had elapsed in the period.  </P> <P> Servite (12-11) was hurt by turnovers (22) and poor free-throw shooting (six  for 18). Torrance (15-10) made 20 of 30 foul shots, including 10 of 15 in the  decisive fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Torrance's Rick Robison led all scorers with 26 points, but made only six of 20  shots. He was better at foul line, converting 11 of 13 attempts.  </P> <P> Forward Steve Marusich led Servite with 18 points, but was held in check after  scoring 10 in the first quarter. ROB FERNAS Cajon 52, Kennedy 50 -- Eric  Culberson hit a 17-foot jumper with 2 seconds left for the victory. Culberson's  shot was set up when point guard Amar Washington took an inbounds pass with 7  seconds remaining, drove to the basket and passed the ball out to Culberson.  The playoff victory was the first in Cajon's 19-year history and spoiled a  10-point comeback by Kennedy (18-8) in the fourth quarter. Jim Barker's  three-point shot with 49 seconds left cut Cajon's lead to 50-48. Tom Deep then  tied the score with 41 seconds left, was fouled on the play but missed the free  throw. Cajon is 16-9.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY WANTS A CANSECO-TYPE CONTRACT;  </P> <P> DODGERS: AGENT SAYS OUTFIELDER MIGHT NOT SEEK OTHER BIDS, AND IS WILLING TO  SWITCH FROM RIGHT FIELD TO CENTER FIELD. VALENZUELA FILES FOR FREE AGENCY.  </P> <P> Darryl Strawberry's agent has met with the Dodgers and said the outfielder  would sign without seeking other bids if the Dodgers agree to pay him a Jose  Canseco-type contract, sources said.  </P> <P> The agent also said Strawberry has told Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda that he  wants to play here so much, he would move from right field to center field if  necessary. That would enable the Dodgers to sign him without being forced to  move Hubie Brooks or Kal Daniels, and could result in one of baseball's best  hitting outfields.  </P> <P> "Darryl and I both expressed a great deal of interest in him playing for the  L.A. Dodgers," said Eric Goldschmidt, Strawberry's agent.  </P> <P> Goldschmidt would not elaborate on Tuesday's meeting with Vice President Fred  Claire and attorney Bob Walker. But he noted: "Darryl has told Tommy that he  will play center field or right field. He told him he would do whatever the  manager wanted him to do."  </P> <P> Until recently, Strawberry, who has averaged 31 home runs and 91 runs batted  in, has publicly wavered on whether he wanted to join the Dodgers or return to  the New York Mets.  </P> <P> Under free-agent guidelines, the Dodgers cannot begin talking contract terms  with Strawberry until Monday. He will be seeking a deal similar to the  five-year, $23.5-million contract signed by the Oakland A's Jose Canseco.  </P> <P> In an unrelated move Wednesday, Fernando Valenzuela took what some feel is the  first step toward ending his 10-year association with the team by filing for  free agency. The Dodgers have no plans to make him an offer, and sources said  Valenzuela has resigned himself to going elsewhere.  </P> <P> "The thing you always know about Fernando is, he gives you the fullest effort .  . . but it's not a case of just looking at Fernando," Claire said. "It's a case  of looking at the ballclub and asking, 'How do we improve to become a  championship club?' As much as we like Fernando, we can't close the door to  looking at change."  </P> <P> Said Tony DeMarco, Valenzuela's agent: "You can arrive at your own  conclusions."  </P> <P> Valenzuela pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 29 but  was 1-3 with an 8.40 earned-run average in six September starts. He finished  13-13 with a 4.59 ERA, the highest of his career.  </P> <P> The Dodgers reportedly believe that Valenzuela would be no more than a fifth  starter in next year's rotation, and that would not justify giving him a  multiyear deal.  </P> <P> But part of this thinking includes the bold notion that Orel Hershiser will be  recovered from shoulder surgery and back in the rotation by opening day.  </P></p>

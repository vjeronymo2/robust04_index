			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / London hotels 'most expensive' BUSINESSPEOPLE PAY more for a hotel room in London than anywhere else in Europe, according to a survey of business travel costs published today. A listed rate of Pounds 223 for a single room in a typical four-star hotel chain in the city compares with Pounds 127 in Dublin and Pounds 123 in Milan. However, the survey, by Visa, the credit card organisation, found that London offers some business-travel bargains. The bill for a day's secretarial services is less than a third of the fee charged in Geneva. And, while taxis are expensive, car-hire charges are among the lowest. British businesspeople face a bewildering array of varying travel costs across the continent, says Visa. Eating out in Geneva is five times more expensive than in Barcelona, and the cost of a secretary in Amsterdam is five times greater than in Milan. Paris has the cheapest taxis but the dearest breakfasts. In Oslo a 30-minute telephone call costs as much as a cup of coffee. Mr John Chaplin, Visa vice-president for market development in Europe, said this variation in prices created difficulties for any company attempting to rationalise its travel and entertainment costs. 'In these competitive times many companies are attempting to control costs by formulating a coherent travel policy,' he said. 'But if a company pays Pounds 120 for a hotel room in Dublin and is then charged Pounds 220 for a similar room in Brussels, forward budgeting and cost control can become a nightmare.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN EUROPE (figures in Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- City               Hotel(1)  Taxi(2)  Taxi(3)  Phone(4)   Continental                                                          breakfast(5)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London               223.00    40.00     6.00      0.20         12.95 Amsterdam            173.99    17.57     3.97      0.26         10.37 Barcelona            142.59     7.12     5.70      0.36         11.40 Brussels             221.40    14.88     3.72      0.28         10.23 Dublin               127.84    11.58     4.45      0.28          6.25 Frankfurt            136.50    23.74     3.31      0.40         11.47 Geneva               159.91    13.36     5.35      0.18         12.03 Milan                123.33    10.45     4.18      0.42         13.17 Oslo                 135.00     8.63     3.64      0.18          8.82 Paris                207.87    22.47     2.02      0.27         14.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- City                   Car   Secretary(7)   Fax(8)   Business   Cup of                    hire(6)                         meal for 4   Coffee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London               56.50          77.00     3.00     202.40     0.75 Amsterdam            47.70         210.90     5.33     137.61     0.84 Barcelona            63.41          58.17     2.37      66.30     0.59 Brussels            132.40         167.44     1.20     204.65     0.93 Dublin               50.70         129.69     4.63     124.13     0.56 Frankfurt            50.97         205.74     0.40     126.61     1.38 Geneva               82.91         249.44     2.23     334.08     1.56 Milan                92.28          41.81     1.67     209.03     0.50 Oslo                 83.46         114.52     0.91     131.79     1.82 Paris                79.78         151.61     1.69     157.30     1.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) City centre, Four star single room rate.

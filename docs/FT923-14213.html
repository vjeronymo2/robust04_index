			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plans for committees spark row GOVERNMENT business managers yesterday precipitated a Commons row over the departmental select committee system by trying to remove the Tory chairman of the health committee and giving Labour the chairmanship of the trade and industry committee. Labour is expected to take the chairmanship of six committees, including the social security committee, which is poised to revive its investigation into the Maxwell affair. Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, was last night emerging as favourite to become chairman of the Treasury select committee. He will replace Mr Terence Higgins, who is leaving the committee. However, Tory MPs on the trade and industry committee are threatening to rebel against the Conservative whips' decision to give the chairmanship to Labour - probably either Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, or Stan Orme, MP for Salford East. A possible Tory candidate would be Sir Anthony Grant, MP for Cambridgeshire South West. The departmental select committees have grown considerably in importance since being set up first in 1979. The televising of their proceedings has increased their powers to intimidate the executive by calling ministers and officials to give evidence. The selection committee's decisions, based on the nominations of party Whips, will be announced today and be debated on Monday. Each committee will then meet before the summer recess to chose a chairman - possibly overturning the whips' intentions - and discuss a possible inquiry programme. Certain to protest is Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Conservative chairman of the health committee of the last parliament, who frequently criticised government policy. The selection committee agreed last night to remove him from the list of MPs proposed for the health brief. Mr Winterton yesterday complained that the Tory whips were 'bully boys' acting 'on behalf of the establishment'. Among other committees, Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, is set to retain the chairmanship of social security; Mr David Howell, Tory MP for Guildford, should win foreign affairs; and Sir John Wheeler, MP for Westminster North, should keep home affairs. Besides trade and industry and social security, Labour is also expected to take the chairmanships of the Welsh and Scottish committees, employment and the newly created national heritage committee.</p>

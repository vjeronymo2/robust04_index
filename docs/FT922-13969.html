			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major keeps post-election options open A CONSERVATIVE opposition might not inevitably vote down a minority Labour government's first legislative programme, Mr John Major hinted yesterday, although he emphasised throughout the day that he was 'stone cold certain' of a working majority. On the last day of campaigning, he was drawn into discussion of what might happen in a hung parliament, his emphasis notwithstanding that the question was hypothetical. Speaking on the BBC's Election Call phone-in, he responded to a question from Mr Tony Halmos, a Liberal Democrat campaign worker, by saying: 'I would study what was in the programme and what I thought was in the interests of the country.' He did not know what Labour would put in its programme, but 'if they put in the policies that they have at present outlined, we would certainly vote against that'. At the final morning's press conference, where he was flanked by senior cabinet colleagues, Mr Major said the party's evidence showed that the Tories would get a clear majority. Setting out the stark choice between the parties over a range of issues from the economy and taxation to choice in housing and education, he added that if it were not for the 'bruises' caused by the recession he did not doubt that the Tories would have an increased majority. He also rejected any idea that he might regret having embarked on the health service reforms, which have been a focus for Labour claims of a 'two-tier' health service. The reforms were, he said, providing better health care for everyone, and he predicted that by the time of the election after today's, the overwhelming majority of people would be defending them. Later, he highlighted the movement back towards support for the Tories over recent days. 'I'm finding day after day that there is slippage back into our column, back into our camp, back into our sort of Britain,' he said on the steps of Dulwich Conservative Club. 'We have plans for the future of Britain that no other party can match, prospects for the future that no other party can deliver, and ambitions for the future that no other party can contemplate.' In Lewisham, where the Tories hold two seats by small majorities, Mr Major met again the man who signed him up for the Brixton Conservatives in the early 1960s, and was involved with him in soapbox politics. Mr Derek Stone, a builder from south London, said that he and Mr Major 'made a big stand, which we used to speak on on Saturday afternoons'.</p>

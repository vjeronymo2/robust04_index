			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH II;  </P> <P> OUR PICKS FOR THE BEST OF THE SUMMER;  </P> <P> ART  </P> <P> The big exhibition splashes in the aesthetic summer swelter will come mainly to  the County Museum of Art. It launches the season June 17 with "A Primal  Spirit," a timely and ambitious extravaganza devoted to the work of 10 Japanese  sculptors.  </P> <P> Ever since Japan became a world economic power and started paying millions for  Van Gogh, we've been curious about what their own artists are up to. Names  represented in this show are strange to these shores, but anyone who knows of  Zen sand gardens, traditional Japanese respect for nature and love of drama may  find familiar echoes.  </P> <P> Artists often work in the form of big room-filling constructions using natural  materials such as wood and stone, minerals and metal. We are talking big here.  </P> <P> Don't be surprised to see huge tree-trunks bent like pretzels, sculpture that  has been purposely incinerated for that char-broiled look or forms that appear  like huge volcanic rocks that are actually made from zillions of tiny ceramic  cubes. That's the traditional Japanese love of complex ingenuity afoot.  </P> <P> At very worst, "A Primal Spirit" promises boffo visual spectacle mixed with  some philosophical serenity before closing Aug. 26.  </P> <P> Such a curtain-raiser naturally presents the age-old question of what to do for  an encore.  </P> <P> The County Museum of Art's graceful answer and summer finale will be  "Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post Impressionism: The Annenberg  Collection" (Aug. 16-Nov. 11). When you combine a blue-chip selection of 50  paintings in the world's most beloved style with the first public in-depth look  at one of the finest compendiums of art still in private hands, you have a  win-win situation. Those who cannot resist a fascination with the lifestyles of  the rich and famous can imagine themselves at Walter Annenberg's estate near  Palm Springs. After golfing with Ronald Reagan and Prince Charles you stroll  into the house for a look at the five prime Van Goghs, the Monets, Degases and  the recognizable rest. For a moment, life is sweet.  </P> <P> In between, the museum will host a patrician Old Master collection that spans  the history of European art in 160 paintings and drawings from Titian to  Modigliani. It's "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum," a reknown repository  in Cambridge, England, that announces itself with the Masterpiece-Theater  subtitle, "The Increase of Learning and other Great Objects of the Noble  Foundation." Sounds edifying. Also sounds like a great browse through works by  artists from Rubens to Hogarth, Van Dyck to Delacroix (June 21-Sept. 9).  </P> <P> A late entry will be the Museum of Contemporary Arts show of New Yorker Tim  Rollins and his group called KOS. They are South Bronx street kids whom Rollins  has turned into bankable artists (July 3-Sept. 9.) There will also be good  reason to visit outposts near the ocean. The Newport Harbor Art Museum will  offer "Committed to Print" (July 15-Sept. 23). Current artistic concerns with  real-world matters will reflect in 144 prints by 108 artists artists in pursuit  of such themes as nuclear power, ecology, gender and race.  </P> <P> Architecture buffs will head further south for "Frank Lloyd Wright: The Realm  of Ideas" a major traveling retrospective visiting the San Diego Museum of Art  (July 23-Aug. 27).  </P> <P> A properly timed visit can also net the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's  "Satellite Intelligence: Boston/San Diego New Art Exchange" (June 15-Aug. 5).  The show will include 10 artists from each town and try to discover any  affinities that exist between two thriving art towns that nonetheless exist in  the shadow of the major art centers of New York and Los Angeles.  </P></p>

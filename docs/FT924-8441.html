			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / People: Jim Tilson joins Arcon Professor/Senator Richard Conroy, academic, politician, entrepreneur and the man in the centre of an unprecedented Irish corporate saga this year, is giving up more of his power at the natural resources company he founded. Arcon International Resources, which until recently was called Conroy Petroleum, has recruited Jim Tilson as chief operating officer. He will join Arcon in the new year and has been set the task of bringing the company's zinc-lead project at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, into development. Arcon hopes it will be Ireland's first big base metals mine in 20 years' time. Tilson, who is in his mid-50s, is a Northern Irishman with a wealth of international mining experience. Conroy says he was chosen partly because of his experience in managing the start-up of a Falconbridge nickel mine in Manitoba, Canada. In his student days at the Camborne School of Mines, Tilson was the winner of the mining prize. Since early 1990 he has been manager, production and technical services, to Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, where he has been responsible for a substantial increase in gold production. At Arcon he will join a number of new directors, including Tony O'Reilly junior, 25, recently brought back from the US to become the company's executive director - planning and corporate development. All this follows the bizarre events which saw Conroy and other directors thrown off the board after he had upset two big shareholders by buying one of Tony O'Reilly senior's oil companies. O'Reilly, Ireland's best-known businessman, subsequently increased his stake to take his shareholding in Arcon to 24.45 per cent and Conroy was reinstated. Observers suggest that O'Reilly is hobbling Conroy, who previously ran the company in autocratic style, by installing an executive committee to which Conroy, still chairman and chief executive, has to report. But Conroy laughs this off. 'As the company grows we need a professional structure and we are putting in some strong people. I'm very happy with it.'</p>

A vote cast by the  speaker will be estimated at five points, first deputy speaker -  four points, a committee chairman - one point, a deputy  committee chairman - 0.5 points. During vote-counting, every  point will be considered equal to 7 deputies' votes.    The "Russia's Choice" bloc which received 11 points in the  Duma council will have the best advantages. It is followed by  the "New Regional Policy" faction which collected 9.5 points,  the faction of the Liberal Democratic Party (9 points), the  Agrarian Party (8 points) and other factions in hierarchy  depending on the number of points they collected.    The council of the State Duma will consist of 15 members,  including the speaker and deputy speakers, heads of factions and  deputy groups, committees, chairmen of vote-counting and  mandatory commissions and a human rights commissioner.    The "weightlifting categories" of factions and parliamentary  groups are expected to play a decisive role when adopting draft  bills.</p>

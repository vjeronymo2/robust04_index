			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> FISHING BOAT RUNS AGROUND NEAR PIER  </P> <P> The 57-foot fishing boat Sharkfin was towed to safety early Tuesday, more than  an hour after the vessel and its six-member crew were temporarily grounded at  the surf line east of the Newport Beach Pier, officials said.  </P> <P> Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Beals said crew members of the San Pedro-based  vessel issued a distress signal about 2:30 a.m., expressing fears that the boat  was running aground.  </P> <P> The crew then lost communication with Coast Guard officers in Long Beach, but a  Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County Sheriff's Department boat later found  the Sharkfin caught in the waves close to shore.  </P> <P> Craig Farmer, a Newport Beach marine safety officer, said two of the boat's six  passengers climbed into a tender -- a small boat -- and attempted to pull the  Sharkfin out of the sand. But Farmer said a wave capsized the boat, throwing  the men in the water.  </P> <P> "The wave just picked them up and turned their little boat upside down," Farmer  said. "They crawled out and walked to shore."  </P> <P> Beals said another fishing boat, the Pamela Rose, later towed the Sharkfin to  deeper waters. Beals said Coast Guard officials did not know why the vessel ran  aground.  </P></p>

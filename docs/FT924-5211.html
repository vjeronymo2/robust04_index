			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee delegates show little urgency TALKS ON a new international coffee pact have got off to a slow start this week, revealing that there is little urgency to meet the deadline of the end of this year for agreement. Yesterday delegates to the International Coffee Organisation in London were discussing for the first time the issue of selectivity - basically, allowing consumers to choose what sort of coffee should be allowed on to the market. In the past, rigid export quotas were set for robusta and arabica coffees, leading to imbalances between supply and demand. Although the talks are not due to end until next Wednesday, delegates already appear resigned to extending the December 31 deadline. Mr Myles Frechette, delegate for the US, the biggest consumer, has insisted that his country's negotiating position has not changed following the election of the new president. The coffee agreement would be way down the list of priorities for the new Clinton administration, he said. Mr Frechette also believes the US will remain committed to getting a coffee agreement - a key element in the war against Colombian drug barons. Producers appear to have heeded a call earlier this month from Mr Alexandre Beltrao, chief executive of the ICO, for greater co-operation among exporting countries in order to make any future pact successful. African exporters agreed at a meeting of their own last week to recommend that producers should take the major responsibility for stopping illegal exports. They had previously argued that consumers should bear an equal responsibility. The exporting countries are certainly anxious not to rock the boat during these talks even if agreement is delayed. Coffee prices have recently touched nine-month highs, but the markets are likely to retreat again on any signs of disagreement at the ICO.</p>

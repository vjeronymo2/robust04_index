			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Deadline nears for BES relief THE DEADLINE for carrying forward BES tax relief from the last tax year is October 5. The rules are complex but provide opportunities for those who did not shelter any funds from tax last year. Only half, at most, of any investment you make now can be carried back to 1991-92; even then, there is a limit of Pounds 5,000. Thus, if you invest Pounds 5,000, only Pounds 2,500 can be carried back; if you invest Pounds 45,000, just Pounds 5,000 can be carried back. This autumn's BES season has been overshadowed by the arrival of non-recourse loans from banks which sponsor schemes. These have been of no use to standard-rate taxpayers so far, but allow top-rate taxpayers to get a return after a year. But supplies of the two schemes offering such loans, sponsored by Close Brothers and Johnson Fry, are now exhausted. Three more conventional contracted-exit companies are still available; these are Accumulus, sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital and with a bank guarantee from Standard Chartered; Cavendish Wates, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson; and Airways Assured II. Scottish solicitor Neill Clerk is offering some more esoteric schemes. Unchained Growth II has covenants from developer Laing Homes and managing agent Graham Harvey - although not from any large financial institutions - to pay Pounds 1.40 in five years for every Pounds 1.00 invested now. Reversionary Gains IV is aiming to raise Pounds 2m to buy home reversions from the elderly. Meanwhile, a trading company called Spirit of 1992 is aiming to raise Pounds 750,000. The company will produce whisky on the Isle of Mull and aims to wind up within six years. There are no guarantees, and trading companies are inherently more speculative than property BES companies.</p>

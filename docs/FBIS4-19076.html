			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ole Nygaard: "One of Four Out"] </F>   [Text] There will be more than 6,000 fewer in the defense  forces in the next 10 years. That means about one-fourth of the  personnel.    Yesterday State Secretary Sigve Brekke presented the  Storting  a report on reorganization in the military. This will be the  greatest change any government sector has ever experienced. It  is to be done without any dismissals.    The officers' organizations are protesting, because the  Ministry of Defense wants to eliminate the right to employment  following graduation from the first level of the Defense School.  This means that officers will only get permanent employment  after they have been accepted to the second level.    The Central Organization of Officers and the Norwegian  Officers Union are reacting to the plan that makes officers only  temporary employees for up to six years before granting them  permanent employment. The defense chief and the Federation of  Labor Unions are against this change.    Officers enjoy particularly good conditions compared with  other groups: full salary while in training, a right to a  position afterward, and extremely good protection against losing  one's job. Brekke said that with a restructuring of the  magnitude the defense forces are now facing there has to be  greater flexibility when hiring.  <H5>  24,OOO Employed </H5>   The defense forces have about 24,000 employees, which means  about one-fourth must go. The Ministry of Defense is going to  establish a resource organization to help each individual who  finds himself superfluous in the transition. There will be a  number of measures taken to stimulate departures.    After the slimming-down has been completed, defense costs  for  personnel will have been reduced by about 1.6 billion kroner per  year. In accordance with the long-term defense plan, these  savings will be used to improve the standard of materiel.    "I share the officers' view, and the consequences for the  professionals' education worry me. Still, this is better than I  had anticipated. I expected the government to suggest  eliminating the right to a salary during training," Hans J.  Rosjorde (Progress Party), chairman of the Defense Committee,  said.</p>

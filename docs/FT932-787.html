			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading COMMENTS from the UK chancellor on the budget deficit dashed any lingering hopes of a cut in interest rates and unsettled stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening of the September contracts on the FTSE-100 at 2,909, four points below its previous close, was the first indication of the effect of the chancellor's comments and by midday continuous selling in a thin market had driven September to the day's low of 2,901. Institutional business remained low but September managed to hold on to the premium through the session. Having hovered around the 2,905 level for a few hours, sporadic bargain hunting saw the contract finish at 2,908, two points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of 11 points on poor volume. Traded options ended the week in poor form. The last session of the week brought total volume of of 17,507 contracts. Most of that total came from activity in the stock options with Hanson leading the way with 2,104 lots, contracts followed Lonrho at 1,544.</p>

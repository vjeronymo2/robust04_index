			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed D.V.: "Dehaene's Post-Agusta Projects"] </F>   [Excerpt] Is the prime minister a follower of the  autosuggestion method? In presenting the government's future  projects during a BRT [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and  Television] radio program on Monday 24 January, was Jean-Luc  Dehaene seeking to drive out the demons -- no doubt of every  shape and size -- which lurk on the fringes of the "affair":  further risks of discrediting our politicians, the prospect of  future conflict relating to the same old community refrains, the  promise of heated debates on the subject of the division of the  social security system and, in short, of the State itself?    Anxious to reduce the temperature, the prime minister wants  to turn the page as soon as possible on this painful episode  which has struck at some of the very bases of democracy which  has found itself caught between the judiciary and politics.  Jean-Luc Dehaene has opened up the future of his team to the  third of the government's three main priorities: after the  institutional and budgetary priorities, completion of State  reform and achievement of the government's global plan without  a social pact, there is now the famous contract promised to the  citizen in favor of a society of greater solidarity.    But is this no more than a means of shifting the public's  attention away from this annoying "Agusta" affair? Jean-Luc  Dehaene seems serious when he speaks of the need to get to grips  with the ultimate priority of a reconstituted government. He  points out that the party presidents have confirmed their  determination to implement the governmental agreement and to  continue their cooperation until the end of the present  parliament: "It is the only way to achieve results with respect  to the three priorities of the governmental agreement" says  Jean-Luc Dehaene.    Conceding that following the institutional reforms and  budgetary affairs, the government's next priority of a society  of solidarity -- or what is referred to by some as the "contract  with the citizen" -- had remained rather in the background, the  prime minister adds that: "This is not to say that nothing has  been done in this area." By way of example, he cites the  modernization of the administration, the depoliticization of  appointments, the appointment of an ombudsman, a better  functioning of the legal system, security contracts, etc.  [passage omitted]</p>

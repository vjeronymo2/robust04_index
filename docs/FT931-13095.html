			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Harmony gold mine lifts Randgold A TURNROUND into profit at the Harmony gold mine helped Randgold, the gold arm of the Barlow Rand group, to record a R6.7m (Dollars 2.2m) after-tax profit during the December quarter compared to a R6.5m loss in the previous quarter. Harmony's performance, achieved with special government dispensation to blast on Sundays, and to blast more than once in 24 hours, could well be instrumental in hastening reform of restrictive laws which hamper productivity in the gold mining industry. A number of other marginal mines have sought similar government exemptions. Harmony made an after-tax profit during the quarter of R8.5m compared with a R5.7m loss the previous quarter. Mr John Turner, chairman, said permission to blast on Sundays, granted in September, had diminished closure risks. Elsewhere in the group, Durban Deep had a steady quarter with after-tax profits of R963,000, against R1m. Blyvoor lifted taxed profit to R4.3m from R1.5m. Losses at ERPM rose to R7m from R3.4m.</p>

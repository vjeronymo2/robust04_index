The spokesman quoted Li Peng as saying that both the Chinese  and U.S. sides elaborated their respective positions on the  most-favored nation trade status, human rights and other issues  during Christopher's four-day visit.    The Chinese side held that the discussions were useful in  helping to increase mutual understanding, Wu said.    Thanking Li for the detailed and all-round briefing,  Hosokawa  held that it is somewhat unwise to impose the western concepts  of democracy on other countries.    Moreover, he said, he also fully understands Li's viewpoint  and position on human rights, according to the spokesman.    Hosokawa recalled that China had played an active role for  the adoption of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights during  the World Conference on Human Rights last year.    Japan deems that it is the duty of all countries to work for  the materialization of the basic principles and guidelines of  the declaration, Hosokawa said.</p>

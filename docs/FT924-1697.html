			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Citroen expects new model to help it regain former market share CITROEN, the French carmaker which forms part of the Peugeot group, yesterday predicted that next year its newest model would help it more than regain the French market share it lost in 1992. Citroen, which yesterday presented its new Xantia, a sleek-looking upper medium-range saloon, has seen its French market share slip this year by 0.8 percentage points to 11 per cent. Mr Jacques Calvet, group chairman, yesterday said Citroen would recover its share of the national market to 13 per cent or 13.5 per cent in 1993. The Xantia's arrival on the market next March comes at a time when the French car industry is in a creative period, with a series of new models. They include the arrival over the past year of the Renault Safrane, top of the executive car market, to be followed next month by Renault's Twingo, an innovative small car of strikingly cheerful design. Mr Calvet said Citroen had gained European market share, despite its setback in the French market this year. It will have sold 766,300 vehicles overall in the 17 countries of western Europe in the 12 months to the end of December, representing a 5.7 per cent rise in car sales in a market down by 1 per cent. Mr Calvet predicted that the European car market would shrink by 4 per cent next year, in line with most other industry estimates. He expected Citroen's European market share to rise from 4.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent this year. Over the same period, the proportion of Citroen's production sold outside France will rise from 64 per cent to 67 per cent. Citroen's world production this year will, however, show a small decline, from 811,891 vehicles in 1991 to 790,700, due to the company's continuing campaign to reduce stocks. Renault Vehicules Industriels, the truckmaking subsidiary of Renault, yesterday confirmed a recent union announcement that it would lose 1,348 jobs next year, out of its current workforce of 16,874. The group cited as reasons the deep recession in the European truck market and its strategy of improving productivity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tadashi Sekizawa, chairman of the </F> Communication Industries Association of Japan and president of  Fujitsu Ltd., by economic news reporter Haruyuki Aikawa; last in  three-part series of interviews with key industrial leaders in  priority sectors under negotiation at the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, entitled: "The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework  Talks: My Arguments"; place and date not given]    [Text] [Aikawa] What is your impression of the framework  talks? [Sekizawa] The United States is seeking to set a share  for U.S.-made products on the Japanese market at the same level  as those secured by American manufacturers in the seven major  industrialized nations (G-7), except Japan. So it is a  numerical target, and it means managed trade.    [Aikawa] You must have had a bitter experience in agreeing  to the semiconductor accord.    [Sekizawa] All member companies of the Communication  Industries Association of Japan [CIAJ] are semiconductor users,  and an overwhelming number of them are semiconductor makers too.  To attain "the 20-percent share of foreign-made  semiconductors," efforts such as starting cooperation right from  the semiconductor development stage have been made."    The 20-percent share is neither a commitment nor a target.  Actually, it is taken as a point at issue. The United States  appears to think the semiconductor accord is the only successful  case. If a numerical target should be included in the accord on  the telecommunications sector, it is certain that the United  States will start trying to strenuously impose it on Japan. We  have had similar experiences, and that is why we are worried.    [Aikawa] The United States maintains that foreign-made  products have only a small share on the Japanese market. What  is your comment on this?    [Sekizawa] The share mentioned by the United States is at  the same level as that of other G-7 nations, but the share of  the private sector is included in the figure. According to a  CIAJ survey, the share of foreign-made products in government  procurement is 0.3 percent in the United States, and 1.6 percent  in Japan. The figure is small in both countries but the share  in Japan is larger than that in the United States. Therefore,  the argument maintained by the United States is based on shaky  ground.    [Aikawa] The United States also calls for including Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation [NTT] in the list of  organizations required to procure more foreign-made products.    [Sekizawa] Since the years when NTT was a public corporation  it has made efforts to keep procurement fair by treating both  Japanese and foreign companies without discrimination, and it  has procured products from American and European makers. When  the United States says "our companies are not included," we are  puzzled. Moreover, NTT has been turned into a private company.  The question is whether the same system connected with the  government can be applied to NTT. The question also arises when  this issue is viewed from the standpoint of protecting  stockholders' interests.    [Aikawa] Why is it that the share of foreign-made products  in government procurement is small?    [Sekizawa] In conducting government procurement, neither  Japan nor the United States will invite all foreign companies to  participate in the bidding. Moreover, another problem concerns  specifications, which are normally written in English in the  United States and in Japanese in Japan. According to standards  set at the GATT, however, I think efforts should be made to make  procurement procedures transparent. As a result, the amount of  office work on procurement will increase. Since costs will be  paid by taxes, the people will be asked to bear this new burden.    [Aikawa] What do you think of the principle of mutualism?    [Sekizawa] NTT holds business talks in the United States to  expand its procurement of foreign-made products. Although the  United States is not being asked to make the same effort, a  major precondition lies in the U.S. Government at least taking  similar measures in conducting its government procurement.    [Aikawa] Cooperation is being promoted among many companies  in the communications industry. What do you think of this?    [Sekizawa] This sector is becoming more global and  borderless. Cooperation is being promoted among companies of  various nations in different ways. The question is whether  there is any sense in deciding on the share for each country, as  this may have the adverse effect of obstructing the trend toward  cooperation.</p>

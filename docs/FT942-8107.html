			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Economists' battleground THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE by Richard Cockett HarperCollins Pounds 22.95, 390 pages Some of my best friends were Keynesians, I think. So it is stimulating to read a book which portrays John Maynard Keynes as the enemy of all sound policies, a man who sold his intellectual soul for political influence, and whose followers after his death tried to enslave Britain in the trammels of the corporatist state. Richard Cockett tells the story of an epic struggle against the evils of the Keynesian consensus which grew out of the unemployment in the 1930s in Britain and lasted until the glorious victory of May 4, 1979 when . . . but I anticipate. The new regime begins only in the final chapter, entitled 'The Heroic Age II' and lasts for a mere 23 pages. Cockett's theme is, rather, the battle of ideas in which the principles of liberal free-market economics were hammered and sharpened into a political instrument called Thatcherism. It is an exciting story because it deals, at one level, with the most important intellectual conflict of the 20th century  -between the forces for centralised planning and socialist government controls, against the old liberal tradition of individual freedom, unfettered markets and minimum government interference. The danger of Keynes, according to this account, was that he offered an illusory 'middle way', including the benefits of a managed economy (to end unemployment), but avoiding the evils of extreme socialism, communism and fascism. The leading critics, Edwin Cannan, Lionel Robbins and Friedrich von Hayek (at the London School of Economics) warned even in the late 1930s that this middle way led on to a slippery slope of increasing government intervention. Hayek, pointed out then, and later in his Road to Serfdom (1944), that governments which pumped money into the economy to create jobs would start a 'collectivist spiral'. It would lead, as another critic, Jacob Viner, put it, to 'a mad race between the printing presses and the business agents of the trade unions'. Were these liberals foretelling the traumas of the British economy 40 years later, when it was assailed by industrial strife, low growth and inflation? Cockett thinks so and claims that Keynes was 'running up the white flag on behalf of capitalism . . .' After the war, the yearning for a better society was so strong that Keynes's demand management and William Beveridge's welfare state became an orthodox faith. The flame of capitalist freedom was kept flickering by an assortment of pressure groups and by a more substantial band of liberal academics which Hayek gathered at Mont Pelerin in Switzerland in 1947. Their ideas were successfully popularised by the Institute of Economic Affairs (founded in 1955) and later also by the Centre for Policy Studies. Cockett tells his tale with the rather breathless spirit of a partisan (adopting the tone of an academic historian). Much of his material, one suspects, came directly from activists such as that pugnacious polemicist, Sir Alfred Sherman, former director of the CPS and adviser to Thatcher. Cockett is consequently much too kind to the counter revolutionaries, some of whom had some very silly ideas, and were later abandoned by Thatcher, for understandable reasons. In this battle of ideas, economists (including those in the Treasury and the London Business School in the 1970s and 1980s, for example) differed on much more subtle and pragmatic grounds than Cockett seems to understand. Few dispute, for example, that Keynes was right that the immediate cause of the dreadful unemployment during the 1930s was a failure of economic demand, whatever they say about later Keynesians. And Keynes told Hayek that he agreed with, and was deeply moved by, most of The Road to Serfdom. Most free marketeers, including Thatcher, accept that the state must play a big part in modern economies (and she scarcely reduced the proportion of national income dispensed by the state). Sensible Keynesians are much exercised by monetary policy, while monetarists think deeply about aggregate demand . . . So Cockett has interestingly described a battle for hearts and minds as seen by the infantry of the winning side, with scarcely a reference to what the enemy was saying. We view in bright technicolour what Sherman thought of Keynes and his snivelling disciples in the Treasury; but what would Keynes have said about Sherman? Or of Cockett for neglecting this point?</p>

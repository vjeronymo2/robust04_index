			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: FOR A TRENDY, LAST-MINUTE PRESENT, TRY A LIVING HAM  </P> <P> Stuck for a last-minute Christmas gift for the spouse or kids?  </P> <P> Want to be a trend-setter? Maybe a Chinese potbelly pig is just the thing.  </P> <P> Since arriving from China and Vietnam about six years ago, the pint-size  porkers have become popular in both Northern California and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A bit part in the movie "Air America" helped; so does a co-starring role in one  of Cal Worthington's car commercials.  </P> <P> If Pete Hupp, a former Encinitas resident now living in Butte County, has his  way, San Diego County will be the next hot spot. To test the market, he shipped  two of the mini-swine to a friend in Encinitas, who is advertising for buyers.  </P> <P> For $1,000 you can get either Lotus or Pearl, stout and covered with bristly  black hair. Maximum adult size: 20 inches tall, 80 pounds, belly almost  dragging the ground.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, ads buying and selling potbellies fill a column in the Sunday  newspaper. In Los Angeles, a Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn. has  formed to ensure that they're treated as pets rather than livestock on such  matters as zoning.  </P> <P> "We think the San Diego market is ripe for potbelly pigs," said Hupp, 38, a  nurse. "They're clean, affectionate and smart."  </P> <P> And a good investment maybe. In Sacramento, a brood sow with good bloodlines  goes for $3,000 or more.  </P> <P> Hupp sees the potbelly as the ideal modern pet, even for condo-dwellers:  quieter than a dog (a soft grunt), more solicitous than a cat, more intelligent  than goldfish.  </P> <P> True, the potbellies do share a characteristic with their behemoth brethren. On  warm days, they like to roll around in water or mud.  </P> <P> "You can easily take care of that need with a small wading pool in your back  yard or porch," Hupp said.  </P> <P> He figures that's a small price to pay for love and loyalty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Role-Playing Psychologist  </P> <P> Movie madness.  </P> <P> * There's always a local angle, even in "Godfather III," which opens on  Christmas.  </P> <P> La Jolla psychotherapist Linnda Durre has a bit part in a scene where Al Pacino  summons other Mafia dons to Atlantic City.  </P> <P> Durre plays a floozy cocktail waitress, dressed in gold lame top and stockings,  tangerine miniskirt and sequined bow tie and hat. Filmed in Cinecitta studio in  Rome.  </P> <P> Durre, who had gone to Italy for vacation, got the part through a friend. She  has studied acting, written a television pilot and attends a comedy workshop in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In between, she does family and marriage counseling.  </P> <P> * Depending on your taste, this is either good or bad news.  </P> <P> For many years, one of the busiest X-rated movie theaters in San Diego was the  Capri on Park Boulevard in Hillcrest.  </P> <P> Then Great American Savings Bank, which had a branch next door, got annoyed  with its steamy neighbor. It bought the property and booted the operator.  </P> <P> The theater reopened as the Park, showing foreign and artsy fare.  </P> <P> Now San Diego-based Great American has been bought by Wells Fargo. Rumors  spread that Wells, based in libertine San Francisco, might allow the return of  more profitable skin flicks.  </P> <P> But a Wells spokesman says no: The theater will remain high-brow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Betty-Watchers Wait for Bargains  </P> <P> There are plenty of people interested in buying a transcript of Betty  Broderick's first murder trial. So far, though, no sales.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, defense attorneys, journalists and the CBS entertainment division  have shown interest. But nobody wants to buy the first copy and pay full price.  </P> <P> The first copy of the estimated 3,000-page transcript will cost about $6,720.  Subsequent copies are about $2,520.  </P> <P> By law, the transcript is owned by the court reporter. The amount that can be  charged per page for a transcript is set by court regulation.  </P> <P> For budget-conscious Betty-watchers, a transcript of just her three days of  testimony should go for around $500, once the first full transcript is sold.  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / France set to tax dumping in attack on waste FRANCE yesterday launched an ambitious campaign against household and industrial waste. The scheme, drafted by Mr Brice Lalonde, environment minister, signals the Socialist administration's sensitivity to the Green party's growing popularity ahead of important regional elections in March. The proposals, if implemented, would cost the public and private sectors an estimated FFr15bn (Pounds 1.53bn) over 10 years. The government says they would give France one of the world's most advanced systems for controlling waste. They are similar to last autumn's German plan centred on an annual levy for collection of household refuse. The French proposals, which drew a hostile response from international packaging companies yesterday, would impose a FFr20 per tonne tax on the dumping of household and non-toxic industrial refuse. The tax is expected to raise FFr350m to FFr500m per year, enabling the government's environment and energy agency to open 160 waste treatment plants over the next decade. France's 6,700 public tips would be closed. Producers of packaged goods would have to pay a levy of three centimes a package. The project, adopted by the cabinet for presentation to parliament, would oblige producers or importers of consumer goods to take back packaging, or pay for a contractor to do so, from the start of next year. The Industrial Council for Packaging and the Environment (Incpen), which represents more than 60 international packaging groups, expressed strong misgivings. It said it was disappointed that many of the ideas for a more flexible approach sketched out in a report on packaging waste by Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of the BSN food group, appeared to have been abandoned. 'If the French go the German route it would be disastrous,' Incpen said yesterday. It has already lodged an official complaint with the European Commission arguing that the German recycling system threatened the free flow of trade across borders. Other industry groups, such as the European Recovery and Recycling Association, which represents consumer products companies and retailers, have argued that recycling schemes should be commercially driven rather than imposed. The tax is designed to encourage industry and individuals to reduce the 70m tonnes of waste they produce each year. Yesterday's proposals include far-reaching plans for dealing with toxic waste. These would require French companies to reach an agreement with the environment agency under which they would treat their own toxic waste or have it dealt with by specialists.

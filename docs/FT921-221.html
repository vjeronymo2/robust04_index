			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / French workers lose their fortress: The closure of the Billancourt plant signals the end of an era AN ERA of French industrial history ends today with the closure of the car plant on an island in the Seine, at Billancourt, where Renault, the state-owned car maker, began life 94 years ago. A white Renault 5, the last vehicle to be made there, came off the production line on Friday and was yesterday completing technical tests in a gloomy water-lapped shed. 'It was poignant and pathetic. We felt as if we were taking part in a funeral,' mourned union delegate Daniel Labbe, one of the last of the hundred or so workers there. The Billancourt plant was a dinosaur in the modern car industry, says Renault. It swallowed components via a narrow bridge, and disgorged them as vehicles into barges moored against its steep walls. Renault decided to close the plant with the loss of just over 4,000 jobs two years ago. Output has been shifted to more efficient sites in north-east France where the company operates rigorous Japanese-style stock control. Billancourt's demise symbolises the eagerness of today's French public sector to break with old traditions. Indeed, the island's stormy life resembles an alternative history of 20th century France. In 1898, Louis Renault, founder of the group, assembled a prototype in a shed on the bank, preserved today as a museum. Seven years later, the company began its first volume production of a model later known as the taxi de la Marne because of its role in the First World War when the government commandeered Paris's entire taxi fleet to carry infantry to fight the approaching Germans. After the war, Renault became the first French company to accept collective bargaining with workers, a development of great interest to the future Chinese Communist leader, Deng Xiaoping, who worked at Billancourt in 1925. But the plant's fate was anything but heroic. Nazi forces used it as a tank repair plant during the Second World War. Louis Renault was arrested for collaboration in 1944 and died in prison a year later. His company was confiscated and transformed into a regie, the equivalent of a public utility. Billancourt returned to its role as a laboratory of social policy after the war. Then, the company was run along corporatist lines through tacit agreement between the Communist-led CGT trade union, the Communist party and the state. The Kremlin-like hulk was dubbed the 'workers' fortress' by the CGT which held the balance of power between the state and unions for much of the plant's life. It set a pattern of industrial relations different from other western car companies, at least until the 1980s. Immediately after the war, the plant produced its first truly mass market model, the boxy little 4CV, at first available only in the sand yellow paint captured from Germany's Afrika Corps. Intense upheaval and strikes followed in the 1960s and 1970s, when Billancourt was a centre of left-wing politics - once the site of a meeting between the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and demonstrating workers. Billancourt's days began to draw to a close from the moment Renault was transformed, two years ago, from a regie into an autonomous state-owned company, in theory with less political interference and more freedom to close inefficient plants. The European Commission's attacks on state aid and the company's alliance with Volvo, the private sector Swedish car maker, hastened its shift away from the Billancourt days and into commercial reality. The question now is what happens to the site. Less than half an hour from the city centre and about 1km long by several hundred metres wide, it is believed to be worth up to FFr10bn (Pounds 1.03bn). Renault wants to move its company headquarters there, from the ugly aluminium-clad tower block on a nearby river bank. The rest of the land would be sold to the highest bidder, to pay for a Renault technical centre to be built near Paris. However, the finance ministry says the land belongs to the state. Billancourt could soon be the site of yet another great battle.</p>

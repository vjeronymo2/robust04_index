			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / BCCI secrets 'put on sale: Accountants accused of seeking documents deal with lawyer AN ACCOUNTANT seconded to the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International offered to sell highly confidential information from the inquiry and doctor evidence to help prevent the prosecutions of suspects, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday. Mr Mark Braley, 25, of Hayes, west London, and Mr Bernard Lynch, 28, an accountant of Forest Hill, south London, denied conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The men are accused of plotting between September and October last year to 'remove, substitute, destroy, deface or copy documents or provide information relating to the investigation into BCCI, Syed Ziauddin Ali Akbar, Sushma Puri and Christopher Williams'. Mr Timothy Langdale QC, prosecuting, said: 'The authorities in this country and the US were concerned that criminal offences appeared to have been committed by individuals involved in the administration of the bank (BCCI) and by other individuals associated with the bank. 'The SFO investigation was one that was and is - because it is still continuing - large-scale and wide-ranging. The banks and individuals whose activities merit inquiry are numerous.' Mr Akbar, a former BCCI official, was one of the individuals. Mr Langdale said the allegation was that Mr Braley and Mr Lynch put their heads together to supply documents and other confidential and sensitive information to Mr Michael Barratt, Mr Akbar's solicitor. 'They thought he would be bound to be interested in such material and would be ready to pay good money because it would assist his client in avoiding prosecution or, if prosecuted, would substantially reduce the effectiveness of the case against him.' He said the plan was frustrated because Mr Barratt went to the police after the initial approach, made by Mr Lynch. Mr Barratt was fitted with a concealed recording device and taped subsequent meetings. The jury, said Mr Langdale, would hear the tapes of meetings between the three men. 'Once Mr Braley's identity and purpose were revealed to the police investigators, he and Mr Lynch were arrested at the London hotel where the final meeting took place,' said Mr Langdale. He told the jury that the trial did not prejudge issues in the SFO inquiry. 'You will hear numbers of names mentioned of those in whom SFO had an interest,' he said. 'This trial does not in any way involve any consideration as to whether any of those people are guilty of any offences.' The SFO had assembled a large investigation team including lawyers, police and accountants, and Mr Braley had been on it. Mr Lynch had met Mr Barratt through their membership of the Barbican health and fitness centre in London. Mr Lynch had boasted that his clients included cabinet ministers and that he had contacts on the legal and surveillance teams at the SFO. In fact, the jury heard, he worked for a dairy firm and his only contact was Mr Braley. He told Mr Barratt he could have 'copies of almost anything within reason', but his contacts were not in it for 'peanuts'. Mr Braley had worked for Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, and was drafted into the BCCI investigation after failing his proficiency exams, the jury heard. The jury was also told that both men had pleaded guilty to conspiring corruptly to obtain a consideration from Mr Barratt and that Mr Braley had admitted the theft of four share certificates from HM Customs. The trial was adjourned until today.</p>

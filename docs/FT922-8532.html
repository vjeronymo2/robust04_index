			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / People: Civil servant joins Anglian Water Dinah Nichols, one of the senior civil servants responsible for the flotation of the water industry in England and Wales over two years ago, has joined Anglian Water, one of the 10 privatised companies, as a non-executive director. Nichols, 48, was head of the water directorate at the environment department in the run-up to flotation. She played a leading role in what was one of the most contentious and complex of all privatisations, and negotiated on water standards with the European Commission. 'We are proud to have her with us because of her wide experience of the industry,' says Roger Dickinson, Anglian's company secretary. There will be no conflict of interest because the department has been restructured following privatisation. Nichols is currently a deputy secretary in the environment department responsible for property holdings, construction and central support services. She has also been a director of a subsidiary of John Laing, the construction company. In the run-up to privatisation, when some of the former authorities were very hostile to ministers and environment department civil servants, Anglian Water, under the chairmanship of Bernard Henderson, took a more conciliatory stance. The close contacts with senior officials have continued. The company also announced the appointment of Jim Adams as an executive board member. Adams, 62, has been with Anglian for 18 years and is currently managing director of Anglian Water Engineering and Business Systems. The subsidiary is responsible for computer systems and for assessing projects on behalf of the core businesses of water supply and sewage treatment and disposal. ***** Albert Harrison, deputy md of ALLIED COLLOIDS GROUP, has died. ***** John Morse, formerly project director of BP Chemicals, has joined HONEYWELL's UK industrial automation &amp; controls division as director of engineering services. ***** Paul Hassin, previously sales and marketing director, of Microdot Aerospace, has been appointed sales director (Aerospace &amp; Defence) of BINTCLIFFE TURNER, a subsidiary of TT Group. ***** Patrick Scott, former md of Datavision, is appointed md of Satellite Information Services in succession to Christopher Stoddart. ***** Darryl Hughes, formerly director in charge of Racal-Decca Service, has been appointed md of CHUBB ALARMS, part of Racal Electronics. ***** Peter Fernihough is resigning from WYKO GROUP but becomes non-executive chairman of its UK distribution division. ***** Grant Findlay, previously group finance director of Continuous Stationery, has been appointed group finance director of TIP EUROPE.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manama, June 22 (AFP) -- UN weapons inspectors said  Wednesday [22 June] they were satisfied with Iraq's cooperation  during their nine-day fact-finding mission there.    The team of nine ballistic weapons experts received answers  to their questions about Iraq's missile programme, UN  coordinator Roald Opsahl said here.    Opsahl said the team wanted to "check earlier information"  on  Iraq's missile capacity. The United Nations has banned missiles  with a range of more than 150 kilometres (93 miles) in Iraq.    The team, led by Frenchman Patrice Palanque, returned to  Bahrain Wednesday and will now set up a long-term system to  monitor Iraqi weaponry, he said.    Another team of four members, led by Briton Gary Dillon,  arrived in Iraq Tuesday, Opsahl added.    The team is to install surveillance cameras at sites where  Iraq could restart its nuclear programme.    Meeting UN Security Council Resolution 687 on destroying its  weapons of mass destruction is a condition for lifting the UN  embargo on Baghdad, imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August  1990.</p>

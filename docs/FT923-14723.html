			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (1): Amato faces awesome task - The April general elections, in which an unprecedented fragmentation of the political parties complicated the formation of a new government, highlight the need for political reform.  Without it, the main economic issues will be hard to address ON PRESENT form, Italy would find it hard to comply with even the most benign interpretation of the demands for closer integrations laid down by the Treaty of Maastricht. The budget deficit has deteriorated during the course of the past six months at an alarming speed. By the end of the year, it could be 11 per cent of GDP, more than double that of its main EC partners. The deficit continues to be financed by state borrowing and total debt is equivalent to 103 per cent of GDP, more than 40 percentage points above the maximum permitted by Maastricht. Unless the treaty conditions are watered down, Italy has little more than two years to achieve major corrections in its budget deficit and the overall level of debt (roughly one third of all European debt). This is the awesome task now facing the country's 51st post-war government as it struggles to establish itself under Professor Giuliano Amato, the Socialist Party deputy leader. The government is based on the same four-party coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals as the previous one. However, in the April general elections the coalition was badly bruised by a large protest vote and its majority has shrunk to 16 in the 630-seat chamber of deputies. The new prime minister is an astute politician with a formidable intellect. He is thoroughly familiar with the country's plight and his programme says all the right things about tackling Italy's problems. He has singled out four priorities - correcting the budget deficit, fighting organised crime, introducing institutional reform and cleaning up public administration. But the precarious nature of Mr Amato's majority, combined with the increasing internal divisions among the parties, especially the Christian Democrats and his own Socialists, will oblige him to fight for every measure. Fresh elections are likely next year - if nothing else to consolidate political and economic reforms which are being promised. In the meantime, a weak coalition government must court unpopularity by cutting public spending on pensions and welfare benefits, while freezing public sector pay and transfers to local authorities. The politicians' track record has been one of indecision, sleight-of-hand or simply moving the goal-posts to preserve their privileges. Sceptics argue the prospect of genuine reform is more remote in the wake of the general elections because the parties are so much more fragmented and weakened by internal divisions. However, the reverse side of this coin is that the very weakness and divisions of the parties permit the government more room for manoeuvre. Furthermore, pressure for change is now stronger, precisely because so many of the country's political and economic structures have failed to adapt and now lag behind the rest of Europe. The April elections demonstrated conclusively that Italy's proportional representation system encourages unstable coalition governments: 16 parties were returned to parliament, 12 of whom had less than 6 per cent of the vote and only one more than 20 per cent. Whether it be the political system, the law or public services such as hospitals, the post and airports, Italy is at the bottom of the European league. Businesses complain ever more loudly that Italy is losing competitiveness because of the high cost and inadequacy of these services. Ordinary Italians are simply fed up having to cope with a malfunctioning state. This sense of frustration is evident in widespread support for the referendum movement - a movement that sees parliament as incapable of legislating for reform and thus seeks to impose legislation through referendums. As many as 10 referendums could be staged next year covering changes in proportional representation to tightening environmental controls. Disaffection with the system translated into a protest vote at the general elections. As a result, the long-running hegemony of the Christian Democrats has been seriously eroded and the political landscape redrawn by the emergence of the populist Lombard League which has become the second largest party in northern Italy. The league is campaigning for devolution of power to the regions and a complete overhaul of the 'partitocracy' - the incestuous relationship between political parties and the state apparatus which has grown up over the past four decades. The extent to which the parties have become entwined with the state has been highlighted by the five-month-old Milan municipal corruption scandal. Headed by the Socialists, the parties running the municipal administration have illicitly financed themselves on bribes from rigged contracts for a decade. The affair has involved Italy's leading construction companies as well as prominent politicians and continues to gather momentum with inquiries spreading out from Milan to embrace much of northern Italy. Such corruption has long been suspected and the real test of changing morality will be whether the clean-up extends to Rome and further south where political patronage buys votes and provides a safe umbrella behind which organised crime prospers. The will to act against organised crime has at last been stiffened by a combination of the sheer scale of Mafia activities and the brazen challenge to the state in the assassination in May of Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate whose motor convoy was destroyed by a tonne of explosives outside Palermo. The Falcone killing accelerated the election of a successor to Mr Francesco Cossiga as president. Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, an independent-minded Christian Democrat lawyer, was not the obvious choice but was elected on a broad cross-party alliance because he symbolised the public need for political honesty and independence. Though a conservative, he is emerging as a statesman determined to use his limited powers as head of state to the full to promote reform of the country's ossified institutions. The new government itself represents a transition between old and new formulas. The stalwarts of government like Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister and present in every administration for over four decades, are no longer there. Of the slimmed down 24-strong cabinet, 13 are first time ministers and six are 'technicians'. External events and pressures have played an important part in forcing change on Italy. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe has removed the fundamental Cold War divide in Italian politics between a Christian Democrat-led anti-communist majority and a Communist opposition. The Christian Democrats have to find a new raison d'etre; while the powerful Communists (PCI), deprived of their ideological prop, last year split between a mainstream social democrat grouping, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and a nostalgic Marxist rump. Issues have overtaken ideology, weakening the consistency of opposition in parliament and creating space for new players. Of equal importance, the demands of Brussels on Italy to conform with Community norms have begun to have an effect. The Italian habit of approving EC directives and then totally ignoring them is no longer so easy. Italy, for instance, has been caught out overproducing milk and risks being excluded from some of the benefits of agricultural reform. Subsidies to industry are more difficult to conceal, transfers to the south are smaller and deregulation is slowly coming onto the horizon in a number of services. At a technical level, Brussels is providing the much-needed framework within which economic and fiscal policy can be planned. The dictates of Maastricht regarding inflation rates, levels of debt and budget deficit are still taken seriously despite the uncertain impact of the Danish referendum. And where the technicians operate in the management of the exchange rate the commitment to the narrow band of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism is fully observed - even at high cost to the reserves. Between April 1991 and May 1992 defence of the lira has cost some L27,000bn. The lira is near its floor of 765 against the D-mark and since April short-term interest rates have moved to 15 per cent, a rise of nearly 3 percentage points since the elections. With inflation of 5.5 per cent, real interest rates are almost 10 per cent and the situation becomes like the dog chasing its tail: the debt stock increases as rates are raised to defend the lira and pay for the deficit. The present financial situation is clearly unsustainable and this in the end should serve to concentrate the politicians' minds.</p>

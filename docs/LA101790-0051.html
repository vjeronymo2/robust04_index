			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: OPEN WIDE, PLEASE, AND SAY 'ALLAH'  </P> <P> An amulet a day keeps the doctor away. Or: Spread a little of that camel dung  on my aching back, please.  </P> <P> U.S. military troops in Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield continue to  encounter the difficulties posed by heat, sand, scorpions and cultural  differences.  </P> <P> A confidential U.S. military memo being circulated to medical personnel both in  Saudi Arabia and stateside, including locally, warns about the differences  between the American and Saudi views of health and healing.  </P> <P> For example, don't expect a blood drive in downtown Riyadh to be very  successful:  </P> <P> "A large segment of the population believes that donating blood adversely  affects sexuality; this belief greatly impedes efforts to collect blood, even  if a relative's life depends on it."  </P> <P> Treatment of disease among nomadic tribes still follows "ancient barbaric  practices." To wit:  </P> <P> "For pain relief, the common practice is to apply heat. Hot irons are used to  brand infected areas and then hot camel dung is applied. Dental treatment  consists of pointed sticks plugged into cavities to relieve toothaches."  </P> <P> The memo provides strict rules to follow when "treating indigenous personnel in  the Persian Gulf area of operations."  </P> <P> Never touch, speak to or make eye contact with an Arab woman. Never turn off  the lights when examining either a man or woman, even to do an eye exam.  </P> <P> Never say admiring things about an Arab child because it might be perceived as  an evil gesture. Never remove amulets (usually shaped like an eye or hand) from  adults or children.  </P> <P> There has already been one culture clash, the memo says, when an "American  female flight line worker scandalized Saudi military personnel by removing her  uniform and working in a T-shirt."  </P> <P> As for U.S. military women, they can forget about sightseeing. The Saudi  religious police are ever watchful.  </P> <P> The eyes-only memo notes that there are two ways foreign women are not to be  seen in public in Saudi Arabia. If they're not escorted by men. If they are  escorted by men.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ante Up  </P> <P> It's in the cards.  </P> <P> As proprietors of city-regulated businesses, the operators of San Diego card  rooms have started to contribute to City Council candidates.  </P> <P> On Monday, the council voted 6 to 3 to help card rooms become more profitable  by increasing the hourly rate they can charge players.  </P> <P> The move was vigorously opposed by Police Chief Bob Burgreen, who says  undercover cops have spotted cheating, bookmaking and drugs at card rooms.  </P> <P> Two of the six council members siding with the card rooms over the police chief  have received campaign contributions from card room proprietors: Bob Filner and  Abbe Wolfsheimer.  </P> <P> * The San Diego school board race between Scott Harvey and John de Beck should  heat up considerably today when the two debate for an hour (11 a.m. to noon) on  KSDO radio.  </P> <P> Harvey plans to poke De Beck, a retired teacher, about a commentary he wrote  several years ago for the teachers union newsletter.  </P> <P> In it, De Beck endorsed the controversial idea that teachers have the right to  strike to resolve contract disputes with the school board.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Full-Time Retiree  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy is counting the days until retirement: 82 as of today. He's  also planning to keep busy.  </P> <P> He will be part-time executive director of the National Sheriff's Institute, an  arm of the National Sheriff's Assn., based in Alexandria, Va. He will organize  workshops and seminars.  </P> <P> He's also going to work with a developer to build a recreational camp in San  Diego County for law enforcement personnel and their families.  </P> <P> Duffy says he has three ironclad rules for job offers:  </P> <P> "I don't want to work for government. I don't want to work full time. And I  don't want to work with the news media."  </P></p>

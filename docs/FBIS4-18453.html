			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brittan Explains Reasons For </F> Supporting GATT "Social Clause"; as released by Brussels EUROPE]    [Excerpt] Speaking in the framework of a public hearing  organised by the Parliamentary Committee on External Economic  Relations of the European Parliament on "The Social Clause and  International Trade: What Stakes?," the European Commissioner  responsible for external economic relations, Sir Leon Brittan,  stressed the "clear objective" of the European Commission to  include social issues within the powers of the future World  Trade Organisation (WTO). "The challenge today is not to decide  whether or not to act in the social sphere, but how and when to  do so"; this must not be interpreted as a protectionist measure  as regards the less developed countries (for which cheap labour  is a sizeable economic factor). "At Marakesh, I propose to make  this clear, explaining why we are keen to include social issues  on the agenda of the WTO," Sir Leon announced, considering that  it will above all be a question of demonstrating that this is  not motivated by "protectionism, self-interest or opportunism";  this is why safeguard mechanisms against protectionist abuses in  this social clause will have to be set up. What mechanisms?  According to the Commissioner, above all, this  means:     -  Making sure that policy in this field is defined on  the basis of multilateral dialogue, not only involving the  developed countries, but also countries from the Third World  which are most concerned by this problem;    -  Establishing objective  criteria which will enable one to note whether a country is or  is not respecting the political line agreed in social  matters;    -  Setting a goal and introducing control and examination  mechanisms for cases where some countries should be accused of  acting against the agreed principles;    -  Making sure that any  action in this field is compatible with the other international  obligations agreed to by the community of States. Having said  that it was "crucial" that these safeguard measures be spelt out  within the new global trade structure "from the very outset,"  Sir Leon welcomed the proposal made by the trade unions  consisting in considering the standards established by the  International labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva as being valid  common criteria which could be discussed with the WTO. "This is  no doubt along the lines of thought of the Commission," he said,  as "pursuing the enforcement of ILO obligations worldwide is a  long-held European priority. We pursue it because it is in  principle right to do so, not because we expect material gain to  result."  <H5>  Reservations of Developing Countries </H5>   The Chairman of the EP's Committee on External Economic  Relations, Willy de Clercq, also pleaded in favour of including  the social clause in the new rules and structures for world  trade, considering that "freedom in trade, fair trade and the  protection of human dignity are not incompatible concepts, on  the contrary." The Philippines ambassador to the European Union  and chairman of the ASEAN Committee in Brussels, Mr. Pedrosa, on  the other hand, not only said that including the social clause  in the rules of international trade was an "inappropriate  remedy" ("we should rather be speaking of this in international  social fora, like the ILO and UNICEF"), but also affirmed that  it would be a "nontariff trade barrier and would be  protectionist" which would be "imposed" on developing countries  by developed ones.    Opposition by developing countries was moreover confirmed in  Geneva where -- in the framework of the GATT work preparing the  signing of the Uruguay Round accord -- work relating to the  draft ministerial declaration to be approved in Marakesh on 15  April was interrupted. The United States, indeed, wanted to  include explicit references to the "social clause," which the  developing countries refused. The GATT discussions on this  aspect of the draft declaration will be resumed next week: the  European Union has a more flexible position to the United  States, in the sense that it would regard as sufficient that the  social issue be inserted in the working programme of the future  World Trade Organinsation.

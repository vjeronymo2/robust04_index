			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Letter: Charities only in name Sir, Your article on Britain's Top 50 charities ('Fears grow for charities as cash crisis worsens', March 15) might usefully have highlighted two oddities apparent from the information presented. The first is the unusually high ratio of funds to expenditure: most charities could support present spending levels for years ahead despite even a sharp fall in current income. The second is the extension of charitable status to organisations which trade in every important respect like commercial companies but are conveniently exempt from the comparable tax burden. In no meaningful way are they directed towards helping disadvantaged members of society without due financial recompense. Such organisations warrant a separate description to distinguish them clearly from those whose activities reflect truly charitable intentions.

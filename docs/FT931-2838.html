			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / German recycling group gets green light to expand THE organisation at the centre of Germany's controversial national recycling system was yesterday given approval to expand its activities from the household sector to industry. The Federal Cartel Office in Berlin said Duales System Deutschland, which runs the Grune Punkt (green dot) system that collects for recycling 80 per cent of consumer packaging in Germany, can collect industrial packaging in the business sector. Consumers pay higher prices for the products bearing the green dot. The money then finances the activities of DSD which collects the packaging. The move had been fiercely attacked by independent waste collectors who claim that the cost-advantageous nationwide system prevented competition. Following the investigation by the Federal Cartel Office, DSD has offered to compensate independent waste collectors for the higher costs they incur. 'With this new system, small waste collectors will no longer be at a disadvantage and need not fear that they are being pushed away from the market,' Mr Jurgen Kiecker, spokesman for the Cartel Office, said. DSD was set up by 600 enterprises as a response to a law which said that industry must ensure the collecting and recycling of the packaging they produce. Today, DSD collects nearly all recyclable household waste and has been asked by the Lander to extend its operations to collecting industrial packaging. Thousands of shipyard engineering workers rallied in northern Germany yesterday to protest against job cuts and contract disputes, Reuter reports. The powerful IG Metall engineering union called simultaneous protest rallies across northern Germany, where shipyards face declining orders.</p>

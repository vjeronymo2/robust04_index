			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Chang Wanrong </F> (1603 8001 7127)]    [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and  Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray held talks at the  state palace on the morning of 29 April and exchanged in-depth  views on issues including bilateral relations.    The talks were held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. At  the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng said he was pleased to  have the opportunity of visiting Mongolia on the occasion of the  45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations  between China and Mongolia. He evaluated highly the  Sino-Mongolian exchanges and cooperation in the political,  economic and trade, science and technology, cultural, and  military fields. He said that China and Mongolia share a long  border, that Mongolia is China's important neighbor, and that  China attaches importance to friendly and good-neighbor  relationship with Mongolia.    Li Peng said the Chinese Government will abide by the  following five basic points in developing relations with  Mongolia:    First, adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful  Coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly  cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century.    Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and  territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice  of their own path of development.    Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the  basis  of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common  development and prosperity.    Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East  Asia; appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard  regional peace and stability; and support for Mongolia's policy  to become a nuclear-free zone, in not allowing foreign troops or  the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons or other  weapons of mass destruction in or through its territory.    Fifth, the Chinese Government is also willing to see  Mongolia  develop friendly relations with other countries.    Li Peng said that the consolidation and development of Sino-  Mongolian friendly relations is not only in keeping with the  fundamental interests of the two peoples but also will be  conducive to regional peace, stability, and development as well.    Li Peng said that the "Friendship and Mutual-Assistance  Treaty Between China and Mongolia" that was signed during  Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia in 1960 laid a foundation  for the development of relations between the two countries. Now  both the domestic situation in the two countries and the  international situation have undergone great changes. Taking  Mongolia's wishes into consideration and with a view to further  developing the friendly relations between China and Mongolia,  both sides have revised and perfected the treaty. Today we will  officially sign a new treaty of friendship and cooperation. He  said that the signing of this treaty will be an epoch-making  event in the history of bilateral ties. It will legally  establish the relationship of friendship and cooperation between  China and Mongolia. It will provide a new political basis for  future bilateral relations. It will also be a basic principle  for standardizing the handling of various bilateral affairs  between the two countries. This treaty will make China and  Mongolia even better friends and neighbors.    Jasray extended a warm welcome to Li Peng's visit. He said  that he agreed with Premier Li Peng's assessment of bilateral  ties. He said that Li Peng's significant visit coincides with  the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic  relations between Mongolia and China. The Mongolia Government  assesses highly China's major achievements in developing the  economy and in improving the people's living standards. A  stable and developing China and a China that is embarking on  reform and opening up is important for peace and stability in  Asia, in the Pacific, and in the world.    Jasray said that Mongolia's foreign policy is based on the  principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the  beliefs or size of a country. The development of friendly  relations with China and Russia, two large neighbors, is a  priority of Mongolian foreign policy. Mongolia will not only  develop relations with the Western and developed nations but it  also will strive to expand ties with Asian countries, in  particular those of East Asia.    Li Peng welcomed Mongolia's adoption of the policy of  attaching importance to its ties with China and Russia.    Jasray said that thanks to the efforts of the two  countries, relations between Mongolia and China have been  completely normalized and constantly developed and expanded in  recent years. The maintenance of high-level contacts between the  two countries has promoted the mutual trust between the two  countries and the two peoples. China's respect for Mongolia's  chosen method of development is very important for the further  expansion of friendship and cooperation between the two  countries. He pointed out that the Friendship and  Mutual-Assistance Treaty signed by the two countries in 1960 and  the joint communique of 1990 have played a positive role in  developing relations between the two countries. Today the two  countries will also revise and sign a new treaty of friendship  and cooperation. This treaty will surely become a legal basis  for long-term development of the friendly and cooperative  relations between Mongolia and China. Mongolia and China  already have signed a number of agreements on cooperation and  will sign more agreements on cooperation today. Therefore, the  development of Mongolian-Chinese relations will surely be very  smooth, which is in accord with the fundamental interests of the  two countries.    When touching on the economic and trade cooperation  relations  between the two countries, Li Peng said that the trade  relationship between China and Mongolia is developing very  rapidly, that bilateral trade is basically balanced, that the  two countries have signed a number of working-level agreements,  and that both countries have opened many border posts. China  has become Mongolia's second-largest trading partner. China is  willing to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with  Mongolia. In the area of economic cooperation, the two  countries may set up joint venture, establish enterprises in  each other's country, and further expand the sphere of  cooperation between the two countries.    Jasray said that Mongolia attaches importance to developing  trade relations with China and that he hopes the two countries  will further discuss ways and areas for enhanced cooperation.  He said that Mongolia also hopes to strengthen cooperation with  China in the area of investment and to make joint efforts so  that the cooperation between the localities and enterprises of  the two countries will become more effective. He added that  because Mongolia is a landlocked country, it is important to  solve the transportation problem when developing economic and  trade cooperation relations between the two countries. Mongolia  is willing to make continued efforts to improve and enhance  conditions in this regard.    Jasray appreciated Li Peng's support for Mongolia becoming a  nuclear-free zone. He also expressed satisfaction over the good  cooperative relations between the two countries in the cultural  and other fields.    Jasray said that the Mongolian Government and people  appreciate the Chinese Government's understanding of their  economic difficulties and the economic assistance that China has  provided to Mongolia.    Jasray reaffirmed that the PRC is the sole legitimate  government of China, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of  China's territory, and that the Mongolian Government will not  enter into any official relations with Taiwan. Premier Li Peng  expressed appreciation for this stand.    Li Peng extended an invitation to Jasray to visit China at  his convenience, an invitation which Jasray accepted with  pleasure.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Unofficial negotiations at the vice ministerial  level have started, and moves toward reopening the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks have gathered momentum recently.    The insurance sector, which has been listed as one of the  priority sectors along with government procurement and  automobiles and auto parts, was "nearing agreement" during the  negotiations in February, and this time, an agreement is  considered to be highly probable if negotiations are resumed.  The focal issue from now on will be how to handle the issue of  delaying liberalization in the "third sector" insurance covering  injuries, illnesses, nursing services, and so forth, where  foreign insurance companies have a relative advantage. The  Finance Ministry expresses "confidence in concluding the  negotiations," and recently, a plan to "work for agreement by  postponing" liberalization in the "third sector" has been  rapidly gaining acceptance.    During an 18 May speech before representatives of the  insurance industry, Jim Foster, councilor (in charge of trade  policy) at the U.S. Embassy's economic office, made a statement  to the effect that: "Unlike automobiles and other sectors where  private companies' cooperation is easy to come by, in the  insurance sector, which is covered by numerous regulations, it  is not appropriate to set objective criteria, such as market  share or growth rate." This can be taken as a signal that the  United States may not necessarily insist on numerical targets.  Many in the industry have begun to speculate that the United  States "has shifted to a softer attitude in insurance"  (according to an industry source).    The pending issues in this sector include: how to handle the  "third sector," and how to correct the practice of contracting  for insurance policies based on "keiretsu" relationships. Other  U.S. demands, such as clarifying standards for granting licenses  and product certification, flexibility in approving new products  and premium rates, and introducing a "broker" system for  recommending insurance companies for the clients' benefit, have  already been included as voluntary Japanese Government measures  in the "outline of external economic policy reforms" issued in  late March.    With regard to the "keiretsu" issue, Japan argues that "it  is  not proper for the government to meddle in private sector  transactions," and "the United States is also showing a certain  measure of understanding" (according to the Finance Ministry).    For the above reasons, the focus is now being narrowed down  to how to deal with "third sector" insurance, where AIU  [American International Underwriters] Japan and other foreign  companies are doing brisk business. Under the present plan for  insurance system reform, life and nonlife insurance companies  operating in Japan will be allowed to participate in this sector  within two years. Threatened by this, U.S. companies complain  that "deregulation in this sector is unfair." Since this demand  to delay liberalization runs counter to the general trend of  deregulation, Japan has been obviously distressed.    The Finance Ministry, which is in charge of this issue, is  cautious to state that "the negotiation process is in progress;  we cannot show all our cards." On the other hand, the Insurance  Council's report openly recommends that "schedule and method of  implementation should take into consideration the position of  foreign insurance companies." Senior Finance Ministry officials  believe that "a pledge to foreign countries has to be  fulfilled." It seems that Japan may be forced to compromise.</p>

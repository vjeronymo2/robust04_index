			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FULL U.S. DEREGULATION WOULD KILL BANKING  </P> <P> It is remarkable how a supposedly learned economist such as Allan H. Meltzer  can be so ignorant of history in his "Deposit Insurance System Was Culprit in  S&amp;L Mess" (Sept. 16).  </P> <P> To jolt Meltzer's faltering memory: In 1932 a series of bank failures prompted  a run on the banks by depositors who feared losing their life savings.  </P> <P> In March, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a bank moratorium and  the banks were closed until the panic was over. Deposit insurance was enacted  to guarantee deposits in an effort to avoid similar panic situations in the  future. The bank failures were caused by mounting losses in the bloated values  of bank assets because of wide speculation before the Depression.  </P> <P> The 1980s has been a period of rising speculation, with inflationary real  estate values, equities and the like, accompanied by a tide of mergers financed  by high-risk, high-interest junk bonds.  </P> <P> The emerging economic downturn is bursting the bubble of speculation and the  destruction of capital is progressing from one region of the country to  another. The relaxation of banking industry regulation and the cuts in  regulatory staff during the Reagan Administration has intensified the debacle,  permitting fraud and high risk ventures that could have been controlled.  </P> <P> Meltzer points to "administrative failure, regulatory failure, failure of  congressional oversight and . . . flawed institutions." Yet he would eliminate  regulatory oversight and do away with deposit insurance, which would return us  to 1932 when millions lost their savings. Eliminating deposit insurance would  result in a mass exodus from the banking system and depositors would put their  money where they feel it will be more secure. Meltzer's proposals would  guarantee the destruction of the banking system.  </P> <P> STANLEY W. CATE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

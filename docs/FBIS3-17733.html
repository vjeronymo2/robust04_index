			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] The Sakhalin Oblast department of the Russian  Federal Counterintelligence Service summed up the results of its  operations for last year. According to the department's data,  workers' efforts resulted in the halting of the illegal export  by ship of 24 tonnes of nonferrous metals, 110 tonnes of Alaskan  pollock roe, and a large quantity of marine products valued at  722 million rubles [R].    The investigation of criminal matters by the department's  investigators last year resulted in the confiscation of  R11,915,000, $900,000 in U.S. currency, items and valuables  worth R3.2 billion, 338 grams of marijuana, more than 15 kg of  mercury, and a large quantity of ammunition.  Counterintelligence operatives uncovered and prevented a number  of attempts by using fake documents to defraud the oblast banks  of an amount that altogether exceeded R4 billion. Federal  Counterintelligence Service staffers estimate that as a result  of their operations, they have prevented an economic loss to  Russia totalling R5.8 billion.    According to information from the service's staffers, they  are currently tracking the development of contacts between  Japanese yakuza [Japanese underworld] and Russian mafia  structures aimed at smuggling fish and marine products and  establishing channels for delivering firearms and drugs to Japan  using fishing vessels and the merchant fleet.</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Ice cream maker requests bank to appoint receivers MR HENRY D Clarke Jr's hopes of building a UK ice-cream empire faded yesterday when Clarke Foods, which he chairs, asked National Westminster Bank to call in administrative receivers. Mr Ipe Jacob and Mr Neil Cooper of Robson Rhodes were appointed. Mr Jacob said he was optimistic that the company would survive through a restructuring or being sold as a going concern. He said 'most of us have grown up with Fiesta, Zoom, FAB and Mivvi (some of Clarke's products). It is important to preserve this essential ingredient of our epicurean heritage.' A number of interested parties have already contacted him and Guinness Mahon, Clarke's merchant bank. Guinness Mahon is working on a voluntary arrangement with Clarke's creditors. Clarke, which owns Lyons Maid, is the second-largest UK ice-cream maker after Unilever, which owns Wall's. Clarke employs 650 people of whom 100 were made redundant yesterday. Its shares, quoted on the USM, were suspended at 8p 10 days ago as the company sought an equity injection. It had been trying to arrange an overdraft facility with NatWest to provide working capital finance but needed to secure further equity finance first. The receivership is expected to cause a Pounds 7.6m extraordinary write-off at Hillsdown Holdings, the food group, which sold three ice-cream businesses to Clarke in March 1991 for Pounds 10.35m, taking an equity stake in return. Allied- Lyons, the brewing and food group which sold Lyons Maid to Clarke for Pounds 12m at the end of last year, is still owed Pounds 4.5m. Mr Clarke, an American ice cream fanatic, built the company out of Yelverton Investments. He and his family have 25 per cent of the group but any new equity investor is likely to dilute that stake, and other shareholders. Clarke had commissioning problems with new equipment in the early summer and was unable to supply retailers when the weather was hot. Late summer weather was cool and led to excess stocks. As well as trade creditors, Clarke's debts include a Pounds 3m term loan from NatWest, Pounds 2.5m drawn under an invoice discounting facility, Pounds 5m of finance leases from Alfa-Laval, from which Clarke had bought the new equipment, and the Pounds 4.5m loan note from Allied-Lyons.</p>

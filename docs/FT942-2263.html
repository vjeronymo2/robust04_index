			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (2): The boat starts to rock / John Gapper finds competition is growing in the commercial sector For the private banks which still dominate retail banking in Spain despite growing competition from savings banks, this is already an unsettling year. It started uncomfortably with the dismissal of Banco Espanol de Credito's (Banesto's) management and shows few signs of short-term improvement. The removal of Mario Conde as president of Banesto by the Bank of Spain and the subsequent restructuring in which Banco Santander took a controlling stake unsettled investors in the private banks. Shares in banks with industrial holdings such as Banco Central Hispano suffered a loss of confidence. Six months on from the drama, which embroiled the US bank JP Morgan because of its dual role as Banesto's adviser and an investor in Banesto through its Corsair fund, stability has been restored. The central bank is generally held to have wielded supervisory powers effectively if drastically. Yet Banesto is likely to remain a weight on Santander, and therefore influence the dynamics of retail banking, for at least two years. Santander must prove that it is able to gain value from its bid of Pta762 (Dollars 5.52) per share for Banesto, a bid which was greeted with scepticism by the stock market. The acquisition of Banesto is a significant step in the process of the consolidation of Spanish banking from the old 'big seven' banks to four big banks - Santander/Banesto, Central Hispano, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Argentaria, the collection of former state-run banks that were partly privatised a year ago. One effect of the purchase is to move Santander closer to its ambition to be a rival to banks such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank. That means a bank with strong roots in retail banking in its home country, but with a strong global and investment and commercial banking presence. But in its home market, some rivals hope that it has at least bitten off enough in Banesto to offset the effects of its sustained effort to raise market share over the past five years. Its launch of high interest savings accounts in 1989 was one of the formative incidents in increasing competition. Santander has chosen to keep Banesto as a separate group under the management of Alfredo Saenz. In spite of the clearing of the immediate asset problems caused by Mr Conde's expansion, other banks say that Mr Saenz has a tough task to instill some vigour in the managers of Banesto's rural branches. They hope that the task will dampen the competition for assets - particularly mortgages - and deposits, which intensified last year and early this year. Jorge Hay, Central Hispano's research director, says that net interest margins narrowed 'quite sharply' at some banks in the first quarter. This is a continuation of a long trend of narrowing margins following the emergence of true competition among banks. But last year's fall was dramatic  -private banks' average net interest margins fell by 0.5 percentage points from 3.24 per cent to 2.74 per cent between 1992 and 1993. That kind of fall is unsustainable. In 1993, it could be absorbed because banks made up all the loss of profit on lending business through bond and foreign exchange trading, including bond sale and repurchase. Profits were virtually guaranteed by falling short-term interest rates. The expectation of a further fall in interest rates caught banks out in the first quarter. Some tried to gain mortgages by pricing them virtually at the cost of funding, expecting margins to widen as interest rates fell. They no longer had windfall trading profits to cover this squeeze. Yet not all is gloom for the banks. There are hopes that the first half of the year will mark the bottom of their fortunes for a number of reasons: The shock of first and second quarter figures is likely to persuade banks of the folly of competing too strongly in a static market for loans. The second quarter fall from last year may be pronounced because the 1993 figure reflected windfall gains from the devaluation of the peseta. Spain's recovery now appears entrenched. Central Hispano is predicting a growth in demand for bank credit of 7 per cent this year, compared with a fall of 1 per cent last year. This should both improve volume, and ease pressure on margins from banks competing for limited demand. The fall in interest rates squeezed margins last year, but will gradually ease the burden of non-performing loans. Banks should be able to release provisions if the economy recovers sharply. They will also have to pay less to finance loans on which borrowers have suspended paying interest. These factors should ease some of the short-term pressures on banks. But the Banesto crisis and last year's squeeze on lending have raised long-term questions about the development of the sector. These concern growing competition from capital markets, and the future of banks' equity holdings. One reason for the Spanish banks' traditional profitability is that there has been relatively little 'disintermediation' - a bankers' term for the elimination of banks as intermediaries between investors, and issuers of financial instruments. This has been true of both wholesale and retail markets. Few large Spanish companies have easy access to commercial paper and medium-term note markets to raise finance, but are instead heavily dependent on bank finance. Similarly, retail customers have relied on bank and savings bank deposits as short-term investments rather than equities and bonds. However, there has been strong growth in bond-based mutual funds in the past year, encouraged both by falling inflation and tax breaks to finance the public sector deficit. A switch from bank deposits in the long-term would put pressure on banks' to rationalise their large branch networks. Companies are also likely to rely more on capital markets. They may have to do so, as banks such as Banesto and Central Hispano reduce equity holdings to free capital. But Spain could face structural problems if banks switch away from equity holdings before capital markets develop. Rod Frew, Lloyds Bank's chief manager for Spain, says that the sector has 'seen the end of growth in industrial holdings'. But he argues that banks could face equivalent problems if they simply replace equity stakes in companies with lower-return debt finance.</p>

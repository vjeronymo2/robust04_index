This will be carried  out as a 3-year project from this fiscal year, as comprehensive  research under the FY93 Science and Technology Promotion and  Coordination Budget. Through this research, an infection and  outbreak biological model, which is needed for R&amp;D on the  treatment of the disease, will be developed. Also, the living  environment (reproductive cycle) mechanism of HIV, which breaks  down the sophisticated immune system of an organism and  penetrates cells, will be studied and the technology to control  the multiplying and infection of the virus will be developed. It  appears that this will open up an important path to the  development of effective treatment of AIDS.    At present, the fact that an appropriate biological system  for experimentation has not been established is pointed out as a  factor that is hampering R&amp;D on the treatment of AIDS, and an  urgent response is required. The rapid reproductive cycle of HIV  and its extremely high variability also are substantial barriers  to R&amp;D.    To overcome these barriers, the comprehensive research  project will proceed based on three main tasks:    (1) Development of an infection and outbreak biological  model;    (2) Development of control technology aimed at the virus  multiplication process; and    (3) Development of control technology aimed at the virus  infection process. Participating research organizations include  STA's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, MHW's  National Institute of Health, MAFF's National Institute of  Animal Health, Kyoto University and Tokyo Medical and Dental  University.    The spread of the AIDS virus begins when it couples with CD4  (receptor) of a helper T-cell. That composite enters a cell and  begins to multiply, thus advancing to the next stage of  infection. The virus does not advance to infection if it does  not couple with the receptor. That is why the chimpanzee, which  can be infected by the virus, is being used as a biological  model in current AIDS research.    However, using chimpanzees hinders the efficiency of  research  because raising and testing chimpanzees is costly, according to  STA's R&amp;D Bureau.    Under this research project, the mouse, in which the  appropriate background at the gene level exists, will be  selected as the biological model to replace the chimpanzee. CD4  will be incorporated into the mouse to develop a biological  model that can be infected by HIV. However, infection is  difficult with just the incorporation of CD4. Infection  efficiency cannot be raised without the addition of a third  element, which human beings possess. Thus in this research  project, emphasis will be given to finding that third element  for infection.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris preoccupied with Suez sale of Victoire Wall Street's morning gains had a limited effect on bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS fell again as investors waited for further developments in the Suez disposal of its Groupe Victoire unit. After the close, Suez, off FFr8 at FFr303, announced that it was in advanced negotiations on the sale of the insurer to Commercial Union of the UK for approximately FFr12.5bn, less than the market consensus of some FFr15bn. The immediate reaction from analysts was that the deal was a disappointment for Suez, which had been virtually backed into concluding the deal yesterday following the withdrawal of a rival bidder, Generali of Italy, earlier in the week. The CAC-40 index ended off 7.67 at 2,020.72, a week's fall of 1 per cent, in average turnover of FFr3.7bn. Generale des Eaux remained weak, off FFr39 at FFr2,226 on the day and 7.6 per cent on the week. Rumours abounded and the group said that it had instructed a stock market supervisor to investigate recent sharp share movements. FRANKFURT's carmakers weakened further, but most banks extended their recovery after Tuesday's fall on loan loss rumours. The Dax index rose 3.76 to 2,133.08 on the session, 0.7 per cent down on the week, reviving to close at an Ibis indicated 2,143.58 by the end of the afternoon. Turnover fell from DM6bn to DM5.3bn. Volkswagen led carmakers down with a fall of DM7 to DM465.50 and Allianz was the front running financial, up DM36 at DM2,474. However, lower down the size scale, Deutsche Verkehrs-Bank dropped DM9.50 to DM210 after it forecast a large loss on loans to the collapsed sports surfaces company, Balsam. The big rise on the day came ahead of news. Viag's Klockner &amp; Co, said after hours that it was taking a majority stake in Computer 2000, Europe's largest distributor of computer peripherals; Computer 2000 had already risen DM63, or 9 per cent to DM773. AMSTERDAM prepared itself for the quotation on Monday of KPN, the post and telecommunications group, which was partially privatised last week. The AEX index ended up 1.45 at 406.71, a week's improvement of 1 per cent. Nedlloyd was again in focus, up Fl 3.70 to Fl 71.20 as the group forecast good earnings prospects for 1994. Hoare Govett yesterday raised its recommendation from hold to buy, citing the share's recent underperformance, low valuation and improved prospects for earnings growth. Philips put on 60 cents to Fl 53.70 after concluding a Dollars 2.5bn revolving stand-by credit facility. ZURICH drifted on profit-taking, the SMI index losing 13.4 to 2,763.8, still 1.3 per cent higher on the week. Against the trend, Ciba picked up SFr7 to SFr860 as an advisory committee recommended the US Food and Drug Administration to approve a combination drug for the treatment of hypertension. Sandoz continued to benefit from positive comment from analysts earlier in the week, with a SFr6 rise to SFr751. MILAN was dominated by technical trading ahead of next week's end of the monthly account and the real-time Mibtel index added 51 to 12,032 in muted turnover. Italcementi fell L176 to L16,095 after it said that its three-for-10 rights issue would be priced at L7,500 a share. MADRID followed Wall Street higher, the general index ending 2.22 higher at 325.51, its best of the day if fractionally lower on the week. Turnover was Pta29.3bn. Banks featured, with Santander up Pta110 at Pta5,020, but one of the biggest gains of the day came in Cofir, the holding company, which rose Pta23, or 4.8 per cent to Pta503. HELSINKI closed a disappointing week with the Hex index down 3.7 per cent, and 21.9 lower on the day at 1,712.4. Outokumpu, the metals and mining company, fell FM6.60 to FM85.20 as it added a rights issue to its results. VIENNA continued to climb in heavy turnover, anticipating a 'yes' vote in Sunday's EU referendum. The ATX index closed 16.87 higher at 1,084.52, 6 per cent up on the week, but traders warned that a 'no' vote could bring a heavy reversal on Monday.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun 10                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1411.64      1413.07      1412.19      1412.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1431.60      1432.76      1433.20      1434.25  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1412.43      1411.41      1410.94      1411.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1433.59      1432.76      1433.37      1432.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Jun 9     Jun 8     Jun 7     Jun 6     Jun 3 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1408.97   1420.74   1409.65   1418.61   1403.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1430.94   1439.28   1426.30   1433.30   1417.13  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 - 1413.94; 200 - 1435.18 Low/day: 100 - 1410.24  200 - 1431.53  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Courtaulds Textiles gloomy over upturn COURTAULDS TEXTILES, the UK's second biggest textiles and clothing manufacturer, issued a bleak warning on prospects for recovery yesterday, saying that 'there are no signs of improvement in trading conditions'. The company blamed 'the high level of European interest rates (which were) seriously depressing consumer spending and business confidence'. In addition 'the over-valuation of European currencies against the US dollar undermined competitiveness'. Without the dollar's fall, pre-tax profit would have risen by twice as much as it did, said the company. The statement came with the company's half-year results which showed a small improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17m from Pounds 16.6m in spite of a fall in turnover to Pounds 394.9m from Pounds 451.6m. Earnings per share rose to 12.7p (12.3p) and the dividend was raised to 4.4p (4.2p). The higher profits were largely the result of cost-cutting and strong cash flow to cut debt, said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive. 'It is a case of fewer people with less capital working harder in more difficult circumstances to make more money.' 'Even the strong businesses have had a tough time. Profits have been improved by cutting out the weak,' he said. The difficulties showed up at the operating level, where profits were down from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 19.7m. 'Chronic dollar weakness added to the pressure on margins,' said Mr Taylor. Courtaulds Textiles is especially exposed to the performance of the dollar against European currencies because it has 80 per cent of its production in Europe. The dollar's fall has left the company vulnerable to cheap imports from the Far East, where many currencies are dollar-linked. Adjusting for disposals, closures and foreign exchange transactions, turnover would have fallen only 3.5 per cent, instead of 12.6 per cent. Since Courtaulds Textiles was demerged from the chemicals company Courtaulds in March 1990, it has pursued a policy of tight control over costs, working capital and cash flow. That cash flow has been used to cut debt steadily from a gearing of 50 per cent at the time of the demerger to less than 5 per cent forecast for the end of the current year. This was reflected at the interim stage in a further fall in interest charges to Pounds 3.1m from Pounds 5.6m. There were exceptional charges of Pounds 2m. Courtaulds Textiles shares rose 13p to 386p. Details, Page 23</p>

Meanwhile, the  president of the Crimea knows better than anyone else that  political stability on the peninsula depends not on Simferopol  -- the key to stability is in other capitals.    "In Kiev and Moscow, Meshkov was referred to as a hostage of  political stability, who would be easy to blame in the event of  any exacerbation of the Crimean issue.    "It is no wonder that the Crimean president who is now  rooted  to the Crimean corridors of power, looks for new hostages among  Moscow politicians, not among little-known Simferopol officials:  yet another sensation marking Meshkov's visit was his proposal  to Yevgeniy Saburov, who, it would seem, was irrevocably pushed  away from real economic power, to head a Crimean government".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Yevgeniy  Saburov. "It is precisely representatives from Ukraine, who  constitute the flower of Russian economic science. Yavlinskiy  is from Lvov, Yasin from Odessa, Belkin from Kharkov," Saburov  said.    "Moscow has been all the time replenished wth cadres from  the  provinces... I return to the Crimea with the sole aim -- to  promote economic reforms on the peninsula. Its potential has  not been used to the full so far... It is too early to speak  about a specific programme. It is necessary to cast a more  attentive look around on the spot".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs a sensational item, in which it is  asserted that Georgian ex-President Zviad Gamsakhurdia "is alive  and will soon place himself at the head of a Georgian  government-in- exile in a foreign country. This was stated in a  rather categorical form by a Georgian Zviadista delegation who  paid an unofficial visit to Stavropol, to their sympathisers,  Russian nationalists, and the Georgian diaspora".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the fifth anniversary of the  withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and on the  consequences of that war for Russian society:    "The main thing is to show care for Afghan war veterans --  commissioned and non-commissioned officers -- for them to remain  on active duty and form the backbone of a new professional army,  to draw on the combat experience as the basis of the training of  troops, and to protect the people socially and morally".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on rumours about change in banknote  denomination and the rouble rate:    "The rumours that the denomination of banknotes is expected  to be changed and the rouble rate is expected to be set in a  one-to-one ratio against the U.S. dollar are a sheer invention".    The newspaper quotes Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman  of  the Central Bank of Russia, as saying that he believes that "the  question of a change in banknote denomination is usually raised  only after prices in a country stabilise."    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries an interview with Yuriy Shafranik,  Russian minister of fuel and power, who emphasises that  "notwithstanding the overall slump in the Russian industry by  16-17 percent on average, our fuel-producing sectors operated in  a relatively steady way. Oil production decreased by only 12  percent, that of coal by nine percent, gas by three percent, and  the generation of electric power by six percent, thereby  ensuring a sufficiently stable provision of the national economy  with energy resources".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA runs an an article by Yegor Ligachev,  former Politburo member of the Soviet Communist Party Central  Committee, who writes: "The work of the parties that are members  of the Communist Parties' Union -- CPSU is as if a continuation  of the CPSU activities but proceeds under new conditions. This  must be taken into account. Previously the party set itself as  a task to broaden the social and political rights of citizens,  whereas now the point is to restore them".    PRAVDA carries a Russian Communist Party statement, which  reads as follows:    "One has to state with deep regret that a campaign to  destroy  monuments of Russian and Soviet history and culture was launched  on a large scale in the country in recent years. Monuments are  pulled down and destroyed, the names of towns, streets, and  squares are changed, and museums are closed down. Matters went  to such lengths that the study of the creative legacy of a  number of great Russian writers has been removed from school  programmes, and the study of the country's recent history has  been narrowed unbelievably".</p>

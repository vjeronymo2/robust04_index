			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIA PEACE MISSION OKD FOR GORBACHEV  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party, trying to prevent a far-reaching split in its  ranks, Tuesday authorized President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other senior  leaders to undertake a peace mission to the Soviet Baltic republic of  Lithuania, whose Communist Party declared its independence from Moscow last  week.  </P> <P> While some members of the Soviet party's policy-making Central Committee had  demanded the Lithuanians' expulsion, the committee as a whole supported  Gorbachev in seeking a compromise, party officials said after a two-day  emergency meeting on the crisis.  </P> <P> Vadim A. Medvedev, a member of the party's ruling Politburo and its ideology  secretary, told a news conference that Gorbachev will travel to Lithuania  shortly with other members of the Soviet leadership for a series of broad  discussions with Lithuanian party members.  </P> <P> The 250-member Central Committee will resume its meeting next month to discuss  what action to take.  </P> <P> Describing the mission as "really a massive campaign, a very serious effort"  aimed at persuading the 200,000 Lithuanian Communists to remain members of the  Soviet party, Medvedev said the Central Committee wants "a compromise taking  into account the real situation in that republic."  </P> <P> "We have to work politically with Communists in Lithuania to find out  everything there," he said, "and on the basis of that understanding, to find a  solution."  </P> <P> Medvedev said the Central Committee had fully endorsed Gorbachev's rejection of  the Lithuanian action at a party congress last week as a blow to "our hopes and  plans for renewing socialist society in the spirit of humanism and democracy."  He added that the committee supports the Soviet leader's assertion of the need  for "a single, firm and powerful Soviet Union" to ensure the country's progress  as well as international stability.  </P> <P> But committee members, even after two days of debate, were deeply divided on  how to respond to the Lithuanian move, which threatens the Communist Party's  sacred principle of party unity as well as posing an unprecedented challenge to  the country's central leadership.  </P> <P> Medvedev said that a number of the 46 speakers at the meeting demanded the  abrogation of the Lithuanian action and the expulsion from the Soviet party of  the Lithuanian leadership. But he said others had called with equal vigor for  an understanding of the situation in Lithuania, where the party faces a tough  election in two months, and had urged a compromise.  </P> <P> The debate was so sharp and bitter, in fact, that only Gorbachev's report --  and, presumably, his concluding speech -- will be published, lest the comments  of the other speakers expose the deep rifts within the leadership and further  inflame passions.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian question, however, is of crucial importance for the Soviet  Communist Party, because this is the first time in nearly 70 years that the  central leadership has faced such a major factional challenge. At issue is not  only the independence of the Lithuanian Communists as a national party but also  the political philosophy, program and tactics that they will follow.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking Monday to the Central Committee, made clear that the entire  party's future is in the balance as he rejected the Lithuanians' declaration of  independence.  </P> <P> "No part of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is entitled to decide the  question of its independent existence on the basis of its own program and rules  without taking into account the positions of the Soviet Communist Party as a  whole," he said. "This means that the Lithuanian Communist Party remains an  integral part of the single Communist Party of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> He warned that the Soviet leadership "will not permit the breakup of the  federal state" but will seek, as he has said before, to restructure the Soviet  state as a true federation of constituent republics, each having maximum  autonomy.  </P> <P> Medvedev, briefing journalists at the end of the two-day session, emphasized  the party's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the present crisis and ruled  out any use of force by Moscow to impose its will on the rebellious  Lithuanians.  </P> <P> "We are against military means," Medvedev declared as correspondents pressed  him on how the central party leadership would prevent this political schism  from turning into full-scale secession. "In this case, as well as in others, we  stand for political methods of solving all problems, and we will use them to  solve problems in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> But Medvedev warned, as Gorbachev had done, that the leadership is preparing  legislation to curb secessionist movements. "The Soviet leadership, party and  state, will take the necessary measures to prevent the disintegration of the  Soviet Union," he said.  </P> <P> Calls for Lithuania's secession had greatly alarmed the central leadership, he  continued, and the Lithuanian party's declaration of independence from the  Soviet Communist Party had "removed the major barrier to prevent separatist,  secessionist tendencies."  </P> <P> The Lithuanian action had already brought many warnings that the Communist  Party and the Soviet Union itself are on the road to dissolution, and  nationalists in other republics -- including Lithuania's neighbors, Estonia and  Latvia; Armenia and Georgia in the south, and recently, Moldavia, Byelorussia  and the Ukraine -- have been watching Lithuania's fate closely.  </P> <P> Explaining legislation proposed by Gorbachev to prohibit groups from advocating  secession, Medvedev said: "The constitution contains the right to  self-determination, including the right of secession, but it does not include  anything about the right to promote secession. One thing is a constitutional  norm; the other is a matter of public policy."  </P> <P> There were also "quite evident differences" between the situation in Lithuania  and other Soviet republics, which are seeking various forms of autonomy,  sovereignty and independence, and the dramatic political transformation under  way in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "There is a distinction between these issues -- one involves the internal  affairs of foreign countries and the other the domestic affairs of the Soviet  Union as a single union of republics," Medvedev said, stressing the party's  need to take a firm stand on the future of the country.  </P> <P> Medvedev said the party leadership hopes to resolve the problem before the end  of January, when the Central Committee is scheduled to hold a major meeting on  plans for the national party congress next October. That session will discuss  proposed changes in the party platform, including far-reaching questions of  future philosophy and policy and the reorganization of the party structure.  </P> <P> Rejecting suggestions that the Central Committee has shown itself too  politically divided to act, Medvedev stressed the desire for compromise.  </P> <P> "For the time being, we do not have a full assessment of the Lithuanian party  congress," he said. "This will be made after members of the Politburo and  Central Committee go to Lithuania and have their discussions. We will then be  able to understand the situation in the republic better, and we will have  firsthand information taking into account the real situation there. Our  discussion will then . . . allow us to find a way out."  </P> <P> But Medvedev described the Lithuanian action as "a step that disrupts the unity  of the party" and added, "Efforts must now be made to prevent a chain reaction  from occurring."  </P> <P> The danger comes, he suggested, not only from nationalists in other republics  but from conservatives who used the action as a basis for their opposition to  perestroika, as Gorbachev's political and economic restructuring is known.  </P> <P> "Steps like that do discredit practical work on perestroika, and they can serve  as the basis for conservative attacks on perestroika," he said. "Here we are  dealing with the negative aftereffects -- that's self-evident -- and the  positive results are not visible. . . .  </P> <P> "This also encourages other forces (advocating) anti-democratic methods. . . .  Is this the road to democracy or to authoritarian methods? This time of  tensions and aggravation tempts people to apply anti-democratic methods."  </P> <P> Medvedev was extremely sensitive, however, to any suggestion that the admitted  divisions in the Central Committee implied criticism of Gorbachev. Barely two  weeks ago, the party leader had been ambushed by conservatives critical of his  reform policies and had silenced them only with a warning that he would resign  if he lost the committee's confidence.  </P> <P> The meeting had been "unanimous" in support of Gorbachev's "assessments and  conclusions," he said, and that unanimity included the Lithuanian participants.  </P> <P> In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in the  square before the cathedral in support of their party leadership and the  independence of the Lithuanian Communist Party.  </P> <P> But Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party first secretary, told Lithuanian  Radio that the Central Committee decision to send a mission to the republic was  "good and helpful."  </P> <P> Medvedev rejected as "tactical and not a matter of principle" the basic  Lithuanian argument for the independence of its Communist Party -- that the  party's prestige is so low that it is in danger of losing power in the February  republic elections and that only through establishing its independence from  Moscow can it regain its influence.  </P> <P> Breaking Ranks  </P></p>

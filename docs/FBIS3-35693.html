This was said in a  statement published by the LDP faction in the State Duma on  Friday.    According to the statement, a "meeting between Zhirinovskiy  and Russian Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik, where all  issues which could be interpreted in different ways will be  clarified, is expected to take place."    However, the faction's representatives warned that if the  criminal case "had not been initiated, since Zhirinovskiy had  received as yet no information on this from the investigating  bodies, those who were guilty of spreading the libel against the  LDP leader would bear legal and civil responsibility for this."    The Russian Prosecutor General's Office initiated a criminal  case against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the accusation mentioned  in provision 71 of the Criminal Code -- propaganda of war -- on  January 26. In accordance with the Criminal Code, Zhirinovskiy  may face from three to eight years in prison.</p>

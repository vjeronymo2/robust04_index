			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview by Leonor Figueiredo with George Stievenard; </F> place and date not given]    [Text] "The politicians are working without a network  in the drug area." DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS] was told this by  George Stievenard, indicated as the future director of the  European Observatory for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which held  its first meeting in Lisbon today. The major task is to lend  consistency to political decisions.    In charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of  European Communities' Secretariat General, he is viewed by the  experts as the likely future director of the observatory. The  commission has had a coordinating function since 1990, but it  was not until after the Treaty of Maastricht went into effect  that the dynamics for the creation of the European Observatory  for Drugs, with headquarters in Lisbon, began to take shape. The  Twelve want a coordinated action, based on the work of the  observatory, which is due to begin operating this year.    DN: What are the functions of the commission that  you head?    Stievenard: This commission analyzes the drug  problem, and is associated with a dozen general directorates  working on the issue. It also plans the commission's decisions  and its participation in the European agencies. With  coordinating functions since 1990, it resulted from the creation  of the European Committee To Combat Drugs, a high-level  political committee including the 12 national coordinators of  the battle against drugs, and the commission's coordinator, who  is a commissioner.    DN: What is the principal objective?    Stievenard: We want to determine the commission's  orientation and the coordinated positions of the Twelve in the  battle against drugs. We also want to pay attention to what is  being done sectorially, on the public health level, and in the  realm of foreign relations, specifically, involving cooperation  with Third World countries, the central, Asian, and Latin  American blocs, and the Mediterranean nations. It is important  that a coordinated action be selected among the 12 countries, in  the area of justice, according to the Treaty of Maastricht.    DN: Do you think that it will be easy to find a  global policy among the Twelve?    Stievenard: That is the most important aspect. In  the context of the political effort that we have made since  1990, the priority is to find a global strategy, in keeping with  the two European plans for fighting drugs, adopted two years ago  by the Council of Europe sessions held in Rome and Edinburgh.  They are largely intergovernmental plans because, before the  Treaty of Maastricht went into effect, there was no Community  jurisdiction over the matter. It is a system for coordinating  the national policies of the Twelve, dealing as consistently as  possible with the issues of public health, foreign and  international relations, and justice.    DN: Some Community countries have small drug  observatories. Will you seek in them the "know-how" for  establishing this European observatory?    Stievenard: The existing observatories have not  advanced beyond an embryonic stage; but the experience is  important. What was decided by the commission, quite concretely,  was to explore the possibility of creating a European  observatory for drugs and drug addiction. It all started there.  Since 1990 we have traveled to various member countries,  questioning them. We came face to face with the participants  working in the drug field, asking them how they would view this  observatory. On that basis, we made a technical study of the  future observatory. Oddly enough, to our great satisfaction, we  perceived that the position of the Twelve was no different. This  enabled us to move to the next phase: the creation of an agency  under Community law, and the regulations for creating the  observatory, adopted in February 1993. In October, we decided  that the headquarters would be in Lisbon; and we are now in  contact with the Portuguese authorities to put this observatory  into operation.    DN: Will the European Observatory begin working  this year?    Stievenard: It should start operating in  September, after the director is installed with an initial  staff. At the first meeting, (to be held today) at the Belem  Cultural Center, it will be decided who the members of the board  of administration will be. The council will have one  representative for each member state, chosen by each country  (Portugal will be represented by Father Feytor Pinto), with two  representatives from the commission in Brussels and two  designated by the European Parliament. The next phase, with the  holding of the first board of administration meeting, should  consist of the naming of its chairman. The second stage will  involve the designation of the director, but this will probably  not occur until the second observatory meeting, due to take  place in June.    DN: The observatory already has regulations. Would  you care to summarize them?    Stievenard: They contain major objectives, with a  twofold ambition. Relying on the national centers gathering  information on drugs in each country, we shall obtain an overall  view of the drug problem. In order to make political decisions,  we must have reliable information on what is happening in each  country, and in the Twelve as a whole. What is the status of  drug addiction; how many drug addicts are there? We don't know  that today. Every country has its own information system, but  the systems are not compatible; the definitions applied are not  the same. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a perspective on  the Twelve. The observatory will have that role, but its  particular aim will be to harmonize the criteria and definitions  increasingly, so that the situations in the various countries  can be compared.    DN: The policy of the Community nations on  repression, prevention, and treatment of drug addicts is like a  patchwork quilt. Each one has gone its own way....    Stievenard: The different policies among the  Twelve give us, besides the difficulty stemming from the  divergence, the opportunity to view the multiplicity of  experiences. This will be one of the basic functions of the  observatory: in other words, to learn about these experiences,  to compare them, and to take examples for a global strategy. It  will help to determine the political objectives.    DN: Will prevention be in the forefront of the  activities?    Stievenard: Prevention will be a priority of the  plan, as well as the aspects of repression and international  relations. The commission is preparing a draft plan of global  action on drugs for the European Union, covering the next five  years. The drug problem cannot be treated in a sectorialized or  independent manner.    DN: But there is an area of human rights between  repression and treatment.    Stievenard: It is a strategic and extremely  difficult area. Dialogue must be facilitated between police  authorities and health technicians.    DN: How will the information be shared?    Stievenard: The observatory has been created for  this purpose: to organize the information and make it accessible  to everyone, to all the technicians, whether they be in the  justice or public health field. That dialogue is necessary. But  we realize that this will be difficult to establish  spontaneously between the ministries of health and internal  administration in the respective countries. Dialogue is easier  on the level of the Twelve. When there are difficult relations  between ministries in the same country, it is better to  facilitate dialogue among ministries of different countries. The  Union can achieve this: by using the value of diplomacy in the  service of a global strategy for the battle against drugs.    DN: Are you confident about the observatory's  future?    Stievenard: Without any doubt; I don't see why it  would not work. Its function is not to substitute for politics,  but rather to treat the information in a technically sound  manner, so that it will be useful for the political decisions.  The politicians are working in this area without a network,  without a real knowledge of the subject that is essential for  making decisions, with an understanding of the cause.    DN: Do you favor harmonization of the member  states' laws?    Stievenard: That is a long way ahead. We started  with a situation, before the Treaty of Maastricht went into  effect, wherein we had 12 countries with their own policies. We  changed when the treaty took effect, allowing the member states  to choose the policy, but obliging them to cooperate within the  framework of the Union. What will happen within the next few  years (and we want this project to be in effect for the next  five years) is rapprochement and dialogue among the member  states. They retain the opportunity for doing what they want on  the national level, but they are obligated to cooperate; and the  observatory will furnish technical resources for reinforcing the  cooperation. They will make their selection by comparing  experiences. It is necessary to "create" that path. I am  confident. I believe in opening up dialogue among the states. It  will make them eliminate the negative consequences of their  individual choice, and they will be forced to include the  dimensions of the others. It is progress. The future will tell  whether it is necessary to go further.  <H5>  [Box, p 18] </H5>    -  The politicians are working in this area without a real  knowledge of the subject, which is essential for making  decisions, with an understanding of the cause.    -  The priority is  to find a global strategy for the European Union in the battle  against drugs.    -  The observatory should begin operating in  September, after the director is installed.    -  Prevention and  repression will be priorities in a European plan that will be in  effect during the next five years.    -  Dialogue must be facilitated  between police authorities and health technicians.</p>

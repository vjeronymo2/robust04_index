			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (15): Take a fiver for a visa - Businessman's guide Travel FOR THE European businessman reaching Turkey is easy, involving just a short flight and a range of routes and airlines, including the much-improved Turkish Airlines. The British are particularly well served, with Londoners able to choose whether to travel and then work half the day, or vice versa. But the British have to obtain a visa, which requires giving a Pounds 5 note  -no cheques accepted - to the police officer on arrival. Inside Turkey, Istanbul and Ankara are connected by regular air services and, for the more curious, an overnight train. In winter the train is recommended, not least because those who chose the site of Ankara's airport disregarded a shepherd's warning that he often lost his sheep in the fog. Other cities are also accessible by air, at reasonable prices. On land, car hire is expensive, but taxis are cheap. Make sure the driver restarts his meter, and do not be surprised when those in Ankara charge the night rate for travel to and from the airport. Do be surprised, however, if the driver understands your destination. He may well be from out of town and, unlike his London counterpart, will not have had to do 'the knowledge'. The A-Z of Istanbul is a good investment. It will also help you minimise your time in the town's impressive traffic jams. Accommodation No longer a problem in any of the major cities in Turkey. In Istanbul, the Swissotel and on the Bosporus, the Kempinski, are impressive while the Hilton and Sheraton have their devotees. Also just opening, are a Movenpick and Conrad. Good value can be obtained at the Divan, Marmara and Nippon. In Ankara, the Hilton and Sheraton rise side by side, with the Sheraton well served by the Ankara Business Centre. (Tel 420 3040). Telecommunications These are now good, with direct dial available from most hotel rooms. However, the Turkish PTT likes to challenge the user's ingenuity. Its latest move has been to change all Ankara numbers beginning with 1 so they now begin with 4 and all Istanbul numbers beginning with 1 so that they now begin with 2. Contacts Most major Western countries have commercial sections at both their embassies in Ankara - chasing state contracts - and their consulates in Istanbul. There are a number of Chambers of Commerce, of which the French is among the most active, and the British is good on agency information. The Austrian and German federations of industry have representatives in Istanbul. The Americans are also strong. On the Turkish side, foreign investors are advised to contact Yased, the Association of Foreign Capital Co-ordination (Tel 272 5094), and foreign traders, to explore the range of services offered by DEIK, the Foreign Economic Relations Council (Tel 243 4180), which is particularly strong on relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Independent consultants and research companies include IBS who are also authors of the 600-page service, Doing Business in Turkey (Tel. 231 0481). Other publications worth following are the OECD's annual surveys on Turkey; the monthlies - Business International's Turkey Monitor (London 071 493 6711) and the independent Turkey Monitor (London 081 881 3199), and Cornucopia, a striking Istanbul arts and life magazine (Istanbul 248 3607). Entertainment The Bosporus and old Istanbul are unique. Leave time to wander up and round them, or call on the Kahriye with its superb mosaics on the way to the airport. Ankara has less to offer but its castle and Museum of Anatolian Civilisations are interesting.</p>

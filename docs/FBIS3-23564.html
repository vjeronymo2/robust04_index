Calling the procuracy's charges against him in the plot  against President Mikhail Gorbachev a fantasy, he declared that,  being in Kiev on 18 August 1991, he did not present the  leadership of Ukraine with demands for supporting the GKChP and  instituting a state of emergency in western oblasts of the  republic, nor did he assign any missions of any kind to the  Commander-in-Chief, Black Sea Fleet regarding Belbek Airfield.  Varennikov emphasized that "none of this was within my  competence; I did not demand, I recommended."</p>

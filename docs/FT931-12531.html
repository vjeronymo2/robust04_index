			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / National or reginal pay bargaining NATIONAL or regional pay bargaining could replace the wages councils in some industries, says Incomes Data Services, the pay analyst. In a report on wages councils, IDS says medium-sized employers might form 'pay clubs' where employers informally exchanged information about pay.

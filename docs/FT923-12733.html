			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Philips multimedia manager resigns MR GASTON Bastiaens has quit as director of the Consumer Electronics division and general manager of the Interactive Media Systems group at Philips, the consumer electronics company. Mr Bastiaens, aged 45, who has been with Philips for 21 years, is joining Apple Computer in September, where he will head the US company's new consumer electronics products division. At Apple, which he will join as vice-president and general manager of its Personal Interactive Electronics (PIE) division, Mr Bastiaens will be responsible for the development and marketing efforts of Apple's new class of personal electronics products incorporating digital information. Mr Bastiaens was the driving force behind Philips' compact disk interactive (CD-I) business, a multimedia product which is one of three business areas the group is counting on to generate consumer interest and revive its flagging fortunes in the consumer electronics market. Multimedia, such as CD-I, is a new technology which combines video, text, data and sound. Electronics companies expect multimedia to sprout new electronics products and form a large market. Mr Bastiaens will look into the possibility of making Apple media products compatible with CD-I, Apple said. Representatives at Philips expressed their regret at Mr Bastiaens' move but said a replacement had been found.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SENTIMENTAL 'SING' HITS FEW HIGH NOTES  </P> <P> "Sing" (citywide) is a slack and sentimental tale in which a community in a  dying section of Brooklyn marshals its forces to stage its traditional  end-of-semester high school musical competition one last time. In his  directorial debut, composer Richard Baskin reveals none of the style that has  marked his film scores and other musical ventures. However, what  screenwriter-lyricist Dean Pitchford has provided him is little more than a  half-baked, heavily ethnic update of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland's old  "Let's Put on a Show" routines.  </P> <P> Black leather-jacketed street punk Dominic Zametti (Peter Dobson) has been  maneuvered into serving as choreographer for Brooklyn Central's final Sing by  his canny teacher Miss Lombardo (Lorraine Bracco). She is guiding the project  with the help of ace student Hannah Gottschalk (Jessica Steen) and fellow  teacher Mrs. DeVere (Patti La Belle, who gets to sing only one song,  contributing the film's liveliest moment). It's of little use that Dominic and  Hannah acknowledge their feelings for each other in the film's final moments.  "Sing" could have used that romance earlier, instead of such protracted  skirmishing between them that when Dominic does his hot "Dirty Dancing" number  his partner is, oddly enough, Miss Lombardo.  </P> <P> Tall and sexy, Dobson is luckier than the rest of the cast. His Dominic is  thrust believably into conflict about following his older brother into a life  of crime; he can only be surprised by the decency and commitment represented by  Hannah and his teacher. On the other hand, Hannah's conflict with her woebegone  widowed mother (Louise Lasser, intense in a thankless role), whom she can never  please, is too sketchy; we never learn why the mother oppresses a daughter who  is pretty, poised, mature, a good student and a hard worker at the family's  seedy diner. Bracco is never able to make anything close to the kind of vivid  impression she made as Tom Berenger's down-to-earth wife in "Someone to Watch  Over Me."  </P> <P> The Sing is actually a Brooklyn tradition, started in 1947 by music teacher  Belle Tillis; although now it's on the wane. Wouldn't you know that in "Sing"  (rated PG-13 for language) the musical update on "Romeo and Juliet" staged by  the sophomores, and the Atlantis fantasy of the competing seniors are  elaborate, hard-edged show biz offerings that exude the glitz and razzmatazz of  Broadway? With what these elaborate productions would realistically cost,  Brooklyn Central could have stayed open at least another semester. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

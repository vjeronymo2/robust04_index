			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHICAGO'S DENT IS BACK AND BOUNDING;  </P> <P> BEARS: WITH A FLYING TACKLE, A SACK AND A FUMBLE RECOVERY, DEFENSIVE LINEMAN  HELPS CART OFF RAM OFFENSE.  </P> <P> Desperate times demand desperate measures, which is why Chicago Bear Coach Mike  Ditka celebrated his upcoming one-year anniversary of his heart attack by  sending his blood pressure to new post-mellow heights.  </P> <P> Ditka ranted. He raved. He relieved Bear offensive coordinator Greg Landry of  his play-calling duties in mid-game. He jerked starting quarterback Mike  Tomczak from the lineup and replaced him with Jim Harbaugh. No one was spared.  </P> <P> "I yelled enough that I don't have any friends left," Ditka said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a much-criticized Bear secondary (ranked 25th against the pass),  resorted to superstition and switched from white to black turf shoes. This is  what happens when a team unfamiliar with losing finds itself in the middle of a  three-game winless streak.  </P> <P> "It was 'de-feet,' " safety Dave Duerson said. "It was just something for the  secondary to rally around."  </P> <P> Turns out that the Ditka tirade-athon was a waste of effort, nothing more than  filler for the 11 o'clock news. As for the Bear defensive backs and their  quaint notion of shoe changes -- please.  </P> <P> This was a game decided Sunday morning when Bear defensive end Richard Dent  walked, not limped, into the Soldier Field locker room. At last, his injured  right leg, the victim of a freak collision with a runaway food cart, was  healed. Dent was back and eager to introduce himself to various Ram linemen,  quarterbacks and running backs.  </P> <P> Hello, he said, to tailback Greg Bell, who was cut down by Dent's acrobatic  flying tackle early in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Howdy, he said, to Jim Everett after a sack and numerous other close calls.  </P> <P> Hi, there, he said, to offensive tackle Irv Pankey, who didn't fare quite as  well as the legendary food cart.  </P> <P> "We're just glad to have Richard back," Duerson said. "He made some incredible  plays out there. When Richard's on the field, you're going to have to designate  two guys to block him."  </P> <P> Said Ditka: "The addition of Richard Dent seemed to make a big difference."  </P> <P> Seemed? Dent was in the Ram backfield more than Gaston Green Sunday. And  Everett probably knows what brand of cologne Dent wears.  </P> <P> Then again, Ditka still can't entirely believe he lost Dent for a game because  a caterer's cart smacked into a tender thigh bruise. At one point, he  questioned the severity of the injury, to say nothing of Dent's dedication.  </P> <P> Now all is forgiven. Dent practiced this week and managed to dodge all moving  metal objects. In return, Ditka placed the former Super Bowl MVP back in the  lineup.  </P> <P> "A food cart can't stop me this time," Dent said.  </P> <P> Neither could the Rams, who tried a little bit of everything in their quest to  slow down Dent. Few things worked, as Dent often roamed free.  </P> <P> "We knew we had to win this game more than anything," Dent said. "We had to  play this game like it was the last game in our lives."  </P> <P> Melodrama aside, Dent managed to inspire a Bear team in dire need of something  other than Ditka's tired theatrics or the apparel changes of a battered  secondary.  </P> <P> "Definitely call it urgency," Duerson said.  </P> <P> Not since 1984 against the Raiders, said Duerson, had the Bears faced this sort  of critical regular-season game. Oddly enough, that was the same game that Dent  set a career high in solo tackles.  </P> <P> He was at it again Sunday, most noticeably with his tackle of Bell, whose back  appeared to be bent at a right angle.  </P> <P> "I didn't get a good view, but I heard it," Bear safety Markus Paul said. "I  heard the clack."  </P> <P> Or as Bear defensive tackle Steve McMichael explained: "Having Richard Dent  back . . . geezus!"  </P> <P> All Dent did was hurdle over the low block of Ram fullback Buford McGee and  then knock the bejabbers out of Bell, who took the handoff but a moment  earlier.  </P> <P> "He just surprised me with it, that's all," Bell said.  </P> <P> Well, not exactly. The tackle electrified a heretofore Anaheim Stadium-like  crowd, as well as the sluggish Bears.  </P> <P> "(McGee) came and cut me before, and he was laughing and talking about it,  saying he timed me right," Dent said. "Next time I knew that I had an  opportunity to make a good play. I was really hoping that the ball would come  out more than anything."  </P> <P> On the next Ram series, Dent got his wish. William Perry pried the ball from  Bell and Dent fell on it. The turnover resulted in a Bear touchdown six plays  later.  </P> <P> Dent even managed to get into a brief wrestling match with a frustrated  Everett. Nothing happened, except that Everett pointed at Dent and Dent pointed  back.  </P> <P> "I told him that wasn't necessary," Dent said, smiling.  </P> <P> Dent's contract expires at the end of this season, which makes him eligible for  the National Football League's version of free agency. Don't think he hasn't  thought of the financial possibilities.  </P> <P> "I don't follow anybody, I try to lead," he said. "I've been a leader since I  left home to go to college.  </P> <P> "I like doing things that people aren't used to seeing a big guy do."  </P> <P> The Rams saw. They wish they hadn't.  </P></p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Military used criminals to smear ANC A JUDICIAL inquiry into political violence in South Africa yesterday found that the army had used a convicted murderer to try to discredit the African National Congress (ANC), providing the most damaging evidence disclosed so far of state involvement in political unrest. Yesterday's statement from Judge Richard Goldstone, who heads a commission of inquiry set up by Pretoria to probe political violence, goes well beyond any previous official report on security force complicity in violence. Judge Goldstone said the commission had seized army documents showing that top military officers had last year sanctioned the use of criminals to discredit the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. The report could do severe political damage to Mr F W de Klerk's government, already under serious pressure after a spate of allegations of state involvement in political assassinations, as well as numerous corruption scandals and resignations of senior officials. Mr Justice Goldstone stopped short of declaring that the evidence proved the existence of an orchestrated campaign to undermine the ANC and foment violence, but he conceded that the documents provided 'some evidence' of such activity. Yesterday's revelations clearly suggest a deliberate strategy at senior levels of government to destabilise opposition groups like the ANC, and cast serious doubts on President de Klerk's frequent protestations - repeated yesterday in a BBC interview - that the government is innocent of involvement in violence. The documents seized by the Goldstone commission, on the contrary, show that the army's top intelligence officer, Gen Rudolf Badenhorst, had employed a convicted double murderer, Mr Ferdi Barnard, to 'compromise' ANC guerrillas by involving them in crime. 'For that purpose use would be made inter alia of prostitutes, homosexuals, shebeen (illegal bar) owners and drug dealers,' the inquiry statement said. Documents revealing the operation were seized when the commission, aided by the police, raided an operations unit of military intelligence. Mr Barnard has also been implicated by witnesses in a parallel inquest being held into the assassination of anti-apartheid activist David Webster in 1989. He was a member of the notorious Civil Co-operation Bureau, a government dirty-tricks agency disbanded by President de Klerk. Yesterday's evidence will increase pressure on Mr de Klerk to clear out top levels of the security forces before progress can be made to install an interim government.</p>

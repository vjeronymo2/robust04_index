			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MALARIA CASE PROMPTS SPRAYING ALONG BORDER  </P> <P> A confirmed case of malaria in the San Ysidro area has prompted County Health  Services to begin fogging procedures today in an attempt to reduce the number  of mosquitoes near the international border, said Gary Stephany, deputy  director of Environmental Health Services Thursday.  </P> <P> The fogging will start tonight and, weather permitting, continue through the  weekend, he said. Stephany said the fogging is in response to a high mosquito  population.  </P> <P> "We are taking this action to reduce the nuisance caused by mosquitoes and as a  precautionary measure to minimize the possibility of malaria transmission," he  said.  </P> <P> The fogging to administer pyrethrins, an insecticide registered with the  Environmental Protection Agency, will be conducted between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.,  said Stephany.  </P></p>

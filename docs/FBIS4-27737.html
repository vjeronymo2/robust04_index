			<p>BFN     [Text] The East Timor conference is now on its fourth day  in Manila. In a video taped message to the delegates, Timorese  rebel leader, Jose Ramos-Horta calls for negotiations to resolve  the conflict in East Timor which Indonesia annexed in 1976.  Horta was one of the foreign participants who were barred from  entering the country.    The conference has been discussing alleged human rights  violations in East Timor. During the conference the conveners  also discussed the peace plan drafted by Horta and was earlier  presented to the European Union in Brussels, Belgium in April  1992. The peace plan states that the people of East Timor hope  to build a society based on democracy and where the citizens are  conscious of their responsibilities.    The peace plan also envisage three phases that should be  undertaken upon withdrawal of Indonesian armed forces from East  Timor. First, the first two years will be set for the holding  of Indonesia-Portugal talks under the auspices of the United  Nations Secretary General and with the participation of the East  Timorese people. Phase two is anchored on a five-year  transition stage in which East Timorese would govern themselves  democratically through having their own local institutions. And  phase three is defined as the stage of East Timor  self-determination whereby the East Timorese may choose between  free association or integration into Indonesia or independence.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Asylum seeker detainee collapses A detainee at the Home Office centre at which almost all 200 inmates are on hunger strike collapsed yesterday, the Home Office said last night, Edward Mortimer writes. It said that seven had been separated from the other detainees at the Campsfield centre for asylum seekers, near Oxford. 'They are supervised by a nurse and checked every half hour,' the Home Office said. It denied allegations from other detainees that some had been force-fed by Home Office officials and staff of Group 4 security company, which runs the centre. The Home Office added that the detainee who had collapsed had been seen by a doctor who was 'not concerned about his medical condition'.</p>

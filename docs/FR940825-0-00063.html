			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area (see sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a) of the CAA). This permit program element, also known as the New Source Review (NSR) program, was submitted by the State of Idaho on May 17, 1994. EPA notified Idaho in a June 10, 1994 letter to the Administrator of the Idaho Division of Environmental Quality that the NSR program submittal was complete. EPA is currently in the process of reviewing the NSR program to determine if the program meets the requirements of the CAA. EPA intends to take action on Idaho's NSR program when EPA has completed its review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, states containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, which become effective without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). Contingency measures for the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho which informed him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for Pinehurst. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Pinehurst, or it will face Federal highway or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA and 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. This Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittal (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In this action, EPA is granting approval of the plan revision submitted to EPA on April 14, 1992. EPA has determined that the submittal meets the applicable requirements of the Act, with respect to moderate area PM&hyph;10 submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has also determined whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Idaho Division of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) held a public hearing on the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 plan on January 22, 1992 in Pinehurst and, after IDEQ reviewed the oral testimony, the plan was adopted by the IDEQ Administrator on April 7, 1992. The submitted plan was received by EPA on April 14, 1992 as a revision to the SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. A letter dated June 8, 1992 was forwarded to the Administrator of IDEQ indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In this action EPA is approving the State of Idaho's PM&hyph;10 SIP submittal for the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 were not submitted by that date as required by section 189(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, EPA made a finding, pursuant to section 179 of the Act, that the State failed to submit the SIP revision and notified the Governor in a letter dated December 18, 1991 (see 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992)). EPA's June 8, 1992 determination that the State had made a complete submittal corrected the State's failure to submit the PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements for Pinehurst due on November 15, 1991 and, therefore, terminated the 18-month sanctions clock for that deficiency under section 179 of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Accurate Emissions Inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area (see section 110(a)(2)(K) of the CAA). Because the submission of such inventories is necessary to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The base year emission inventory (1988) developed for the Pinehurst nonattainment area identified the major sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PM&hyph;10 concentrations during 24-hour worst case winter days as residential wood combustion (59%), fugitive dust (38%) and other sources (3%). Annual emissions for 1988 were residential wood combustion (41%), fugitive dust (38%), building construction (18%) and other sources (3%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is approving the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  For further details see the Technical Support Document (TSD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the amended Act; therefore, EPA may continue to rely on this guidance (see section 193 of the CAA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. RACM (Including RACT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) were implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

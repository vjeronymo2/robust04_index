			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (6): 'Franc fort' may pay off after all - Bonds took a bashing - but debt is becoming manageable After a very tough 12 months, during which the turmoil on Europe's currency markets battered the Belgian franc and Belgium's bond market, there are signs that the Belgian Government's management of its huge public debt is moving back on to an even keel. What is widely perceived by the markets and the Belgian political class as a significant breakthrough came in the early hours of November 17. It was then that the Centre-Left coalition led by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, agreed on a package to rein in budget and social security deficits, increase industrial competitiveness, and freeze wages in real terms until 1996. The bourse rose immediately; short-term interest rates were cut by more than a full percentage point; the franc strengthened, and the the risk premium which the government has to pay on its paper, fell. The public debt mountain, equivalent to between 125 and 130 per cent of Belgium's gross domestic product depending on the method of consolidation chosen, still towers over a basically strong, high-productivity, export-oriented economy. But there are now grounds for believing that the government's franc fort policy of shadowing the D-mark, and the renewed effort to get a grip on public finances, could pay off. When the storms in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) first broke in September 1992, the Belgian franc weathered them well. The franc fort policy had earned Belgium the right to be considered part of the 'hard core' inside the ERM, alongside Germany, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (with which Belgium has a 71-year old currency union). Over the previous year and a half, the Belgian franc had strayed no further than 0.06 out of alignment with the D-mark, and the narrowing of interest rate differentials with Germany was almost complete. At one stage, Belgian short-term rates of interest even dipped below the German rates. The size of the public debt stock - at about Dollars 200bn - remained a problem. The public debt stock is more than double the debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 per cent indicated in the Maastricht criteria for those European Union member states seeking to create a single currency by the end of the century. Annual interest payments to service the debt eat up an unsustainable 11 per cent of GDP. Thus, even though the 'primary' budget balance (exclusive of interest payments) was turned round, over the decade 1981 to 1991, from a deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP to a surplus of 4.1 per cent, the actual deficit, after the interest bill, was reduced from 13.3 per cent to only 6.3 per cent - again, double the Maastricht criterion of 3 per cent. As long as the deficit was moving in the right direction, however, Belgium's partners and the markets perceived the debt stock as a hangover. In January this year, for instance, the yield on 10-year Belgian benchmark bonds narrowed to 40 basis points against their German equivalent, compared to 120 basis points in August 1992, just before the first ERM crisis. The 1992 budget deficit had climbed to BFr485bn, or 6.9 per cent of GDP. But throughout Europe, as recession deepened, unemployment costs rose and the tax take shrank, deficits were rising. Belgium could justly point out that in the depths of such a recession its primary surplus was actually rising, heading on latest Finance Ministry estimates for 4.5 per cent this year. 'The feeling was, it's as good as the D-mark, except you get a premium,' summarises Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Belgium's leading bank, Generale de Banque. But after the de facto implosion of the ERM this August, sentiment changed. Investors in government bonds, particularly from outside Belgium, 'wondered how they could buy paper from a country with such a high public debt,' says Mr Praet. Throughout September and October, the central bank had to fight hard to maintain the credibility of the franc fort against market conviction that the authorities - in Belgium as in France - could not sustain the high interest rates needed to keep the link with the D-mark. The psychological low point came at the beginning of October when Luxembourg held its first public bond auction. Belgium's currency union partner offered a substantially lower coupon on 10-year bonds, even though the Luxembourg and Belgian francs are interchangeable. Speculation flared that Luxembourg was steeling itself to break the link with Belgium. But despite the dent to the credibility of Belgian bonds, the market was surprisingly resilient. 'It was tested in very difficult conditions and it proved to be liquid,' Mr Praet emphasises. But nevertheless, the need to get a stabilisation package became all important, and Mr Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, persevered even after the trade unions walked out of what was initially conceived as a tripartite pact between government, business and the unions. The precise financial details remain sketchy as this survey goes to press, but the Government appears to have found savings of BFr70bn on the social security budget - the estimated deficit for next year. And these savings will be recurrent through changes, for example, in eligibility for child allowances. On the eve of the crunch cabinet meeting to finalise the package, the risk premium offered by Belgian 10-year bonds over German equivalents was 109 basis points; within hours of markets opening the yield differential had narrowed to 90 basis points. The package, moreover, reinforces the government's already well-advanced strategy of repricing its debt. According to estimates prepared by Generale de Banque, this could save the Treasury the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP a year. Some BFr2,000bn of short term debt, which is currently attracting implicit rates of just over 7.3 per cent, is being moved to longer maturities. More debt falling due between next year and 1996 will be similarly refinanced. Restored credibility in the bond market could win the government more leverage and yield further savings. That will be in addition to - as seems likely - about 2 per cent of GDP savings from the stabilisation package agreed earlier this month. It will be well into the next century before Belgian debt gets near the Maastricht debt stock criteria. But the emerging longer-term and cheaper profile of the debt will make it far easier to manage any intervening shocks.</p>

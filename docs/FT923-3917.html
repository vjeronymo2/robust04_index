			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Major calls for overhaul of G7 summits MR JOHN MAJOR has called for a radical overhaul of the Group of Seven's annual summits to re-establish their role in shaping effective leadership among the rich industrial nations. In a confidential letter to the leaders of the US, Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Canada, the prime minister has proposed they shed the vast bureaucracy that has built up around their annual gatherings. Instead, he has suggested that the summits return to the original 'fireside chat' formula devised by Mr Valery Giscard D'Estaing and Mr Helmut Schmidt when the then French and German leaders called the first in 1975. One idea is that the G7 should abandon the long pre-drafted communiques covering all aspects of world economic and political developments in favour of a concise statement of priorities. A more radical proposal floated in Whitehall is that the foreign and finance ministers, who often dominate the working sessions at the summits, should be banished. Ministers in the UK and elsewhere have recognised that recent summits have failed to get to grips with the failing world economy and the turmoil in the former communist bloc. Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, believe that the summits - which also bring together hundreds of officials from the seven countries - have become too stage-managed. The detailed preparations have reduced the talks among heads of state to carefully rehearsed statements of previous positions. Mr Major has been particularly frustrated by the failure of two consecutive summits - London in 1991 and Munich in 1992 - to achieve a breakthrough in the stalled Uruguay round of trade talks in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). He believes that uncertainty over the future of the world trading system has contributed greatly to the slowdown in economic growth.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LANGUAGE LAW COMPROMISE IN MOLDAVIA URGED  </P> <P> Moldavia's Communist Party chief, in an effort to placate outraged minority  groups, proposed today that the republic adopt a weaker version of a law making  Moldavian the official language, an activist said.  </P> <P> The compromise, which reportedly resulted from a telephone conversation between  the party chief and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is aimed at stopping  widespread strikes and other protests in the republic.  </P> <P> The initial proposed law would substitute Moldavian for Russian in virtually  all government and business transactions in the republic. Russians and other  minorities in the republic say the proposal is discriminatory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Language for Government  </P> <P> The proposed compromise, outlined to the Supreme Soviet by Moldavian party  chief Semen Grossu, would make Moldavian the language for government officials  and documents, and Russian the tongue for everyday contact among the republic's  ethnic groups.  </P> <P> The Parliament had been expected to vote today on the language issue, but Yuri  Roshka, a spokesman for the autonomist Moldavian Popular Front, said the vote  had been put off until Thursday.  </P> <P> "The Parliament has appointed a commission to draft the final document. It will  be presented to the deputies tomorrow morning and the vote will take place  after 2 p.m.," he told Reuters from the republic's capital, Kishinev.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compromise Proposal  </P> <P> The compromise proposal was reported by Vasily Nestase, a leader of the  pro-Moldavian People's Front who spoke by telephone to the Associated Press  from Kishinev.  </P> <P> Moldavia, which borders Romania, now has no law specifying which language is to  be used, but Russian has traditionally been the tongue for government affairs.  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / South-east jobless reap rewards of recovery: Unemployment falls in most regions SOUTH-EAST England exclu-ding London has been the greatest beneficiary of the fall in unemployment since January - supporting indications that the region, one of those hit hardest by the recession, has been among the first to experience recovery. Unemployment in the south-east outside London dropped 4.6 per cent in the five months to June - well above the overall fall for the UK of 2.8 per cent. The south-west experienced the next biggest fall in seasonally adjusted unemployment over this period with a drop of 4.3 per cent. Last month was the fifth in succession to record a fall in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit for the UK as a whole. The figure fell 7,600 to 2,909,200, after a drop of 23,100 in May. Joblessness as a proportion of the available workforce stood at 10.4 per cent in June. Unadjusted for seasonal variations, unemployment fell 51,600 in June to 2,865,000. Most regions recorded falls in unemployment last month, with the exceptions being East Anglia, northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of the 7,600 reduction in total unemployment nearly half was accounted for by the south-east, including London, where the figure fell by 3,700 to 927,800. In contrast, more people in northern England were out of work last month than in May, with the figure rising 1,700 to 169,900. The region has an unemployment rate of 12.2 per cent, the highest for the UK apart from Northern Ireland, which has a comparable figure of 13.9 per cent. Out of the cumulative 83,100 fall in UK unemployment since January, the figure for the south-east excluding London has dropped 22,300 to 457,500. In the south-west, the number out of work has fallen 9,800 to 217,200. Other regions that have seen falls in unemployment of 3 per cent or more over the period are the east and west Midlands, north-west England, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Anglia and Wales. Regions with a fall below this figure include London with a muted fall of 0.3 per cent between January and June, while northern England bucked the trend with a 1.1 per cent rise in the numbers without jobs. Scotland and Northern Ireland recorded falls in unemployment of just over 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays under pressure BARCLAYS Bank shares attracted exceptionally heavy two-way trading activity after Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French-owned stockbroker, was said to have trimmed its dividend forecasts for the bank. The stockbroker declined to give details of any forecast reduction but said it felt Barclays would be prudent to consider a cut in the payment in order to protect its capital ratios. Dealers in the market said that a large line of Barclays stock, rumoured to have been as large as six to seven million shares, had been offered around the market. Barclays shares fell to 325p at one point, but later rallied to end the session a net 4 higher at 335p on turner of 13 million. Grand Met busy Brewery and food group Grand Metropolitan recorded its largest share turnover for five years as some investors decided that the recent bleak trading had now been discounted and that the shares looked cheap. The stock climbed 19 1/2 to 379 1/2 , the best performing FT-SE stock, in huge turnover of 18m. Grand Met has been dogged by poor trading news, particularly in its US food operations, in recent months, which led to two sets of brokers' downgrades last month. These prompted institutional investors to bale out, bringing a steep slide in the share price. However, Strauss Turnbull was prominent among a number of brokers and institutions yesterday to recommend the stock. Strauss analyst Ms Alex Oldroyd said: 'While the size of the problems in the US are unclear and remain a cloud on the horizon, the fundamentals of the company remain sound and at this price the shares look cheap.' Other analysts pointed to currency considerations likely to benefit Grand Met and to the fact that the shares underperformed by some 17 per cent last month. Owners approached Holiday group Owners Abroad finally bowed to market pressure and admitted in a statement after another day's hectic trading that it had been approached by a predator, although no formal offer had been made. The group's shares rose a further 6 to 77p yesterday, a rise of 31 on their low-point of 46p just three weeks ago. Market sources said that the group had been forced by the Stock Exchange authorities to make the announcement in order to clarify the situation. The confirmation by Owners, Britain's second largest tour operator, fuelled speculation, already rife, over who the predator might be. While some in the market were suggesting LTU, the German airline group, others were pointing nearer home, to Airtours, one of Owners main rivals. Neither company would comment on the speculation last night. Airtours shares added 6 to 246p. Standard Chartered jumped 23 to 445p, boosted by a profits upgrading instigated by BZW. The broker was said to have lifted its current year estimate from Pounds 210m to Pounds 225m and that for next year from Pounds 325m to Pounds 345m. In composite insurances, General Accident recouped 19 to 504p and Sun Alliance 12 to 285p. The recent bout of outperformance by Shell Transport, which took the shares close to their all time high relative to the market, came to a halt. The shares fell 3 1/2 to 531p on 3.7m traded, ahead of a presentation to oil analysts today by a senior executive from Shell's chemicals division. Dealers said some institutions, mindful of the profits warning issued recently by ICI, had decided to lock in profits in Shell. The rest of the oil sector performed strongly. BP, benefiting from switching from Shell, rose 4 1/2 to 215 1/2 p on 8m traded. The forthcoming US listing and expected good news from the current series of presentations to US institutions continued to produce a stream of buying orders for Enterprise Oil. But the main thrust behind yesterday's rise of 7 to 415p came from a buy recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson. The broker said Enterprise offers 'secure growth and income'. It added that Enterprise is 'fundamentally strong with proven and probable reserves of 948m barrels of oil and has a portfolio of assets encompassing North West Europe, Italy, the Black Sea, and the Far East. It spoke of a production profile rising sharply, a cash flow multiple of below four times in the mid-1990s, and reduced gearing after the completion of the ADR issue. East Midland Electricity, rumoured to be interested in British Coal, edged up 2 to 376p. Electronic Data shares shot up 50 to 465p after an agency cross of 45,000 shares transacted at 475p. Prudential Group shares moved erratically. They opened firmer in line with the market but came under sustained pressure during early trading after news that the company's Mercantile &amp; General (M &amp; G) subsidiary estimated its losses resulting from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki at around Pounds 30m. Dealers were also initially concerned at news that M &amp; G was taking strong action to remedy the problems at its reinsurance business. But two presentations by the insurance group, the first to insurance analysts and the second to institutions, detailing moves by M &amp; G to adopt a tough line of renewals and cut expenses, was well received and saw Prudential shares stabilise and then move ahead strongly. They ended a busy session a net 9 higher at 259p. Sustained selling pressure sent shares in Rank Organisation tumbling in a thin market. Dealers said the afternoon fall came after one leading house was left with some stock on its books after matching a large buyer and seller. They closed 20 off at 515p with just 370,000 traded. Shares in Babcock International fell sharply, giving up 9 to 31 1/2 p, to make it the day's worst performing stock in percentage terms, after a couple of brokers downgraded profit expectations and provoked doubts about the dividend. Smith New Court reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m while Panmure Gordon reduced its figure by Pounds 8m to Pounds 42m. Profit taking in British Aerospace led the shares to buck the market trend. They ended 4 lighter at 131p. The latest bid speculation in the engineering sector focused around Lucas Industries, considered one of the great names in British engineering. The suggestion was that engineering group Siebe could launch a bid for the engineering and motor components group. Speculation sent Lucas shares climbing 6 to 92p. Siebe hardened 2 to 337p with a further advance checked by the bid talk and availability of stock. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (17).

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Hopes pinned on the bulletin board: Attempts to keep the market in seldom traded shares alive Timing, so the saying goes, is everything. This autumn, the London Stock Exchange plans to unveil its vision of the future of share trading in the UK. After nearly three years of political in-fighting, its blueprint will reveal how shares in UK companies will be traded in the years ahead. Last Friday, however, Warburg Securities, one of the biggest traders in UK shares, unilaterally decided to stop making markets in 350 small companies. Just under 100 of these have effectively been left without a normal market for their shares. The Warburg announcement may not have been intended to carry any deeper message about the future of the UK stock market. After all, it was doing what any company does in a recession - shedding lossmaking product lines and cutting overheads to concentrate on more profitable business. But against the background of the stock exchange's overhaul, Warburg's move has been widely seen as a vote of no-confidence in the future. 'We very much hope the Warburg action will help to focus the exchange's mind,' said Mr Jonathan Davie, head of equities at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'I'm not aware there has been much of a debate on smaller companies recently.' Warburg's move has kicked back into life a debate which has lain dormant for much of the past year. The problem is simple: of the 2,500 or so companies on the stock market, only a small proportion are actively traded. Shares in the rest are seldom traded - or if they are, buyers and sellers are often brought together by a broker, leaving no business for the marketmakers who quote prices on the stock exchange's Seaq system. With little business to do, it is small wonder that the marketmakers are throwing in the towel. The stock exchange has made various attempts at filling the vacuum, most recently this spring with the launch of its 'bulletin board'. This electronic notice board was never intended to be anything more than a fall-back position for companies which cannot muster at least two marketmakers to quote prices in their shares. Investors wanting to trade in the shares of a company which has been consigned to the bulletin board can opt to have their buy or sell orders displayed on screen for the rest of the market to see. Other investors can then deal at these advertised prices or try to negotiate a better deal. The number of companies on the board could soon nearly double. Warburg's move has left 93 companies with only one marketmaker: if these cannot find another by the end of next week, they will be put on the board, swelling the number in this nether region of the stock market to more than 210. The bulletin board can do little more than keep a semblance of a market for the growing numbers of illiquid, or seldom traded companies, the exchange acknowledges. Evidence so far suggests that companies on the board are traded no more or less actively than before - at around two bargains in their shares on average each month, it says. For some companies, the board may have brought an improvement. Mr Keith Hall, chief executive of the Hartlepools Water Company, says trading has picked up. 'Whether this is due to the bulletin board, the publication of our results at about the same time or the general development of water industry shares, it is impossible to say. But we welcome any improvement on what went before, which was next to nothing.' Other ideas to keep the market in small companies alive have so far failed to bear fruit. Nearly two years ago, six of the biggest marketmakers - among them Warburg - agreed between them to guarantee that every listed company would have at least two marketmakers. That commitment has come and gone as market conditions have continued to deteriorate. Then, a year ago, the exchange first floated privately the idea of creating 'sole traders', or 'matching principals' - traders who would be given a monopoly in trading a company's shares. That suggestion was criticised by investors and listed companies who feared this would lead to a deterioration of the market. The bulletin board is the exchange's only order-driven system - that is, a market that operates on the basis of investors' actual orders to buy and sell shares. As such, it has driven a wedge into the normal quote-driven system, which is based on intermediaries' quotes of prices at which they are prepared to buy or sell shares. Warburg's decision to drop marketmaking in so many companies' shares, coming as the debate between these two different market systems gathers momentum, could help to push the exchange further towards an order-driven market. To many marketmakers, that is heresy: it would allow buyers and sellers of shares to deal without needing a marketmaker to act as intermediary - and so could spell the beginning of the end of marketmaking. But as Warburg's move clearly indicates, making markets in many companies' shares may no longer be worth the effort.</p>

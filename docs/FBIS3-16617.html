			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaly Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Russia must be among the first and vigorous  participants of partnership with NATO, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said in response to an Interfax question  following his meeting with Secretary of Defense William Perry.    Kozyrev quoted Perry as saying that all countries willing to  join NATO's Partnership for Peace program were equal. "It is  also obvious, however, that Russia is a great power with its own  interests. It would be strange if we were late arrivals,"  Kozyrev said meaning Partnership for Peace.    He said that the Russo-American cooperation must be equal,  mutually beneficial and have clear cut goals.    "Pragmatism and usefulness must be the all-important  factors.  We should not be guided by ideological cliches. Like in a  family, there are issues in the Russo-American relations which  call for close coordination while in other fields every member  of the family acts on his own trying not to harm the common  interests," Kozyrev explained. He emphasized that neither the  Russian nor the U.S. leaders intended to give up cooperation or  partnership.    Answering another Interfax question, Kozyrev said that he  had  talked with Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the phone  to discuss numerous international issues, notably the Middle  East. He added that the UN Security Council would discuss a  resolution on the Middle East Friday.    "This resolution must be passed urgently. The delay of its  adoption hinders the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli talks,"  Kozyrev said. He emphasized that if the resolution were adopted  Friday, Russian president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk  would go to Tunis to discuss with the PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat  the specific day when the talks would resume.    Kozyrev said that the delay also provoked new tragedies and  casualties in the Middle East. "It is important that the  confrontation mechanism should not be allowed to gain momentum,"  he said.    He had also discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina with  Christopher. "I expressed my view and the U.S. secretary of  State agreed with it, that the Bosnian Moslems and Croats who  intend to sign an agreement in Washington on March 18 on the  setting up a federation should use this agreement as a tool for  rapprochement and compromises with the third party, the Bosnian  Serbs, rather than for opposing them jointly," Kozyrev said. He  explained that Moscow would like to know if the federation was  consistent with territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.    "We hope that this agreement will be a step forward. But  even at this point it is important to know what the next steps  will be and how the Bosnian Serbs will be incorporated into it,"  Kozyrev said.</p>

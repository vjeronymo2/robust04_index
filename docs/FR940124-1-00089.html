			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Allotment Formula and Funding Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.11&blank;Allotment Formula <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 494(a)(2) of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to provide Federal funds to a SPRE for performing the functions contained in the State's agreement with the Secretary. Accordingly, in &sect;667.11, the Secretary proposes a funding formula under which the Secretary allots annually to each SPRE its share of the Federal funds appropriated for the SPRP. The following discusses the proposed funding formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each fiscal year that Federal funds are appropriated for the SPRP, the Secretary proposes to allot $20,000 to Guam, $20,000 to the Northern Mariana Islands, $20,000 to the Virgin Islands, $20,000 to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), and $20,000 to American Samoa. The Secretary believes this amount is sufficient for these States to carry out SPRE activities because only three institutions are located in Guam, and only one institution is located in each of the other jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to allot the remaining fiscal year appropriation so that each remaining State receives the greater of $50,000, or the amount determined under a formula that uses the following two variables_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The number of institutions located in a State that are certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The amount of Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students enrolled in those institutions during the latest year for which complete data is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the formula, the Title IV, HEA programs only include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), Federal Direct Loan, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Federal Perkins Loan programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes the formula described in greater detail in &sect;667.11(a) because the Secretary believes that each State needs at least $50,000 to carry out SPRE activities. In addition, at least in the initial years of the program, the Secretary believes it equitable to allot Federal funds to States based on the relative exposure of Title IV, HEA program funds in each State as represented by the two variables in the proposed funding formula. However, after several years, when there is a history of referrals to States and SPRE reviews of institutions as a result of those referrals, the Secretary plans to reexamine the funding formula to determine whether to base the formula on the percentage of referrals each State receives, the number of reviews each State performs, or a combination of those two variables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;667.11(b), the Secretary proposes to reallot Federal funds not expended by a State to other States in a manner that best carries out the purposes of the program. The Secretary proposes to reallot those funds the Secretary determines a State will not spend during the period for which those funds are available, and those funds a State does not spend by the end of the period for which those funds are made available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 667.12&blank;Application for Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;667.12, the Secretary proposes procedures under which a State applies to receive its allotment for each fiscal year in which Congress appropriates funds for the State Postsecondary Review Program. Under these procedures, a State's application for funds consists of a plan to carry out specific activities and a budget that accounts for those activities. The Secretary views these application procedures as satisfying the requirement in section 494A(b)(5) of the HEA that a State include in its agreement with the Secretary its plan to carry out SPRE activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes a two-phased State application process. In the first phase, a State applies for funds to develop review standards and to carry out other activities that are necessary before the SPRE conducts reviews of referred institutions. In the second phase, a State applies for funds to conduct reviews of referred institutions and to perform other allowable activities. A State may apply for funds in the second phase only after it has established review standards. The Secretary considers a State to have established review standards if those standards were developed in accordance with the requirements contained in &sect;667.21 and those standards were not disapproved by the Secretary under &sect;667.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application before standards are established.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For this phase of the application process, in &sect;667.12(b), the Secretary proposes that the State submit a plan to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Develop the State review standards described in section 494C(d) of the HEA and discussed further in &sect;&sect;667.21 and 667.22 of this preamble; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Develop procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty, and others regarding an institution, as required by section 494C(j) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the standards and the complaint procedures must be developed in consultation with institutions in the State, as required under sections 494C(d) and 494C(j) of the HEA, respectively. In addition, the State may submit a plan to identify information systems maintained by institutions and State agencies that are relevant to developing State review standards. Finally, the plan may contain estimates of the costs of coordinating those information systems with an information system for the SPRE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes these allowable activities because the SPRE cannot carry out a review of an institution to determine whether the institution is in compliance with State standards until the State has developed those standards in required consultation with institutions in that State. Similarly, a State cannot process complaints until it has developed procedures, in required consultation with institutions in the State, to respond to complaints. Finally, a State cannot determine whether it will be cost-effective to coordinate existing data systems without first determining the costs of coordinating those systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

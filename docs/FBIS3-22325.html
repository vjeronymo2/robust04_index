			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Norwegian ecological organization, (?Bellona), has  published a report entitled "Sources of Radioactive  Contamination in Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblasts". Here with  the details is Dmitriy Kiselev, our correspondent in Helsinki:    Kiselev: The report's authors, Norwegian  researchers (?Niels Denner) and (?Thomas Nielsen), claim they  have obtained access to classified information, as a result of  which they found out that over two-thirds of nuclear submarines  are to be dismantled at the Severodvinsk wharfs near  Arkhangelsk. Incidentally, only two nuclear submarines with  four reactors have been dismantled and cut to pieces so far.  The report from the Norwegian ecological organization  (?Bellona) contains a detailed analysis of the plans to prepare  the Severomorsk wharfs for the work to come. These include  building new dry docks and facilities for removal of fuel  elements, extending mooring lines for old nuclear submarines  and, finally, modernizing the railway connecting Severomorsk and  Arkhangelsk with the Mayak enterprise in the Urals, to which the  highly radioactive waste is expected to be shipped for  reprocessing.    However, Norwegian researchers claim that not one plan for  the refurbishment of the wharfs for such a large-scale and  dangerous task as destroying some 150 nuclear submarines has  been approved. And this is in spite of the fact that the works  were planned for the period between 1993 and 1998. Moreover, it  is still hard to establish who is specifically accountable for  complying with international agreements under the START-2  treaty, and also who is ecologically accountable for possible  consequences.    Meanwhile, at present many old nuclear submarines no longer  on combat duty are dispersed throughout the fjords of the Kola  peninsula on so-called temporary mooring, the report authors  claim.    Slackness in project drafting, however, is only half the  trouble. It has still not been decided with any degree of  certainty what is to happen to the reactors to be removed from  the submarines--whether they will be dumped in the Kara Sea--as  the USSR used to do until 1991--or stored in a special  depository in Arkhangelsk Oblast. There is no money for the  depository, the Norwegian researchers conclude, quoting official  and unofficial replies from those they had talked to in  Arkhangelsk and Severomorsk. This means, the authors of the  (?Bellona) report conclude, Russia intends to dump several  hundred more nuclear reactors in the Kara Sea. (?Niels Denner)  and (?Thomas Nielsen) believe that Moscow's refusal to sign the  London convention banning the dumping of radioactive waste in  the open sea is further evidence of the existence of these  ominous plans.    What causes the biggest threat, however, in the view of the  Norwegians, is the social unreliability of Russia's nuclear  complex. According to their data, the staff of the Murmansk  nuclear fleet, the Severodvinsk wharfs, and the Northern Fleet  have had their wage payments delayed for several months. It is  natural that, under these conditions, the people's attitudes  toward their duties may change and the probability of a human  error in dealing with radioactive materials increases  significantly.    So, now you know about the alarming report that was  published  in Scandinavia. It is hardly appropriate for a new Russia to  find out about itself from its scared neighbors.</p>

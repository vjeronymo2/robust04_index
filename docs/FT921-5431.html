			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: S. African gold producers divided on forward selling DIFFERENCES between South African gold producers about the merits of selling gold forward have resurfaced following the publication in a local journal of an article suggesting that the practice does not pay. Mr Hugh Munro, formerly chief consulting engineer in Union Corporation, now part of the Gencor group, claims in in the Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy that Western gold producers lost Dollars 2.5bn revenue in 1990 through forward sales of gold. Mr Munro's conclusions have met with a mixed, if predictable, reception. They have been welcomed by Gengold, which is a reluctant forward seller and dismissed by Anglo American, the world's largest producer. Mr Munro says forward sales consist of gold leased from banks at a very low rate of interest. It is then sold on the spot market, and the proceeds invested at the US dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) at a much higher interest rate. The difference between these two rates is the gold contango. Over the past three years has between 3 and 8 per cent. Mr Munro's claim is that producers overlook the loss attached to enjoying this contango. His calculations attempt to prove that every extra tonne of gold sold per annum reduces the price by about 20 cents an ounce. Based on Gold Fields Minerals Services figures for 1990, Mr Munro calculates that non-Communist mines would have made a monetary gain of Dollars 2.55bn in 1990 had they not sold gold forward. In the article he argues that, if his views are accepted, then forward sales will diminish and many gold loans will be repaid so that the price of gold will rise 'fairly rapidly to a level perhaps in excess of Dollars 400 per ounce,' and possibly as high as Dollars 500. Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said that he supported Mr Munro's conclusions which 'back up some of the feelings we've had.' Gengold's approach to forward sales was that they were necessary only in special cases where a marginal mine was likely to go under if it did not sell forward, Mr Maude added. Mr Kelvin Williams, marketing manager for the gold and uranium division at Anglo American, said his company was sceptical of the reasoning and conclusions contained in the article. 'The simplistic application of complicated mathematics to a collection of dynamic factors in the market is sufficiently removed from reality for it to be fruitless to comment,' he said. Two other factors which diminish the worth of the analysis in the view of Anglo American are the figures on which it is based and the failure to take account of the impact of paper gold transactions on the market.</p>

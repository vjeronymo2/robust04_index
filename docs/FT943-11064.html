			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: UAE in move to harmonise tariffs The United Arab Emirates, trying to harmonise rules within the seven-member federation in preparation for a possible Gulf Arab common market, yesterday began levying a 4 per cent tariff on most imports, Reuter reports from Dubai. Before the rule took effect, customs departments throughout the UAE were charging different tariffs. The Higher Council of Tariffs said tobacco imports, which already attract a 30 per cent government tax, would in addition pay the new 4 per cent duty. The tobacco tariff might go up to 50 per cent, under a government plan to discourage smoking.</p>

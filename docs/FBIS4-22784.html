			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Volkova: "That Means Someone Needs It: On </F> Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves Once Again"]    [Text] On 5 November 1993, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA [RG]  printed a perfectly harmless article entitled "Do Not Count  Diamonds in the Voucher Check Caves," where specialists  questioned the sincerity of advertisements of the check  investment fund "Neft-Almaz-Invest" [Oil-Diamond-Invest]. As it  became clear, however, the claim hit a sore spot, and the fund's  managers proposed that the editorial office publish a retraction  and compensate for moral damages with a monetary sum of 50  million rubles [R], and in addition threatened to sue the  newspaper.    And although instead of money and a retraction, they  received  an even more expositary article entitled "Ship the Diamonds in  Barrels" (RG, 22 December 1993), for some reason they did not  sue the newspaper.    As it turned out, state offices had begun auditing the fund.  As a result, the fund's license was revoked and criminal  proceedings were instituted against its management.    But several days ago events took an altogether different  turn. On 11 April, the finding of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly Commission of Independent Experts on  the audit of the activity of the "Neft-Almaz-Invest" check  investment fund, the "Dante-Capital Management Company" and  "Depositariya" [Depositary] was faxed to the editorial office.  The first lines of the finding confirmed that the high  Commission (with a capital letter) had been created at the  instruction of the leadership of the State Duma Committee on  Ownership, Privatization, and Economic Activity. And then over  several pages came a complex denial of any violations by the  fund. That was the Commission's finding. The fund works in  accordance with Russia's laws and its charter and it operates  efficiently. The fact of 572,700 missing privatization checks  was not established.    The Commission considers incorrect the claim of the GKI  [State Investment Committee] employees that the  "Neft-Almaz-Invest" ChIF [check investment fund] illegally  issued and sold stock worth R11 billion. It also does not  recognize the claim that the fund does not follow established  procedures in keeping a stockholders' register and thereby does  not protect stockholders' rights properly.    The Commission believes that the GKI and the law enforcement  organs have done serious damage to the cause of privatization in  Russia, which should also be reimbursed by them following  established procedures.    Yes, RG rightly wrote, the bosses of investment funds easily  imagined that a Soviet citizen would take any word spoken on  television and in the press as the absolute truth. Despite the  exposes in our newspaper, they were earnestly counting on  catching even us journalists through our gullibility and using  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA to influence the minds and feelings of  Russians. In the Commission's opinion, journalists should have  "saluted" and printed the finding after looking at the list of  members of the Commission:    "V. M. Simcher, academician, doctor of economic sciences,  and  chairman of the Commission; V. S. Martemyanov, State Duma  deputy; Yu. M. Ruda, State Duma deputy; V. V. Grigoryev, expert,  doctor of economic sciences, and docent; V. V. Ivanov, expert,  candidate of economic sciences, and docent; A. V. Filippov,  expert and department chief of the Control-Budget Committee  under the State Duma; and A. K. Solodov, expert and auditor. A  representative of the Procurator's Office of the city of Moscow,  A. A. Bratchikov, and a representative of the RF Tax Policy  Department Administration for the city of Moscow, Major A. P.  Klishin, were enlisted for the Commission's work."    But we decided to call the chairman of the Committee on  Ownership, Sergey Burkov, at the State Duma. And it turned out  that in the Committee they first heard of the Commission from  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. Here is the text of the official  announcement of the committee delivered specially for  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA:    "The State Duma Committee on Ownership, Privatization,  and Economic Activity states that the Committee did not make a  decision to create a certain Commission To Study the Activity of  the `Neft-Almaz-Invest' Fund. Moreover, this question was not  discussed or even raised. If such a Commission was in fact  created, the Committee did not authorize it to do the study. All  the facts cited in this connection are only the opinion of  certain deputies."    Why was this needed, and who needed it? Sergey Burkov  answered this question with the conjecture that a serious  political game is underway and large amounts of money have been  used. He promised to inform our readers of the details in a few  days when the circumstances of the matter are cleared up.</p>

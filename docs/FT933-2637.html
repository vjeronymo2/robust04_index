			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Fittings back in black THE STEPS taken last year to restructure management and control costs have put British Fittings Group back in the black in the six months to June 30. Despite continuing adverse trading conditions, the group turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 672,000, against Pounds 1.02m losses last time. The results have been prepared according to FRS 3 and comparatives restated. Turnover in continuing businesses fell 6 per cent to Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 36.96m), but operating profits on these businesses rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 1.09m). The group's activities cover pipeline equipment distribution, high pressure water products and non-ferrous metals distribution. Interest charge for the half year was lower at Pounds 762,000 (Pounds 1.28m) and after tax of Pounds 70,000 (nil), earnings per share were 1.71p (5.11p losses). The interim dividend has been raised by 50 per cent to 0.75p (0.5p). Mr Michael Borlenghi, chairman, said working capital had remained under strict control and net borrowings had fallen by a further Pounds 977,000 to Pounds 18.29m, making a reduction of over Pounds 5m since June 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Nigerian military government of General Sani  Abacha keeps tightening the screw another turn on the  pro-democrat opposition. They say there is no way they can  resign and revert the result of last June's election and the  presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, seems bent on setting up an  alternative government on the anniversary next Sunday [12 June].  There has been a wave of arrests of leading politicians,  including former senators and members of the National Democratic  Coalition, NADECO and the clampdown has continued. From Lagos,  Sola Odunfa reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] At least, five leading members of  the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, were arrested  yesterday as the police launched a massive clampdown on  pro-democracy activists nationwide. Those arrested were Chief  Anthony Enahoro, veteran nationalist and leader of NADECO, who  was picked from his home in Benin; former civilian governors  Chief Christian Onoh of Anambra State, picked up in Enugu;  Alhaji Balarabe Musa of Kaduna State, picked in Kaduna; Alhaji  Yahaya Abdulkadir of Sokoto State, picked up at Lagos Airport;  and Air Commodore David Jang, retired, who was arrested in his  home near Jos.    Simultaneously, other teams of policemen raided the homes of  other politicians in Oshun and Oyo States in Western Nigeria but  the politicians had gone into hiding. The arrests have come in  the wake of increasing defiance of the military government by  the politicians who are insisting on the immediate restoration  of full democracy, through the formal installation of the winner  of last year's presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola.    Reports today say that members of the dissolved Ondo State  legislature met secretly yesterday in Akure and resolved to  formally reconvene the House in open defiance of the military.  Legislators in Katsina and Kano States in Northern Nigeria, and  those in Oyo in the west are reported to be planning similar  meetings. The man at the center of it all, Chief Abiola, is  daring the military government to arrest him. Addressing a  public lecture in Lagos last night, Chief Abiola said that he  was ready to sacrifice his life in the struggle to make his  victory at last year's election a reality.    However, the military government is unyielding. The vice  chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council, Lieutenant General  Oladipo Diya, told a gathering of traditional rulers in Eastern  Nigeria yesterday that installing Chief Abiola as president  would create a new set of problems which he did not specify.    The head of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, Archbishop  Abiodun Adetiluye, has condemned the current spate of arrests.  He says it will only aggravate tension and cause Nigerians to  dislike the military the more. In an open letter to the head of  state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the primate said, my dear general, now  is the time to go. I appeal to you in the name of God, please  listen to the voice of reason and go. [end recording]</p>

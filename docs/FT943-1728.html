			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian sugar output forecast to rise by 24% India's sugar production will rise by 24 per cent this year to 9.8m tonnes, reversing the steady decline of the past three years, according to the food ministry. A further spurt is expected to push output to 12.2m tonnes in the next sugar season starting in October. The increase in production comes as the nation's sugar industry launched a campaign for complete deregulation of the sugar market. The Indian Sugar Mills Association believes that production could rise to 13m tonnes if the industry were deregulated. This could save Rs20bn (Pounds 400m) a year in wasted output and import bills. Isma has been galvanising public opinion by placing large advertisements in India's daily newspapers urging the public to support the reforms they have suggested to the government, beginning with a policy of complete deregulation for the sugar industry. The association estimates that half of the money lost through current policies 'goes down the drain', in the form of sucrose left unrecovered by some processors. 'Unfortunately, this happens in a scenario where the established capacity of sugar manufacturers is left unutilised, due to a lack of cane,' Isma says. Another Rs10bn goes on import costs, caused by the production shortfalls of sugar units. An equitable distribution of cane between all processors would minimise the diversion of cane, and allow production units fully to utilise capacity and expand further to take advantage of economies of scale, which would in turn, bring down sugar prices. The association has also urged the government to announce a clear-cut policy on the creation of buffer stocks when there is a bumper crop, for effective utilisation during times of shortage. An official of the food ministry said the government was examining the proposals forwarded by the association. 'But it will be some time before the sugar industry can be fully decontrolled,' he said. 'The government would be exposing itself to rampant inflation if this essential commodity were out of its control,' the official said. The government currently distributes sugar through subsidised public distribution and a system of ration cards. Though sugar is freely available on the open market, the price difference is significant. The association says decontrol will stabilise prices and decrease the disparity between the price of sugar for public distribution, and free market sugar prices.</p>

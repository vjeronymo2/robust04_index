			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 3 May issue  of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Editor Assails al-Azhar Critics    2. Columnist Urges Law Organizing Religious Rulings    3. Conference Considering Copts as Minority Criticized    4. Religious Seminar Says No Link Between Islam and  Terrorism    5. Seminar Says Islamic Penal Code Reforms Society    6. "Koranic Medicine" Offense to Islam    7. Chadian Islamic Official Interviewed    8. Koran Radio To Transmit 24 Hours Per Day  <H5>  EDITOR ASSAILS AL-AZHAR CRITICS </H5>   In his back-page 400-word "A Call to Reason" column, Chief  Editor al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf mocks "the children of the West"  in Egypt who call for minimizing the role of al-Azhar. He cites  some of the ideas of these "children," who he says "claim to  lead an enlightenment campaign." For example, he says, they  accuse al-Azhar of expanding the base of extremism and opening  the door to terrorism. They are further quoted as advocating  that Islamic education at schools must be kept to a minimum "so  that extremist thought may not invade the minds of our sons and  daughters and threaten national unity." And they are said to  deny the existence of such things as moderate Islam, as opposed  to extremist Islam. Commenting on this, the writer says: "May  God curse an enlightenment essentially based on demolishing  religion, desecrating sanctities, and undermining the constant  principles that preserved this nation for centuries despite  vicious attacks. May God protect Islam and Egypt from every  treacherous hand trying to harm them, either by bullets or the  pen."  <H5>  COLUMNIST URGES LAW ORGANIZING RELIGIOUS RULINGS </H5>   In his 400-word "Rightfully I Say" column on page one, Samir  Rajab, the newspaper's board chairman, calls for unifying fatwas  [religious rulings]. He calls for legislation imposing severe  punishment on anyone passing fatwas without having the official  power to do so. To support his call, he claims that mosques,  which are open to anyone, "were behind the breeding of  terrorism. False muftis emerged along with false preachers, and  they both played a serious role in planting the seeds of  terrorism." The writer believes that "depending on security  alone to face the phenomenon of terrorism is not enough." He  urges the government to rush to draft a law unifying fatwas  "otherwise the government would be supporting terrorism without  knowing it."  <H5>  CONFERENCE LABELLING COPTS AS MINORITY CRITICIZED </H5>   A 700-word report by Tariq 'Abdallah on page two focuses on  a conference on minorities in the Arab world and the Middle East  organized by an Egyptian studies center. 'Abdallah says: Many  accusations have been leveled against the organizers, especially  for characterizing the Copts in Egypt as a minority. Dr. Sa'd  al-Din Ibrahim, president of the organizing center, is cited  defending the conference and the British organization financing  it. Ibrahim says that objection to the presentation of Egypt's  Copts as a minority is acceptable but he stresses that the  conference aim is to discuss the problems and concerns of the  Copts in Egypt, not their status.    Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim al-Fayyumi, secretary general of the  Higher Council for Islamic Affairs, is quoted criticizing the  conference and maintaining that Egypt's Copts cannot be labelled  as a minority because they are Egyptians governed by the  Egyptian Constitution and have the same rights and duties as  Muslims. He says Copts have no special problems or concerns.  Former Government Attorney Edward Ghali al-Dhahabi describes  the conference as "very bad" and maintains that Copts are an  integral part of Egyptian society.    A related item on the conference, a 700-word article by  Majdi  Salim on page 10, discusses attempts to "wake up sedition" under  the guise of freedom of expression and thought. Implicitly  referring to the minorities conference as one of these attempts,  the writer states: "Every citizen in Egypt is Egyptian. They  are all of the same race. There is no such thing as a minority  or majority and everyone has citizenship rights without  discrimination." In his article, Salim also refers to writers  who criticized a decision by some governors to prevent the use  of satellite dishes in cafes and public places in their  governorates to protect youths from watching explicit movies.  <H5>  RELIGIOUS SEMINAR SAYS NO LINK BETWEEN ISLAM AND TERRORISM </H5>   An approximately 2,000-word report on page four, attributed  to Mamduh al-'Ushri, Musa Hal, and Nazih Fudah, details a  religious seminar organized by 'AQIDATI at a youth center in  al-Daqahliyah Governorate. Speakers addressed the audience and  answered questions on religious issues and practices. Asked  about Islam's relationship with terrorism, the newspaper's chief  editor, al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, is quoted as replying: "There  is no relationship between Islam and terrorism. Indeed, Western  media are seriously and intentionally promoting this mistaken  belief and, regrettably, some news media here are joining them,  with bad intentions." He is cited adding: "The assassinations  or bombings taking place here cannot be linked with Islam, even  if they are perpetrated by Muslims. These people are not real  Muslims. Islam is not a bloody religion." He is further quoted  as saying that confronting terrorism is the responsibility of  all society.  <H5>  SEMINAR SAYS ISLAMIC PENAL CODE REFORMS SOCIETY </H5>   An approximately 1,500-word unattributed report on page 10  cites speakers at a seminar on "The Concept of Integration of  Islam" organized by the Islamic Research and Studies Center at  Cairo University. The speakers discuss the foundations of Islam  that make it an integrated religion. One of these, according to  one speaker, is Islamic legislation--the laws and provisions  that organize the life of the Muslim individual and group and  that determine punishments. Dr. Muhammad Baltaji, dean of  Dar-al-'Ulum College, is cited attacking those who brand the  Islamic system of punishment as inhuman. He says the  application of the Islamic penal code, which does not  differentiate between the rich and the poor, or the strong and  the weak, reforms society. He adds: "The application of the  penal code is the way out of today's problems. The best proof  is that the rate of crime is less in societies that apply  shari'ah than in others."  <H5>  "KORANIC MEDICINE" OFFENSE TO ISLAM </H5>   Pages 12 and 13 feature an approximately 3,500-word report  by  Jamal Salim discussing "a serious phenomenon spreading in  several towns and villages in Egypt's countryside, namely,  medical treatment through the Koran." "Koranic doctors"  reportedly treat all kinds of illness, from fatigue and colic to  paralysis and impotence. The reporter asks Egypt's mufti,  Muhammad Tantawi, and other clerics, psychologists, and  sociologists about this practice. They maintain that the  phenomenon offends Islam and they attribute it to ignorance and  to charlatans exploiting people's religious sentiments. Tantawi  says the Koran can be used to treat souls for hatred, envy, and  similar psychological symptoms but not physical diseases.    A related 150-word report by Musa Hal on page one says  al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee warned against the Koran being used  by charlatans to profit and exploit simple-minded people under  the pretext of treating diseases. The committee said that using  the Koran to mislead the simple is a major crime and a sin.  <H5>  CHADIAN ISLAMIC OFFICIAL INTERVIEWED </H5>   On page 20 there is an approximately 1,500-word interview  with the chairman of the Higher Islamic Affairs Council in Chad,  Imam Husayn Hasan Abu-Bakr, by Tariq 'Abdallah. Abu-Bakr  discusses the problems facing Muslims in his country, al-Azhar's  important role in serving Islam, and features of an Islamic  awakening in Chad.  <H5>  KORAN RADIO TO TRANSMIT 24 HOURS PER DAY </H5>   A 50-word report by Mamduh al-'Ashri on page one cites  Information Minister Muhammad Safwat al-Sharif ordering an  extension of the Koran radio's transmission to 24 hours a day  throughout the year, effective 31 May 1994.    Commenting on the decision in a 200-word article on page 18,  Mamduh al-'Ashri thanks the information minister and urges him  to instruct the television's management to broadcast religious  programs at suitable times so as to serve Islam and spread the  right religious awareness.</p>

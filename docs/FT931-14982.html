			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Tanker oil dispersal a 'minor miracle' THE RAPID dispersal of the 84,500 tonnes of oil from the wrecked Braer has been 'a minor miracle', the Shetland Islands council said yesterday. Maps drawn up daily at the council's emergency centre at Sumburgh Head, the southern tip of the islands where the tanker hit the rocks, show that the slick has shrunk sharply since the weekend. Most of the original patches of thick black oil have broken up under the impact of ferocious weather into thin sheens and patches of 'grey lines'. Oil is still visible on a handful of beaches, the area around the tanker including Quendale Bay; the Bay of Scousburgh; St Ninian's Bay; and Bigton Wick. But dispersal has been much faster than in many other oil spills because the Braer's cargo was relatively light Norwegian crude oil. Scientists in the Shetlands are becoming more confident that much of the Braer's heavier 'bunker' or fuel oil has also dispersed. The council said yesterday: 'It is some days since bunker oil appeared on the maps except in the immediate vicinity of the wreck - although it is not impossible that some may still be on board'. The massive pounding by the waves has broken the oil into ever smaller droplets, enabling it to sink into the water, when bacteria then break it down. To monitor exactly how far the particles are spreading scientists from the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries department have been on board the research vessel Clupea since January 11. They will take samples of sand, water, shellfish and plankton for another week. Mr Barry Lester, of the Department of Transport's marine pollution control unit, which is in charge of the Shetland clean-up, said yesterday: 'It is too early for scientists to give conclusions, but it seems highly unlikely that much oil has settled on the sea bed.' Although the rapid clearing of the oil confounds some early predictions of ecological disaster, fishermen and environmentalists are still scanning the seas for signs of longer-term effects. A week ago the Scottish Office banned fishing or harvesting of salmon in a 400,000 sq mile area around the spill. The 16 salmon farms in the zone account for about a quarter of Shetland's salmon farming, which last year was 10,500 tonnes and was worth Pounds 33m. Mr Scott Findlay, of the Shetland Salmon Farmers' Association, said: 'The way it looks now, only farms within the closure zone are affected by the sheen, and rigorous scientific testing is now under way to see the effect on the fish.' He added: 'There have been no salmon mortalities whatsoever, and there is no chance tainted fish will ever enter the food chain.' Environmentalists sound distinctly more optimistic than they did last week. Mr David Mitchell, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which has counted 750 dead birds so far, said: 'It is unlikely that there will be many more bird oilings.' Dispersal of the oil has removed much of the risk to migratory birds, which will start flying in to breed within two months. He warned, however, that the black guillemot, which has already arrived on the islands, has been badly hurt by the slick. 'There will be recolonisation but it will be slow - this bird lays only one egg a year.' The RSPB is also afraid that mussel beds have been wiped out, causing eider ducks to move out of the region.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (5): Pressures force changes - Computer Distribution THE RECENT tumult in the computer industry has taken its toll on those who distribute their products and many small retailers in the UK have gone to the wall in the current recession. While the market for personal computers was flourishing, the manufacturers did not pay undue attention to the means by which their products were distributed. Now that the market has become even more fierce, such competitive factors have grown greatly in importance. The computer distribution market looks ripe for change. Some computer manufacturers such as Dell, the US group which also has a strong presence in Europe, have moved to supply products direct to the end-user themselves. The company argues that by being responsible for the distribution of its products, it can offer greater flexibility and improved levels of service. But other forms of distribution, such as superstores and mail order look set to account for a growing proportion of computer sales. At present, however, the market for portable computers in the UK still remains largely in the hands of distributors and dealers, although it is not as yet a highly profitable segment of the personal computer market. Toshiba claims it has seen two developing trends in the market for portable computers - 'the first is a move towards mass merchandising. As the price of portable computers diminishes, they are increasingly being sold through computer superstores and mail order outlets,' it says. The second development is that value added resellers (Vars) - which sell individually-tailored hardware and software packages to companies - have also seized a growing slice of the market for portable computers. 'The value added resellers (Vars) are becoming more important in selling an integrated solution as the portable computer increasingly becomes a component of a company's IT strategy,' Toshiba says. The value added resellers are selling a business solution rather than a box. Big insurance companies, for example, are buying portables for use by on-the-road salesmen to give immediate quotes. Such portables are often supplied by the value added resellers who design specialist bespoke software needed to run the sales programmes. Mr Jan Murray, who runs Vision Technology, a computer mail order company which last year opened the first computer superstore in Europe under the logo PC World, concurs with Toshiba's interpretation of the main trends in the market. 'I would say that portable sales are definitely growing compared with other forms of computers. But we have found that it has become a commodity market very, very quickly. Prices are coming down a lot faster than people thought and a lot of manufacturers who piled into the market have found that they have had to reduce prices to maintain market share,' he says. His company has reported buoyant sales of portable computers both through its superstore and on its mail order side but he argues that the market is swiftly changing. He detects a rapid move towards the notebook computers - 'laptops are already becoming seen as old technology,' he says. PC World, which is run from a 30,000 sq ft site in Croydon, south London, sells mainly to small and medium-sized businesses but is also selling direct to individual business executives. 'If you are of a certain status, then you are likely to buy a machine to use in conjunction with desk top machines,' Mr Murray says. He claims that PC World is performing well and that the superstore concept will be extended this year. He plans to open a second store in the Brent Cross area of north London at the beginning of May. But the consumer market for portable computers is generally proving a difficult one to crack. Mr Alan Dickinson, buying director for Dixons, the UK's biggest electrical retailing group, says that the growth rate for mobile computers has not matched the early projections. Dixons sells most of its mobile computers, ranging from Pounds 599 upwards, to individual consumers or small businesses. But he claims there is still considerable resistance to their high price, which can be 30 to 35 per cent higher than desk top computers with identical functions.</p>

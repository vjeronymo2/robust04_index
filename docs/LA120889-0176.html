			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PALESTINIANS UNDER CURFEW  </P> <P> More than 1 million Palestinians were under curfew in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip today to prevent violence on the eve of the second anniversary  of the Palestinian uprising's start.  </P> <P> As it had done on previous days designated as special occasions by the  Palestinians, the military confined most of the Palestinians in the occupied  territories to their homes.  </P> <P> In the Gaza Strip, residents in several neighborhoods broke the curfew to  attend prayers. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the  worshipers, but no injuries were reported, Palestinian sources said.  </P> <P> In Nazareth, the largest Arab city within Israel, about 30 Arab women held a  demonstration in the center of the city in support of the uprising.  </P> <P> The underground Palestinian leadership in its latest leaflet instructed Arabs  to mark the anniversary on Saturday by observing a general strike, raising  outlawed Palestinian flags and writing slogans.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Go Voyages may cancel takeover deal GO VOYAGES, one of the largest French bucket shop travel companies, is threatening to pull out of its long-running negotiations for a takeover by Air France, the state-controlled airline. Air France has for the past year been in discussions to buy Go Voyages, a subsidiary of Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires, the French insurance group. GMF is keen to withdraw from the travel sector and a year ago signed a provisional agreement to sell Go Voyages to SOTAIR, the airline's travel arm. Mr Serge Fabre, chief executive of Go Voyages, said yesterday it would look for other investors if Air France did not clinch the deal within a month. Air France refused to comment. Earlier this year it announced plans for an expansion of its travel activities by merging SOTAIR with the tour businesses owned by Havas, the French media and travel group, and TUI, the German holiday company. Go Voyages has just emerged from a period in which it sustained heavy losses. Mr Fabre yesterday said it had returned to the black in its last financial year to October 31 when turnover rose to FFr378m from FFr366m in the previous year.</p>

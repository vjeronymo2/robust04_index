			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 25 May (KNA/PANA) -- The half-caste  Belgian-Burundian businessman Mathias Hitimana, chairman of the  small monarchist People's Reconciliation Party (PRP), has urged  workers in Burundi to go on strike on Wednesday [25 May].    The PRP leader's demands include the opening of the public  media to the opposition and the cancellation of plans to hold a  conference on the theme "Restauration and Maintenance of Public  Order in the State of Law", scheduled for early June in Nairobi.    The initiator of the conference is the UN secretary  general's  special representative in Burundi, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of  Mauritania. All political organizations in Burundi and the army  command have been invited to the conference. But the  opposition, fronted by PRP sees the conference as a repeat of  the Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) summit meeting. [passage omitted]    Newspapers close to the opposition has branded the proposed  meeting as a "summit of betrayal" for seeking to discuss the  delicate issue of the Burundi Army outside the national  territory. The threat of a general strike looms over the  Burundian capital at a time when interim President Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya has been touring the country for a week, asking  his fellow displaced countrymen to return to their homes now  that calm is gradually returning.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATH;  </P> <P> BRITISH SPY GREVILLE WYNNE DIES  </P> <P> Greville Wynne, who spied on the Soviet Union for Britain during the Cold War  and who spent 18 months in a Moscow prison after being caught, died of throat  cancer Wednesday, hospital officials said today. He was 71.  </P> <P> The wealthy businessman, who described his exploits in two celebrated memoirs  -- "The Man from Moscow" and "The Man From Odessa" -- worked for Britain's MI6  Secret Intelligence Service. He said he acted as the intermediary for Soviet  double agent Col. Oleg Penkovsky, a senior military intelligence officer who  passed Moscow secrets to MI6 and the CIA.  </P> <P> Opposition Labor Party legislator Ted Leadbitter said of Wynne in a statement  to reporters Wednesday night: "How many secrets has this man taken to his  grave?"  </P> <P> Wynne set up his own business as an exporter of industrial engineering products  in 1950, traveling often to Soviet Bloc countries.  </P> <P> He was arrested during a trip to Budapest, Hungary, in 1962 and put on trial in  Moscow in 1963 for spying and was sentenced to eight years in prison.  </P> <P> Penkovsky, who was tried with him, was sentenced to death for treason. He  reportedly committed suicide in a Soviet labor camp.  </P> <P> Wynne served 18 months in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. He was freed in 1964 in  exchange for Soviet spy Conon Molody, or Gordon Lonsdale as he called himself  in Britain.  </P></p>

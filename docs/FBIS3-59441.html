			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Dan Stanca: "We Will Be Sold Out for a Third </F> Time"]    [Text] The meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and  President Boris Yeltsin will not be a mere routine one, at which  a few more nuclear missiles will be scrapped or the race for  more Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) treaties will be  continued. This meeting will decide the fate of quite a few  people and of several nations and even whole countries.  Therefore, next week's meeting in Moscow will be on a par with  the Yalta and, more recently, the Malta meetings. The Iron  Curtain came up at Yalta, through Stalinist-type methods that  did not bother about or waste time with niceties. At Malta,  Mikhail Gorbachev's reasoning (with its Brezhnev-type  limitations) -- faced with the economic disaster of the entire  Eastern bloc but also with President George Bush's adroitness --  had to make important concessions to the free world. There, the  Russians lost their former empire, but secretly hoped that that  crash will be short-term. At the forthcoming meeting in Moscow,  we will see if that failure is going to be sealed or whether the  Russian forces are going to turn against the United States and  the West asking for their rights.    What has happened since Malta? In the past four years, the  repressive communist-centralist system has collapsed noisily,  amidst the cheers of the crowds. But quite paradoxically, and  parallel to this visible downfall, the old structures were  restored more or less enigmatically from one case to another and  from one country to the other, in a function of the specific  conditions of development or backwardness prevailing in the  respective state -- to use the well-known phrase. The former  German Democratic Republic was the first to escape and was  swallowed by the strong machinery of West Germany. Poland,  Hungary, and Czechoslovakia brusquely remembered that they do  not belong to Eastern Europe, but rather to Central Europe;  consequently they felt that they must strictly distance  themselves from their former Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance [CEMA] and Warsaw Pact partners. Thus, the  "Trilateral" came into being, out of conceit and the desire to  forestall would-be future surprises. These surprises began to  appear from the moment when a country like Romania, where the  anticommunist revolution had been the most radical and violent  and whose interwar record has been obviously hostile to the  left, went astray as early as 1990 both internally and  externally. Internally, by convincing the foreign countries --  something which not even our most hated enemies would have  managed to do so well -- that the communists are still in power.  Externally, by signing the shameful treaty with Moscow, which  basically sanctioned our previous relationship with our master  beyond the Dniester. The comeback we have made of late,  particularly in 1993 (the Council of Europe and so forth), has  come rather late and has only had a formal significance -- it  was just dust in the people's eyes, only that our dignitaries  are wearing protective glasses. The true integration is not  ensured by our national flag being hoisted in Strasbourg, but  rather by our admittance to the Euro-Atlantic security bodies,  which everybody craves for, but few will achieve. That is why  the U.S. President's visit to Europe, correlated to the NATO  meeting, acquires an overwhelming importance. Will we be sold  out for the third time? The theory of the Iron Curtain has been  ever-more successfully replaced by the theory of the sanitary  cordon in the propaganda campaigns of the international media.  Faced with scores of millions of hungry hordes from Russia, the  West has been obliged to take defensive measures. For this, it  must knowingly sacrifice a group of countries, which will thus  become a buffer between it and the convulsions of the Russian  colossus. These countries will definitely not be the "award"  countries of the Visegrad treaty, with whose representatives  Clinton will also meet in Prague. Neither will they be the  Baltic countries, which, in the opinion of historians, represent  a jewel of Catholic civilization in the north eastern part of  the continent. These countries will be the pitiable Ukraine,  Romania (Moldova), and Bulgaria. Maybe the Red Army's  triumphant march of 1944-45 up to the gates of Berlin cannot be  undone in only 50 years, but rather in 100 years! What is our  only chance? That Bill Clinton's saxophone mind will clear up  and realize that a strategic zone for NATO is not so much  Central Europe as the Balkans, where the much desired stability  cannot be ensured by Greece alone. The much flaunted theory  that Romania is a bridgehead in this convulsed region must be  implemented. Otherwise, by selling us out for a third time, the  West will sell itself out.</p>

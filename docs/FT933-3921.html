			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rates boost Germany's decision to reduce its interest rates, which sparked off a wave of cuts through Europe, prompted share price increases for UK companies with a big exposure to the Continent. The boost to industry that lower rates will provide gave particularly a fillip to the UK's hard-pressed building industry groups. RMC Group, which has substantial German interests, jumped 28 to 807p. Redland rose 14 to 548p, BPB 6 to 247p and Rugby Group 3 to 276p. Blue Circle Industries, also active in Europe, received an extra boost from positive interim figures and the shares advanced 14 to 284p in heavy turnover of 12m. The company, which reported a 31 per cent jump in profits, said market conditions in the UK and US were improving. Housebuilders and property groups also benefited from the hope that UK rates might now fall further. Bellway moved forward 7 to 449p, Alfred McAlpine 4 to 210p, Great Portland Estates 7 to 213p and Slough Estates 10 to 237p.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading An erratic and less confident performance from derivatives markets took its toll of equities again yesterday, writes Terry Byland. The March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index undermined the stock market at first, when it failed to hold a premium of 15 to 20 points against cash, and caused share prices to hurriedly abandon early gains. The contract continued to drift down for much of the remainder of the session, before rallying as Wall Steet opened in good form. At the day's worst, the March contract was at a discount of several points against its fair value premium, currently estimated at 13 points, unchanged from last week. But by the close, a premium of 9 points to fair value had been restored. Volume slipped below last week's levels to record 12,635 bargains. Dealers pointed out that there had been no opportunity for the arbitrage operations between futures and underlying stocks which enlivened both markets last week. Yesterday, the locals, or independent traders, found themselves left to trade amongst themselves. The big securities houses were content to tidy up any outstanding trading situations positions but uninterested in opening up new ones. Business in traded options was reduced, the final total of 33,868 contracts contrasting with nearly 55,000 on Friday. Volume in the Footsie contract dipped to 9,136 from 13,717, while the Euro FT-SE contract returned 3,314. Among individual contracts, Ladbroke, the leisure, bookmaking and hotels group, topped the list with 3,297 as investors continued to reasses the implications of the departure of the chairman.</p>

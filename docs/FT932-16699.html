			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Earning a crust in a gastronomic wasteland - Ian Hamilton Fazey visits a sandwich bar which has found a hungry market ANYONE who believes that the management techniques of big business cannot be applied to small ones should meet Helen Jessop. She learnt about market research and marketing while working for two Manchester advertising agencies. When she started her own business in 1991, she put everything she knew to the test. It has worked better than she ever imagined. The business is called HJ's Quality Sandwich Makers. What makes it unusual is its insalubrious location near the Old Trafford football and cricket grounds, and because marketing has turned it into more of a factory than a shop. Of 800 sandwiches sold every day, about 500 go in three rounds to the office blocks of Old Trafford, Trafford Park and Salford Quays. She has three vans and 10 employees, including a full-time chef. They work flat out from 5am each day making lunch for hundreds of office workers, with executive and boardroom buffets a growing sideline. She started only 19 months ago with three employees, a Pounds 7,000 loan from Barclays, Pounds 40 a week from the government's enterprise allowance scheme and a day's obligatory awareness training at Trafford Business Venture, the local enterprise agency. She now turns over between Pounds 4,000 and Pounds 5,000 a week and has nearly paid Barclays back. 'It was because I knew the market was there that we have succeeded,' she says. 'It was a classical case of a finding a hole and filling it.' Her husband, Mike Featherstone, an independent financial adviser in Manchester city centre, first put her on to it. He used to work for Allied Dunbar in Old Trafford and was always annoyed at the limited range of local choice for lunch. Helen also used to work nearby, for BDH, a Manchester advertising agency, where she was assistant to the planning and research director. Its staff used to repair to a local pub for lunch because of the shortage of choice. Helen went on to work for BCMB, another agency, where she was an account supervisor. She left to have a son, Henry. Rather than return to advertising, Helen, now 30, told Mike, 15 years her senior, she wanted a business of her own so they would have more control over their lives. She researched his sandwich shop idea, and quickly discovered potential bulk customers among companies in local office blocks. 'But I didn't just offer to supply any old sandwiches,' she says. 'I did what I had learned to do in marketing: I spent time with people discussing their likes and dislikes so we could give them what they wanted.' This included comparison of sandwiches available in Manchester's many shops. Philpotts, which has popular sandwich shops in central Manchester and Chester, was universally praised, so she deliberately set out to match them, seeing no point in trying to reinvent the wheel. Her menu ranges from a cheddar cheese sandwich, for 70p, up to an avocado and prawn baguette for Pounds 2. Armed with a sound top line for her business plan, she had no trouble in raising her bank loan or getting approval to join the enterprise allowance scheme. Mike put up Pounds 40,000 to buy HJ's premises, an unimpressive former dental surgery with a flat above - now home for Henry's nanny - in a run-down parade of shops in Old Trafford. Menus are distributed widely and orders are can be faxed to the shop - or customers can buy from the trolleys her three drivers wheel out of their little Suzuki vans and into the office blocks HJ's supplies. The trolleys were designed by Frank Whitty, an engineer in Altrincham, where Helen and Mike live. They stand nearly five feet high and their many trays can be swivelled out, forming mobile displays. The vans themselves have her business's name sign-written on them and have proved effective peripatetic advertisements, attracting new office blocks of customers who have seen them parked outside neighbouring premises. One of her customers buys 500 sandwiches a day for its employees - and gets a bulk discount. The deal has wiped out long lunch hours caused by staff leaving the building in search of food. The office blocks she does not supply are those within a few hundred yards of the shop. These customers walk to her, and queue. This frees the vans to go farther afield in a five-mile radius. In December, she ploughed back Pounds 15,000 of investment into the most modern cooking, chilling and food storage equipment available. Nearly all sandwich fillings are cooked daily on the premises. Soups are home-made in true culinary waste-saving tradition. Getting the right staff has been her biggest problem. The area is not the best, bordering Moss Side, Manchester's inner city problem area. 'I used to use the local Jobcentre but the quality of applicant was not good enough,' Helen says. 'I offered two of them jobs, but they never turned up for work.' Others were sacked for unreliability or stealing stock. Now she relies on word-of-mouth to recruit new staff. 'The team is now excellent,' she says. Mike does the books and wages every Friday. Helen pays Pounds 3.10 an hour and has part-time helpers on Sundays, when Monday's sandwich fillings are prepared. Things do not always go to plan. A few weeks ago she had to put in nine hours one Sunday on her own, boiling and shelling 12 gross of eggs and producing thousands of cucumber and tomato slices. It is the price of success. 'I never thought it would take off like this,' Helen says, 'but I was always trained to believe that if you research the market properly, produce then right products and promote them to the right people, then the sales will come. They have.' There is no competition yet, but now she has opened the market, her big business experience tells her this will probably be the next challenge.

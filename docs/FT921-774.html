			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Jardine Strategic issue surprise JARDINE Strategic, the investment holding company of the Jardine Matheson group, yesterday surprised the market when it said it was considering a Euro-convertible preference share issue. The company released no details of the proposed issue but said, if it proceeds, the funds would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and provide funds for further investment. Analysts were taken by surprise because Jardine Strategic only last July moved to convert compulsorily the remainder of a convertible preference issue it floated in 1989. That issue raised USDollars 200m and analysts expect Jardine to raise a similar amount this time around. Earlier in the day, Jardine Strategic directors had declined to comment on talk in the Hong Kong stock market that it was about to make a rights issue. Rumours of a rights issue earlier knocked 50 cents off the shares. Speculation concerning rights issues by various blue-chip companies have swept the Hong Kong market during the current financial results reporting season. The Euro-convertible preference share issue announcement came with annual results for the company which showed a 9.5 per cent growth in net earnings to USDollars 233.2m from USDollars 212.9m. Mr Henry Keswick, the chairman, said the companies in which Jardine Strategic has an interest were financially strong and were well placed to take advantage of dynamic growth prospects in the Asia-Pacific region. 'While it is too early to make any forecasts for the current year, the underlying businesses have made and encouraging start and the longer term prospects for Jardine Strategic remain excellent,' he said. Directors declared a final dividend of US cents 7 a share which, together with the interim of US cents 3.5 makes a total of US cents 10.5 - 163 per cent higher than in 1990.</p>

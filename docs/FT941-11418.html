			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / People: Torday &amp; Carlisle Paul Torday, 47, grandson of the founder of Newcastle engineers TORDAY &amp; CARLISLE, is bowing out after more than a decade at the helm of a company he joined over 20 years ago. The company, which lost Pounds 13m in its last financial year and is not paying a dividend, refused to comment on the reasons for Torday's impending departure. However, there have been reports of growing institutional pressure for boardroom changes. Torday's decision to quit the company when a new chief executive is found comes less than a month after the resignation of two of the company's three non-executive directors, Sir Michael Carlisle and Michael Denny. The company has appointed three executives, David Batie, Mike Hennon and Menno van der Hulst from DMI, its core business, to the main board and says that it also wants to appoint two non-executive directors.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHAPO: HATS OFF TO FRANCO-MEDITERRANEAN TASTE  </P> <P> Chapo is a perfectly logical spelling of the French word for hat, which the  French don't happen to use. And there actually is a hat at Chapo Restaurant, a  derby perched on the end of a ceiling beam. That's Chapo for you: a little  eccentric, but neat.  </P> <P> The owners used to have a restaurant in Belgium called the Curiosity, and  actually I suspect the hat is a little fun they're having with the excessive  neatness of the Belgians. Belgium is a country where guests invited to dinner  at 7 p.m. arrive at 6:50 or so and stand outside the door without knocking  until the very second of the hour. I know such a practice would drive me to  sticking a derby on a rafter.  </P> <P> Foodwise, there's not much that reflects Belgium, though. Certainly Chapo knows  its endives; the Caesar salad is a tile pattern of endive leaves, each  containing a little mustardy sauce and some Parmesan (down at the bottom, there  are some romaine leaves to throw us off). The mussel soup, made with  particularly good mussels in a cream and sherry broth, might be a Belgian dish.  </P> <P> The basic style of the place, though, is Franco-Mediterranean with a definite  personal accent. With the bread, in place of butter, comes a bowl of olive oil  flavored with basil. The French fries (called "Curiosity fries," referring to  the Belgian restaurant) are made from waxy potatoes and flavored with rosemary  and red pepper.  </P> <P> There are pastas and such, but a lot of what's going on here is quite classic  French. The wonderful smoked salmon comes with a toasted brioche. Lamb  garnished with small white beans in garlicky lamb stock is agneau a la  bretonne, and the pork in a sauce of mustard, cream and meat juices could come  straight from Normandy.  </P> <P> But the place seems nouvelle/California at the same time. Nothing could be more  nouvelle/California than a sandwich of goat cheese and chicken thigh meat with  romaine lettuce and grilled prosciutto. (It does slide around a little on the  good chewy French bread.) There's a three-mushroom salad with balsamic vinegar,  and a field salad with toasted pine nuts scattered over it. There's also  grilled ahi and black-and-white fettuccine with seafood, which happen to be the  only uninteresting dishes I've had here.  </P> <P> But the restaurant ventures into areas where nobody around here has really gone  yet. Our relentless California eclecticism only rarely plays with the  possibilities of Moroccan food, but one night Chapo had a special of a "spicy  lamb sausage" with sweet peppers that was certainly Provencale/North African.  And nothing anywhere is quite like the osso buco with ginger risotto. Yes,  ginger risotto, rich with meat juices and glowing with ginger. It's probably  the best single thing on the menu.  </P> <P> The desserts are European or American, however, and uniformly excellent. They  can be as simple as a lemon cake ("like a really good birthday cake," as  someone put it) or a chocolate pecan pie with caramel sauce, or as elaborate as  an apple tart with a lattice crust that is itself topped with a layer of  paper-thin apple slices in apricot glaze. The best might be the incredibly  creamy cheesecake.  </P> <P> This is a great little place. I guess my hat's off to it.  </P> <P>  Chapo Restaurant, 7661 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 655-2924. Open for  lunch Monday through Friday, for dinner nightly. Beer and wine. Valet parking.  American Express, Carte Blanche, Diners Club and MasterCard accepted. Dinner  for two, food only, $30 to $55.  </P> <P> </P></p>

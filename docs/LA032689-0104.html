			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BROADWAY BOUND?  </P> <P> Fitness guru Richard Simmons is trying to put together a Broadway musical  called "Lbs.," which would cast him as the son of an eccentric woman who  inherits a fat farm. Twelve songs have already been written for the two-act  show, including "The Last Supper" -- a tribute to that final binge before  serious dieting begins.  </P> <P> Simmons told us he's been working on the project for three years with writer  Bruce Vilanch and songwriters Earl Brown and Artie Butler. The William Morris  Agency is handling the business end, and Simmons hopes to begin casting in  January.  </P> <P> "We four all have something in common: We love to eat and we've gone through  periods where we would sell our mothers for a hot loaf of French bread,"  explained the 5-foot-6 1/2-inch Simmons, who weighed 268 pounds in high school,  before averaging out at 155 pounds in recent years. The show, he promised, will  be "very funny, but also with a sensitive message. Nobody who sees it will ever  make fun of an overweight person again."  </P> <P> But can the ex-chub sing?  </P> <P> "Let's just say 'Ethel Merman.' Honey, I can hit the back row every time. I'm a  born belter." From Stacy Jenel Smith  </P></p>

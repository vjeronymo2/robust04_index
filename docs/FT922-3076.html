			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: Unfair picture presented of water services' operational and investment activities Sir, The director-general of water services last Tuesday published a considered and objective report which highlighted an increase in complaints. He made it clear that the increase was low - four in every 10,000 households or 0.04 per cent. He also stated that there was no evidence to link this increase to any decline in standards of service. However, the media fastened on the increase and went on to link this with high profits, high prices and high salaries. With only a few exceptions, the media presented a picture of monopolies failing the nation whose customers could look only to the director-general for protection. This picture is a travesty of the truth. The facts are that standards of service and water quality are higher than ever before and still improving. Investment is higher in real terms than at any time in the past 100 years, with nearly 100 per cent of works now meeting the standards currently required. Discharges to bathing waters will meet the current standards by 1995 or soon after. Over 70 per cent of profits are reinvested. Amounts distributed to shareholders are less than were previously paid in interest to government. Prices are rising solely to pay for higher investment. Top salaries and other perquisites are less than in other businesses of comparable size. The positive change in attitudes to customers between the previous authorities and privatised companies is very marked, as demonstrated in their own market research and also the recent customer survey carried out for the director general by MORI. We now have highly effective, efficient, profitable water companies, providing higher standards of service. We have left behind companies which were under-resourced, under-invested and subject to constant political interference. From 1947 the public and parliament groaned at the burden of inefficient, loss-making, nationalised industries. We now have a model that is successful. Our best inventions are said always to be derided at home and exploited abroad. Is this now going to happen with privatisation? We ask only that the media and the public look at the facts and judge us fairly on performance. Such an objective appraisal would lead any reasonable person to welcome the new model of private water companies under public regulation and to encourage the companies to get on and complete the job they have started so successfully.

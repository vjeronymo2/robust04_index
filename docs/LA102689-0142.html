			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE MARKET THAT COULD: IT NO LONGER CAN;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: COMPETITION AND FALLING PROFITS SPELL DOOM FOR A VENERABLE  'MOM-AND-POP' OPERATION. IT WILL MAKE WAY FOR A NEW RETAIL CENTER.  </P> <P> Dwarfed by modern supermarkets and threatened by shrinking profits, it was the  little market that could.  </P> <P> Now it can't.  </P> <P> Riverside Market, which has stood at the same North Hollywood intersection for  more than 40 years, will close early next month. The property is being sold to  a developer who may replace it with a retail center containing a bank, gift  shop and real estate brokerage firm.  </P> <P> "It's the end of a neighborhood institution," said Tom Paterson, president of  the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. "There aren't very many like it around."  </P> <P> Three generations of the Damus family have run the one-story, white grocery  store at Riverside Drive and Laurel Canyon Boulevard since it opened in the  mid-1940s. Back then it was an open-air market and offered locally grown  oranges, corn and apricots. Despite diminishing annual returns -- last year's  profits plunged to only about $25,000 -- the family has kept the store open  until 2 a.m. daily, 365 days a year.  </P> <P> Now the market, which was enclosed in the 1950s and has low ceilings and  exposed rafters, looks half-naked, with its shelves stripped of canned goods  and freezers sitting empty.  </P> <P> "It was our second home for 40 years, but it can't be helped," said Vic Damus  Sr., 70, who bought the store eight months before the end of World War II. The  elder Damus has leukemia and has largely left the closing of the store and the  dismissal of its 15 employees to his son Mike and other children.  </P> <P> "It's been a tough situation all along because of Price Club and the warehouse  supermarkets," said Mike Damus, 33. "There's a 50-50 chance we'll relocate in  south Van Nuys or Studio City."  </P> <P> The "mom-and-pop" stores are "a dying breed" and are closing all over the  state, said Don Beaver, president of the Sacramento-based California Grocers  Assn. Beaver said his group does not keep such statistics, but he estimates  that close to half of the state's 20,000 grocery stores are former small  markets that have been converted to quick-stop convenience stores.  </P> <P> "It's progress," Beaver said.  </P> <P> A woman shopping in the Riverside Market this week agreed, saying she "never  trusted" the store because its meat and produce is displayed in older cases  instead of shiny new ones. But longtime patron Roger Knight, a movie set  dresser in his late 30s, said the store's passing will leave a void in the  community. Knight was buying rabbit and stuffed pork chops, prepared to order  by the store's butcher.  </P> <P> "This is the kind of place that if you were short on cash, they'd let you go  home and bring back the money later," Knight said. "It has a neighborhood feel.  I wish they'd find another place for that shopping center."  </P> <P> "It's like a little piece of home," said Patt Bellevilli, 28, who moved from  Detroit to North Hollywood last year. "I hate big grocery stores because you  never meet your neighbors there."  </P> <P> The property is being bought by Long Beach developer Bob Champion, who declined  Tuesday to reveal the purchase price. One of the conditions of sale was that  the market and a nearby florist shop and shoe repair store be vacated, said Tom  Leanse, an attorney for the Damus family.  </P> <P> Champion said he may raze the stores and build three one-story buildings that  would be occupied by a bank and other new businesses. Another option is to  renovate the existing buildings, but he said they are in poor condition.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who occasionally shops at the market,  said he hopes Champion will consult with residents' groups before developing  the property. If Champion does not, "then to the extent that I have leverage,  I'll use it" to influence city decisions on development of the site, Wachs  said.  </P></p>

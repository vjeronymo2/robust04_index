			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO EASY A'S IN TOP SOUTH BAY SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The South Bay Union Elementary School District found itself once again at the  rarefied level of California's top districts when the state's closely watched  annual achievement test scores for elementary school performance came out  earlier this month.  </P> <P> Although no surprise to South Bay administrators -- who push tough  accountability standards for teachers and who zealously stress basic skills --  the scores continue to astound many among the county's education establishment.  </P> <P> After all, South Bay is a district with 8,600 students whose families are 68%  nonwhite (mostly Latino); 57% working poor; 16% on welfare. Its geographical  area hugs the backside of San Diego Bay, running through Imperial Beach, Nestor  and Palm City. Yet its California Assessment Program (CAP) results rank right  up with those of high-rent districts along the North Coast and Interstate 15  corridors.  </P> <P> In gauging the reasons behind South Bay's performance, discussion soon centers  on its physically imposing, hard-charging superintendent, Philip Grignon, a  58-year-old, no-nonsense schools veteran whose passion for improving public  education has stirred admirers and detractors.  </P> <P> The history of South Bay during Grignon's almost five years as its chief is  replete with change and controversy. His successful, sustained push for  quarterly monitoring of teacher and student progress, for widespread use of  computers, new teaching methods and curricula, all is directed toward the  payoff of improved achievement as measured by standardized tests.  </P> <P> Student scores in South Bay have jumped by 20% to 30% in recent years,  depending on the particular standardized math or reading test.  </P> <P> "Meet my standards, and I love you," says Grignon, a husky, 6-foot former  Marine Corps judo champion with a leathery face he readily admits resembles the  texture of a football. "If not, then go be happy somewhere else. . . . For many  parents here, the only thing to be proud of is their children, and this  district produces test scores that they can be proud of."  </P> <P> Among those impressed are state schools Supt. Bill Honig, who has used CAP  testing to push reform and improve accountability statewide, and who personally  congratulated Grignon and his staff at a ceremony in May in Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> "They emphasize curriculum, staff training, organization, and have gotten their  kids to read, to do math, to grow (academically) more than (students) anywhere  else," Honig said in an interview. "Grignon thumbs his nose at those who say  you can't have high standards and high achievement everywhere. . . . There are  all kinds of personalties and styles, but the bottom line is whether you've  delivered the goods."  </P> <P> But Grignon's role as gruff taskmaster has had its downside as well, arousing  critics who point to his blunt style and his single-minded pursuit of better  test scores.  </P> <P> After Grignon called the teachers union "a cancer on education" in a  particularly angry moment during heated salary negotiations in 1988, California  Teachers Assn. chief Ed Foglia labeled Grignon "intemperate, intolerant and  confrontational . . . exactly the kind of person we teachers work so hard to  prevent our students from becoming."  </P> <P> Yet Grignon's only detractor on the district's five-member board of trustees --  he voted against Grignon's last contract renewal and says he would vote no  again today -- nevertheless confesses ambivalence because of the  superintendent's many accomplishments.  </P> <P> That trustee, Thomas Teagle, principal of an adult education school in the  neighboring Sweetwater district, compared Grignon's insistence on innovation  and high expectations to the methods of Jaime Escalante, the nationally  renowned calculus teacher whose creative classroom style has motivated Latino  high school students in East Los Angeles to pass college-level courses.  </P> <P> "If I was the education god, I'd stick Phil Grignon in the toughest district in  the nation," Teagle said. "Those urban districts need a tough person willing to  shake up the troops, and he'd do that well."  </P> <P> But, Teagle added quickly, "South Bay doesn't need that style," saying that  Grignon has offended people for years by being abrasive. Teagle himself ran for  the board after his own personal run-in with Grignon, an incident he prefers  not to discuss today but which still influences his view of the superintendent.  </P> <P> "He wants to be aloof, he wants to be feared. I just don't like his style,"  Teagle said.  </P> <P> People in the district talk privately about hearing stories that Grignon  "dresses down" principals or teachers whose schools show small test  improvements or whose instructional methods fall short.  </P> <P> In his defense, Principal Lynda Schultheis said Grignon can be pointed in  discussing improvements he wants to see but never personally abusive. Board  member Doug Langdon said that Grignon can dispense strong medicine, especially  to those relmuctant to change, "but I have never seen him demeaning to people."  </P> <P> Bayside School teacher Bill Boyd said major changes wrought in the district,  rather than Grignon himself, might be the source of much of the animosity.  </P> <P> "It would cause problems in any organization."  </P> <P> Grignon concedes that he can be impatient with people, and he has tried to  soften his handling of personnel in response to board directives. "I don't  think the rank-and-file teachers are as vitriolic against me as the union  itself is," Grignon said, conceding that he regards the union as a barrier to  speedy change. "Yes, in general I'm probably not well-liked, but I'm going to  hold everyone accountable nevertheless."  </P> <P> Grignon lives, eats and sleeps education. He shows up at work Monday mornings  often talking about three or four new ideas conceived as a result of weekend  reading or bull sessions with district colleagues.  </P> <P> Around South Bay district headquarters, the only living being seemingly  unaffected by his energy and ideas is his dog, Isabeau. The dog, a rare bouvier  des Flandres breed, distinguished by a rough, wiry coat and long used in  Belgium for herding cattle, sleeps contentedly in Grignon's corner office while  Grignon alternately strokes and scolds his staff.  </P> <P> Yet even Isabeau is brought into Grignon's "push for excellence" when the  superintendent visits a school. He isn't content to have the children marvel at  the unusual dog: at Pence School last week, he peppered a kindergarten class  with questions about Isabeau. For example: "Look at her tail, how is it  different from other dogs?" (It's a bobtail.) He pulled a world map down over  the blackboard and pointed out the location of Flanders in an impromptu  geography lesson.  </P> <P> "I'd say his only weakness is that he needs more balance in his life . . . he  is all school, school, school, although I don't know if a normal person could  have gotten all the changes through," board member Nancy C. Yturralde said of  Grignon.  </P> <P> Grignon has had a zest for action since he joined the Marine Corps as a  high-school dropout from the lower East Side of New York in the early 1950s. He  was posted to Japan, where he gave judo demonstrations to Japanese as the U.S.  military champion in 1955.  </P> <P> Entering community college in Southern California on his return, Grignon  eventually became a biology teacher in south Orange County, winning state and  national laurels as "biology teacher of the year" and helping to initiate a  "Save the Whales" campaign as well at the Orange County Marine Institute.  </P> <P> His South Bay stint was preceded by 3 1/2 years as superintendent in the  smaller Carlsbad system, where he received high marks for rescuing that North  County district from insolvency and beginning a host of programs to raise  sputtering academic standards. In 1985, Carlsbad was named one of 17 districts  nationwide that had met recommendations in a 1983 Carnegie Foundation report  that castigated American public schooling.  </P> <P> But Grignon left a sour taste among many teachers in Carlsbad because of his  hard-nosed wage bargaining and temporary layoffs to stop the red ink. He was  also criticized for being too much a perfectionist.  </P> <P> Similarly, Grignon wasted little time in shaking things up after taking over  the 12-school South Bay system.  </P> <P> Grignon instituted a rigorous, quantifiable evaluation of teachers four times a  year, examining their instructional methods and the performance of their  students. Under the setup, the principal or assistant principal reviews written  goals set both for the teachers and each individual student. Principals are  expected to spend 50% of their time observing in the classroom.  </P> <P> The district's curriculum has been aligned closely with the academic frameworks  in math, English, science and writing recommended by the state Department of  Education and used by the state as the content basis for CAP testing.  </P> <P> Grignon has invested heavily -- more than $2 million -- in computer equipment  and programs for every grade, including a "write-to-read" program specifically  for kindergartners and first-graders. Each teacher and each school has specific  plans for raising test scores annually, and test records are kept year-to-year  on students so schools can determine how much growth a child has made annually.  A new reading and writing competition among schools will reward teachers  monetarily whose students show the most improvement on a combination  multiple-choice and essay test.  </P> <P> Teacher salaries rank in the top three of the county's 37 districts, with a  1987-88 salary of $36,300 for a teacher with average senority. The district  runs an extraordinary number of teacher training programs for its size and  prefers to promote from within. Seven schools run year-round, with three more  to begin year-round in July, each with proposed different schedules under a  Grignon idea to give parents an option of sending their children for more than  the state-mandated 180 days a year. All schools have free pre- and after-school  education activities.  </P> <P> All of Grignon's changes are tied to his belief that schools can make a  difference for students and that achievement is not controlled by economic or  social status. His administrative staff strongly backs his ideas, themselves  working 60-hour-a-week shifts, in addition to occasional weekend retreats at  which Grignon and his cabinet brainstorm other innovations.  </P> <P> "Good students test well," West View principal Lowell Billings said. "And  traditionally, our students were not expected to test well compared to those in  Bonita or La Jolla."  </P> <P> "For years, socioeconomics has been used to explain why kids don't learn," said  Marilyn Wheeler, South Bay's testing coordinator who left Carlsbad for South  Bay. "It's one thing to say we have high expectations, but quite another to  work consciously to carry them out."  </P> <P> Helen Steel, assistant principal of Nicoloff School, said she was skeptical  when Grignon first put his plans into effect. Now she supports his program.  </P> <P> "I was never held accountable as a teacher," Steel said. "Today, the principal  is a partner with the teacher, and fewer students are allowed to fall through  the cracks."  </P> <P> Nestor School teacher Jeff Knox, although by no means an unabashed admirer of  Grignon, respects the high standards the superintendent sets.  </P> <P> "Grignon demands that I know my stuff . . . and a lot of the staff development  has been very, very good. There is more substance than gloss, although I hate  to admit it." But Knox said that Grignon also has reaped the benefits of the  many good teachers already in South Bay when he arrived.  </P> <P> Knox also said he doesn't argue with the results from test scores, although he  is uncomfortable with the amount of skills reviews that teachers are asked to  do.  </P> <P> "You pass on a lot of anxiety to the teachers and to the students," Knox said.  </P> <P> Boyd of Bayside School said that, although perhaps 70% of the district  improvement in test scores results from improved curriculum and the rest from  regular review -- estimates also cited by trustee Doug Langdon -- he dislikes  Grignon's use of the scores to push the district's visibility and publicity  agenda.  </P> <P> Grignon makes no apologies for wanting high standardized scores, saying there  is nothing wrong with emphasizing skills measured on tests such as CAP --  skills that California educators have agreed are important. He also points out  that the district's new reading curriculum is ahead of other districts in  carrying out state changes for literature-based instruction, and away from  rote-skill learning that some have accused the district, without specifics, of  doing to raise test scores.  </P> <P> "I agree that tests don't measure everything, but they do tell me if the kids  know reading, math and social studies," Grignon said. "I'd rather have  increased reading proficiency than increased playground mechanics or  socialization techniques."  </P> <P> He uses that argument in his latest campaign, a fight to take over two junior  high and two senior high schools from the Sweetwater district and unify South  Bay as a kindergarten-through-12th-grade system. Grignon cites low test scores  in the Sweetwater system, saying that the skills his students take away from  the sixth grade in South Bay dissipate after several years in Sweetwater-run  schools.  </P> <P> Sweetwater officials oppose the idea, and want to analyze computer data to  compare the performance of South Bay students with that of students in the San  Ysidro, National and Chula Vista elementary districts who also attend  Sweetwater secondary schools.  </P> <P> South Bay, nevertheless, will push the issue to a vote if necessary. "We're  being attacked because what we are proposing makes (Sweetwater) nervous . . .  that with attention to detail and hard work, anyone can do what we have done,"  Grignon said.  </P></p>

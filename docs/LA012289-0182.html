			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A FEW GOOD MEN  </P> <P> Aw, come on. A Marine drill instructor court-martialed and fined for grabbing a  recruit's collar? For using profanity? ("Marines Looking for a Few Good  (Sensitive) Men to Be Drill Instructors," Jan 1).  </P> <P> I can hear a sergeant on a future battlefield far, far away: "Excuse me,  Marines, please consider exiting your foxholes and if it's not too much  trouble, assist me in attacking that gosh darn bunker."  </P> <P> Chesty Puller and Lew Diamond just rolled over in their graves.  </P> <P> CHUCK FERGUSON  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto have greeted President Borhanoddin  Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar on the occasion  of the Islamic Revolution Day of Afghanistan. The president in  his message said the people of Pakistan are proud that they  stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their Afghan brethren in the  difficult time of jihad. They are, however, deeply saddened that  the fighting in Afghanistan continues. He appealed to the  Afghan president to jointly take appropriate steps with other  Afghan leaders so that a cease-fire is enforced immediately and  the process of conciliation restarted.    The prime minister in her message to Engineer Golboddin  Hekmatyar said that the people of Pakistan are concerned with  the continued fighting in Afghanistan, which is depriving them  of the fruits of jihad. She called on the Afghan prime minister  and other Afghan leaders to settle their differences politically  by being flexible in approach and contemplation so that peace  and stability are restored. She assured Pakistan's total support  and cooperation in this respect.</p>

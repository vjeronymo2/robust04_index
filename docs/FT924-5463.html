			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Poor inflation figures help to depress bund prices GERMAN government bonds fell on the combination of poor inflation figures and disappointment that the Bundesbank failed to indicate any willingness to lower interest rates at yesterday's repo operation. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM70.5bn at its tender for 14-day securities repurchase agreements, allocating funds at 8.75 per cent and above. The bund market had hoped to see a lower rate at the repo, and was disappointed that the rate remained unchanged. Although the amount allocated represented a net injection of liquidity of DM10.9bn, dealers said this was mainly for technical reasons. The announcement of worse-than-expected inflation figures for two of the big German states provided further disappointing news for the bund market. North Rhine-Westphalia reported a 0.5 per cent rise in its consumer price index in the month to mid-November, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per cent. Consumer prices in Baden-Wuerttemberg rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-November, up 3.3 per cent year-on-year. Preliminary November consumer price figures for west Germany are expected to be published later this week or early next week. The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its high of 91.65 to end at around 91.33. Dealers said the yield curve flattened at the longer end, and steepened at the short end. Elsewhere in Europe, French government bonds ended slightly firmer helped by a rebound in the currency early in the day. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 opened at 8.25 per cent and ended at 8.24 per cent. UK government bonds gave up some of Tuesday's gains as funding worries continued to haunt the gilt market. Dealers expect concern about the government's heavy borrowing requirement to depress prices ahead of the Bank of England's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction on December 2. The Liffe gilt future contract fell from 100.20 to 100.05 by late afternoon, and prices drifted down in the cash market with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 losing  3/32 to end at around 109 3/16 JAPANESE government bonds ended higher in Tokyo on dealer short-covering. The announcement of a successful auction result after the Tokyo market closed helped to push up JGB futures prices further in London trading. The Finance Ministry offered Y800bn of 10-year bonds with a 4.8 per cent coupon, the lowest coupon for a 10-year JGB in over three years. The average auction price was 100.25, yielding 4.763 per cent, and the bid to cover ratio was 3.9 per cent which dealers said signalled reasonable demand for the issue. The yield on the benchmark No 145 ended at 4.605 per cent, having traded in a range of 4.6 to 4.625 per cent. The key March futures closed at 107.74 in Tokyo, against its opening level of 107.65, and traded up to 107.79 in London. US Treasury prices eased across the board yesterday in the wake of more statistics showing a stronger than expected economy. At the end of a session shortened by the approach of Thanksgiving Day, which will close all markets today, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 101, yielding 7.535 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly weaker, down  1/8 at 99 25/32 , yielding 4.691 per cent. Trading was light throughout because many market participants were winding down business early ahead of the holiday weekend. Prices fell after the Commerce Department announced that third-quarter gross domestic product grew by 3.9 per cent, and not the 2.7 per cent originally reported last month. Analysts had been expecting the figures to be revised upwards, but not by so much. Later in the session, there was some more economic news that was bearish for bonds. Weekly jobless claims fell 12,000 to 374,000, and October existing home sales jumped 9.1 per cent.</p>

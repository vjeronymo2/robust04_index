			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by Serbian Minister for Privatization Radoje Djukic </F> in Cacak on 25 April 1994: "I Am Abolishing `Small Business'"]    [Text] Not one government so far has really understood the  real potential and strength of the private sector, fortunately  never extinguished, even in the "most communist" times. The germ  of enterprise has been preserved. With the replacement of the  political system and the change of climate and attitude in  Serbia, private initiative has gained momentum.    This government and its prime minister realized, however,  the  significance and potential of private enterprise in Serbia, and  formed the Ministry of Private Enterprise. The ministry's goal  and task is, in a completely new ministry with new people and  different views and ideas, to promote private business and to  carry out the necessary institutional changes for that purpose.  Having that kind of potential and using it poorly is  inappropriate for a serious state, and we claim to be a serious  state and to attribute significance to private enterprise, in  view of the trend toward the transformation of social property  into private property. The future of Serbia is thus in private  enterprise. I do not believe that we will use that term  "private" and "social" any longer, because the "most social"  person is the one who engages in socially useful work either by  producing or by providing necessary services to citizens.  <H5>  Encouraging Production </H5>   There are now about 186,000 private enterprises and 210,000  independent craft, commercial, and other shops functioning in  the Republic of Serbia. Unfortunately for us, fewer than 10  percent of them are involved in production: 16,000 enterprises  in industry and mining, 3,800 in construction, 3,000 in  transportation, and 95,600 in commerce. There is a  disproportionate ratio between enterprises engaged in production  and enterprises engaged in commerce, because commerce is in  effect the superstructure of the production base. There are  2,700 private enterprises operating in the hotel industry, 4,000  in crafts and services, and 14,000 in the area of financial and  other services.    The budget of the Republic of Serbia has therefore provided  for very serious funds to encourage production and development,  which will be invested through commercial banks in those  programs and given to those people who will put them to use  quickly and repay them.  <H5>  Changes in the Tax System </H5>   This government inherited a tax system that was never based  on valid parameters, and so in 1993, during the period of  hyperinflation, it completely collapsed. The previous  government, rushing to solve the budget problem, made very, very  big mistakes in determining the amounts of (?FIRMARINE) and tax  obligations for entrepreneurs without paying attention to their  economic strength, or performing the necessary selection, since  not everyone has the same strength, size, and ability to pay.  That is even against the constitution.    Admittedly, we are applying the laws that are in force, but  we want to replace them with better ones. Very soon we will send  the Serbian Assembly a bill that would regulate tax obligations  differently and selectively.    Specifically, we will eliminate the tax on financial  transactions, but a sales tax that is enormously high will  remain--27 percent, while for a few goods the tax rate has been  reduced from 44 to 27 percent, but for most it has been  increased by 7 percent. That is the reason for the boom of the  black market in which those who do not pay customs duties, sales  tax, contributions to employees, etc., work. The state gets  nothing out of that.    My team, however, will prove mathematically that low tax  rates will contribute higher budget revenue, facilitate  business, and increase employees' wages--and it will be good for  everyone. We will do everything analytically with the goal of  ending this year with the kind of legal and derivative acts that  will guarantee certainty to everyone to intends to engage in  business next year. In other words, people will no longer live  from decree to decree, and the laws will be logical--but  Serbia's economic regulations consist of 135 legal acts.    I would like to see a lawyer who could cope with that, but  we  want to create an atmosphere here for the normal, average  citizen of Serbia.    It will be a long-term job, but private businessmen know how  difficult, arduous, and slow it is to make progress.    Don't suspect that your minister will have weak nerves or  short breath. But remember--that will give us the right to  establish a strong control function for the state.  <H5>  Distribution of the "Poorly Distributed" </H5>   Taxes are not the only problem, however. In fact, a bigger  problem is the enormous disparity between the number of private  enterprises and the number of workers employed in them. The  official data do not give a correct picture. It is true that  there are more than 300,000 people in Serbia who are working  "illegally" in the private sector. That is why our goal is not  only to employ these people legally, but also to correct the  structure of employees and substantially increase their number.  We will try to create the kind of environment in which economic  logic will lead the unemployed to the private sector to seek a  livelihood there themselves. We will carry out this transition  painlessly, by adopting appropriate regulations, whose  implementation will not cause upheavals. I have always said that  there is not a surplus of employees in this country, but rather  only poorly distributed ones.    In addition to the absolutely abnormal tax system, the  enormous contributions that are withheld from employees' wages  also encourage "illegal" work. More than 95 percent of both  socialized and private enterprises and shops do not show  salaries realistically through the payroll. Because of the high  contributions, wages are drastically reduced. Everyone loses.    Our goal is to reduce contributions so much that no one will  have a reason to employ workers "illegally," and we will not be  very tolerant, because there will no longer be a reason for  anyone to complain that we have put too much of a burden on him.  <H5>  Returning Jurisdiction to the Municipalities </H5>   I know quite well how much the municipalities have been  crippled by the redistribution of jurisdiction at the republic  level. One should expect changes along these lines soon, because  it is unnatural that a municipality does not have insight into  and influence over the development of the economy in its  surroundings and on its territory. In fact, it is natural for a  municipality to be very interested and to be very concerned and  involved with strengthening the local economy for the purpose of  raising the standard of living and wages, and developing the  infrastructure, education, and everything else that constitutes  the social superstructure for a better and higher-quality life.    Furthermore, I have taken the initiative for us to bring  educated young people from all regions, and then from every  municipality, to be trained in the Serbian Government, and  afterwards sent back to rural areas to apply what has been  learned and agreed upon.  <H5>  Construction of Small Shops </H5>   The construction of small shops is our "festering wound."  City planning conditions and infrastructure are very bad, and  the corresponding laws and derivative acts resemble an  impassable forest that has not been cleared since 1967-1971, in  which not even a highly educated lawyer can find his way, much  less an average businessman who has to conduct his business. We  will very soon formulate a draft law that will solve this  problem in every municipality in Serbia, so that every  municipality would build a small industrial zone, and create  opportunities for the rapid construction of production  facilities. My estimates indicate that in every municipality at  least 10 people would immediately start construction if given  the chance, which yields the figure of 2,000 small factories for  the 200 municipalities in Serbia. I don't have to explain how  much that means for the construction materials industry, brick,  iron, insulation material, construction workers....    We are also convinced that every owner of his own small shop  will seek to develop business and become a serious partner for  the large enterprises in the socialized sector. The new Law on  the Transformation of Social Capital, which implies the complete  independence of socially owned economic entities to choose the  form of ownership transformation, is also contributing to a good  atmosphere.    Unfortunately, it is a characteristic of our mentality that  honest people are accused of dishonest intentions, the  consequence of which will be that entrepreneurs who decide to  build facilities with a couple of hundred "square meters" will  continue to make progress faster than those who wait for the  implementation of this law. I know quite well that this is an  enslavement of capital, but years will pass before we solve the  problem through the laws and decrees that we intend to adopt  soon in order to stimulate this process. Admittedly, there are  already government decrees on the priority use of unemployed  production capacities. It is fortunate that the large socialized  enterprises, on their own initiative, are visiting the smaller  private firms and seeking a suitable form of cooperation.  Nevertheless, I think that this form of communication will be  accelerated soon.  <H5>  Bringing the Socialized and Private Sectors Closer Together </H5>   Along those lines, I spoke recently with the director of the  Belgrade Fair about the idea of having commercial banks organize  successful private entrepreneurs with whom they are already  cooperating on the fairgrounds, as part of the traditional  Entrepreneurs' Fair. As the sponsor of this fair, the government  has already adopted a decision on a symbolic price for renting  space in the hall, which the Fair's administration has accepted.  The purpose is for people from public enterprises to see in one  place everything that can and must be bought in Serbia from  producers in the private sector, who, during the blockade, have  even succeeded in producing incredible things. The task of us in  the government is to "link" the private and socialized sectors,  to bring them closer together and refer them to each other.    It has also been agreed with Belgrade TV that every day, in  prime time, it will promote this campaign, so that people  throughout Serbia will become acquainted with the enormous  capabilities of our private sector, including that of Cacak.  <H5>  Imitation of Privatization </H5>   Public enterprises are one more "festering wound" for the  Republic of Serbia. Their amorphous nature represents a big  problem for the Serbian economy, but their ownership  transformation, which has been carried out to date through the  distribution of worthless internal papers, constitutes nothing  more than an imitation of real privatization. That is why it  will be subject to audit, and a new law on ownership  transformation, which will sanction those who have exploited  this process in the most primitive way to steal social property.  Those who have done this job correctly do not have any reason to  fear an audit. Furthermore, the budget provides for  expenditures to "extract" welfare policy from socialized firms,  which should make it easier for them to begin a different policy  toward surplus employees.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5>   I am abolishing the term "small business," because this  state  lives on private entrepreneurs. It no longer lives on the  Smederevo Steelworks, or EI [Electronics Plant] Nis, but rather  on us, private businessmen.    If 68 percent of employees in the European Union work in  companies with at most 10 workers, why should we be ashamed of  small numbers? It seems that we like everything that is big,  even if it is inefficient.    With respect to efficiency, in just the Steelworks, for  example, 90 percent of its capacity is idle, because of a  shortage of spare parts. I maintain that our private businessmen  throughout Serbia can successfully produce 95 percent of the  missing amounts. Our public enterprises, however, seem to have  people who will not give 100,000 German marks, for instance, to  our people, but prefer to give an amount several times higher to  import the same product from abroad, or to watch trains standing  motionless.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5> <H5>  Monetary Political Institutions </H5>   I do not consider the banks in which budgetary funds on  which  interest is not paid are deposited to be real banks. I am saying  publicly that they are monetary political institutions.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5> <H5>  At Vranje's Side </H5>   I am extremely delighted by the fact that in the Cacak  municipality, with 70,000 residents, as many as 43,000 people  are employed. That is an extremely high employment rate, which  only Vranje also has in Serbia.</p>

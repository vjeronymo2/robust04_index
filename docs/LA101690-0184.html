Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STREEP AWES CO-STAR MACLAINE  </P> <P> Actress Shirley MacLaine says her relationship with Meryl Streep while filming  "Postcards From the Edge" was nothing less than "awesome."  </P> <P> The last time Old Hollywood met New Hollywood -- when MacLaine and Debra Winger  co-starred in "Terms of Endearment" -- there were a series of skirmishes  between the two actresses.  </P> <P> According to the latest Entertainment Weekly magazine, Hollywood insiders  predicted similar quarreling between MacLaine and Streep. But it didn't happen.  </P> <P> "Meryl is a genius," MacLaine said. "You don't say her name in the same breath  as Debra Winger's. Or mine. She's got a whole other thing going there.  </P> <P> "It's more akin to channeling than anything else. It's awesome."  </P></p>

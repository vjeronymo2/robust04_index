			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Nigerian foreign exchange sale The Central Bank of Nigeria has set up a committee including representatives from banking and industry to allocate the first foreign exchange sale of the year to the private sector, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. Under a regulated system announced in last month's budget, the government has fixed the exchange rate at N22 to the dollar, minimised the role of banks in foreign exchange and outlawed the parallel market where the dollar changes for at least N46. The bank will allocate foreign currency pro rata to importers with 50 per cent going to manufacturing industry, 30 per cent for finished goods and 10 per cent for agriculture. The remaining 10 per cent of foreign exchange will be sold at the bank's discretion for invisible exports.</p>

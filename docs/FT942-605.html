			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: ADS issue for Chinese power group Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company, the first Chinese power-generating company to file a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, hopes to raise around Dollars 400m through a public offering of 23.4m American depositary shares (ADSs) next month. CS First Boston, the global co-ordinator of the issue, said the ADSs, each representing 50 N shares, will be offered to investors in the US, Europe and Asia. N shares, a new category of security on the New York Stock Exchange, provide holders with the same rights as Chinese B shares, which can be bought by foreigners, but they will also meet SEC requirements.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Construction Contracts: Automated warehouse in Barcelona McGregor Cory, the European logistics and distribution specialist, has awarded TILBURY DOUGLAS CONSTRUCTION an Pounds 11m contract to design and build an automated warehouse in Barcelona. The multi-client facility is believed to be the first of its type in Spain, combining a 9,300 sq metres high-bay store with a 11,300 sq metres conventional low-bay area. Tilbury Douglas designed the distribution centre around the racking and mechanical handling systems. The design, supply and installation of the computerised mechanical handling system are all part of the contract which is being carried out by Cleco as sub-contractor. Twenty loading docks are included in the design. Goods in the main high-bay warehouse will be handled by automated computer controlled cranes linked to front loading bays. The adjoining low-bay area will incorporate a controlled temperature area for storing food products. Office facilities, a fork lift truck maintenance area, and other ancillary buildings will also be provided. The warehouse will be completed in September 1994. It will be the first building in a new business park, whose existence is partly attributable to the distribution centre. Tilbury Douglas is working in joint venture with Spanish contractor Jotsa.</p>

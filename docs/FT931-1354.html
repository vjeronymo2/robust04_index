			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Call to centralise securities regulation THE regulation of securities markets should be centralised under the Securities and Investments Board, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said yesterday, Richard Waters writes. He appealed for a solution to the fragmented regulation built around the recognised investment exchanges and self-regulatory organisations. Sir Andrew called for a central database to hold details of all securities transactions in the UK. SIB should take over investigating and prosecuting cases extending beyond the remit of any single investment exchange or self-regulatory body, he said. Sir Andrew's remarks appear to stem in part from the exchange's experience in trying to investigate insider dealing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenian Premier Proposes CIS </F> Countries Institute Collective Currency"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Armenian Prime Minister Hrant Bagratian  has sent a letter to all the CIS prime ministers.    It states, in particular, that financial transactions  between  the CIS countries have become considerably more complex as a  result of the introduction of national currencies. The Russian  ruble is used as a single currency for many trade deals between  states; the CIS countries look to Russia for loans to execute  their transactions, thereby increasing the Russian budget  deficit. The prime minister thinks that the way to ease  financial difficulties lies in the broader use of national  currencies, and also proposes setting up a collective currency  for the CIS countries, in which it is proposed to carry out all  transactions in a CIS interstate bank.</p>

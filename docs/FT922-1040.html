			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages mild rally on the back of Tokyo Wall Street AIDED BY a moderate recovery in Tokyo overnight, US prices managed a slight improvement yesterday following their recent weak performance, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.82 at 3,285.62, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged ahead 0.64 to 404.04. The American SE composite gained 1.12 to 376.74 and the Nasdaq composite put on 3.63 to 553.36. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 190.8m shares, with rises outnumbering declines by 990 to 730. Two factors were behind a positive opening: the upturn in Japanese share prices which helped assuage fears of a sustained decline in worldwide equity markets; and the resilience displayed by US stocks on Monday afternoon, when late buying cut the Dow's initial loss of 30 points to just under five points by the close. The underlying tone of the market, however, remained weak due to concern about how long it will take for corporate earnings to show signs of significant improvement amid a worryingly slow economic recovery. Merck fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/8 in turnover of 3.2m shares on reports that some analysts believe the company could face problems in marketing its new prostate drug, which only received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Friday. Goodyear advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 67 after shareholders of Goodyear Canada voted against approving the merger of their company with a Goodyear subsidiary, GCI Amalgamation. The offer, worth CDollars 48 a share, was withdrawn following the vote. Nacco Industries dropped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 after the company warned that its net income for the second quarter would be 'well below' the 53 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago. Another company telling the market that its forthcoming quarterly earnings would be down sharply from last year's level was the oil recycling and waste management group International Recovery, which plunged Dollars 6 5/8 , or 35 per cent, to Dollars 12 3/8 in the wake of the management's warning. Keithley Instruments, traded on the American Stock Exchange, weakened Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 11 1/2 following an announcement that it will report a loss in the fiscal third quarter, and that the company was 'cautious' about the outlook for the rest of the year. Pet Inc gained Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 after broker Wertheim Schroder put the stock on its recommended list and advised that the specialist food and confectionery company could be an attractive takeover target. On the Nasdaq market, Vestar shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 in busy trading after Liposome filed a lawsuit against Vestar alleging its Ambisome product violated a Liposome patent. Liposome firmed Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks drifted off from midday gains to end flat after a dull session. Traders said there was little corporate news or economic data to sway the market. A heavy number of small-capitalisation 'cheap' shares crowded the active list. The TSE 300 index closed just 2.4 better at 3,343.0, while declines held a small advantage over advances by 294 to 276 after volume of 24.3m shares valued at CDollars 234.8m.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Britain's managers not as good as they think, says Heseltine Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last night rebuked British managers for overconfidence in the face of figures showing their performance to be unsatisfactory. In a speech at the annual dinner of the Institute of Directors, Mr Heseltine asked his audience for 'a clear recognition' that there was a gap between the UK's industrial performance and the best in the world. While a recent survey identified only 2 per cent of UK companies as world class, Mr Heseltine said research showed that British managers thought they were the best in Europe. 'The German, French, Italian and Spanish managers thought a great deal less highly of us,' he said. Although the survey could be interpreted as good news in that British managers appeared to have a great deal of self-confidence, Mr Heseltine said it might also suggest 'that we have a rather too fulsome opinion of our own performance'. 'In particular, the rest of Europe did not think our managers were particularly hardworking or that our companies were focused on the marketplace.' In spite of increases in productivity, the trade and industry secretary said the UK was still 25 per cent behind its main European competitors and even further behind the US. Britain's share of world trade in manufactures had also 'declined remorselessly'. Although it had stabilised it was only about half that of Germany. Mr Heseltine disclaimed responsibility for the performance of trade associations representing different sectors of industry. It was not his fault that most were too weak to serve their members actively or to present a case to government. 'You complain about the proliferation in the number of trade associations, the overlapping responsibilities and the sometimes inadequate service. But you pay for them. So if you pay, why should it be my responsibility to do something about it?' Mr Heseltine described the government's deregulation initiative as 'the most productive thing it could do . . . to get off the backs of British business'. He indicated that when he unveiled his bill, expected this month, he would be seeking measures to sweep away hundreds of government regulations. Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / US tempts Syria in peace bid A summit between US President Bill Clinton and Syria's President Hafez al-Assad next month, followed by resumption of Syrian-Lebanese peace talks with Israel in Washington, marks an important fresh effort to keep a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement in sight. The moves, announced yesterday by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, show that Washington is prepared to use its muscle and the promise of improved US-Syrian relations to push forward a comprehensive peace agreement. The breakthrough points up the importance Damascus attaches to better ties with the US, and the linkage it makes between improved Syrian-US relations and advances in the peace process as Syria seeks to end its international isolation and reform its economy. So far, there seems no clear compromise between Israel and Syria on the fundamental obstacles to an agreement. Syria continues to insist Israel must declare its intention to withdraw fully from the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 six-day war. Israel wants Syria to state clearly its commitment to full peace, including trade and diplomatic ties before it will clarify the extent of its withdrawal. Jerusalem has said it will withdraw 'on' but not 'from' the Golan, suggesting only a partial return of Syrian land. Despite the apparent impasse, Israeli officials believe the latest US initiative provides grounds for cautious optimism because it holds out a tempting prize for Damascus. The US placed Syria on the terrorism blacklist when it was introduced in 1979, prohibiting US companies from exporting goods which could enhance Syria's military or terrorism potential. The move also obliged the US to vote against any development loans offered to Syria by multilateral organisations. Syria was briefly taken off the list by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 but sanctions were re-imposed after an attempted bombing of an El Al aircraft in 1986 was blamed on Syria, and the US withdrew its ambassador to Damascus. Syrian experts say Mr Assad is anxious to have Syria taken off the blacklist to boost his international standing and aid the economic reform he is overseeing. Liberalisation of the economy contributed to a 7 per cent growth rate last year but future growth will depend on much greater investment. Earlier, Mr Christopher announced Syria had made two important humanitarian gestures to Israel, in an effort to restore confidence between the two sides. Syria agreed to help a US delegation which is searching for seven Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon and to grant exit permits to up to 1,200 Syrian Jews to travel freely before the end of this year. Both moves were enthusiastically welcomed in Israel. But the Syrian reasons behind the measures appear to have more to do with its desire to improve relations with Washington than to make concessions to Israel. As part of the package Mr Christopher said the US would allow Kuwait to donate three ageing US-built Boeing 727 aircraft to Syria. But Washington stressed the US was not relaxing sanctions against Syria. Mr Farouk al-Shara, Syrian foreign minister, said a number of other undisclosed steps would be taken before talks with Israel resumed. Mr Christopher yesterday declined to give details of what other guarantees he had given Mr Assad to entice Syria back to talks. Israeli officials have hinted the US has an outline package of concessions from Damascus and Jerusalem linked, on the Syrian side, to improved relations with Washington and aimed at thrashing out an agreement in principle by next April or May.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Castle Mill losses Castle Mill International, the wholesale distributor of clothing, saw pre-tax losses increase from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 322,900 in the first half of 1994. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.04m. The company said the result reflected the seasonal nature of turnover in Fashion Accessories International and continuing pressure on margins from retailers who are reluctant to raise prices in highly competitive markets. Losses per share were 1.58p (1.84p).</p>

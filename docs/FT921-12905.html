			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Polymer emerges from waste heap A POLYMER suited to the agricultural, construction and automotive industries can now be produced from mixed industrial or domestic plastic waste in a single step, writes Paul Godden. The homomicronisation process, developed by the Swiss company, NewPlast-Process, of Geneva, uses roughly-washed, mixed waste, which can even include impurities like rubber and copper. Because of this the NewPlast polymer costs SFr .50/kg (10p/kg) compared with SFr 1.20/kg for virgin polyethylene. It is also less expensive than most recycled plastics where the waste has to be sorted to ensure that polymers are not mixed. The process 'stirs' the dry waste granules at high speed in a special steel drum, at ambient temperature, with a specially designed rotor. The resultant friction causes the materials to polymerise and form a homogenous mass. This mass is treated by conventional machinery to produce pellets suitable for subsequent processing.

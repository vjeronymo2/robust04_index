			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Well, all week police were looking for Chief Abiola.  Now his supporters and family are looking for the chief. His  whereabouts since his arrest have been unknown. There were  various reports that he had been flown off to Abuja and that he  stayed in a police cell in Lagos. On the line, Mary Harper  asked Chief Abiola's eldest child, Mrs. Lola Abiola Edewo what  the family's information was.    [Begin recording] [Edewo] I have no idea as to where he is.  The last we saw of him was on the day that he was arrested  because I was one of the people who escorted him as far as where  he was taken, which was in Lagos here.    [Harper] Where exactly did you follow him to?    [Edewo] We followed him to Alagbon, the FIB, which is the  police-cum-security headquarters.    [Harper] And do you have any idea where he was taken to from  this police headquarters?    [Edewo] Even though we were all there, we didn't know when  he  was moved. It was much later, about four in the morning,  because we were all out keeping a night vigil. Then one of the  police people who had come to arrest him from home said we  better leave because he is no longer here, that they've taken  him to Abuja.    [Harper] Have you been in touch with the police since his  arrest?    [Edewo] Yes. I was there about half a dozen times yesterday  to the same site where he was taken where we had followed him to  just to double check that information. Each time I went I was  told, he is still in Abuja. On the sixth trip the policeman at  the reception there said to me, Madam, he is still in Abuja, he  is not here. Don't bother.    [Harper] Do you have any indication when your father might  be  brought to trial?    [Edewo] Huh, nobody is telling us anything. I have no idea.  [end recording]</p>

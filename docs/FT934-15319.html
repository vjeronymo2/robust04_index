			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (3): Motorists queue to get in - Nottingham plans a new transit system to relieve pressure on roads TRAVELLING into Nottingham can be wearing. Rush-hour commuters know they are near the city centre when the traffic grinds to a halt. The capital of the East Midlands has congestion worthy of a metropolis three times the size. At peak times, queues of motorists joust with buses, which have crowded into the city following deregulation and the decision of rival companies to compete head-on. Planning officials have inadvertently made the problem worse by turning a number of city streets into pedestrian malls, leading to delays and jams on remaining roads when buses stop to pick up passengers or trucks make deliveries. To the west of the city, the congestion stretches into the suburbs where motorists travelling in from the M1 motorway are filtered on to a single-lane road. Mr Malcolm Reece, chief executive of Nottingham Development Enterprise, has no illusions about the dilemma. 'Compared with similar European cities our infrastructure is a problem. Our road links are poor - you have to queue to get into the city. That is a bad sign.' Aware of the deterrent effect of poor infrastructure to businesses and consumers, Nottingham is planning a new transport system to ease the jams. The city is going back to the future. Like other British cities which ripped up tramlines in the 1950s, Nottingham is looking wistfully at light rail systems to take pressure off the roads. Planners in the East Midlands are following the example of their colleagues in Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham, which all have new transit systems in operation or under development. Although systems elsewhere in the UK are more advanced, Nottingham Development Enterprise (NDE), which is masterminding the project, says it has been successful in forging links with overseas cities with rapid transit systems in place. Citing the advantages of rapid transit - involving light rail carriages capable of running on regular railway track or mingling with road traffic on street rails - NDE claims that a similar system in Grenoble 'immediately attracted 65,000 users every day'. Karlsruhe, one of the prime movers in the Four Cities Partnership, has also offered technical expertise to Nottingham. German officials have acted as advisers on proposals for a Pounds 65m line stretching north from the city centre to the outlying village of Hucknall. Advice from Karlsruhe has focused on the German city's pioneering model of track sharing between trams and regular trains. If adopted in Nottingham, trams would intermingle with trains on a five mile section of track currently operated by Regional Railways, the division of British Rail, between the suburb of Basford and Hucknall. Officials at VBK and AVG, the two companies operating the Karlsruhe system, have also offered information on vehicle selection, maintenance and civil engineering. The aims - to relieve congestion, attract more consumers, retailers and new businesses into the city - are laudable. But there is considerable doubt over whether it can get off the drawing-board. The department of transport has told city authorities around Britain that it can afford to make grants available to one rapid transit system a year. But Nottingham is some way down the pecking order in the list of applicants. Sheffield is expected to win the next tranche of state aid for its system, with Birmingham next in line. After that Croydon, Leeds and Nottingham are all vying for contention. With increasing curbs on public sector spending, the government may not be so well disposed to rapid transit schemes by the time Nottingham reaches the front of the queue. 'I don't know when the government will have the money,' admits Mr Reece. 'So we have to spread the risk.' The enterprise agency is seeking private backing for the venture and says local companies have raised Pounds 700,000 out of Pounds 2m committed so far. That leaves a yawning gap in the financial arithmetic; the money raised is only a fraction of the sums needed and the government may be reluctant to pick up the shortfall. Nottingham, however, is determined to reform its transport infrastructure. It could do worse than looking at Nancy, where the city opted for trolley buses in preference to trams. Development costs for the system, a hybrid between buses and light rail, were offset by a levy on businesses. It could be an attractive option in the East Midlands, where the dreams of a rapid transit network are a long way from reality. Whichever system the city chooses, Mr Reece knows there must be a change. 'If there's no public transport relief the city will lose economically. The consumers and businesses will go elsewhere.'</p>

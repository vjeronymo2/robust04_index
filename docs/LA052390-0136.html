			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS CLASH OVER ALLEGED ILLEGAL CONTRIBUTION  </P> <P> Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson charged in a complaint to state election  officials Tuesday that his Democratic primary opponent has received an improper  campaign contribution.  </P> <P> Democrat Tom Umberg, who is facing Yudelson in the June 5 primary, disputed the  allegations and responded by calling his opponent a "compulsive liar." The  complaint was filed with the Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> The complaint said Umberg used the results of a $3,000 poll conducted in  November by the Orange County Democratic Foundation in soliciting support for  his candidacy during a December trip to Sacramento. Yudelson charged that  Umberg had not filed the proper documents to be a candidate in December and  therefore the poll represented an illegal contribution.  </P> <P> Umberg denied that he was ever in Sacramento in December and said that he never  talked with any legislators about his candidacy until February, after he  announced his campaign. He also said the only information from the poll that he  received was included in a letter the foundation sent to its members.  </P> <P> "This guy is desperate," Umberg said. "He's going to throw as much garbage as  he can, and it doesn't matter whether it's true or not. He has a complete  disregard for the truth."  </P> <P> In a statement, Yudelson responded: "Give me a break. The guy moved his family  and bought a house in Garden Grove, and he was given the full value of that  poll before he did that. To expect us to believe anything else is like asking  us to believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy."  </P> <P> Yudelson and Umberg, both of Garden Grove, are running in the Democratic  primary for the 72nd Assembly District now represented by incumbent Curt  Pringle (R-Garden Grove).  </P> <P> Audrey Redfearn, chairwoman of the Democratic Foundation, said the group  conducted the poll last fall to determine if Pringle could be beaten. The poll  tested hypothetical match-ups between Pringle and four possible Democratic  candidates, including Umberg and Yudelson.  </P> <P> It found that Umberg would beat Pringle and Yudelson would lose, Redfearn said.  She said the results of the poll were offered to all four Democrats and were  published in a letter to the foundation's members.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEMOCRATS WANT TOO MUCH FOR CONVENTION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau said Monday that it has decided  to take the the city out of the running to host the 1992 Democratic National  Convention.  </P> <P> The bureau pulled out, after the Democratic National Committee required that  the host of its quadrennial bash put up $15 million in goods and services for  the pleasure of the only occasionally successful political party.  </P> <P> Even Mayor Tom Bradley, who fought unsuccessfully for the 1976 Democratic  convention, found the amount to be too much.  </P> <P> "The mayor does concur in the (bureau's) decision," Bradley spokesman Bill  Chandler said. He described the financial tab as "rather excessive."  </P> <P> Los Angeles' withdrawal leaves 16 cities in the running for the convention,  including San Francisco and San Diego. San Francisco was the site of the 1984  Democratic convention.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with exiled General Alberto Arciniega by Alberto </F> Ku King M. in Buenos Aires, date not given: "Drug Trafficking  Increasing Dangerously in Peru"]    [Excerpts] Buenos Aires--Brigadier General Alberto  Arciniega Huby of the Peruvian Army, considered one of the best  military strategists in Peru's fight against terrorism and drug  trafficking, has charged that drug trafficking is increasing  dangerously in his country.    Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government  advisers for not following through on a single strategy to  defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern  jungle of Peru for several years.    "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the  best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they  have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking  power," he stressed.    Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in  place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and  even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time  when the American Government was willing to engage in joint  operations."    The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in  Argentina since last January, having left his country on the  heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually  turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army,  General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted]    General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the  alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses  against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in  exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru.    The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru  in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army  as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and  nine students.    Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and  21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country  one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in  his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking.    He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even  though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him.  However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way  he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru.    Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English  thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting  ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug  strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and  made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School  of Government's catalogue.    Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding  officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest  drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the  terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was  implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers  numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of  their social base."    "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to  destabilize  the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal  Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the  peasant population," Arciniega recalls.    He admits leading his troops into many battles against the  terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to  consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants  rather than drug-trafficking criminals."    The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting  the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other  products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding  political and social defeat.    "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out  while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break  up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP)  between April and December of 1989," he recalls.    He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who  waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman  finally lost his will to have another army and immediately  changed tactics."    He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence  reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was  celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as  paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had,  but did not find him...."    Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori  Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April  1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the  chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed  extraconstitutional powers.    The former military official maintains that the drug  traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that  they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world.    When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of  persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which  the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American  affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of  the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come  out in a book."

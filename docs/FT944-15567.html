			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Ruling on council hearing due Mr John Magill, Westminster City Council's district auditor, will announce today whether he will disqualify himself from public hearings into allegations of gerrymandering. If he does, the hearings will not take place at all, he said yesterday. But if he does not disqualify himself, they will start tomorrow morning. The hearings were due to start yesterday but were delayed because lawyers for Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of the council, wanted more time to argue that Mr Magill should disqualify himself. At yesterday's one-day hearing, Mr Andrew Arden QC, barrister for the group of objectors which first lodged the allegations, urged that the hearings start as soon as possible. He quoted from one of Dame Shirley's interviews with Mr Magill in which she insisted that she was 'no Asil Nadir'. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, retained by Dame Shirley, said that Mr Magill should step down because he had acted wrongly during his investigation. Mr Scrivener said that Mr Magill used emotive words such as 'disgraceful', 'improper' and 'gerrymandering' when he announced his provisional findings in January, and that he created the 'maximum amount of prejudice' by giving a press conference. After a four-year investigation Mr Magill, a senior partner at accountancy firm Touche Ross, provisionally ruled that Dame Shirley and nine others should repay Pounds 21.25m spent on selling council homes in marginal wards to secure victory at the 1990 local elections.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE MARKET: WHAT'S FRESH BUYING OPPORTUNITIES;  </P> <P> MONSTER MASH;  </P> <P> AVOCADOS OF THE BACON VARIETY, WHICH CAN TOLERATE FROST, ARE HARVESTED THROUGH  THE CHILL OF FEBRUARY.  </P> <P> For many Californians, a salad isn't a salad without it. And without guacamole,  what would happen to the tortilla chip industry?  </P> <P> The avocado, a teardrop-shaped subtropical fruit, is one of Ventura County's  leading cash crops. But more important to the eater, if you are going to eat a  food with a high fat content, the avocado is a healthful, no-cholesterol  variation. According to the California Avocado Commission, the fruit is low in  sodium and teems with potassium and 17 other vitamins and minerals.  </P> <P> Lyle Carson grows about five acres of avocados in Ojai and offers the fruit at  his Carson Farm Supply roadside stand. "We are just getting under way selling  the Bacon variety," he said.  </P> <P> Along with the Bacon, Carson said a second variety is grown commercially in  Ventura County. The Hass -- identified by its thick, pebbly skin that turns  dark brown as it ripens -- is the most widely grown variety, making up 80% of  California-grown avocados.  </P> <P> "The Hass, a Guatemalan variety and the most popular between the two, matures  February through October and is grown in the warmer districts because it's more  susceptible to frost," he said.  </P> <P> Carson said the Bacon variety, with a thin, smooth skin, will be in production  now through February and is grown in the cooler regions of Ventura County,  given its tolerance to frost.  </P> <P> "It is a Mexican variety that tends to be more watery than the Hass," he said.  "And it does not command the market price that Hass do."  </P> <P> Carson referred to the Hass as a "heavier, meatier variety with a somewhat  nutty flavor," while the Bacon is lighter and "just doesn't have as much oil as  the Hass."  </P> <P> "The Bacon, however, is a more consistent bearer," he said. "You don't have the  production fluctuation like the Hass."  </P> <P> Harvest yields of the Hass avocado tend to alternate from year to year, Carson  said. "You will have a big crop one season and the following year production  falls off."  </P> <P> As much as a 40% difference can be expected. "It's just the nature of the  beast," he said.  </P> <P> At harvest time, the fruit is picked by hand when it has reached a mature, but  not fully ripened state.  </P> <P> "The fruit must soften off the tree," Carson said. "It's picked when the oil  content reaches a certain degree." He said the minimum oil content of harvested  avocados must fulfill strict California Department of Agriculture demands that  are implemented to protect the consumer from buying undesirable fruit.  </P> <P> "The minimum oil content guarantees that the fruit will ripen and will be  edible," he said. "If picked too soon -- and the oil content is too low -- the  avocado would just shrivel up and not ripen."  </P> <P> A grower must also judge harvest-readiness relative to the time the avocado  will spend waiting to be purchased.  </P> <P> "Fruit left too long on the tree will have a high oil content, thereby  shortening the shelf life because it reaches ripeness too quickly," Carson  said. "And an avocado with a high oil content can soon become rancid."  </P> <P> After purchasing avocados that haven't reached desired ripeness, consumers can  control the rate at which the fruit ripens, Carson said.  </P> <P> "You can vary according to your needs," Carson said. "Buy three. Put one in the  fridge, one in a brown bag and the other on the counter.  </P> <P> "The one in the fridge will ripen slowly. An avocado left in a bag will be  exposed to its own ethylene gas, which speeds up ripening" and, left on the  counter, an avocado will ripen at an average pace, he said.  </P> <P> Carson said last year's avocado harvest was generally small due to unfavorable  weather conditions. Specifically, a heat wave during April -- the bloom period  -- sterilized the pollen. To make matters worse, a frost hit in February.  Prices soared.  </P> <P> "However, consumers can expect lower prices this harvest season because the  crops are looking good," he said. "We'll see an increase in total poundage over  last year."  </P> <P> Carson said he will be selling Bacon avocados for 75 cents each.  </P> <P> Carson Farm Supply is at 111 Topa Topa St., Ojai, and is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Mondays through Saturdays.

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Government faces snub by building societies Building societies are to snub the government by resisting key suggestions put forward in a Treasury consultation paper for making them more accountable to the millions of customers who own them. The paper marked the second stage of a government review of societies' powers which has been undertaken as part of the deregulation initiative. A draft response to the Treasury will be discussed at a meeting of the council of the Building Societies Association on Thursday. It says there is no shortfall in the arrangements for societies to be responsible to their members. In particular it rejects the idea of making societies more accountable through setting up consultative committees of members or requiring societies to reserve some board places for candidates nominated by 'ordinary members'. It broadly supports proposals for streamlining the limits on societies' powers and relaxing the regulatory controls under which they operate. If ministers accept the association's argument that societies should have greater freedom without significant changes in accountability, the Treasury will be open to criticism for giving them an unfair advantage in the retail financial services sector. As mutual institutions societies are owned by members rather than being responsible to shareholders. Alternatively, the response will set societies on course for a clash with the government if ministers insist that they must be made more effectively accountable in return for greater flexibility. The association's paper does make some small gestures towards greater accountability, for example by saying that more efforts should be made to give members clear and easily comprehensible information about their rights. It rejects suggestions - originally brought forward as another deregulatory initiative - to reduce the amount of information societies have to send out to their members, such as the summary financial statement. But if there seems little movement on accountability, some societies may respond to the Treasury's signals that the benefits of mutual ownership - not having to pay dividends to shareholders - should be passed more directly to society members. Schemes being considered involve handing a share of profits to members as a 'dividend'.</p>

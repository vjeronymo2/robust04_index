			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / US says CSCE could use Nato force NATO, which is seeking a new role for itself following the end of the Cold War, could become the military arm of the recently expanded 48-nation pan-European security forum, a senior US official suggested yesterday. 'Nobody foresees a military structure for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe,' Mr John Kornblum, chief US delegate to the CSCE review conference, which opens in Helsinki next month, said in a satellite television broadcast linking Washington with five European countries. 'But the US would probably find it useful if Nato was one of the agencies for providing troops for the CSCE.' Mr Kornblum went out of his way to counter perceptions that the CSCE - grouping the western allies, members of the defunct Warsaw Pact and the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union - was incapable of taking effective action because of its rule that decisions should be taken by consensus. That impression had been fostered by its failure to adopt a decisive role in solving the Yugoslav crisis. But it should be realised that the new structure of the CSCE had only just been put in place when the Yugoslav crisis broke out and that, in any case, the organisation was never intended to enforce solutions by military means. 'Our first purpose is not crisis management, but crisis and conflict prevention,' Mr Kornblum said. Rejecting the idea that there was a duplication of roles between the CSCE and the new Nato Co-operation Council, created as a link between the North Atlantic allies, eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, Mr Kornblum said the organisations were complementary. The CSCE, with a much wider membership, provided a broad political blue-print for dealing with the complex situation created by the disintegration of Cold War structures. Nato was much more narrowly focused on security issues and did not cover important areas such as human rights, confidence-building measures and economic problems. One of the main tasks of the Helsinki review conference would be to enhance the CSCE's ability to take concerted action. A cautious step in this direction had been taken at the recent CSCE ministerial meeting in Prague, when it was agreed that a single member state could be overridden if found guilty of 'clear and gross violation' of its CSCE commitments. But consensus would nevertheless remain the 'cardinal principle' for decision-making, Mr Kornblum said.</p>

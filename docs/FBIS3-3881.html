Hsu said prior to his departure he will meet with officials  of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS) on three issues -- repatriation of illegal  mainland immigrants and hijackers as well as a solution to  cross-strait fishing disputes.    The talks will begin Friday and continue through March 30.  If necessary, Hsu said, the schedule may be extended for one or  two days.    "We are hopeful the talks will be fruitful and help pave the  way for closer bilateral cooperation in the future," Hsu noted.    It will be the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three  thorny issues since the heads of the two semi-official  intermediary organizations met in Singapore last April. The  first three rounds were held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei  during the second half of last year.    Hsu said although the two sides managed to reach consensus  on  some points in the previous rounds of talks, fundamental  political differences still hinder the signing of a final  agreement on the three non-political issues.    Nevertheless, Hsu said, the two sides reaffirmed their  commitment to resolve the problems during a high-level meeting  between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart  Tang Shubei in Beijing in early February.    Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taiwan's jurisdiction over  the territories now under its control has been the greatest  obstacle to reaching an agreement on the three basically  administrative issues, local political observers said.    Hsu said he believes the Chiao-Tang meeting will speed  proceedings at the coming talks. "I also hope Beijing will show  its sincerity so that the talks can produce concrete results,"  he added.    According to a joint news statement issued at the end of the  Chiao-Tang talks, if the two sides can reach agreements on the  three topics, Tang Shubei will visit Taipei to sign a formal  accord.    Many illegal mainland immigrants have been forced to remain  at two detention centers in northern Taiwan for long periods of  time because of Beijing's recalcitrance. Repeated hijackings of  mainland commercial airliners to Taiwan have also created  problems for Taiwan. Eleven hijackings took place since last  April. Taiwan hopes the two issues can be resolved soon.</p>

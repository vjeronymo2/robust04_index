			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK SERVICE CRITICIZED OVER HOPE LAND DEAL  </P> <P> The National Park Service's handling of a proposed exchange of public land for  property owned by entertainer Bob Hope in Los Angeles and Ventura counties was  severely criticized during a congressional hearing in Washington on Thursday,  but the session was not expected to dampen the exchange's prospects.  </P> <P> Park Service Director James M. Ridenour said his agency has not taken a  position on trading 59 acres it owns in Cheeseboro Canyon for 1,100 acres of  Hope property on the adjacent Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura County.  </P> <P> Hope also has agreed to transfer another 4,600 acres of his holdings in the  Santa Monica and Santa Susana Mountains to parks agencies for a below-market  price of $10 million if the land-swap is approved.  </P> <P> Political machinations, confusion and ambiguity have marked the Park Service's  handling of the Jordan Ranch swap, said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). "This  process stinks," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Boost to women in further education Almost three-fifths of students in further education were female in 1991-92, compared with two-fifths 20 years ago. The number of secondary-school pupils dropped by a quarter between 1980-81 and 1990-91. Yet more are staying on beyond the official leaving age, and the proportion leaving without GCSE or equivalent qualifications halved in the 15 years to 1990-91.</p>

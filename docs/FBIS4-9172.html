			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivkica Bacic: "Strike Wherever You Can"] </F>   [Text] Belgrade (From VJESNIK's permanent correspondent) --  Electric shock, beating with billy clubs on the palms of the  hands and the soles of the feet, sexual abuse with a stick, the  beating of bound arrestees, the striking of all parts of the  body with metal objects, the binding of arrestees to objects  which prevent movement, pressure, rubbing the ears, karate blows  to sensitive parts of the body--these are only some of the cruel  methods in the excessively rich repertoire of abuse and  harassment to which Sandzak Muslims have been exposed in Serbian  prisons from the end of last year to March of this year.    The Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law the other day  presented to the public extensive documentation giving testimony  to systematic torture of Muslims by state agencies of Serbia,  most of all those in Novi Pazar, Sjenica, and neighboring  villages, who for months have been the victims of extraordinary  police violence, who have been imprisoned and arrested without  any pretext whatsoever, even without warranted suspicion that  they had broken the law in any way. The fund's representatives,  led by Natasa Kandic, have visited Sandzak several times and  talked to Muslims who are the victims of police violence solely  because of their nationality and religion, whose elementary  human and civil rights have been threatened to such a degree  that Natasa Kandic did not hesitate to say in a recent news  conference that it is a question of large-scale systematic  violation of their rights that "can be compared only to what  people have been experiencing in the bloody Bosnian war."  <H5>  Provinces Swallowed Up </H5>   Those words of hers, backed up by the statements of the  harassed Muslims (some of them have even complained to Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic, who then ordered Police Minister  Zoran Sokolovic to see "internally" what his subordinates are  doing in Sandzak), certainly have not been made public in any  government medium (something was written only by BORBA),  presumably in order not to disturb the ceremonial atmosphere  that prevails in Serbia because of 28 March, proclaimed  Statehood Day. It was that day five years ago that "Serbia again  became a state," as all the media euphorically recalled on  Monday when they carried the comment for the occasion from the  state agency TANJUG. It was on that day in 1989 that Serbia  changed its constitution, that is, swallowed up the two  provinces (which had been constituent parts of the former  six-member federation), threatening the former Yugoslav  republics with that same "constitutional ingestion," all of this  under Milosevic's well-known slogan "Serbia will be whole or it  will not exist," which was in fact the beginning of the war, an  unambiguous announcement of what by the force of arms has been  represented as "Serbian defense of its own" these past four  years. In the TANJUG comment, this is referred to as "the tough  struggle of Serbia, its leadership, and a great majority of the  people for sovereignty," for "integrity of the state from Horgos  to Dragas," a struggle without which Serbia "would perhaps now  be even smaller than Serbia proper, reduced only to the Belgrade  Pashaluk," TANJUG concluded.  <H5>  "Expel, Kill..." </H5>   And that "Serbia wanted nothing but equality with the other  nationalities and republics," as indicated by the documentation  of the fund referred to, which proves with numerous examples  that Serbia is not only not a civil state, as its constitution  states, but is markedly discriminatory "from Horgos to Dragas,"  to the detriment of all except the Serbs, specifically those  Serbs who "represent statehood." Many among the Muslims from  Novi Pazar and Sjenica (just from the end of January to the end  of February of this year, there were more than 400 of them in  prison) were arrested in the drive to confiscate arms like the  one in Prijepolje, during which the alleged arms were sought  only from the Muslims, a practice, as asserted by the staff  members of the fund, that encourages the Serbs and Montenegrins  to continue to arm themselves. There is evidence of this in the  fact that the government agencies have done nothing concerning  the datum made public that at least 7,000 members of Seselj's  party are armed (a statement by Zivota Panic, former top man in  the Yugoarmy). But on the other hand, even those Muslims not  found to be possessing arms or those who possessed arms with  proper permits (most were in this category) were exposed to  unprecedented torture by Sokolovic's police, who as they beat  them called them "backward Muslim peasants, Turks, mojahedins,"  for whom "there is no place in Serbia" and who should be "driven  out or killed," as stated in the extensive report of the  Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors' appeal case opens A GROUP of individual creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday appealed against last month's High Court ruling that sanctioned a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 885m) compensation package. The package was negotiated between Touche Ross, the liquidators, and the bank's Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. The legal move follows the decision of the British creditors' committee not to appeal when it was told that it might be liable for costs in the action rather than being able to recover any appeal costs from BCCI assets. Mr David Hunt QC, counsel for the creditors, argued in the Court of Appeal that Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor who approved the compensation package, had wrongly substituted his own commercial judgment for that of the creditors. The creditors' committee voted to recommend rejection of the deal by a 7-1 majority. Sir Donald, giving judgment last month, said the proposals, which will give creditors between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of their original investments, represented the best option for the bank's 140,000 creditors in 70 countries. Mr Hunt argued that the wishes of the majority of the creditors should be paramount. 'Creditors can be expected to be the best judges of where their own financial interests lie,' he said. The creditors are headed by Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors Protection Association, who claims to be a creditor for Pounds 1m. He is supported in the appeal by the trustees of Film and Photo Design Pension Fund, the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt and nine individual Jordanian-based creditors. All will be at risk on costs if the appeal fails. The hearing is expected to last until tomorrow.</p>

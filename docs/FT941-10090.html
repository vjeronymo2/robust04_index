			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Latin America trading accords 'carry dangers' The proliferation of bilateral and sub-regional trade agreements in Latin America carries dangers, the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean says in a new report*. The report reflects the concern expressed by Mr Gert Rosenthal, the head of the Santiago-based organisation, in a recent interview, over the lack of common external tariffs in most of the region's trade agreements. What may follow, he said, is the development of rules of origin 'as a proxy for restricting trade.' The report, prepared for a meeting of Latin American government experts on trade next month, says rules of origin 'could become a hidden instrument of protectionism that discriminates more against countries less able to take advantage of the expanded market's potential or against those with a greater proportion of extraregional investment.' Four sub-regional agreements are in place - the Central American Common Market, the Andean Pact, the Caribbean Community and Mercosur - and over 20 bilateral agreements have been signed. Trade liberalisation commitments have also been signed between groups of countries, for example between the Caribbean Community members and Venezuela. Bilateral agreements tend not to carry common external tariffs while none of the sub-regional agreements currently has a common tariff applied by all its members, the report notes. It points out that 'bilateral agreements and other agreements with very limited geographical coverage' entail costs if they do not lead to broader, less discriminatory arrangements. For example, 'if bilateral relations are increasingly concentrated, there is a risk that a small country may adjust its production structures to the conditions prevailing on the market of its main trading partner, instead of adapting them to the more competitive conditions of the world economy.' It adds: 'The emergence of certain 'hub' countries with which most bilateral agreements are concluded can also create incentives for the concentration of investment in those countries, since they will have access to more markets and cheap inputs.'

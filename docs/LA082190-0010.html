			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Police are looking for a 24-year-old man in connection with the stabbing death  of another man in Logan Heights.  </P> <P> When police arrived at the scene about 6:50 a.m. Sunday, they found Ernest  Thomas Sharpe, 33, dead with a stab wound in his chest.  </P> <P> The killing on 29th Street between Imperial Avenue and Commercial Street is  believed to have been drug-related, said San Diego police spokesman Bill  Robinson.  </P> <P> He said police are looking for Jeff Gaulden of San Diego.  </P> <P> Sharpe apparently arrived in the area with some friends and, after talking  about drugs with a man, got into an argument with him.  </P> <P> Another man then approached Sharpe with a knife, but, when Sharpe tried to run  away, he stumbled and was stabbed, Homicide Lt. Dan Berglund said. A knife was  found in a yard near the scene.  </P> <P> Just after 1 a.m. Monday, a police SWAT team, along with eight other officers,  sealed off an area in the 2100 block of Oceanview Boulevard because the suspect  was thought to be holed up in a house there, Robinson said. The house turned  out to be empty.  </P></p>

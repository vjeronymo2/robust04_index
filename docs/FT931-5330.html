			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Early retirement pensions at Mirror TRUSTEES of the Mirror Group Pension Fund yesterday announced the reintroduction of early retirement arrangements for both active and deferred pensioners. These were suspended after the discovery that more than Pounds 440m was missing from the pension schemes of companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The arrangements will be available from the age of 56 to people who have completed 25 years service. Those aged at least 60 will be allowed to commute part of the pension for a lump sum. Deferred pensioners who had at least 25 years service before they left the company will have similar arrangements available to them, Mirror Group Trustees said.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Pounds 8.5m spent searching for Escobar A year after his escape from jail, drugs cartel leader Mr Pablo Escobar is still on the loose, probably hidden by loyal followers in the Medelln area. The government has spent over Pounds 8.5m hunting for him and his henchmen, making 12,000 raids and searches and arresting 1,400 people, Sarita Kendall writes. A newly fortified jail houses 25 of the most wanted gunmen and traffickers captured or re-captured over the last year. On several occasions Mr Escobar has apparently been close to surrendering. For nine months he responded to the chase by planting massive car bombs in Bogota and Medelln. But the police claim to have broken up the bombing groups and have seized seven tonnes of dynamite as well as hundreds of weapons. Heads have rolled for his escape - four generals, three colonels, 11 other officers, 36 guards and soldiers and the former vice minister of justice have all been charged in connection with the breakout. But as President Cesar Gaviria comes up to the last year of his presidency, Mr Escobar's escape and continued liberty remains the biggest embarrassment of his administration.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hill &amp; Smith shows sharp recovery to Pounds 4m Hill &amp; Smith, the West Midlands-based steel stockholding, forging and fabricated products company, reversed its downward spiral with pre-tax profits sharply increased over the 12 months to September 30. On turnover marginally ahead to Pounds 67m, profits improved from Pounds 1.53m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 4.03m. Profits had shown a steady decline over the previous three years, but Mr John Silk, chairman, said yesterday that all group business were profitable during the year, except the forging side and that was expected to return to the black in the next few months. Earnings jumped to 9.91p (1.95p) and a final dividend of 4.1p lifts the total 10 per cent to 6.2p. The group also proposed its usual scrip issue, this time on a 1-for-10 basis.</p>

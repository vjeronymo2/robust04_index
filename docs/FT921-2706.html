			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading A STRONG cash market combined with good performances in the gilt and short sterling markets held the FT-SE futures up, although they later drifted back in quiet trading, writes Christopher Price. The March FT-SE contract was marked up to 2,490 and quickly squeezed higher by sentiment from several sources to reach its best level of the day at 2,496. These included a good opinion poll for the Conservative party, the news on Midland Bank, a rally in gilts and a strong showing in short sterling. However, the tight trading range saw March stay around the 2,490 mark for most of the day. Wall Street had little effect, although in the last half-hour of trading March perked up on rumours that an opinion poll would today give the Conservatives a four-point lead. The contract closed at 2,489, up 27 from the previous session and at a discount of around 6 points to its four-point fair value premium and a discount to the underlying market. Turnover was 4,597 lots. In the LTOM, volume was down 10,000 from the previous day's 33,000 contracts. Midland was the most heavily traded stock option with more than 3,500 lots dealt, followed by British Gas and Forte.</p>

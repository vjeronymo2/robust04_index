			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Observer: Buck House in battle royal Competition between Britain's royal palaces is starting to turn ugly. A glance at the latest annual report of the Historic Royal Palaces, an executive agency which controls a number of London piles, shows that the Tower of London is the only real money spinner. It accounts for three-quarters of the 3m visitors and its Pounds 4.3m net operating surplus is more than offset by Hampton Court's Pounds 4.8m deficit. Kensington and Kew palaces and the Banqueting House all lost money and the Tower was the only outfit to record an increase in visitor numbers last year. Part of the problem was the arrival of a new competitor - Buckingham Palace. As the Queen's London residence it has not yet been turned into an executive agency but it is being required to earn its keep at last. It was only open for business for two months last year, yet its 380,000 visitors spent Pounds 5m. It opens again next week and expects to do even better. The number of visitors to the Historic Royal Palaces has been stuck at about the 3m mark for several years and, with Buck House starting to cream off the top end of the market, HRP's managers are going to be hard-pressed to meet their target of increasing their income by a quarter this year. If they fail yet again, then they may have to consider more drastic action. How about spinning off a bit of Hampton Court for luxury housing or making a bid for Buckingham Palace?</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper prices surge to 18-month peaks COPPER'S PRICE surged again to fresh 18-month peaks on the London Metal Exchange yesterday after Poland's copper mining unions called an all-out strike for July 20. But some producers cautioned that world economic conditions did not justify the market's apparent optimism. Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, told brokers in Tokyo he was surprised by some copper price forecasts because there was no evidence the recession was ending. He was asked whether the copper price would reach Dollars 1.50 a lb and said this was unlikely. However, Sir Derek suggested that copper prices would be more resilient than those of other metals because copper demand and supply were finely balanced. Mr Paul Hansen, president of the Highland Valley Copper company in Canada, told the Reuter news agency there was not enough underlying demand for the metal to enable copper to maintain its recent upward momentum. 'North America and Japan are still mired in recession and we really don't see the fundamentals in place at this point,' he added. Copper 'could easily fall back and maybe go below Dollars 1 a lb.' The metal's price in London has risen by nearly 9 per cent in a little over a week from Dollars 1.04 to Dollars 1.13 a lb even though Asarco, one of the big US copper producers, signed new labour contracts without any problems and although the Polish news and had been widely expected. Traders pointed out that there was still time for the Polish government to avert the strike by reaching an agreement with the miners. Pay talks are to start today at Poland's giant KGHM copper producing combine between management and miners' unions. The unions are demanding a 30 per cent wage increase and are backed strongly by the workforce of nearly 40,000, which recently voted overwhelmingly for strike action in a shop floor ballot. Such a pay increase would require an easing by the government of prohibitive taxes controlling state sector wages. So far all that the authorities have conceded is not to tax wages earned at the weekend on condition that ore mining and refined copper output increases. Miners' hopes of having their demands accepted rose recently after talks with representatives of Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the PSL farmers' party leader, who yesterday dropped an abortive month-long effort to form a new government. A short wildcat stoppage on Monday at the Rudna and the Sieroszowice copper ore pits saw miners calling for Mr Pawlak as prime minister. In any event the conflict promises to be the first challenge facing the new government, which will be led by Ms Hanna Suchocka and is likely to be installed at the weekend. The unions are also demanding that the government explain its privatisation plans for KGHM. Asarco, the US metals producer recently offered to manage the combine under a three-year contract while Australia's Western Mining Corporation is talking with it about a joint venture. KGHM produced 165,000 tonnes of copper in the first five months of this year, an increase of 2.5 per cent on the same period last year.</p>

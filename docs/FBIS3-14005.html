			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Why Is the Hindu Suffering Not Noticed?"] </F>   [Text] Bombay, 24 February (NP) -- It is surprising that  truth-loving truth President Clinton has compared the Kashmir  situation with Bosnia. According to him, the human rights of  Muslims are being violated in Kashmir. His advisors are  apparently giving him inaccurate reports. The fact is that  Pakistani terrorists are destroying democracy in Kashmir and are  committing horrible atrocities against Hindus to establish an  Islamic feudal government. Even Hitler did not commit such  atrocities against the Jews. The truth is that Hindus are being  totally obliterated in Kashmir.    When the terrorists take hold of an Indian soldier, they  take  out his eyes, amputate his hands, feet, nose, and ears, and  leave him to die. Some Indian soldiers acted in retaliation. If  such atrocities were committed against U. S. soldiers, would the  U.S. President remain quiet in the name of human rights?    Mr. Clinton should help the world's largest democracy and  peace-loving country, India, stop terrorism instead of helping a  country that is increasing terrorism and the drug trade all over  the world.    It is important to let Mr. Clinton know that after  independence, India appointed a Muslim president, governors, and  chief ministers. Pakistan and Bangladesh, however, have not even  given Hindus the right to vote. They are not even permitted to  worship. Their democratic and human rights are being violated.  In India, we grant special privileges to Muslims, which the  Hindus here do not have. We have passed minority protection  laws. In order to help Muslims get education and employment, the  government is sending millions of rupees. The Shankaracharya of  Shringeri said in an interview that it is the blood of Hindus  that runs in the veins of Muslims. The Indian Government spent  about 750 billion rupees on the Kashmiri people over the last 45  years. Because of the hundreds of privileges, the population of  Muslims in India has increased from 30 million to 120 million  since independence. In Pakistan, however, because of the  atrocious rule there, the number of Hindus has fallen from 10  million to only 1 million. Hindus are also disappearing from  Kashmir and Bangladesh. Such genocide has never happened  anywhere else in the world. The Hindu society, because of its  love for peace and tolerance, has suffered atrocities for  thousands of years.    In this context, we are appealing to the president of the  most powerful country in the world to take the initiative of  protecting India, which has done so much work to increase peace  and spirituality in the world.    Former U. S. Presidents Kennedy and Carter understood this  very well. In order to stop terrorism in Kashmir, the whole  world will have to speak out against it. Therefore, we are  requesting that the Pope and Mother Teresa speak against it, so  that truth and non-violence will win.  *</p>

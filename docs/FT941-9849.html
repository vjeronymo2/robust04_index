			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Declaration on peace a failure, says Molyneaux Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, claimed yesterday that the Downing Street declaration aimed at securing peace in Northern Ireland had failed and he urged the British government to press on with talks aimed at securing a political settlement in the province. Mr Molyneaux's remarks described the London-Dublin initiative as an experiment which had obviously failed. While the two governments might not be ready to admit it, he was prepared to transmit the message 'loud and clear'. In a BBC interview he echoed the complaints of other Ulster politicians over the decision by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, to put his proposals for a devolved assembly in Northern Ireland to the government of the Irish Republic before constitutional parties in the north had been given the opportunity to help in its formulation. The government yesterday continued its efforts to step up its initiative among the constitutional parties when Sir Patrick met Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party. After the meeting, during which Dr Alderdice was briefed on the ideas submitted to Dublin, he said the session had been 'reasonably useful'. Sir Patrick is expected to see Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, early next week. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, again attacked the joint declaration as a bar to further political progress. But in a by-election for Belfast City Council yesterday, before which the DUP had campaigned on a rejection of the declaration, Mr Paisley's party suffered a fall in its share of the vote. A continuation of the conflict in Northern Ireland will cost the British and Irish governments an estimated IPounds 450m (Pounds 433m) per year with 75 per cent of the cost falling upon Britain, according to a study published yesterday by DKM economic consultants in Dublin, Tim Coone writes. DKM estimates that the greatest savings, in peacetime, would accrue in security costs, amounting to IPounds 222m in the province and IPounds 91m in the republic.

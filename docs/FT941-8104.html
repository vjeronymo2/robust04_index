			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Placer commissions study on gold mine property Placer Dome, the international gold producer, expects to decide within the next 12 months whether to press ahead with construction of a gold mine on the rich Las Cristinas deposit in north-east Venezuela. The Vancouver-based company said yesterday it had approved a USDollars 13m feasibility study on the property which, according to initial studies, contains about 7.7m ounces of gold. Placer's 70 per cent share of Las Cristinas is equal to almost 60 per cent of current reserves at its 17 operating mines in North and South America and Australasia. Placer also reported a slight drop in 1993 earnings, but a 44 per cent jump in fourth-quarter income. The latter was largely due to gains from the sale of investments and favourable tax adjustments. Earnings for the year were USDollars 107m, or 45 cents a share, down from Dollars 111m, or 47 cents a share, in 1992. Sales dipped to Dollars 917m from Dollars 1.02bn. Placer's share of gold output totalled 1.83m ounces, down from 1.95m ounces. Average cash production costs edged down to Dollars 184 from Dollars 189 per ounce.</p>

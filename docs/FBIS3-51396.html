Today's  Straight Talk topic will be interesting. We always choose  interesting topics, but there are times when we broach issues  that truly worry the people. Today's topic will be one of those:  The banking policy and how it can contribute to improved  domestic finances. To broach this topic, I have invited JUVENTUD  REBELDE reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro  Rodriguez. Are you brothers?    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are brothers, we are brothers but we  are not related. However, we do have the same patronymic and  matronymic.    Yes Juan Carlos, I do believe this is an interesting topic.  The implementation of a single measures will not solve the  domestic finance problems. Budget control, taxes, and banking  policies, on their own, will not solve the problem. The problem  will be solved by implementing a group of measures. These  measures must be aimed at gathering the excess currency and  maintaining a balance after this is done. It would be useless to  gather the excess currency and face the same situation later.  Financial stability is important from the banking viewpoint.    [Roque Garcia] And that is what we want to talk about.  First,  let us think about something. Of the approximately 11 billion  [currency not specified] in excess currency, half of that is in  the banks. If much of what is still on the streets were in the  bank, the problem would not be that big.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We must find a solution to those  problems. I believe that one of these problems is our current  banking policy, or, if not implemented correctly, the banking  policy we will have once the new measures are implemented. We  must immobilize as much currency as possible. Money in the bank  is immobilized money. Money that is immobilized does not  circulate on the black market. Money that does not circulate on  the black market is money that will not devaluate our currency.  Therefore, I believe it would be logical to immobilize as much  of that excess currency as possible.    [Roque Garcia] Pepe [nickname for Jose], do you agree with  this?    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, I do. However, Juan Carlos,  I  believe that to solve this problem, to search for the different  ways to solve it -- we must launch a frontal attack and hit them  from every side -- we must first change the way the bank deals  with the people. That is the most important thing. The bank must  begin by encouraging the people to put their money in the bank.  For example, interest rates. Something must be done about this.  I also believe that we must study some of the measures that have  been suggested. Some of the measures suggested are a bit too  drastic. I have heard people say....    [Roque Garcia, interrupts] Measures proposed.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, proposed.    [Roque Garcia] That is correct, that is correct.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I have people say: No, no, I can  have a certain amount of money. I believe this must be handled  in an economic manner. Everything has a bit of political lacing,  but we must also remember that if we are promoting a savings  policy, we cannot create measures that will discourage what we  are trying to get the people to do, which is to save.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What we must determine is who has the  money. How they earned that money.    [Roque Garcia] That is correct.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] How they got that much money and how  they  got to save that amount of money.    [Roque Garcia] But that is not the bank's problem.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, it is not. It is what Pepe was  talking about. We cannot change the cause to ensure a final  objective. The bank's objective is to immobilize the money. What  the police and investigation groups must do is find out where  this person got all that money from.    [Roque Garcia] The so-called hoarders, for example.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The so-called hoarders. Here in Cuba we  have many hoarders who earned their money in a very honest  manner. Perhaps, but mistake were made, or there was excess  profit, or there were state-made mistakes -- they made much  money, but it was honestly earned. Therefore, we must  differentiate in the way we handle these people, or these  comrades. But it is not the bank's duty to do this.    The man who made his money illegally does not put his money  in the bank. That man is afraid of putting his money in the bank.    [Roque Garcia] We are looking for coinciding points of view  between what we are discussing here and what is being said on  the streets. There were things broached during the first part of  the program which I am not very clear on. What do you think,  Jose Alejandro?    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I was very surprised by a....    [Roque Garcia, interrupts] A term he used.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. I believe that  many people must be thinking about this. He used two words:  hoarders and honest. Some people may be thinking that these two  words do not go hand in hand.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What you say is true, and I believe it  needs further explanation. We say that anyone who has a lot of  money is a hoarder. There are many people in Cuba who have made  a lot of money in an honest way: for example, the farmers. There  are farmers who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and who  earned this money honestly. Is there a more honest way of making  money than by working the land?    [Roque Garcia] I agree.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There also are hundreds of craftsmen who  have earned hundreds of thousands of pesos honestly. They were  able to earn this money because of the price of handicrafts,  because of the policies established for these products, and  because these products are not taxed. The other day we were  talking about taxes. Were these farmers taxed on what they do,  perhaps they would not have been able to accumulate the hundreds  of thousands of pesos they have today. However, there are others  who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and have no way of  showing how they got that money. They have not worked a day in  their lives and have no way of showing how they got that money.    But there is another problem, you mentioned the banks. That  is a mistake; banks do not exist to find out where the money is  coming from. Banks are there to receive and keep the money I  deposit. Even though one topic leads to the other, this is not  the issue we are discussing today. So let us go back to today's  topic: A banking policy to ensure that our domestic finances  will return to normal. As Pepe said, that policy should  encourage the people to save as much as possible. The bank  should have good interest rates that will encourage the people.  I want to earn something on what I save. A good interest rate  must be established so that the people will go and deposit their  money in the banks. The people must trust the banks.    [Roque Garcia] I do believe that people trust banks.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Yes, but as Pepe Alejandro said, the  banks must not be made into a coercive instrument. A bank is  there to receive the money that is deposited. If today I were to  take 2 million pesos to the People's Bank and tell them that I  want to keep my money there, they cannot go around finding out  where it came from.    [Roque Garcia] I would have you investigated immediately.  [laughter]    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] But that is not what a bank is for.    [Roque Garcia] I agree.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The bank must accept my 2 million pesos  and pay me the established interest rates. Today's interest  rates are too low.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] It is only 2 or 3 percent.  Sometimes not even that. It is 2 percent per annum.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Why should we be afraid of someone being  able to live off the interest he is getting from his savings? If  a worker has been working for 25 and 30 years and he has saved  money in the bank in the hope that when he retires he can have  some extra money to live off, then why not? It can happen.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Osvaldo, there are other  problems.  The banks have a thousand and one ways to encourage people to  save. For example, at this moment when there is such a big  difference between the excess currency on the street and the  lack of goods to be purchased, we can encourage the people to  save by establishing a plan by which after they have saved for a  specific period of time they can buy certain products that  cannot be purchased on the market.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Durable goods.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct, durable goods.  For example, if you have saved quite a bit of money, after two  years you can purchase a television set or a refrigerator. This  would be an incentive. This could be a way of encouraging the  people to put their money in the bank.    [Roque Garcia] These are strategies that must be considered.  We must keep these ideas in mind, especially today when we are  trying to improve our domestic finances.    [Roque Garcia] We are here today with JUVENTUD REBELDE  reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro Rodriguez. We are  talking about a banking policy that could contribute to  improving domestic finances. The bank cannot utilize coercive  methods. We are clear on that. However, there are rumors. What  can we expect?    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Juan Carlos, you know Cubans. We  are always talking about things, about everything. And boy, can  we smell things! People see things changing, and they talk about  it.    [Roque Garcia] That is the people for you.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. However, there  are some who want the banks to assume a repressive role. They  want the banks to handle social phenomena that must be solved by  other means.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] That is why I said a while ago that we  must have trust in the banks.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Bank policies are policies that  have been around for hundreds of years. This is worldwide. These  are policies that cannot be ignored. The relationship between  the bank and the client must be one of trust and flexibility.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] They must be very careful about how they  treat people. The client should not be kept waiting.    [Roque Garcia] There are times when you get to the bank and  you have to wait in line for a long time because it takes  forever to complete a transaction.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Going back to what you and Pepe were  saying: I believe that banks cannot, under any circumstance, put  conditions on my money. The bank is there to hold my money. That  is it. When I want to withdraw my money, even if I want to  withdraw every single peso I have deposited, even 100,000 pesos,  the bank has to give me my 100,000 pesos plus the interest  accrued. The bank uses that money. The bank uses the money I  deposit. The bank uses my money, your money, and everyone's  money for its own operations. Therefore, the bank cannot  condition my deposits. The people would lose all trust in banks  if they begin imposing coercive measures. I believe that those  who are suggesting that the banks implement coercive measures  are mistaken. Banks must protect the trust the people have in  them.    [Roque Garcia] I agree with you. I believe that this is the  correct path. We have only expressed our opinions. We are not  judges and the banks are not in the dock. We are not  specialists. All we are doing is analyzing the problem.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are only observing the situation.    [Roque Garcia] As Osvaldo just said, we are observing the  situation and we cannot ignore what the people are saying.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There is something else that the banks  could implement, which I believe would be good. I am talking  about time deposits. All foreign banks do this. It is similar to  something that we are doing here.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] The fixed fund account [cuenta de  fondo fijo].    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, creation of the fund [formacion de  fondo].    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Creation of the fund.    [Osvaldo Rodriguez] This fund is a payroll-deductible  account. You set aside a certain amount for a specific time; in  other words, you freeze that money. After a specific amount of  time, you get your money back with interest. Time deposits are  similar to this. The only difference is that you deposit a  specific amount in a lump sum and decide how long you want to  keep it in the bank, be it six or 12 months, or the time  established by the bank. This provides much higher interest, and  keeps that money immobilized. These are options that the banks  must analyze at this time when we are looking for ways to  improve our domestic finances.    [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] We must establish a balance, and  for this to be possible, it is important to have a good rapport  between the banks and the people. This rapport must not be  tainted by any type of repressive or restraining measures.</p>

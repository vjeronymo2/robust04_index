			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Appointments: Smyth to help Fiat rev up its dealers FIAT has appointed Geoff Smyth as operations director of Fiat Auto (UK), its British importer/distributor subsidiary. Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, is planning to invest around Pounds 100m over the next three years in order to strengthen its UK dealer network and improve its poor market share. Smyth, who was previously Fiat's area director for Scandinavia and Austria based in Turin, will be responsible for managing the dealer networks of the three marques in the UK. Smyth, 39, has worked his way up through Fiat since joining the company in Ireland in 1979, and has been based in Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. There are currently around 300 Fiat dealerships in the UK along with 69 for Alfa Romeo and 56 for Lancia. Although Fiat is the second largest west European car-maker, in the UK the group has languished far behind its rivals. Smyth says that 'it will be my job to ensure that the group's position in the UK more accurately reflects the company's successes in other markets.' Alec Murray, managing director of QUICKS Group, the Manchester-headquartered vehicles distributor, is taking the corporate name to heart. Just three months after he moved in, the Quicks board has been reshuffled and a loss-making leasing subsidiary, Trafford Vehicle Leasing, closed down. James Quick, nephew of chairman Norman, and Michael Davis have left their positions as executive directors of the group board to assume responsibility for the group's main operating subsidiary, dealers H &amp; J Quick. A third group director, James Olroyd, has left the group altogether. He is said to have successfully completed 'specific tasks for which he was appointed in 1990', understood to relate to his management of Ford dealerships within the group.</p>

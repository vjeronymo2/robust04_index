			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 2 INSURERS CUT RATES ON SOME COVERAGE; AUTOS NOT INCLUDED  </P> <P> Two insurance companies, Safeco and Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, said Tuesday  that they are voluntarily rolling back their premium rates in accord with  Proposition 103 on certain commercial policies representing a small percentage  of their total California business.  </P> <P> Checks with these and other major insurers found no company, however, that had  plans to roll back any private automobile or homeowner premiums. All spokesmen  said their companies had applied to Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for  exemptions from rollbacks on these policies, which constitute the lion's share  of their business in the state.  </P> <P> Aetna spokesman Jason Wright said Aetna will roll back rates 20% from 1987  levels, as called for in the initiative, on commercial policies relating to  crime coverage, farmers and ranchers and inland marine (boats), and 8.8% on  policies covering commercial condominium owners. Total premiums affected would  be less than $50 million of Aetna's 1988 sales of $660 million in the state, he  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Safeco Rollbacks  </P> <P> Safeco spokesman Bill Pierron said that company will give 20% rollbacks from  1987 levels for malpractice policies for dentists and emergency medical  technicians. These constitute about $13 million of Safeco's $409 million annual  sales in all lines of insurance.  </P> <P> A third company, the Automobile Club of Southern California, said it will roll  back premiums on small boats, constituting $4 million of the $770 million in  total premiums it writes.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court in its May decision upholding Proposition 103 rollbacks  said insurers could be exempted from them by the insurance commissioner if they  could demonstrate that after giving them, they would not be receiving a fair  rate of return on their business.  </P></p>

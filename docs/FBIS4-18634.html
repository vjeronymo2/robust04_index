			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Netherlands Submarine Spies Along the </F> Coast of Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] Den Helder, 6 Apr (ANP) -- A Netherlands Navy's  submarine has been sailing up and down the coast of the former  Yugoslavia on military espionage mission exercise for some time  now. This was revealed Tuesday evening [5 April] during a forum  organized by the Royal Navy Institute of Den Helder.    The submarine crew, using sophisticated equipment,  eavesdrops  military communications between Bosnian and Serbian troops.  Tactical and strategic information, which may be of importance,  is made available to UN peaceforce commanders in the former  Yugoslavia. PvdA [Labor Party] Defense Spokesman Van Traa said  that Netherlands espionage for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  had revealed some interesting military events, which Van Traa  did not specify.    The Defense Ministry recently reported that a fire had  broken  out on board the submarine, causing breathing problems to some  of the crew members. Not a word was said about the submarine's  special duties.    When asked, W. Van Straten, head of the Navy Information  Service, said that he was able neither to confirm nor to deny  the submarine's espionage mission. "The duties and  possibilities of Netherlands submarines are described in defense  notes without any further comment," the spokesman said.</p>

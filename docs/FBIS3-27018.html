Only when we direct the focus of economic  work to raising economic efficiency and dealing conscientiously  with the relationship between speed and efficiency can we  maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu  kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099  1455] of the national economy. In order to promote the raising  of economic efficiency, as of today the committee for the  extensive and in-depth survey of economic efficiency in China,  and the RENMIN RIBAO Theoretical Department jointly open an  "Economic Efficiency Forum" column. Readers' participation in  this in-depth discussion on ways to raise economic efficiency in  the form of articles is most welcome.    Raising economic efficiency was the premise and fundamental  objective for Comrade Deng Xiaoping when he was outlining his  blueprint on China's reform, development, and stability. It is  a key integral part of his economic theory. In his southern  inspection tour addresses in early 1992, with characteristic  historical perception and courage to take on the future, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping stressed more than once the problem of raising  economic efficiency, and he urged the people of the whole  nation: "In future modernization, it is both necessary and  within our grasp to achieve a certain number of stages where  there is a better rate of development and high economic  efficiency. We must aspire to this!"    An intensive study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's writings on  raising economic efficiency helps us understand Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party Central Committee's overall  strategic layout for speeding up the establishment of a  socialist market economy system in order to promote economic  development and social progress.  <H3>  I. "Work for Efficiency in an Down-to-Earth Fashion" --  Relationship Between Efficiency and Development </H3>   Speeding up development and turning our country into a  socialist power were the lifelong ideals and goals for  proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation like Mao  Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, as well as the main theme  forever occupying a prominent space in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory and practice. In the late 1980's and early 1990's,  socialist China was under external pressure: The international  socialist movement had entered a low tide; the world's economy  was moving into different blocs and increasingly integrated; and  there was the rapid economic takeoff of the Asia-Pacific circle.  There were also internal difficulties: Deep-layered economic  contradictions remained; there was an irrational production  structure; and there had been no fundamental improvement in the  low economic efficiency. At this critical juncture, where  challenges and opportunities coexisted and difficulties and  hopes ran side by side, Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly  stressed the vital importance for China's future and fate of the  general development goal of speeding up development and  quadrupling the GDP. He made a series of expositions on how to  speed up development and achieve the general strategic goal of  quadrupling the GDP, a question that turns on the mode of  development.    On how to achieve the general strategic goal of quadrupling  the GDP, Comrade Xiaoping makes two fundamental requirements:  First, according to the ideological line of seeking truth from  facts, he stresses that the economic quadrupling must not be  "diluted" but "real and solid," for he is "not encouraging high  speed in disregard of practical conditions." Second, on the  principle of the party serving the people, the fundamental  criterion will be whether or not the people support and favor  the program. He stresses that "doubling the GDP ultimately must  be reflected in people's living standards, which is, moreover, a  gradually rising one." "The people are highly sensitized to  this problem. Our bookkeeping can in no way beat theirs, for  theirs is the truest." These two fundamental requirements  determine what Comrade Xiaoping stressed, that increasing the  rate of development must be premised on raising economic  efficiency, and the development rate he was stressing is of  necessity one with good efficiency. Comrade Xiaoping has  explained this clearly:    In the article "The First Decade as Preparation for the  Following One," he pointed out clearly: "The target for our  struggle should have been in place toward the last 20 years of  this century, and that is quadrupling both industrial and  agricultural output value under the premise of increasing  economic efficiency."    In the article "All Tasks Must Be Conducive to the  Establishment of Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," he  pointed out: "We must attach importance to raising economic  efficiency and should not go after only growth in output volume  and value."    In his southern inspection tour addresses, he said:  "Economic development in our country is such that every few  years we will have to move into a new dimension. Of course,  this does not mean that we are encouraging impractically high  speed. We still have to be down-to-earth and value-efficient,  and develop in a steady and coordinated fashion."  On the question of how to speed up economic development,  there have always been two models in the history of China's  socialism: One is "rate-pulled efficiency." The  traditional planned economy increased the rate of economic  development mainly through expanding investment, opening up new  fronts, and launching new projects. The economy was pulled into  high-rate growth momentum by means of speed, and particularly by  means of expanded fixed-asset investment, which naturally also  raised economic efficiency. We can say that this model, through  inertia, still plays a role to this day. Two, the  "efficiency-propelled rate," raising economic efficiency through  increasing internal reproduction capacity, and from it  increasing the rate of economic development. This is precisely  the model Comrade Xiaoping is advocating. In the Volume 3  of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Comrade Deng  Xiaoping brought up more than once the lesson of 1958, pointing  out: "The development of `leftist' thought led to the `Great  Leap' and People's Commune Movements in 1958. That was a big  mistake, and we were punished for it. During the three years of  natural calamities between 1959 and 1961, industrial and  agricultural output went down, and there were only a few  commodities on the market. People did not have enough to eat  and their production motivation suffered." "Our objective is  quite realistic, and raising people's living standards is a long  struggle. The several mistakes we have made since the founding  of the country all were caused by excessive zeal and  unrealistically high targets, which did not match with China's  practical conditions. Development actually was stalled." Only  by adopting the "efficiency-propelled rate" model can we  genuinely speed up the rate of economic development. This is  the historical conclusion given us by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.    Guided by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, the "CPC Central  Committee's Decision on Certain Problems Related to Building a  Socialist Market Economy System" also stresses the fundamental  thinking of raising economic efficiency. The "Decision"  stresses: It is necessary to "raise the proportion of financial  revenue in the GDP through developing the economy, raising  efficiency, and expanding sources of income." We must firmly  bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's historical conclusion,  based on his experience and high wisdom and on the spirit of the  "Decision." Only the increase of rate premised on improved  economic efficiency is a genuine "undiluted" increase in rate, a  genuinely and solidly fast rate, not a false and illusory fast  rate! The development of China's economy must follow this  development model of a genuinely fast development rate!  <H3>  II. "Once Reforms Are in Order; Efficiency Comes  Automatically" -- Relations Between Efficiency and Reforms </H3>   Comrade Deng Xiaoping never stressed development without  simultaneously emphasizing reform, because development premised  on the improvement of economic efficiency can be achieved only  and primarily through reform. Development by external and  extensive expansion typified by the blind pursuit of rate is  achievable under a traditional planned system. We will  understand better Comrade Xiaoping's series of expositions on  speeding up reform and opening up if we approach them with  raising economic efficiency as the controlling concept.    Efficiency is the ratio between input and output, and  represents products or services demanded by society. In a  traditional planned system, "high input, with low output and  efficiency" remained entrenched and beyond touch. "Years of  experience prove that the pat traditional system is incapable of  developing productive forces." To raise economic efficiency and  develop social productive forces, it is necessary to shatter the  old planned economy system. As early as 1978, Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out sharply: "To raise the economic development rate,  it is necessary vigorously to pursue the specialization of  enterprises, greatly improve the technical level of the work  force, conscientiously train and test workers, tighten up  enterprises' economic auditing, and raise the labor productivity  and capital profitability rates. Therefore, there should be  significant technological, institutional and organizational  reforms on all fronts. The pursuit of these reforms represents  the long-term interests of people throughout the country, else  we will forever remain backward in production technology and  management." He pointed out even more explicitly on a trip to  Tianjin in 1986: "Tianjin Port has significantly raised its  economic efficiency since its deregulation two years ago. The  people and land remain the same, but economic efficiency was  achieved through reform." Reform is the only and primary path  through which economic efficiency can be raised. Therefore,  Comrade Xiaoping said very firmly: "No one can stop China from  continuing with its reform and opening up. Why? It is simple:  There will be no development without reform and opening up; the  economy will coast and reverse, and people's living standards  will fall. The trend of reform is unchangeable."    The objective of reform is to establish a socialist market  economy system, and raising economic efficiency is a basic  requirement for establishing a socialist market economy system.  As the ratio between input and output is determined primarily  by the mode of resource allocation. Under a planned economy  system, resources are allocated by a highly centralized  administrative system, under which input and output cannot be  rational, and there cannot be any economic efficiency (and in  fact, there is none). Only under a socialist market economy  system -- under which enterprises are economic entities that  operate independently, and are responsible for their own profits  and losses, development, and restraint -- can the improvement of  economic efficiency become a fundamental objective for our  economy. Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's scientific  conclusion, the 14th party congress made the establishment of a  socialist market economy system the objective for our country's  structural reform. The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee then outlined a basic  framework for the socialist market economY system, thus  providing an institutional guarantee for the improvement of  economic efficiency. Speeding up the development of productive  forces and raising economic efficiency through fundamental  changes in resource allocation -- this is Comrade Xiaoping's  outstanding and enormous contribution to the theory and practice  of reform and opening up.    As reform necessarily requires raising economic efficiency,  raising economic efficiency will provide a fundamental economic  guarantee for the steady pursuit of reform. Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out: "In the process of reform, it is good enough to  keep production at a certain growth rate. We should not  overreach our limits in the pursuit of high speed. Of course,  it will not do if the rate is too low. The rate in the past  decade was not low. If we can keep development at a relatively  good rate for the next few years, we will run a much lower risk  in deepening reform." Reform is the second revolution for our  country. It involves an adjustment in the interest pattern and  an economic reintegration. Therefore, reform must promote the  improvement of economic efficiency in order to create a less  demanding situation against which the deepening of reform  proceeds. Otherwise there will be capital shortages and weak  markets, seriously affecting the reform process. This is the  underlying truth of Comrade Xiaoping's famous dictum "once  reform is in order, efficiency comes automatically."    Based on Comrade Xiaoping's thoughts, the "CPC Central  Committee Decision on Certain Problems Related to the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy System" pointed out  explicitly: "Enterprises run production and operations according  to market demand, and in pursuit of raising labor productivity  and economic efficiency." "The development of our rural economy  has entered a stage characterized by structural adjustment and  raising economic efficiency. The rural economy must adapt to  changes in market demand for agricultural products; optimize its  product mix; and develop agriculture in the direction of high  yield, high quality, and high efficiency." This embodies the  fundamental requirement for establishing a socialist market  economy system to raise economic efficiency, as well as the  close inner relations between deepening reform and raising  economic efficiency.  <H3>  III. "What Hazards Could There Be if We Are Mindful of  Economic Efficiency?" -- Relationship Between Economic  Efficiency and Stability </H3>   Both reform and development require a stable environment.  Basically, growth in social productive forces and considerable  improvement in economic efficiency will provide a fundamental  guarantee for social and economic stability. As Comrade  Xiaoping said: Regarding treatment of social environment, the  real and ultimate way lies in improving the economy."    First, we can avoid serious economic damage and  fluctuations if increases in the rate of economic development  are premised on raising economic efficiency. Comrade  Xiaoping said: "One of the things we learn from our experience  is that we should be able to see where problems might come from,  even when development is going well. Development must proceed at  the right pace. Problems will arise when the economy is  overheated. In short, be practical when formulating policies.  As long as we can do that, we will not make big mistakes." He  said on his Tianjin tour: "What hazards could there be, even if  one or two localities borrow $10 billion or so in 10 years, if  they are mindful of economic efficiency? There is nothing to  worry about, even if they borrow $20 billion." Thus raising  economic efficiency was made the premise and fundamental  guarantee for preventing economic hazards. Early last year,  Comrade Xiaoping said in Shanghai: "In economic work, we must  seize opportunities and accelerate development while keeping an  eye on stability so as to avoid damage, especially serious  damage." Thus we are further reminded that we must really carry  out the job of raising economic efficiency in economic  development.    Second, if economic development is based on higher  economic efficiency, it will guarantee the improvement of  people's living standards and will promote social stability and  unity. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out emphatically: "The  most fundamental element is the rate of economic growth, the  benefit of which, moreover, must be reflected in people's  gradually rising living standards. People will settle down when  they witness the benefits of stability and of the current  institutions and policies. If we can do that, then whatever  changes there may be in the international major climate, things  will be steady as a rock."    What needs to be pointed out and emphasized is that while  raising economic efficiency is an economic problem, it is also a  process that calls for a spirit of arduous enterprise and  involves fight against corruption. This is highly significant  for the pursuit of socialist spiritual civilization. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping pointed out sharply as early as 1980: "The drive  against privileges is only one of the aspects of arduous  enterprise. The biggest problem is how to stamp out waste,  raise labor productivity, cut the output of products for which  there is no demand and of junk products not meeting quality  requirements, reduce total costs, and raise the rate of capital  utilization. We must make everyone understand how hard it was  for us to obtain this capital and make these products. Any kind  of waste is a crime." In 1985, he pointed out: "A too- rapid  development rate causes many problems, and affects reforms and  social climate. It is better to be slower, but more stable.  The scale of fixed-asset investment must be kept under control.  Do not overstretch ourselves in launching capital construction.  Management and quality get top priority. Only a development  rate that helps both economic efficiency and social benefits is  genuine." He said in 1989: "The more developed we are, the  more we must emphasize arduous enterprise. Advocating a spirit  of arduous enterprise helps overcome corruption. Since the  founding of the country, we have been advocating the spirit of  arduous enterprise. Later, when things improved, we started  encouraging high consumption, and there was waste everywhere."  Raising economic efficiency and fighting corruption are  completely identical. Only then can we genuinely unify the  masses and build socialist spiritual civilization, and hence  promote the triumphant march of the socialist cause and the  stability and unity of society as a whole.    Our country is at a critical juncture where the planned  economy is changing toward a socialist market economy system and  the traditional development model is changing to a modernized  one. Raising economic efficiency is a premise and guarantee of  fundamental import for our reform, development, and stability.  We should actively conduct studies, investigations, and  publicity campaigns for the effort to raise economic efficiency,  and should include such an effort as part of our action  programs, and hence promote the sustained, rapid, healthy  development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816  6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our country's economy.</p>

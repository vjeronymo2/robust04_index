As we reported at the city's  Main Medical Administration, the reason for this increase is the  increased number of refugees that have carried the disease in  and the dirtiness of Moscow residents themselves. There have  been cases where entire families have contracted scabies.  Families often try to rid themselves of the infection by using  mercury salve, which is unsuitable for treatment. Immediately  thereafter they arrive at the hospital with acute poisoning.  Sometimes self-treatment is fatal. The other day, young parents  with a nursing child that could not be saved were brought in a  critical condition to the Center for Treatment of Acute  Poisonings of the Scientific Research Institute imeni  Sklifosovskiy.</p>

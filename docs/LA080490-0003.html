			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARR STRIKES OUT SINGING THE ANTHEM  </P> <P> I was appalled and repulsed by the rude, thoughtless and inconsiderate  performance of our national anthem by Roseanne Barr at Jack Murphy Stadium in  San Diego. It wasn't bad enough that she agreed to "sing" in the first place  knowing full well that she couldn't; but to follow her "performance" with an  inappropriate gesture and spitting was totally unacceptable and an insult to  those in the stadium and the rest of our great country as well.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN A.

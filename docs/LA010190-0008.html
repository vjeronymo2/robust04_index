			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIBUTE TO A WAR HERO  </P> <P> Not too long ago many Americans believed marijuana was no more harmful than  tobacco, and a presidential adviser described cocaine as "probably the most  benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use . . ." Back then, police  officers fought a dangerous, lonely and unappreciated war against drugs. Los  Angeles Police Officer Kelly Key was one of its troopers.  </P> <P> He was paralyzed nearly two decades ago by a bullet fired while he tried to  serve a search warrant on a suspected cocaine dealer. Key died last week,  having spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair from which he taught  youngsters the dangers of drugs and other temptations of the streets.  </P> <P> A quadriplegic, he still volunteered three days a week at the Gwen Bolden  Foundation, an after-school counseling program in a rough neighborhood south of  downtown Los Angeles. Key was a tutor and a mentor, often for boys with no  other man in their lives. He bought book-packs, shoes and treated youngsters to  lunch, which was for many their first experience in a restaurant. He quietly  did things to teach youngsters to feel good about themselves. There was no  better role model in the war against drugs.  </P> <P> Drug use has exploded exponentially since a bullet cut short Key's once-bright  police career in 1970. Now it destroys lives, families and communities  wholesale. As the terror of the nightmare grows, more officers like Key risk  their lives. But, as law enforcement leaders are beginning to recognize, the  war must be waged with equal fervor against the underlying social causes that  make illicit drugs so alluring for so many. Prevention must be as important as  enforcement.  </P> <P> Kelly Key, who turned 49 the day before he died, will be buried Tuesday with  full Police Department honors. His tombstone should read: Pioneer and Hero in  the War Against Drugs.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prosecutor Jose Nemtala on 29 March confirmed the  arrest of Victor Poma, alleged member of the Tupac Katari  Guerrilla Army, EGKT, who is charged with terrorist attacks and  attacks against the state's security.    Nemtala said that Poma was arrested following relentless  investigation by the state's intelligence services. He declined  to provide further details or the place where Poma is being held.    The EGKT began its terrorist activities in July 1991, with  the "bombing" of two high tension pylons in the Alto Lima zone  of the city of El Alto. Poma reportedly participated in this  attack, which claimed the life of an EGKT member. The  organization then perpetrated a number of attacks leading to the  arrest of top leaders: the brothers Raul and Alvaro Garcia, who  are jailed in the Chonchocoro prison, and Felipe Quispe, known  as "El Mallku," among others. The state's intelligence services  are searching for Carlos Lara, who is considered to be a member  of the EGTK "general staff."</p>

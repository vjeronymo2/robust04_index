			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 23, 1993, CONSOL, Inc. filed comments regarding the proposed addition of 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 section 2(12), expressing its concern regarding the proposed 30-day time limit for submitting updated ownership and control information. CONSOL, Inc. recommended that the proposal be changed for large corporations, to allow for the submittal of updated information within thirty days of the date when it is released by the corporate secretary rather than thirty days from the effective date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In responding to CONSOL's comments, the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet) indicated that it understood the commenter's concern that the proposed language could be read to allow sanctions to be imposed for failure to submit ownership and control updates within thirty days. The Cabinet went on the state that it recognized that ``multi-level corporate entities require a reasonable amount of time in which to submit corporate changes. The failure for an entity to submit updated information within the thirty (30) day timeframe does not automatically constitute a violation. The Cabinet does not intend to initiate suspension procedures unless a permittee has refused or failed to submit information to the Cabinet upon request.'' The proposed language in 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 section 2(12) provides that ``[A]fter the permittee's refusal or failure to timely submit the information to the cabinet upon request, the Cabinet may suspend the permit after opportunity for hearing *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Director feels that Kentucky's response to the concerns raised by CONSOL, Inc. is adequate and he has approved the proposed language herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various government agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program. The Kentucky Heritage Council, Soil Conservation Service, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of Land Management, Maine Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Mines generally considered the amendment to be acceptable or submitted an acknowledgement with no comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Water Act (22 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

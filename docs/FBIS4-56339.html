			<p>BFN     [Text] Although it was not on the agenda, the congressional  Constitution Committee yesterday approved a draft bill  regulating the use of, and procedures for filing, habeas data  petitions in court. If Congress approves the draft bill, habeas  data cases will be heard only by civil courts and not by  criminal courts.    The draft law was submitted by Carlos Torres y Torres Lara,  chairman of the Constitution Committee, who announced that the  bill will be debated by the Congress plenum today.    Although government and opposition blocs in Congress agree  on  the need to define this subject as soon as possible to eliminate  any possible threat to the freedom of press in Peru, the diverse  positions on the subject prompted a heated debate.    In the end the majority approved the proposal to regulate  the  habeas data right through a specific law, while the minority  demanded that the habeas data be eliminated from the text of the  Constitution.    The proposal to regulate habeas data was finally approved by  a 7-6 vote.    The draft bill is divided into seven articles and one  transitory measure.    The first article states that, until a specific law is  approved, habeas data cases will be heard by a civil court near  where the alleged offense took place.    The second article states that media organizations are  required to correct earlier reports without delay -- within  three days -- and proportionally to the original report. In  case of disagreement, a judge will decide when the correction  must be published.    Procedures set forth for the constitutional right of Amparo  (with the exception of the provisions of Article 11 of Law  No.23506, as outlined in Article 3 of the bill) will be  applicable to habeas data petitions in case of procedural  loopholes.    The only transitory article of the bill states that if a  habeas data petition is filed before a criminal court, it should  be turned over to a civil court.    The great majority approved the draft bill which Torres y  Torres initially submitted to Congress in October, but which he  submitted again yesterday after revising it and updating it.    Torres y Torres feels that because this tool is new to  Peruvian law, it should be regulated by a transitory law to give  the nation time to gain experience before drafting a specific  law.    Torres y Torres asserted that the Constitution states that  habeas data cases must be heard by civil courts in accordance  with the procedures set forth in a writ of amparo and this is  why criminal courts have turned down every habeas data petition  filed before them.    Torres y Torres voiced confidence that this bill will dispel  every doubt about procedural matters concerning habeas data  petitions.    He said he believes the subject has been misinterpreted by  some citizens and used for political purposes by the opposition.    The opposition believes a law of implementation alone will  not suffice. Roger Caceres (Frenatraca) [National Front of  Workers and Peasants] and Lourdes Flores Nano (PPC) [Popular  Christian Party] argued the need to eliminate the habeas data  right.    The PPC legislators say it is unnecessary because the writ  of  amparo guarantees the right of rectification.    Henry Pease (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement], however, is  not  so radical. He proposes derogating just Paragraph 7 of the  constitutional article on habeas data which refers to the media  organizations.    Torres y Torres Lara conveyed his satisfaction over the  outcome of the committee hearing.</p>

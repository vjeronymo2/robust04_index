			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rasim Cerimagic: "A Hostage to His Own Greed"] </F>   [Text] The copy has become more clear than the original.  Tudjman has outdone his own ideal, and Milosevic has become  owner of not only the Serb souls but "the father of all Croats,"  too. Tudjman has become more of a Serb than Milosevic -- not  because he wants to, on the contrary. However, he was caught in  the net he and Milosevic had woven in Karadjordjevo, intending  it for Bosnia.    Like Milosevic, the leader of the Croats did not even  mention  the number one world event until his visit to the "friendly  state of Romania," during which he condescendingly stated that  the ultimatum may play a certain role in the Bosnian conflict,  but that the bombing of the Serb positions would lead to an  escalation of the war -- no less and no more than that. In  front of the entire international community, including the Serb  Orthodox mother Russia, Tudjman sides with the almost abandoned  Karadzic. The Croat leader has irretrievably become hostage to  Milosevic's stratagem and his own greed for the territory of  someone else's internationally recognized country. Paradoxical  or not, the fact is that he now has to save Milosevic by  defending his part of their joint plan -- wiping Bosnia off the  world political map. With the removal of the Serb artillery (by  hook or by crook) from the positions at the Sarajevo  encirclement, certain -- possibly crucial -- instruments of  dividing Bosnia in the way that the two had planned and carried  it out have been taken to pieces.    It took the international political and military giant two  years of unprecedented brutal killing of a small state and a  people -- the Bosniak one -- to move. Slow reactions are  characteristic of the internal logic of a huge mechanism.  However, once the machinery is started, it is constantly  accelerated and is difficult to bring to a standstill. Tudjman  feels that the end to the international community policy that  indifferently acknowledged new "realities on the ground" is  near. The ultimatum to the Serbs hangs over Croatian policies  in Bosnia as a heavy lead cloud, too. However, its president,  who has long ago put everything on one card -- the division of  Bosnia into two parts -- has gone too deep into its  blood-stained mire to be able to get out of it. This is why, in  a state of panic, he gave the statement in Bucharest.    Franjo Tudjman must do what is impossible: save the now  questionable job of breaking Bosnia in two, which is well under  way, while, with the new, changed attitude of the international  community, which has been getting into full swing of stopping  the bloodshed, avoiding economic sanctions or an ultimatum  similar to the Serb one. Another possibility is going a few  years back, breaking off the ghostly engagement with Milosevic,  and giving up on the so-called exclusive Croatia at the expense  of the neighboring Bosnia.    What he is going to opt for can best be discerned in his  program address to the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]  Presidency and HDZ representatives in the parliament. Those who  may still have had illusions or doubts were finally given a  first-hand answer to the question who the real creators or the  Croatian policies toward Bosnia are and who are the executors.  Tudjman did not directly respond to Miko Tripalo's [official of  the Croatian National Party] accusations, which said that three  years ago, he had arranged a dual division of Bosnia with  Milosevic, but said that, regarding Bosnia, he "carried out the  only possible policy," that he "anticipated and realized," and  that "our people in Herceg-Bosna and Boban and everyone else  carried out and will carry out this policy." He swung his  rhetorical sword before the parliament representatives and  pointed it even at the pope himself, reproaching him for the  desire for the establishment of a new community of the Southern  Slavs. Moreover, says Tudjman, "the pope claims that the cause  of all the evil in the present-day world is the exaggerated and  extremist nationalism, for which leaders rather than the people  are to blame, that nationalism has led to a new paganism -- the  deification of the state." In that context, Tudjman recognizes  himself. The pope supporting sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina and  expressing solidarity with its people who have suffered so much  suits his politics even less.    By imputing this to the Vatican, Croatia is losing its last  friend. It, therefore, seems that there is no going back for  Tudjman and Croatia. He has chosen the same loner's way as his  model Slobodan Milosevic. They are faced with the same future.  Disputed and isolated by the world, they will be each other's  only support and solace.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Opportunity knocks: The challenge awaiting Clinton's economic team It may all end in tears. But in these early days it is hard to suppress a sense of excitement about what the Clinton administration could achieve economically. The fact that the economic team was named first, ahead of foreign policy and defence posts, sends a strong signal that economics matters. So does the creation of an economic council within the White House of equal status to the National Security Council. Mr Bill Clinton seems determined that his administration never should not lose sight of the commercial and financial implications of decisions. With the cold war over, he senses that the principal challenges facing the US are now economic. He has a unique opportunity for correcting many of the policy mistakes of the past two decades. He inherits a promising economic outlook from President George Bush. The economy, having grown sluggishly for six straight quarters, now seems to be gathering momentum. Yet, thanks in part to the cautious policies of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, for the first time in a generation the US is also in striking distance of re-establishing stable prices. At the same time, after 12 years of budgetary gridlock in Washington, the same party at last controls both White House and Congress. There is an opportunity for action on many of the pressing problems facing the US, such as the need to raise savings and reform health care. Congress, moreover, appears to recognise the importance of addressing long-term structural problems such as slow productivity growth. One instant criticism of Mr Clinton's first round of economic appointments was that it included only one professional economist - Ms Alice Rivlin, of the Brookings Institution, who was named as deputy budget director. The two most senior posts go to congressional deal-makers: Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate finance committee, who was named Treasury secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta, the chairman of the House budget committee, who was named budget director. Wall Street investment banking was also well-represented with Mr Robert Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, named to run the new White House economic council, and Mr Roger Altman of the Blackstone Group, tapped as deputy to Mr Bentsen at Treasury. Three of the four men - Messrs Bentsen, Panetta and Rubin - are trained lawyers; Mr Altman has an MBA from the University of Chicago. Few industrialised nations put professional economists in top policymaking positions. Mr Clinton has sensibly opted to put politicians in political slots. If Mr Bentsen and Mr Panetta cannot get legislation through a Democrat-controlled Congress, it is doubtful anybody can. Both are respected on Capitol Hill, having been intimately involved in economic and budgetary policymaking for over a decade. Mr Rubin and Mr Altman are knowledgeable on economics and have the advantage over academics of bringing real-world experience of the constraints that financial markets can impose on even the best intentioned policies. Mr Altman also has government experience having served at the Treasury in the Carter administration. These were, in any case, only the first economic appointments. Mr Clinton yesterday named Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to head the Council of Economic Advisers. His old friend, Mr Robert Reich, who lectures in political economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, was named labor secretary. Other important announcements, such as trade representative and commerce secretary, will follow. There is scope for some tension among members of Mr Clinton's team. Mr Bentsen is likely to put greater emphasis on tax incentives for saving and investment than would Mr Panetta and Ms Rivlin, both of whom have reputations as deficit hawks. Mr Bentsen also has an unfortunate history of regarding the tax system as a mechanism for rewarding individual sectors, such as oil, gas and real estate. Once out of the Senate, however, he will no longer face political pressure to put sectoral interests above national ones. But neither Mr Rubin nor Mr Altman have policy axes to grind; both seem likely to serve as efficient implementers of administration policy. Mr Rubin, in particular, is seen as playing a co-ordinating role in economic policymaking analogous to that in foreign affairs of General Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security advisers. What the senior appointees have in common is more important than what divides them. They are all solidly in the political and economic mainstream; they believe in market forces, free trade and responsible fiscal policies. Fears that Mr Clinton would lurch to the left after the election thus appear unfounded. Indeed, this week it was the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, rather than Republicans, that voiced misgivings. The team seems likely to establish amicable relations with the Federal Reserve. Before the election Mr Clinton went out of his way to defend the Fed's independence in monetary policy. He recently invited Mr Greenspan to Little Rock to try to reach a mutual understanding on the economy. But what, it may be asked, has this conventional team of moderates got to do with the more radical ideas Mr Clinton outlined during the campaign? Are these the people to 'rebuild' the American economy, to oversee large new investments in education, training and infrastructure? There are two possible answers. The first is that Mr Clinton is a politician through and through. He said what he had to say to solidify Democratic support and defeat Mr Bush. Now that he has won he will drop many of the policies (and people) associated with the campaign. A more charitable interpretation runs as follows. Mr Clinton has conventional macroeconomic views and has always seen deficit reduction as one of the keys to higher national savings and improved productivity growth. He has thus named a macroeconomic team capable of reassuring financial markets and pushing tough deficit reduction legislation through Congress. But he has not forgotten the other, more radical part of his agenda. He does want to transform industrial skill training, invest more heavily in commercial research and development, and, perhaps, develop a more aggressive industrial policy. The principal players here are likely to include Ms Tyson at the CEA and Mr Reich at Labor. But by giving the most senior posts to moderates such as Mr Bentsen, an advocate of free enterprise, who will restore the Treasury's traditionally dominant role in economic policymaking, Mr Clinton is ensuring that the interventionists will not gain the upper hand. Mr Clinton, moreover, stressed again this week that he remains the chief economic decision taker. It will be his job to balance the conflicting demands of different agencies and departments. And while the administration has great opportunities to solve economic problems, it faces formidable challenges, some of which reflect Mr Clinton's own inconsistent campaign pledges. Mr Clinton wants to increase spending significantly on education, training, infrastructure and technology, reduce the burden of taxes on middle-income families and sharply reduce the structural budget deficit. Even if he manages to reduce the rate of growth of health care spending, he cannot achieve all these goals simultaneously. The hard bargaining has yet to begin.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>   [Text] Shanghai Petrochemical Co has shelved its plan to  adopt a tender system for selling its second tranche of new A  shares in China, says the lead underwriter. The head of  Shanghai International Securities' corporate finance division,  Ni Xinxian, said the sluggish market was contributing to the  change of heart by China's biggest petrochemical firm. "The  company and the underwriter have decided not to go ahead with  the proposal given the present market conditions," he said in  Shanghai. "The decision has nothing to do with the company's  fundamentals," he said. The China Securities Regulatory  Commission which was also involved in what would have been a  pioneering move in the country, agreed to the decision too, Mr  Ni said.    He said the shares earmarked for tender would not be issued  until next year. Whether the scheme would revive would depend  on market conditions, he said. But he did not say how the  shares would be issued if they were not allocated through  tendering.    Shanghai Petrochem's second tranche of 450 million shares  was  intended to be offered in two batches: 320 million shares were  to be allocated to A shareholders at 2.4 yuan (about HK$2.14) a  share and 130 million shares through tender. The tender system  has come about to address weaknesses in existing offering  systems for allocating A shares, such as an unlimited issue of  subscription forms and a share allocation linking allocations  with bank deposits. The former results in investors paying a  high cost for share purchases and the latter results in  subscription money long being frozen.    Mr Ni said the existing offering systems were a result of  the  underdeveloped banking system in China, which posed difficulties  in settling payment of initial public offers. However, it is  believed the falling stock market made it difficult to discover  the price of shares offered through a tender system. Potential  investors are reluctant to make offers for fears of further  falls. The continuous slump in the price of Shanghai  Petrochem's A shares also means that mainland investors can buy  cheap stocks already available in the market, and it is  unnecessary to use a tender to establish market interest.    The market price of Shanghai Petrochem had fallen below the  subscription price for shareholders. Petrochem's A shares  closed at 2.05 yuan on Friday, compared with 2.54 yuan in  mid-April and 5.76 yuan on its debut close on the Shanghai stock  exchange in November last year.    Concerns have also been raised over the feasibility of  importing the international tender practice to China. However,  Mr Ni said: "For a company such as Shanghai Petrochemical, which  has launched an H-share offer in Hong Kong under the  book-building system, we shouldn't have any worries."    The new initial public offering method comes at an  unfavourable time. The A share indexes on the country's stock  exchanges are sliding fast, offering no hope for the tender to  operate in an effective manner. An excess of new listings have  been a key factor in the market's slump this year, with large  counters such as Shanghai Petrochem suffering the most. Mr Ni  said the portion of 320 million new shares offered to  shareholders in April had been fully subscribed. But no  official announcement has been made on the level of  subscription. Shanghai Petrochem announced on Friday that the  share sale had been completed, and that 200 million shares would  be listed on June 20. The 200 million shares represent those  subscribed for by the public. The remaining 120 million shares,  subscribed for by company employees, would be listed on July 4.    Shanghai Petrochem offered 550 million new A shares last  year  following a $2.65 billion H-share offer in Hong Kong in July,  giving it a listing in the territory.</p>

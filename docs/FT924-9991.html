			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Hanson bid hinges on RHM response HANSON's advisers said yesterday the Anglo-US conglomerate was unlikely to enter a bidding war with Tomkins for Ranks Hovis McDougall unless information from the baking and grocery products group is deemed to be new. Morgan Grenfell, RHM's adviser, replied yesterday to an eight-page letter from Hanson's adviser, NM Rothschild, asking questions about RHM's business. Under Takeover Panel rules, RHM is obliged to pass on information given to Tomkins which is specifically asked for by Hanson. Hanson said it would study Morgan Grenfell's reply before deciding whether to increase its bid or walk away. The Anglo-US conglomerate last week saw its hostile Pounds 790m bid trumped by Tomkins' agreed bid. With Tomkins shares closing 11 1/2 p up at 223 1/2 p, its share offer values each RHM share at 258p. There is a cash alternative of 260p which values the ordinary shares at Pounds 935m, including Pounds 10m for the preference shares. Hanson said its offer of 220p for each RHM share was fair based on information it had at the time. Unless RHM has disclosed new financial material made available to Tomkins, which Hanson believes justifies Tomkins' higher bid, Hanson is expected to walk away. Hanson wants RHM both for financial and strategic reasons. The latter being its desire to create a core business centred around UK food products. However, a Hanson adviser underlined the conglomerate's determination not to 'overpay' if it decided RHM had not disclosed new information. According to an RHM adviser the reply to Hanson's request did not contain much new information. Meanwhile, Tomkins has revamped its presentation to institutional shareholders to try to answer reservations about its apparent change of direction into the food sector. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said: 'Some people have been concerned that we we will be re-rated as a food company. This is not true. We are a management company of mature businesses.' He said the new presentation provided more clues as to what Tomkins would do with RHM. Institutions oppose 'war', Page 22</p>

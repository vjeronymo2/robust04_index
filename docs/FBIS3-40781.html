The Rajya Sabha passed the bill, the Chief Election  Commissioner [CEC] and other Election Commissioners (conditions  of service) Amendment Bill, 1993, which replaces a presidential  order of October 1, this year. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill  last week.    Replying to a discussion on the bill, the minister of state  for law, justice and company affairs, Mr H.R. Bhardwaj,  justified the presidential ordinance and said the government was  willing to hold discussions on electoral reforms with all  political parties.    He said there were no political motives behind the ordinance  which was in accordance with constitutional provisions and the  supreme court directive.    Members belonging to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and  the  Janata Dal [JD] opposed the bill saying the government should  await the supreme court judgment on the issue and then bring a  comprehensive bill on electoral reforms.    The bill was passed by voice vote after amendments by  opposition members were negated.    Alternatively, the two parties suggested that the government  should accept the amendment moved by Mr S.P. Malaviya of the  JD(S) [Janata Dal-Samajwadi] to refer the bill to a select  committee till the supreme court gave its final verdict.    Mr Mohd Afzal (JD), however, supported the bill.    He expressed concern over reports that about one million  people in the capital were being divested of their voting rights  by the election commission by labelling them as foreign  nationals.    Mr Sukomal Sen (CPM) supported the bill to make the election  commission broad-based. He was, however, critical of the  election commission's directive to the West Bengal government to  issue photo identity cards to voters by next year.    Mr Chaudhary Hari Singh (Congress) said all members of the  commission should be of equal status and should enjoy parity in  service conditions.    Opposing the bill, Mr Triloki Nath Chaturvedi (BJP) said as  the matter was sub-judice, the government should not pass the  bill in haste.    He said though his party was in favour of a multi-member  election commission, the primacy of CEC should be maintained.</p>

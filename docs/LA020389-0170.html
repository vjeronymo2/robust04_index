			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRAN PLANS TO SEEK FOREIGN LOANS  </P> <P> Iran has reversed its policy of refusing to borrow from foreign banks as  another step toward rebuilding an economy devastated after eight years of war  with Iraq.  </P> <P> In an interview published in today's New York Times, Gholamreza Agazadeh,  Iran's minister of oil and mineral wealth, said that Iran would borrow for  revenue-producing projects and that such borrowing would not exceed $3 billion  over the next five years.  </P> <P> "In my country a big debate has gone on," he said. "Now we have decided the No.  1 priority in this country is reconstruction of the economy."  </P> <P> Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini banned such loans when he took power 10  years ago and established an Islamic government.  </P> <P> Recent changes in government policy, including a decision to reopen a natural  gas pipeline to the Soviet Union announced in December, reflected a decision to  pursue a more pragmatic approach to solving the country's woes, Agazadeh said.  </P></p>

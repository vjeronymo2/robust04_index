			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMY CARTER ON GULF AND ENERGY  </P> <P> "Sour grapes" Jimmy Carter thinks our country has the reputation of being the  world's warmonger.  </P> <P> If we had not maintained a strong military, the Russians would never have come  to the bargaining table. George Will, noted columnist, said that "the money  spent to fight the cold war was the best investment we ever made. It bought  freedom for millions of people." Lest Carter has forgotten, it happened during  President Reagan's tenure.  </P> <P> FREDERICK D. MULLEN, Upland  </P></p>

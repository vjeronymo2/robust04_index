			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Television The market's response to Thames Television's failure to win the Channel 5 licence is puzzling, not least the 3 per cent rise in Carlton Communications shares. True, Thames planned to roll out the new station in London. That was bad news for Carlton, as holder of the London weekday franchise, and LWT. Without a new competitor the available pool of advertising revenue will be split fewer ways. But television accounts for only a modest percentage of Carlton's profits. With television advertising revenue weak, the outlook for Carlton Television is far from cloudless. The 12 per cent slide in Thames shares follows a strong run on the assumption that the licence was in the bag. It is not certain, though, that Channel 5 was such a wonderful prize. Since Thames was the only bidder, it can only be assumed that the rest of the industry took a sceptical view. The company may be better off on the sidelines. That is little help in valuing Thames shares. Talk of a judicial review aside, Thames will be hard pressed to find a route back into mainstream broadcasting. Its interest in the satellite repeats channel UK Gold is promising but limited by the size of the satellite television audience. That leaves Thames as a programming producer of undoubted quality but unproven margins.</p>

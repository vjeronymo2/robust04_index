			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VON WYL'S FIELD GOAL LIFTS NO. 4 AUBURN  </P> <P> After a "fumblerooskie" play backfired on Florida State and helped Auburn tie  the score, Jim Von Wyl kicked a 38-yard field goal with two seconds remaining,  moving the fifth-ranked Tigers into the thick of the national championship race  with a 20-17 victory over the seventh-ranked Seminoles Saturday night.  </P> <P> Quarterback Stan White helped set up the winning kick with a fourth-down,  21-yard completion to Herbert Casey. After letting the clock run down to six  seconds, Von Wyl came on to kick his second game-winner of the year. Two weeks  ago, his 30-yarder beat Louisiana Tech, 16-14.  </P> <P> Stacy Danley tied the score, 17-17, diving over from the two with 3:47  remaining to cap a 57-yard drive that started after the blown "fumblerooskie."  </P> <P> Quarterback Casey Weldon put the ball on the ground for a lineman to pick up,  but it was Auburn's Walter Tate who covered it.  </P> <P> After Danley's touchdown, Weldon, who came off the bench to pass for 244 yards,  led the Seminoles back to the Auburn 37. But on fourth and five, Weldon was  grabbed by Ricky Sutton, stumbled backwards while trying to keep his balance  and finally fell for a 22-yard loss with 1:04 to play.  </P> <P> That led to Von Wyl's kick.  </P> <P> Auburn (5-0-1), which came back from a 17-7 halftime deficit, won on a Saturday  when two higher-ranked teams, No. 2 Miami and No. 3 Tennessee, were beaten.  Tennessee's 9-6 loss to Alabama was particularly important to Auburn, moving  the Tigers into sole possession of first place in the Southeastern Conference.  </P> <P> Florida State (4-2) had its national championship hopes dashed as Auburn  snapped a three-game losing streak in the series.  </P> <P> Weldon, who had passed for only 223 yards in Florida State's first five games,  entered the game late in the first quarter in place of starter Brad Johnson and  sparked the Seminoles to 17 second-quarter points.  </P> <P> Alabama 9, No. 3 Tennessee 6 -- Alabama came up with an unorthodox way to  generate some offense in the midst of a defensive struggle, and Philip Doyle  made it pay off.  </P> <P> The result was a 9-6 upset of No. 3 Tennessee Saturday at Knoxville, Tenn.  </P> <P> The offense came in the form of a blocked field-goal attempt with 1:35 left.  The ball bounced hard off the chest of the Crimson Tide's Stacy Harrison and  bounced 23 yards downfield to the Tennessee 37.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Doyle won it with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the  game, as time expired.  </P> <P> It was a big victory for Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, whose team improved to  3-3, 2-2 in the Southeastern Conference. Tennessee fell to 4-1-2 and 2-1-1.  </P> <P> The blocked field goal "worked out great for us," Stallings said. "It gave us  30 or 40 yards when we needed offense. It was great to get that. We hadn't made  that much in a while."  </P> <P> Tennessee had a nation-leading, 12-game unbeaten streak halted.  </P> <P> No. 17 Florida 59, Akron 0 -- The Gators (6-1), coming off a 45-3 loss to  Tennessee, bounced back with an easy victory over outmanned Akron at  Gainesville, Fla.  </P> <P> Quarterback Shane Matthews paced an offense that produced 595 yards, completing  20 of 32 passes for 283 yards and three touchdowns. Willie McClendon rushed for  105 yards and one score.  </P> <P> Akron (3-4-1) gained only 87 yards and didn't make a first down in the second  half.  </P> <P> Georgia 39, Vanderbilt 28 -- Garrison Hearst rushed for 127 yards and two  touchdowns and Joe Dupree and Andre Hastings connected on a 68-yard touchdown  pass play for the Bulldogs in an SEC game at Athens, Ga. The Bulldogs (4-3,  2-2) also got a 58-yard touchdown run from Larry Ware and John Kasay kicked  field goals of 38 and 48 yards. It was the 21st consecutive SEC road loss for  the Commodores (1-5, 1-3).  </P> <P> LSU 30, Kentucky 20 -- Harvey Williams rushed for a career-high 213 yards in 28  carries, scored on a 60-yard run, and caught a four-yard touchdown pass to lead  Louisiana State (4-2, 2-2) over the Wildcats (2-5, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La.  </P> <P> No. 18 Mississippi 42, Arkansas State 13 -- Randy Baldwin scored four  touchdowns in the first 19 minutes as Ole Miss (6-1) routed the Division I-AA  Indians at Oxford, Miss. The Rebels rolled up 495 yards, one shy of their  season high. They also ensured a second consecutive winning season, the first  time Ole Miss has accomplished that since 1970-71.  </P></p>

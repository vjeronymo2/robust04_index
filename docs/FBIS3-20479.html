As to the New Airport, Hong Kong Is Not the  Host, as Beijing Is Going To Have To Pay the Bill    At the Fourth Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin officially became  the general secretary [of the CPC Central Committee], whereupon  he asked the Central General Office to tell the the General  Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA to report on the  material sent by every daily paper to the Hong Kong press, as  well as that in the mainland press on Hong Kong and mainland  China. She Mengxiao [0152 1322 1321], deputy director and  secretary general [of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA], told me  that he had already complied with this. While She Mengxiao and  I both agreed that the general secretary's concern for reports  from outside and for our work in Hong Kong was good for our work  in Hong Kong, She told me that when Jiang Zemin had been  Municipal Party Secretary in Shanghai, he had also asked for  material on the Hong Kong and Macao Working Committee from a  certain Xu [6079], who was a deputy director of the General  Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA, and which Xu had  actually handled on his own without asking instructions from the  secretary general. In fact, the Working Committee provided on  its own initiative certain information and data in areas, such  as Hong Kong and outside political, economic, and cultural  matters, for reference by officials of mainland ministries,  commissions, and provincial and municipal party Committees. And  the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA specially published various  "references" for this purpose. When Jiang Zemin was Minister of  Electronics Industry, this Xu was a secretary to Vice Minister  [of Electronics Industry] Cao Weilian [2580 4850 1670], and had  later accompanied him as secretary when Cao Weilian came to the  Hong Kong Office of the NCNA as deputy director, and then had  been made deputy General Office director after Cao passed away.  As to Jiang Zemin's use of such connections at the time to get  material from the Working Committee, we were surprised. While  such methods were out of line with the party's organizational  principles, the matter was past and Jiang Zemin was now general  secretary so that, after She Mengxiao reported it to me, we  smiled wryly at each other, shook our heads, and said no more  about it. Before long, the Central General Office again issued  instructions to the Organization Department of the Hong Kong  Office of the NCNA, with Zheng Hua [6774 5478] [deputy director  of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA] telling me and several  other deputy directors at a meeting of the Working Committee  that Jiang Zemin had nominated Xu by name for director of the  General Office of the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA. This  greatly surprised us all, with one deputy director sighing that  "the general secretary is truly managing things in too great  detail to be so concerned about a mere general office director!"  While we all objected to this without being willing to take a  stand, I acted as a peacemaker to "preserve" the general  secretary's prestige, by telling Zheng Hua that "Liu Lin [0491  2651] (the General Office director) had best resign and let Xu  take his place." When Zhou Nan subsequently became the secretary  of the Working Committee, he immediately designated Xu to be  mostly in charge of sorting out the "material" about myself.  When I later heard about this, I could only sigh.    On 11 July 1989, when Jiang Zemin said at a meeting with the  Hong Kong members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and some  of the members of the Advisory Committee that "well water does  not intrude into river water [or we'll mind our business if you  mind yours]," which was taken unkindly in Hong Kong, someone  called it "a witticism [or proverb] about the tense China-Hong  Kong relations." We colleagues at the Hong Kong Office of the  NCNA commented among ourselves that: "How could he have said  this? This is likely to make people feel that they do not  understand Hong Kong's situation." As over 98 percent of  Hongkongers were Chinese, and Hong Kong was already facing a  reversion [to Chinese sovereignty], how could he treat  Hongkongers as outsiders, calling them "well water" standing  outside of the "river water" of the Chinese? During the 4 June  incident, the patriotic actions of Hongkongers could not be  regarded as "well water" intruding into "river water" as, even  if there was some intrusion, it was by a tiny minority. So how  could he consign the majority of his Hong Kong compatriots to a  hostile status? I guessed at the time that Jiang Zemin had  probably done so after hearing Li Hou and Lu Ping's report, and  accepting their inaccurate information and views.    But before long, there was another incident over Jiang  Zemin's comments about the new airport.    The British Hong Kong government's plan to build a new  airport was a huge construction plan, which grew into a major  incident in Sino-British political relations. Ji Pengfei had  once asked my view, to which I had replied that while British  Hong Kong had planned in the 1970s to build a second airport at  Ch'ihlachiao to replace the existing one, they had later shelved  the plan when they learned that we were going to recover Hong  Kong.    Then in 1986, when Hu Ying-hsiang and Li Chia-ch'eng had  proposed a plan even bigger than British Hong Kong's for  developing Tayu Mountain and the sea area west of Hong Kong  Island, by building a second airport and expanding the port  zone, it had died in embryo because the British Hong Kong  government did not support it. So the current British Hong  Kong's bringing up again of the so-called "rose garden" plan to  win popular support before its pullout and leave some cherished  memories for afterwards, as well as acting in the interests of  British firms before its pullout, was more out of political than  economic considerations, or at least equally weighted.    I said that in light of Hong Kong and even Mainland China's  economic growth, building a new airport and expanding the  seaside docks was necessary and, having done a preliminary  estimation of the investment possibilities, had found no major  problems. Based on British Hong Kong's past actions, there was  not much possibility of a purely government investment, so that  social funds would probably be used, to turn over some of the  project through bidding to commercial operation, which was also  the only way that British firms could benefit. Even with  complete government investment and the completion of the project  in eight years not at their announced HK$100 billion framework  but doubled to HK$200 billion, the British Hong Kong  government's recent years of budget surpluses and average growth  rates meant that as long as continued prosperity was maintained,  it would be possible to draw on an average of over HK$20 billion  a year. But it was guessed that the British Hong Kong  government would not act in this way. I told Ji Pengfei that I  had instructed the Policy Studies Department of NCNA's Hong Kong  Office to do a study, which I would send a report on to the  center before long.    But several days later, Jiang Zemin suddenly took a stand on  the building of the new airport in British Hong Kong at a  meeting with a group of Hongkongers, saying that "you are not  the host, as we are going to have to pay the bill," setting off  another wave of negative feeling in Hong Kong public opinion.  So I wondered: As they had already taken a stand and made a  decision, why had Ji Pengfei not told me about it in advance?    At the time, I wondered if Jiang Zemin's statement about the  "we" who would have to pay the bill referred to all Chinese  including Hong Kong's Chinese residents, or to simply the  mainland people or government? As the general secretary  recently had painstakingly separated Mainland China's "river  water" from Hong Kong's "well water," his current statement  about "we" left one feeling that he meant only the mainland  people or the Central Government.    This was also the general public response. If the "we" was  interpreted in this way, and the building of the new airport  created a future deficit, how would the the mainland people or  the Central Government "have to pay the bill," as it would  increase the burden on Hongkongers instead? It the general  secretary was using this angle to warn the British Hong Kong  government, he might have won the good opinion of Hongkongers.  But it was still necessary to wait for the situation to be  clarified: Would the British Hong Kong government take on the  whole project, not using social funds, which might be going  beyond its means to leave the SAR Government with a bundle of  debts and an unfinished project? The situation was not clear  at the time. So this talk of "paying the bill" was too soon,  obviously growing out of a mistaken confidence in the words of  his "advisors."</p>

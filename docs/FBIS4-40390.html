			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today  that North Korea must respect the treaty on non-proliferation of  nuclear weapons.    He said in an interview that he had information proving that  North Korea had prepared a statement on withdrawal from  International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the secretariat of  the agency has as yet received no similar official statement.    Kozyrev underlined that if North Korea violated the Non-  Proliferation Treaty, there would be no other way out but to  impose sanctions. Kozyrev pointed out that the sanctions must  be imposed gradually and be considered a last resort.    Kozyrev spoke in favor of an international conference  initiated by Russia so that China, Japan, Korea, Russia, the  U.S.A., France, Britain and other members of the UN Security  Council could make the issue clear for themselves since North  Korea had put forward a number of explanations of its position.    Kozyrev emphasized that North Korea must continue to  participate in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and observe the  conditions put forward by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

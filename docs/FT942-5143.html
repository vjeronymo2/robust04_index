			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: A whiff of short-term optimism - London About the only people smiling in the London stock market last week were the equity chartists who looked with quiet satisfaction as share prices collapsed and then with bored disdain when they rallied. But the chartists are not the only players in the market. There are now clear signs that some equity market participants are at least willing to take a more optimistic view on the prospects for a market recovery, albeit for the short term. The optimists may need to rein in their confidence a little. There cannot be too much reason for celebration while the June future contract on the Footsie, which did so much to drive the stock market ahead in its glory days, prefers to remain at a discount to the underlying equities. And it was the futures market that saw the business when the market rallied; trading volume in equities proper remained as unimpressive on the uptick as it had been on the way down. Any upset in Frankfurt or New York bond markets found a swift reaction in UK stock futures and then in share prices. It has become clear that the hike in key interest rates by the Federal Reserve has not resulted in the calmer global bond markets regarded as the platform for a genuine recovery in UK equities. Both S. G. Warburg and Strauss Turnbull draw attention to the impact on valuations of the equities in the wake of the latest sell-off, Warburg commenting that the failure of equities to yield any premium over index-linked gilts 'must be the cause of some concern'. The yield relative on conventional gilts has risen to 2.28, around the highest level since 1992. Until gilts settle down - and that requires similar moves in German and US bonds - UK equities must remain highly volatile and chances of a genuine recovery in jeopardy. Last week's bounce has sent investors searching for stocks likely to outperform in any recovery. The leisure sector in general has underperformed but traditionally responds to earnings momentum. Smith New Court, using a technique of seeking out shares on which market expectations and analysts' views are changing, has put the tape over leisure and hotel shares. Smith has rated the FT-SE 100 stocks from 1 to 100 in terms of changes in market share earnings estimates over the past three months - 100 being top of the list. Rank Organisation rates well at No 79 and Smith strengthens the case by predicting that there are further earnings upgrades ahead. Smith is prepared to overlook the recently strong outperformance in the stock. When the same technique is applied, shares in Forte come off less favourably with a rating of 50, although Smith says that analysts' share earnings estimates are trending slightly upwards. The shares have mildly (3 per cent) underperformed over three months so there is room for conjecture as to whether the estimates rating justifies the present share price or indicates that some recovery is due. Smith takes the more positive line.</p>

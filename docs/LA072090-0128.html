			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> OVERALL MARKET DOWN, BUT OIL ISSUES LIFT DOW  </P> <P> A late rally in oil company stocks drove blue chip issues into the plus column  Thursday, overcoming a spate of disappointing corporate earnings reports.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down about 20 at its mid-session low,  closed with a 12.13 gain at 2,993.81, again putting the index just short of the  elusive goal of 3,000.  </P> <P> But the broad market suffered: Declining issues outnumbered advances by about  4-to-3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 621  up, 858 down and 522 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 162 million shares,  down from Wednesday's 168.8 million.  </P> <P> Damage was heaviest in over-the-counter issues, where the NASDAQ composite  index lost 2.65 to 458.17.  </P> <P> "The oil stocks have led this rally back," said George Pirrone of Dreyfus Corp.  </P> <P> The oil stocks surge was prompted by rumors that Iraq might use force against  Kuwait in their dispute over production quotas. The Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries meets next week to discuss prices.  </P> <P> Texaco, Chevron and Exxon, all components of the Dow 30 index, gained 1 5/8 to  61 3/8, 1 1/2 to 76 3/4 and 1 1/2 to 50, respectively. Elsewhere, Mobil jumped  2 1/4 to 65 3/4, Arco added 1 3/4 to 125 1/2 and Unocal rose 1 to 30 3/8.  </P> <P> In the broad market, high-tech earnings disappointments hit that sector hard,  though bargain hunters entered late in the session.  </P> <P> Apple Computer was off 2 7/8 to 41 3/4 after dropping to a low of 40 on a  forecast by Apple's chairman that it would be difficult for earnings in the  quarter ending Sept. 30 to match those of a year ago.  </P> <P> Lotus Development also sank on a weak earnings forecast for the current  quarter, losing a substantial 6 1/8 at 25 1/8.  </P> <P> Traders were also cautious after Wednesday's comments on interest rates by  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. The Fed chief, in testimony to  Congress, said the central bank might lower interest rates further. But that  gave some investors reason to question the Fed's resolve to fight inflation.  </P> <P> Market highlights:  </P> <P> Among high-tech issues that plunged, Tandem Computers dropped 1 7/8 to 19 5/8  after the company reported profit for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30  cents a share, against 31 cents in the 1989 period.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in high tech, Compaq fell 1 to 63 3/8, Teradata dropped 1 1/2 to 26  1/2 and AST Research lost 1 3/4 to 23 3/4. Tandon lost 3/16 to 3 1/8, rallying  back from a low of 2-11/16 after its earnings report.  </P> <P> California bank and S&amp;L stocks were walloped on new fears of real estate  losses. HomeFed plunged 4 3/4 to 14 1/4, Ahmanson fell 1 to 20 7/8, CalFed lost  5/8 to 14 1/2, First Interstate sank 2 7/8 to 37 and Security Pacific lost 1  1/8 to 34 3/4.  </P> <P> New stock issue Modtech, the largest builder of modular classrooms in  California, went public at 10 and closed at 12.  </P> <P> U.S. Shoe fell 4 1/4 to 18 after saying its second-quarter earnings may be  below those of the year-earlier period.  </P> <P> American Ecology of Agoura Hills rocketed 2 to 10 1/4, continuing to surge on  Tuesday's strong earnings report.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks closed mixed. The 225-share Nikkei average closed up 7.51 at  33,055.62.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times stock index lost 14.7 to 2,387.3. In Frankfurt  the 30-share DAX index drifted 8.80 lower to 1,957.24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Mixed in Slow Trading  </P> <P> Bond prices finished narrowly mixed in light dealings in the wake of a big  slide Wednesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said there was little influential economic news, and prices remained  in a narrow range for most of the day as a result.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond lost 3/32 point, or about $1 per $1,000  in face value, after losing $8 on Wednesday. Its yield rose to 8.55% from  8.54%.  </P> <P> "The market is in a holding pattern," said Carl Napolitano, a market strategist  for R. C. Government Securities.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve moved late last week to nudge the key federal funds rate  down to 8% from 8.25%, and comments from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on  Wednesday indicated that a further easing is possible. But many traders remain  wary of the Fed.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate was quoted at 8%, up from 7.938% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dollar Drifts Down in Dull Session  </P> <P> The dollar ended mostly lower in lackluster trading, with little news to affect  the market, traders said.  </P> <P> "There's no real reason to buy or sell dollars," said Gabriele Schmitt, analyst  at Bank of New York.  </P> <P> The only market activity came from small traders taking profits, she said. "It  was one of those choppy days that didn't have much reason behind it," she said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 147.60 Japanese yen from 147.25 at  Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.00 yen. In New York, one  dollar bought 148.09 yen, up from 147.65 yen.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound fell to $1.8155 from $1.8205 late Wednesday. In  New York, one pound cost $1.8165, more expensive than $1.815 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pork Futures Drop Daily Trading Limit  </P> <P> Prices of frozen pork belly futures plummeted the 2-cents-a-pound permitted  daily limit for the second straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  reflecting bountiful supplies and slack demand for bacon.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, livestock futures ended mostly lower, energy  futures were mixed, grains and soybeans were mixed and precious metals  retreated.  </P> <P> Frozen pork bellies settled 2 cents lower across the board, with the contract  for delivery in July at 46.50 cents a pound and the more heavily traded August  contract at 44.42 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Weak consumer demand for bacon, which is made from pork bellies, has weighed on  the market for several weeks. The situation has been reflected in the narrowing  gap between prices of fresh bellies on the cash market and frozen ones on the  futures market.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the August contract for West Texas Intermediate oil rose 44 cents to  $18.99 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Rumors of  possible violence between Iraq and Kuwait helped, but prices also got a nudge  from technical factors, and from word that the flow of crude through the Alaska  pipeline was being reduced.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Martin Freeman] </F>   [Text] Two more countries are imposing travel restrictions  on people who use the British National Overseas (BNO) passport.  Latest figures from the government show that the number of  countries allowing visa-free access for short stays has dropped  from 72 to 70, as Austria and Spain join the ranks. The league  table of visa-free travel for Asian passport-holders now shows  Hong Kong slipping even further behind developed countries in  the region.    South Korean passport holders can travel without a visa to  82  countries worldwide, Malaysians to 86 destinations, and people  with Singaporean documents can go visa-free to 94 nations. UK  British passport holders can visit 128 countries without visas.    But Simon Vickers, principal assistant secretary for  security, said the situation was still "encouraging" and would  improve further once agreement with China was reached -- over  passport and right of abode -- due to Hong Kong travellers' good  reputations. The concern many countries had was over  "returnability" -- what happens if something goes wrong and a  traveller has to be sent back which could feasibly involve three  governments, Britain, Hong Kong and China, he told the  Legislative Council's subcommittee on nationality. "There is no  precedent for this in international law: Two sovereign states,  one responsible for right of abode, the other responsible for  the travel document," he said.    The Immigration Department was continuing efforts to gain  visa- free travel for BNO passport holders and wanted to make  the same representation on the proposed special administrative  region [SAR] passports which would be issued after 1997.  "Unfortunately, as you know, there has been little progress on  the talks on the proposed SAR passport through the Joint Liaison  Group on this," Vickers said. "We are behind time but we can  catch up," he said.    Legislators said the government should aim at countries  which  allowed visa-free travel to the territory's neighbours and  encourage those nations to lift restrictions on people  travelling from Hong Kong. A legislator, Howard Young, said:  "We should watch this like a hawk."    The Government is being inundated with applications from  people seeking the BNO document. A higher-than-expected number  of requests -- 298,815 -- came from the latest age group, those  born November 1962 and 1966, in the latest phase which closed on  March 31. About 84 per cent of those eligible had applied.</p>

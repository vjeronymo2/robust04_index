			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jiro Kokuryo, assistant professor, Keio </F> University Business School: "Pressing Need To Reconsider Rate  Structure"]    [Text] We are entering a period when we can expect to see  users throughout the world turn to multimedia communication  systems and distributed processing computer networks. Technical  discussion on this subject is often tinted in rosy colors. But a  business economics analysis shows that without fundamental  changes in Japanese telecommunications structure, it will be  useless to wait for the coming of the multimedia age in Japan.    In a NEW YORK TIMES special report, which appeared last  November, Japan was said to have already fallen considerably  behind the United States in networking. In a country without a  long acquaintance with keyboard culture, Japan's information  system is not only being held back by attempts to maintain the  status quo for telephone services but also by Japan's outdated  telecommunications system. Without reforming its current system,  attempts to lay optical fiber lines will be a waste of the  investors' money, and the dream of having high-speed information  networks will probably go unrealized. This writer would urge the  following reforms.  <H5>  Hampered by Old Ways </H5>   First, current telephone charges are based on a meter-rate  system, which adds sharply to the cost of longer calls. This  system is the first thing that has to be revised. Otherwise the  system, as it exists, is hardly suitable for the transmission of  large amounts of data. The ISDN [integrated services digital  network] charge, for example, for sending 90 seconds of  high-resolution images (at an estimated 10 megabits per second),  using the conversion rate for 64 kilobits per second per  telephone line, would run up a bill of 47,000 yen. Even if the  amount of information were cut down to one-tenth of this by  reducing the quality of the resolution, it would still cost  4,700 yen and cannot compete with videos. We can hardly expect  the multimedia age to come to us with this sort of fee structure.    Second, it is necessary to do away with fencing policies  that  divide the field along regional, city, service, and  international lines to prohibit territorial crossovers. In the  United States, the ability of businesses to cross over regional  lines has encouraged the diversification of services and the  lowering of fees. Regional fencing in Japan has the opposite  effect, protecting NTT's monopoly and obstructing the entry of  competition into high-level services where communication has to  be controlled from start to finish.    Third, abolishing restrictions on the resale or leasing of  lines (connections between private and public lines) should also  be considered. Use restrictions, besides reducing the incentive  to develop ways to apply new technology, serve as deterrents to  developing a rich array of telecommunication services through  competition.    Linked to the fact that the Japanese have fallen behind in  the use of communication networks is the failure of domestic  equipment manufacturers to develop suitable products for the  market. It is symbolic of this failure that all of the network  equipment for communication services known as "frame relays"  that have been introduced in the last year or two are  foreign-made. The problem isn't that Japan is technically weak.  Rather, unlike the United States, where products are actively  developed to meet actual demand, in Japan, the development of  new products has to meet "projected" demand. But that sort of  demand may not materialize under the type of restrictions and  fees that currently exist. The problem is not limited to the  telecommunications industry or to telecommunications equipment.  The lack of progress in developing distributed processing  information networks will probably hamper the efforts of  Japanese enterprises trying to recover their competitiveness  through downsizing and reengineering. For the telecommunications  industry, too, this failure has become an important factor in  its falling behind in the competition among carriers that are in  the process of globalizing their operations.    Under the protection of the postwar years, the  telecommunications industry has led a life far removed from  international competition. But, as will be shown, in the age of  multimedia and distributed processing, global competition will  be a necessary fact of life. The day is nearing when dramas  played overseas -- the struggle between British  Telecommunications (BT) and American Telephone and Telegraph  Company (AT&amp;T) over entering each other's domestic market or  the  tie-up between BT and MCI of the United States -- will be  replayed on Japan's shores. No longer about international  territory, global competition has already moved into an age when  the struggle will be over entering another country's domestic  communications market. One can safely say that neither Japan's  administrative agencies nor those in the telecommunications  business are prepared to respond to this trend.    The activities of global telecommunications companies in  Japan have not gathered a great deal of general interest because  regulations limit their services to data communications, and at  the present time, they cannot handle voice communications (i.e.,  telephone services). But their packet communications technology  is considered the forerunner of technology known as Asynchronous  Transfer Mode [ATM], used for switching equipment. This  technology is said to be central to communications in the 21st  century. Functionally, these companies already have the  technology to make voice services possible and will be able to  realize multimedia networks that combine voice, image, and text  data. They are working out a system, including a system of fixed  charges, that users will find easy to use. Regulations that  would restrict these companies, especially in the United States  and England, were done away with long ago.    This writer would basically welcome the changes that foreign  carriers would bring to Japan. Their entry would probably lower  communication charges while providing users with a greater  diversity of services and serve as an impetus to the high-level  use of networks. Rather, the problem is with the administration  and an industry that tries to maintain the status quo. If things  are left as they are, Japanese industries as a whole will be  left behind other advanced nations in the information  revolution, losing their global competitiveness, and in the  short run, bear the seeds of new trade friction.  <H5>  The Age of Distributed Processing </H5>   Here, a short description of leading trends in the  multimedia  field may be helpful.    News reports about major trends in the telecommunications  industry focus on the growing use of distributed processing  computer networks and, along with this, the growing use of  computer networks as communication tools. Because the price of  smaller computers has gone down dramatically just as there have  been marked improvements in their capabilities, there has been a  move away from the kind of centralized processing of information  that was done primarily by large computers and mainframes toward  its distribution to personal computer workstations and smaller  computers. There has been a rapid conversion toward distributed  processing, where only necessary information is passed on and  exchanged through workstations. The distributed processing  system has broken through the limitations of centralized  processing, making it possible to expand greatly one's data  processing capabilities with only a small investment of money.  Able to be used for "on-the-spot" system development and for a  system that matches one's particular needs, it has also become a  powerful reengineering tool for corporations.    In distributed processing, since the system is being  designed  so that computers set up in various locations can communicate  with other computers, information can be processed as it is  being exchanged; therefore, it is an excellent communications  (media) tool. In U.S. workplaces, local area networks (LAN)  linking workers, each with a personal computer on his or her  desk, are used in communicating through such means as electronic  mail, facsimile, and voice mail (multifunction answering  machine) and are starting to get popular in Japan, too. As far  as distributed processing networks are concerned, multimedia has  become a real possibility.    A characteristic of communications based on this kind of  computer network is that nearly every network function will be  carried out by equipment in the office rather than by the  telephone company's switchboard. We are in the process of moving  from a centralized network system to a distributed processing  network system. The telephone company's role will merely be that  of maintaining and servicing its cable lines. All other advanced  functions will be carried out at [computer] terminals. An  important point for such telephone companies is that these  terminals in most cases will be provided, not by themselves, but  by equipment manufacturers. Telephone companies, their services  reduced to "wiring," a term which is used by the telephone  companies, are afraid that their value-added services will flee  into other hands. Carriers in every country, fearful of losing  revenue, have come out of their offices to adopt a strategy  which transcends existing jurisdictions and national boundaries  to cover advanced communication needs from start to finish.  Cases in point are the purchases by American regional telephone  companies of cable television companies in other regions and  BT's global enterprise communications service. The pressure is  building to break down regional fences.  <H5>  Rate Structure To Encourage Use </H5>   Another characteristic of distributed processing networks  has  to do with their fee structures. Generally, almost all  communication networks have fixed costs that are passed on to  users according to some kind of formula or method of allocating  these costs. In Japan, during the age of centralized processing,  the basis for allocating costs was time and distance -- the time  on a "switch" [device used to transmit and route data] and the  distance between them. Today, with distributed processing,  however, this switching ability exists in the user's office,  making it meaningless to base charges on time and distance. With  the technology employed for distributed processing -- the use of  fiber optics and packet switching -- distance is not such an  important factor in determining transmission costs, and it has  become meaningless to impose charges on the basis of distance.    Thus, what is becoming more and more popular is a system of  fixed charges or some variation of that. Fixed-charge systems  are set up to allow unlimited use of a network for a fixed  charge, thus encouraging a high-level of use of information  systems. This idea of fixed charges is not new. Until 1971,  Japan had a system of fixed charges for calls made within city  limits. In the United States, a system ofintra-city fixed  charges is employed in many areas. To think that the meter-rate  system is the one and only arrangement possible would be hasty.    In Arlington, a suburb of Boston where this writer lived for  two years, residents had the option of fixed rates, enabling  them to call anywhere within the city or neighboring areas  (including Boston) as much as they wanted for the set charge of  $29.29. For this writer, this meant being able to call up the  computer at Harvard University, from home and to send  electronic mail anywhere in the world. It also meant being able  to make connections to computers at Massachusetts Institute of  Technology and other universities without any additional charge.  This writer's monthly phone bill, on average, came to about  3,100 yen for the equivalent of about 2,400 minutes on the  phone. In Japan, on the other hand, for a connection between  Tokyo and the neighboring city of Kawasaki, callers would have  to pay a basic charge of 1,550 yen along with an additional  16,000 yen for the call, for a total of 17,550 yen.    This doesn't mean, however, that calls within city limits  are  necessarily cheaper in the United States and higher in Japan.  Japan's rate structure is clearly more favorable for shorter  calls. The problem is that, for users who want to transmit a  large volume of data, a necessity in multimedia, the fee  structure in Japan is very onerous. If this fee structure  reflected true costs, there might not be anything that could be  done about it. In today's age of distributed processing,  however, the existing fee structure has lost its meaning, and  maintaining it will only stand in the way of users.    Relaxing restriction on the resale or leasing of circuits is  an important basis for a system that hopes to correct its fee  structure and encourage providers to cross over into new  territories, disregarding existing fences which mark off city,  regional, and national boundaries. Specifically, it is necessary  to deregulate the connections, or hook ups, between private and  public services. In the telecommunications industry, there are  public services that are comparable to buses, an example of  publicly owned, public (mass) transportation, and there are  private services that are comparable to chartered buses. The  business of leasing out private lines is like the business of  setting up scheduled tours, using buses chartered from the bus  company.    Connecting public and private services, then, is like  setting  up a tour that uses both chartered buses and regular (publicly  accessible), scheduled airline flights. That such tours (at  least, in regard to voice services) are not recognized is a fact  of life in Japan and a major deterrent to the development of  diverse services. To continue with our analogy, the tour  business would fold if one of the conditions for a tour was that  everything up to [but not including] the planes that were used  had to be chartered.    Doing away with regulations regarding the leasing of private  lines would be a valuable step for those in the  telecommunications industry who hope to regionally expand their  services and, without the confusion over ownership rights to  telephone lines and facilities within city limits, will make it  possible for them to quickly develop advanced services covering  large areas. In fact, in the data communications field, where  deregulation has been occurring, powerful carriers like BT and  AT&amp;T have sent in their globalizing forces and are leasing  services here, in Japan, too. Not only are fees below those  charged for public services offered by the telephone companies  in the past, a savings due to the development of technology  which makes use of circuits with greater efficiency; with a  fixed-rate system, an alternative is being offered that better  matches the needs of high-volume system users. Symbolic of what  is happening is the fact that AT&amp;T-JENS is leasing services  connecting users to local area networks at a cost four times  lower than the fees charged domestically by NTT. Internet and  other U.S. "information highway" networks as well as other  foreign carriers are in the process of expanding their presence  in Japan as fixed-rate, leased services.    In Japan, the resale or leasing of private lines--something  which introduces competition into the telecommunications service  area and brings about diversity as well as lower costs--is  strictly regulated. In the United States and England, this type  of restriction was quickly done away with; in Japan, where such  restrictions still exist, they have become barriers to the  development of advanced services by foreign carriers and to new  businesses entering Japan's domestic market. What would be  desirable is for restrictions on the leasing of private lines to  be relaxed as soon as possible and for the situation to exist  where foreign and domestic companies compete regardless of  existing fences. In this article, major problems standing in the  way of these things happening have been discussed in terms of  the telecommunications administration's fencing policy, which  divides the industry by regional, city, and national boundaries  and prohibits businesses from crossing over into each other's  territory. This policy may have been appropriate for Japan's  old, centralized telephone network. But it is clear, from the  above discussion, that it hampers competition and technological  progress in an age of global, distributed networks.  <H5>  Reform Is Essential </H5>   Unlike other major countries that are revamping rate  structures and outdated telecommunications systems built on a  telephone-based concept of communications, Japan has stuck to  its old ways, unable to discard either its existing rate  structure or its outdated telecommunications system. If Japan  retains these old ways, the multimedia age will be a long time  in coming. Adjusting the ISDN rate structure to the existing  telephone rate structure may be a good way to preserve the old  order, but like a wall, it blocks the way to a new era. And it  will have serious repercussions for the competitiveness of every  Japanese company.    The kind of system reform that has been discussed here will  inevitably profit some businesses and hurt others, and it calls  for some tough decisions for government administrators. It may  even call for a political solution. But the type of reform that  has been advocated here is, for Japan's future, necessary and  essential.</p>

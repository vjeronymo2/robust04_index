			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel M. Syrtlanov under the rubric </F> "Military Reform: In the Air Forces of Commonwealth Countries":  "The Virgin Skies of Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Judging by the constructive solutions to economic  and social issues, the Republic of Kazakhstan intends to make  intelligent use of its skies as well. The first steps in the  emergence of the national army already testify convincingly to  the steadfast attention that is being devoted in the republic to  the formation of their own air forces. This process is being  conducted on the basis of the realities of the current day and  experience that has been obtained--both their own and that of  the leading aviation powers of "near" and "distant" foreign  lands--and is, most importantly, figured for the long term.    "We have to solve difficult problems in the course of  military reform. But knowing my people, I am convinced that we  can manage it," was the opinion of the first commander-in-chief  of the Air Forces in the history of the resurrected nation,  Deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan for  Aviation Major-General of Aviation A. Volkov. At the beginning,  you will agree, faith in oneself and one's subordinates is a  factor of no small importance in achieving success. Recall what  is happiness for a commander--when you rise up to attack and  don't have to look around.    There is another circumstance deserving of respect that  cannot fail to be mentioned when analyzing the process of  military reform in the republic as a whole. Having gained the  genuine right to sovereignty, Kazakhstan has not rushed to  affirm itself at a forced pace with the break-up of old  structures or the complete rejection of the gains of the past.  Everything that is valuable and useful has been taken up here  with the zealousness of the far-sighted master. Taking into  account the fact that they had to begin the creation of their  own armed forces in parallel with defining the "outlines" of the  future military doctrine and the conceptual framework for  military organizational development, this stance appears to  correspond the most to common sense.    The Air Forces of the republic will include units and  subunits of bomber, fighter/bomber, fighter, reconnaissance,  transport and army aviation from the composition of the Air  Forces of the former USSR. The Ministry of Defense of the  Republic of Kazakhstan, in accordance with that decision, has  already worked out the principles for the creation of the  services dealing with pay, food and clothing, and has thought  out ways of upgrading the aircraft inventory in the future. On  the agenda are making the structure of the Air Forces more  efficient, concluding agreements for the delivery of combat  hardware and its repair, and interaction with other nations of  the CIS that have signed the "Collective Security" Treaty. Then  it will obviously be possible to discuss the training of  national cadres for the Air Forces.    It would be incorrect, by the way, to assert that the  difficulties of an economic nature that have come up in all the  republics of the former USSR have bypassed Kazakhstan. But here  they have been able to overcome the evil costs of the stagnant  order despite everything.    Life sometimes dictates its own terms when determining the  expediency of this or that solution. When it was necessary to  replace engines that had used up their service lives on some  combat aircraft, they had to make barter deals with the Air  Forces of a neighboring republic that at the time had an acute  need for airfield servicing and support vehicles. One need not  be an authority on marketing to define something like that, I  would say, as vulgar entrepreneurship in the sphere of military  organizational development. But where do you go if there is no  other way out, and one is not seen in the foreseeable future?    The problems being discussed are far from simple ones.  Deliveries of assemblies and spare parts, as well as fuel, have  been cut back as a result of the disruption of production and  other ties. While they are getting out of the situation somehow  with parts, the lack of fuels sometimes forces them to plan  flight shifts only in amounts that barely support the  maintenance of the proper level of training proficiency of the  crews.    The question of manning many aviation units and subunits  with  personnel remains unresolved. The chief of staff of the Air  Forces of the republic, Major-General Yu. Shanin, who has served  15 years in Kazakhstan, elaborated that certain military  collectives have a shortfall of officers of roughly 10 percent,  and of warrant officers of up to 30 percent. Add to that about  seven hundred in line to obtain housing, and it becomes clear  how important it is to maintain those people with a good word,  to demonstrate concern for them. We can thus understand the  commander of the Air Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan,  Major-General of Aviation A. Volkov, who has been looking after  the social protections of the servicemen and inveighing for an  expansion of housing construction at the aviation compounds  since the first day he took up his position.    Even in Moscow before my departure on the trip, I read in a  newspaper about the supposedly oppressed situation of the  Russian-speaking population living in the republics of Central  Asia. I do not know about elsewhere, but Kazakhstan does not  deserve such a frankly provocative reproach. Dispassionate  statistics confirm, on the contrary, that the republic must  provide for an influx of specialists of the indigenous  nationality into the army even today. It is one thing that the  local youths used to enter the military schools or  warrant-officer schools unwillingly. It is another thing--and  this must finally be frankly acknowledged--that even those who  linked their fate with military service rarely received the  right to serve in their own land, and even more rarely had the  opportunity to make a military career. Even though the zealous  attitude of Kazakhs to the fulfillment of their service  obligations is well known to all, some had to share with them  the burden of military service.    I want to be understood correctly. The attraction of Kazakh  youth to take part in the defense of their homeland is not an  end in itself. The presence of national cadres not only in the  Air Forces, but first and foremost in them, will sooner or later  ensure the stability of the military policy of Kazakhstan and  eliminate the negative consequences of migration processes,  which have already started whether we like it or not. Whence the  tasks of military-patriotic indoctrination of the youth and  propagation of the combat traditions of their countrymen that  are being advanced to the command of the units and subunits by  Minister of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan  Colonel-General N. Nurmagambetov. The leadership of DOSAAF,  which is continuing to devote the most steadfast attention to  the development of air clubs, also sees a role for itself in  this important cause.    Yes, when gathering the first harvest, one must already be  thinking about tomorrow--so as to cultivate worthy successors to  the aviation glory of the republic, successors to front-line  soldier and two-time Hero of the Soviet Union Talgat Begeldinov  and other aces of military times.    The considered approach of the leadership of the republic to  the realization of the program of military reform confirms that  the upturned virgin lands of the Kazakh skies, protected by  mighty wings, will provide good shoots without fail.</p>

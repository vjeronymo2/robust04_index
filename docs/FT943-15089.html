			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Alitalia flights again disrupted Alitalia, Italy's state-controlled airline, yesterday suffered its third big day of disruption in less than a week, as unions protested against imposition of a tough restructuring plan on the loss-making national carrier. Originally an all-out strike was called by the main unions covering flight personnel and ground staff. But Mr Publio Fiori, transport minister, on Sunday invoked special powers that oblige operation of minimum services. This meant Alitalia could operate 55 per cent of planned domestic flights, 65 per cent of short-haul international flights and 83 per cent of inter-continental flights. On Sunday Alitalia took the unprecedented step of placing advertisements in the national press apologising to passengers under the headline: 'Thousands of passengers cannot fly - why?' A letter was sent to employees in the name of Mr Renato Riverso and Mr Roberto Schisano, respectively chairman and chief executive, pointing out there was 'no alternative to the restructuring and in no form can we give up this objective'. Negotiations on the restructuring, which envisages loss of up to 4,000 of the compay's 18,000 jobs, were broken off last week by the unions in advance of their strike call. On Tuesday and Wednesday last week wildcat strikes were called by Sulta, a militant trade union, which was formed last year and was not included in the talks. Some talks are to resume tomorrow with the main unions, but at least two more strikes have been called later in the month.</p>

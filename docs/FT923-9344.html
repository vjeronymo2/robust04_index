			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: EC makes new offer in oilseeds dispute THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday offered the US a fresh compensation package to settle a long-standing conflict over EC subsidies to oilseed crops like soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds. A senior US official said the meeting had ended inconclusively. 'There has been some evolution in the EC position, but their revised offer is still well below the level that would be necessary to address the impairment to US farmers,' he said. Both sides say they are willing to meet again, but no dates have been set. Details were being kept secret. However, the package is understood to contain some compensation on corn imports, which would be of direct benefit to US oilseed farmers, who claim they have lost billions of dollars of exports to the EC because of its subsidy regime. Yesterday's negotiations in Geneva come less than a week after Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, met Mr Edward Madigan, US agriculture secretary, in an effort to defuse a potentially explosive farm trade conflict. Fears have mounted of a wider trade war, particularly following the failure of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Munich a month ago to make a breakthrough in the deadlocked Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. The US set an August 18 deadline for settling the oilseeds dispute, and is threatening to impose punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of EC agricultural exports if its oilseeds subsidy regime is not reformed. The list includes wine, cheese, biscuits, gin, liqueurs and tobacco. A US official said yesterday he doubted whether the dispute would be resolved ahead of the deadline. The oilseeds dispute arose almost five years ago, when Washington complained that EC subsidies contrary to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) cut into benefits the EC had granted in 1962 when it agreed to allow oilseeds in duty-free. An independent Gatt dispute panel has twice declared the subsidies unjustified. For its part, the EC has insisted that US exporters have lost ground to third world exporters rather than because of the subsidy regime. Even now, it refuses to dismantle the regime, instead offering to compensate the US and other oilseed exporters - an option open to it under Gatt rules of dispute settlement. The EC's previous offer was rejected last month.</p>

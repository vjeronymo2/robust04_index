			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs mixed The regional electricity (recs) stocks came under substantial selling pressure in midsession but began to pick up during the late afternoon as rumours concerning the distribution review, due to be announced this morning, circulated in the market. Shares in the recs rocketed last week as the market picked up hints that the review would be much more lenient to the companies than had previously been expected. Dealers said the late surge saw stock being taken aggressively from the inter-dealer broker screens, but they warned that much of the expected good news, as far as the market was concerned, was already in prices of the recs. They did, however, expect a burst of switching activity among the 12 recs after the review news is made public. Utilities specialists said the market had already factored in an average price reduction of 15 per cent plus a price formula giving the companies price rises of inflation minus 3 to 4 per cent. 'The review will have to produce something exceptional to trigger any further big gains in the short term,' said one specialist. However, there were suggestions late yesterday that the price formula could come in as low as inflation minus 2 per cent. If so, analysts predicted a further series of strong rises in the sector. Eastern Electricity was an exception to the general rule, making good progress throughout the day to close 5 higher at 709p after strong buying interest from the US.</p>

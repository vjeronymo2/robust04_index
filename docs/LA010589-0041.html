			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> NEW OWNER'S JITTERS? MORE TURN TO HOME WARRANTIES  </P> <P> If you're buying or selling a home this year, you might feel more secure if the  house were covered by a home warranty, a one-year plan that covers mechanical  things that could break down just after you've bought or sold it.  </P> <P> With a warranty plan that will cost between $245-$295, for example, you might  save $3,500 on a furnace bill, $1,400 for repair of an oven/stove or $375 for a  new water heater.  </P> <P> Almost unheard of a few years ago, home warranty plans are becoming  increasingly popular with buyers and sellers across the country. And some  companies will renew the warranty on a year-by-year basis after the initial  plan expires.  </P> <P> Californians are tuning in on the warranty plans in a big way, too. During the  first two quarters of 1988, almost 42% of the homes being sold in the state  were covered by a home warranty, according to statistics from the Santa  Monica-based Home Warranty Assn. of California (HWAC), established in 1985.  </P> <P> About 110,000 home warranty contracts, valued at $32.6 million, were sold in  the state through June of last year. That's a 24% increase over the number sold  during the same period in 1987.  </P> <P> "I definitely advocate them to a lot of my clients," Long Beach realtor Peter  Lowes said. "Whether they're buying residential or income property, it gives  them peace of mind for at least 12 months for a deductible of $35 to $50. And  the policy itself averages about $245 for a single-family residence. For an  extra $110, you can get the spa or pool covered, too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Optional Add-Ons  </P> <P> Depending upon the warranty company, you may also get the air conditioner,  washer and dryer or pool heater covered by warranty for an added fee.  </P> <P> "It's just additional protection and benefit to the seller or buyer," Lowes  added. "Either the seller or buyer can purchase the warranty, or they can do it  50-50. Or realtors can purchase one as a negotiating tool for the home they're  selling or as a closing present to the buyer. But people should absolutely read  the fine print of the policy to make sure they know what's being covered."  </P> <P> For one thing, don't confuse a home warranty plan with homeowner's insurance.  Home warranties mostly cover problems with a home's heating and cooling  systems, plumbing, electrical and appliances -- such as water heaters, stoves,  ovens, dishwashers and disposals. If you've got water damage from a leaky roof  or had a fire, theft or vandalism, a home warranty doesn't help you. You'll  have to check with your homeowner's insurance.  </P> <P> "They certainly have a place in the market, but I don't think they're for  everybody," said Mary Jane Ludwig, a realtor with Fred Sands/Marina del Rey.  "I've used them a couple of times with clients purchasing on a shoestring.  Financially, they've plunked down every dime to buy the house, and if an  emergency would come up, they wouldn't have the extra cash to pay for it. But  people who are fairly affluent aren't going to get involved in that."  </P> <P> Ludwig said that she apprises her clients of the availability of home  warranties, and gives them literature about them. But she doesn't personally  recommend any specific company.  </P> <P> There are about 10 companies in California that sell home warranties; six are  members of the Home Warranty Assn. of California. But all are regulated by the  California Department of Insurance.  </P> <P> According to an association spokeswoman, an average of 1.2 claims were paid on  each home warranty contract sold in California in 1987, "significantly higher  than the average number of claims per policy paid by other industries regulated  by the state insurance department." Claims can range from a simple repair to  replacement of a major appliance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agent's Protection  </P> <P> The firms that sell warranty plans in Southern California are American Home  Shield, the state's largest company, based in Santa Rosa; First American Home  Buyers Protection Co. in Van Nuys; Buyers Home Warranty Co. in Burbank, and Old  Republic Home Protection Co. in Irvine.  </P> <P> "I've had pros and cons from clients (about home warranty plans)," Ludwig said.  "One customer in particular felt there was so much in the fine print in terms  of exclusions that the policy wasn't very helpful. But on the other hand, if  you're talking on the basis of a water heater or furnace breaking down, a  warranty can save you money. Some agents have been using them for fear of  lawsuits -- people who just sue at the drop of a hat -- or for extra caution.  But I think they are mostly for people, buyers and sellers, who want to take a  conservative approach."  </P> <P> If you're considering taking out a home warranty plan, you should do some  comparison shopping. One company may cover stoppages in drain lines; another  may not. So you should make a detailed inquiry about every item that will be  included in your warranty.  </P> <P> The companies that issue home warranties do not do inspections, but issue  coverage on the basis of the written disclosures and home inspections that are  standard practice in home resale transactions.  </P> <P> Thus, if the seller is dishonest about something in the house, the home  warranty company generally will not repair it if it is found to be a  pre-existing condition or if it is an item that was broken before the policy  went into effect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Repairs, Not Upgrades  </P> <P> "A warranty company will not upgrade bootlegged wiring in your house," said  Phil Branson, president of First American Home Buyers Protection Co. and a  former president of HWAC. "We're in the problem business and we fix things, but  we're not in the fixer-upper business."  </P> <P> And according to Branson, industry statistics show that "it's during that first  year (of ownership) that things really go wrong."  </P> <P> California home warranty companies offer their clients a toll-free telephone  number to call for repair service. The company will send a repairman to service  the item or replace it. The client pays the standard deductible of $35 to $50.  The companies also offer 24-hour emergency service for homeowners with warranty  plans.  </P> <P> "This (warranty plans) helps realtors, too, because they don't get the phone  call that something is wrong at the house. We do," Branson explained. "And it  gives the consumer a company to talk with if there is a problem. If they're not  satisfied with the work that's been done and they don't get results from  talking with the company, they can then go to the Consumer Affairs department  of the Department of Insurance. It's really an added protection for the  consumer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hire Inspector  </P> <P> Branson said his advice to people buying homes is to get their own inspector in  addition to the one the seller has employed to survey the home. "Have him check  the structural integrity of the house before you buy it," he said. "Whatever  the cost of the house is, it's worth it to spend a few hundred dollars on your  own inspector.  </P> <P> "Then walk through the house prior to the close of escrow and run all these  things -- start the garbage disposal, the furnace, the dishwasher," Branson  continued. "Test all the systems. I tell people they shouldn't be shy. They're  the ones buying the house. Then insist on a warranty. If you make all that  little added effort, you've protected yourself as well as you can."  </P></p>

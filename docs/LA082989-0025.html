			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINDEXTER CONSPIRACY CHARGE NARROWED  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday granted a government request to narrow a conspiracy  charge in the Iran-Contra indictment against former National Security Adviser  John M. Poindexter.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Harold E. Greene agreed to drop allegations of a conspiracy  by Poindexter and others to illegally divert funds to the Contras from the  Ronald Reagan Administration's secret arms sales to Iran.  </P> <P> Remaining in the indictment are allegations that Poindexter conspired to  obstruct Congress, make false statements and destroy official documents in the  Iran-Contra scandal. His alleged co-conspirators were former White House aide  Oliver L. North and businessmen Richard V. Secord and Albert A. Hakim. North  enlisted Secord's help in supplying arms to the Contras during a congressional  ban on military aid to the rebels.  </P> <P> Poindexter also is accused of two counts of obstruction of Congress and two  counts of making false statements to Congress. Those counts also relate to  denials that North was assisting the Contras.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE OFFICER OUT OF INTENSIVE CARE  </P> <P> After three months under intensive care, injured Costa Mesa Police Officer  Robert Baumgardner was transferred to an ordinary hospital room Friday, just in  time for Christmas.  </P> <P> "He's talking. He's talking up a streak," said his wife, Sally Gene  Baumgardner, who has spent most of the three months waiting outside the  intensive care unit of Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Until recently,  Baumgardner had been unable to speak and had communicated by pointing to  letters on an alphabet board.  </P> <P> The release from intensive care is a major victory for the 39-year-old  motorcycle officer, who was struck by a car while writing a routine traffic  ticket in September and has been fighting his way back to life ever since.  </P> <P> Baumgardner, who suffered numerous broken bones and other injuries, followed by  pneumonia and other respiratory complications, was slowly weaned from  life-support systems last week.  </P> <P> "First the sedatives, then the respirator," said Sally. "The chest tubes they  removed one at a time, each day, and it took six days to get rid of those.  </P> <P> "He's eating three square (meals) a day. And he's standing up in a walker --  for a couple of seconds."  </P> <P> The move means the officer will be able to receive Christmas visitors, if only  very briefly. His wife, Sally, hopes he will be well enough to go home in a few  weeks. She said she planned to spend Christmas in the hospital.  </P> <P> "Just spend the day and look at him, and hold his hand -- now that he can hold  it back," she said.  </P></p>

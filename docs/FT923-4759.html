			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Brambles Industries fall in line with forecast BRAMBLES Industries, the Australian industrial services group, yesterday reported a 6.2 per cent fall in net profit for 1991-92 to ADollars 185.75m (USDollars 132.6), Reuter reports from Sydney. 'We estimate that this year's profit outlook contains up to 8 per cent growth which is largely independent of economic conditions,' Mr Gary Pemberton, chief executive, said. 'It is based on issues specific to Brambles, such as the expansion of our US activities.' Mr Pemberton pointed out that the annual profit was in line with the forecast at the half- year. 'The two big factors in the result were the reduction in interest income and the severe downturn in the construction industry in Australia,' he added. Mr Pemberton said the economy in Australia continued to be flat at best. 'For the first time in 18 years, Brambles' revenue in Australia actually declined.' He said that despite concerns with the move to European unity, Brambles' European business had delivered a higher trading profit. Operating profit for European businesses rose to ADollars 146.30m from ADollars 142.7m.</p>

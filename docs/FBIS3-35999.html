Solutions to this problem must not be sought "solely on the  basis of the documents signed in Massandra," the minister said.    "The protocol signed in Massandra is only a protocol of  intentions. It gives some opportunities for maneuver and search  for the ways to resolve this problem, but there are also other  agreements which should be taken into account during the talks,"  Ukraine's foreign minister said.    Under the Yalta Accords reached in 1992 between Presidents  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the  Black Sea Fleet was to serve as the basis for building Russia's  Navy and Ukraine's Naval Forces. In the meantime, the Fleet was  to be run by the two presidents.    On June 17, 1993, in Moscow, Yeltsin and Kravchuk signed  another agreement, under which the Black Sea Fleet was to be  divided between Russia and Ukraine equally.    On September 3, 1993, in the town of Massandra in Crimea,  the  two presidents signed an agreement under which Ukraine yielded  its part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia to cover its debt for  the Russian fuel received by Ukrainian consumers earlier. The  concrete mechanisms of compensation for the ships to be  transferred to Russia and for the use of naval bases located in  Crimea were to be devised during further talks. However talks  on this issue became stalemated.    Therefore Zlenko's latest statement actually signifies  Ukraine's departure from the Massandra agreements on  transferring Ukraine's part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia.    When asked by Interfax-Ukraine about the international  aspect  of the possible referendum on independence for Crimea, Zlenko  said he hopes that "the people of Crimea will have enough  restraint and common sense to refrain from developing an issue  fraught with aggravating relations between Crimea and other  nations."    "We must not allow an explosive situation to emerge," Zlenko  said. "Russia is not interested in aggravating relations and  using the Crimean card either," he pointed out.</p>

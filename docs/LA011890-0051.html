Besides serving as a forum for citizen comments on law-enforcement issues, the  panel will also deal with fire prevention and disaster preparedness.  </P> <P> The new members of the panel are: Christopher L. Fairchild, Aslan Brooke, Norma  Kemper, Bronwen McGarva and John Altschul.  </P> <P> Nancy Greenstein, assistant to the city manager, said that the panel will  probably meet once a month but that no official guidelines for its operation  have been adopted.  </P></p>

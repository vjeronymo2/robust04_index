			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOME SALES SAG AS RATES RISE  </P> <P> Sales of new homes plummeted 7.1% in January to the lowest level in nearly a  year, as both mortgage rates and prices continued to climb, the government said  today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally  adjusted annual rate of 589,000 units in January after falling 8.4% in  December.  </P> <P> December sales originally were reported to have dropped 9.6%. It was the worst  performance since sales fell to 556,000 homes on an annual basis last March.  </P> <P> It marked an ominous start for the new year after new-home sales slowed to  650,000 units in 1989, down 3.8% from 1988 and the lowest level since 639,000  homes were purchased in 1984.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors reported Wednesday that sales of existing homes,  which represent about 80% of the housing market, dropped 2.2% in January. The  real estate group blamed higher mortgage rates and the usual January buying  lull for the drop.  </P> <P> Interest rates rose from 9.83% to 10.05% in January. Rates continued to rise in  February, reaching 10.31% by last Friday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL AND THE PLO  </P> <P> Daniel William's article "Children of the Intifada: 'Our battle' " (Part I,  Feb. 18) poses a serious problem both to Arabs and Israelis alike. Yet the  solution in itself is not that hard to envision. While those children have  accomplished more than all their ancestors and the combined Arab armies in  gaining sympathy to the Palestinian cause, there remains one problem that must  be coped with once these children accomplish their goals: There remains the  effect of 20 years of Israeli occupation during which they eyewitnessed and  lived the ugly scenes of police brutality, army beatings, arrests, house  demolitions, the killing of their relatives, not only by the hands of the  Israeli Army but also Jewish settlers, who have assumed the role of God in the  region and claimed the whole area as theirs.  </P> <P> These children have reached the stage where parental authority in their view is  meaningless if not ceremonial. The parents of these children realize the  importance of their accomplishments. They are willing to lose parental  authority in favor of freedom and dignity. This is really a small price to pay  considering the trade-off. But what does the future hold for these heroes? Will  the nightmare end for them? Will the ugly images disappear from their minds? Or  will it leave scars of fear, hatred, and revenge?  </P> <P> It will behoove today's psychologists to stop wondering what they can do to  make it easier on the Israeli soldiers to continue in their role as occupiers,  and instead concentrate on finding solutions to the future of these children.  The cycle of hate has to stop in the Middle East. If not for our sake, then for  the sake of the next generation, Arabs and Israelis, alike. Each deserves to  live in a society void of violence and above all hate. Genuine peace can be  achieved through an end to the occupation.  </P> <P> WILLIAM G.

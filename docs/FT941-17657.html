			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / US cable operator enters UK: Tele-Communications takes Pounds 200m stake in Flextech media group Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television operator, is to create a 'second force' in the UK cable and satellite market by merging its European channels with Flextech, a British former oil services company that has turned itself into a media group. The deal announced yesterday will make the enlarged company the biggest cable and satellite channel operator in the UK after British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. Tele-Communications (TCI) is taking a 60.4 per cent stake, valued at more than Pounds 200m, in Flextech. Flextech will acquire all the European programme assets of United Artists European Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCI. Both companies at present hold stakes in BSkyB channels and other cable channels. The enlarged Flextech will hold a stake in five of the 12 satellite channels that make up the basic multi-channel subscription package on BSkyB: Bravo, a classic movies channel, The Children's Channel, The Family Channel, UK Gold and UK Living. A UAEH subsidiary also manages four other channels: Discovery, the factual channel that is part of the BSkyB package, and cable channels The Parliamentary Channel, The Learning Channel and Wire TV, an entertainment channel. Although most of the satellite channels are currently loss-making, the deal is underpinned by 10-year contracts with BSkyB, signed in September. Each channel in the subscription package receives 15p per subscriber per month. BSkyB said last month that 3.1m homes took at least one of its subscription services. When the merger talks were first revealed in October, Flextech shares jumped 49p to 224p. Its shares are currently suspended at 379p. The agreement will give TCI - at present in merger talks with Bell Atlantic, the US telephone company - a European vehicle for future expansion. Flextech also announced yesterday it was increasing to 86.7 per cent its stake in IVS, a UK cable company with franchises in Oxford, Stafford, Andover, Salisbury and Jersey.

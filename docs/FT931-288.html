			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / French right in proposal to help 'cohabitation' FRANCE should set up a national security council in which its Socialist president and its new conservative government could jointly run the country's foreign and defence policy, an influential Gaullist adviser suggested yesterday. Mr Pierre Lelouche, foreign affairs adviser to Mr Jacques Chirac and now an RPR deputy, wrote in the Liberation newspaper yesterday that joint decision-making in such a council could avoid possible paralysis of French policy on issues such as defence, the European Community and the Gatt trade talks, where President Mitterrand and the right had genuine differences of view. The new era of cohabitation - the term used to describe periods in which France is governed by a president and prime minister of opposing parties - got off to a smooth start. Mr Mitterrand rapidly named Mr Edouard Balladur of the RPR as the new prime minister within a day of the centre-right's sweeping parliamentary victory on Sunday, and promised to 'respect scrupulously' the new majority's general policy. But there is still the possibility of early conflict over the composition of Mr Balladur's cabinet, announced last night. Mr Mitterrand may yet baulk at Mr Balladur's nominations for foreign and defence minister, areas of policy in which the president made clear on Monday night he would exercise the influence which the constitution gives him. Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, who was Mr Mitterrand's chief of staff at the Elysee in the last cohabitation government of 1986-88, yesterday warned the new government against the temptation to 'hide things' from the president. A new computer network linking the Elysee to the Quai d'Orsay's diplomatic cable traffic would make concealment harder now. Meanwhile, the manoeuvring between the RPR and UDF components of the new ruling coalition intensified yesterday over not only ministerial posts but also that of president of the National Assembly. In return for early endorsement of Mr Balladur as prime minister, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, said his party should get the top parliamentary post, perhaps - some suspect - for himself because, like Mr Chirac, he is staying out of the government.</p>

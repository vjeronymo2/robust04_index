"But Darrin and his family feel very strongly  about him coming to Nebraska."  </P> <P> Osborne repeated his statement made this week that Wagner would not be given a  scholarship but was welcome as a walk-on. Osborne said that depending on his  athletic and academic progress, Wagner could earn a scholarship.  </P> <P> Under National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, Wagner will not be eligible to  play for Nebraska until the 1990 season and will have 3 seasons of football  eligibility remaining.  </P> <P> Wagner, The Times' 1987 San Diego County back of the year for Lincoln High  School, did not play in a game for SDSU as a freshman.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELCOME TO THE FOOD CHAIN, Y'ALL;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: SINCE THE PEST MAY BE WITH US FOR A WHILE, A FARM BELT NATIVE WONDERS  IF URBAN AND RURAL INTERESTS MIGHT NOT GET TOGETHER AND FIND A SENSIBLE WAY TO  DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> Y'all having trouble with them pesky flies again. Four hundred flies is all, I  hear, trapped around Los Angeles County over the last 10 years. Hell, I've  known farmers who trapped more flies than that in their pickup cab on a cold  night. Probably ain't none of my business, but since the state's mixing the  malathion with corn syrup, sliming your cars and scumming your swimming pools  with syrup made from good Midwestern corn, I didn't think you'd mind my putting  my two cents in.  </P> <P> See, farmers got to deal with this kind of trade-off all the time. They take it  seriously, same as you do, worry about breathing the stuff, worry about their  kids. But there's humor in it, too, if you look hard. World would be a terrible  place without a sense of humor. Like Lakewood City Councilman Robert G. Wagner  saying about the chopper spraying, "I think it's overblown." Well, if it was,  he wouldn't have a problem, would he? Or this Republican political consultant,  Sal Russo, saying that fighting the Medfly "needs to be like Panama or Grenada.  You've got to get in fast and win it or else it's like Vietnam." Was it using  choppers that brought out that old boy's killer instincts or what? Did we win  something in Grenada and Panama that I didn't hear about?  </P> <P> Or that Los Angeles Times Poll that showed Republicans were more sympathetic to  spraying than Democrats. Was that because Republicans own the orange groves, or  because old George Deukmejian is a Republican and they're standing behind their  man, or don't they know straight up from apple butter? Then there's the sad  tale of the Vietnamese people at the nightclub in Garden Grove running out  scared when the Medfly choppers came roaring over. We watch the 6 o'clock news  out this way, after supper, and when California comes up sometimes we suspicion  we might have turned on another weird Hollywood picture show.  </P> <P> It does get to be a mite exasperating for a farmer to hear one more time around  that city people, however well-meaning, don't mind enjoying the fruits but  don't want to help shoulder the burden. There's people who go around parading  for animal rights with meat in their bellies and leather shoes on their feet,  letting someone else do their killing for them. There's people bent out of  shape about food prices who don't want farmers to use chemicals to grow that  food cheap. And there's people who sneeze when a little malathion-laced corn  syrup tangerine-flakes their cars, sneering about farmers driving tractors with  enclosed cabs and air-filtering systems.  </P> <P> You've got 250 types of fruits and vegetables in California susceptible to  Medfly infestation. If that fly gets out into the valleys and the fruit groves,  farmers are going to have to use a lot more malathion than the state is  spraying over the Los Angeles area these days. Spray a little in the city or a  lot on the farm: Welcome to the food chain.  </P> <P> I asked my friend Tom Bauer once about pesticides. Tom's a real farmer out in  Missouri who harvests a thousand acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and  raises cattle and hogs. He said he didn't have much truck with pesticides ever  since he read on the can label about 10 years ago that he was supposed to burn  his work clothes after he sprayed his fields. He still uses herbicides -- which  are pesticides for plants -- to keep down weeds. But he's gone to rotating  crops to fight pests -- corn one year, soybeans the next -- because the same  bugs don't eat on them.  </P> <P> It wouldn't be so easy to rotate crops out there in California, since your  crops are trees. You might think of rotating your fruit trees with Florida's  every other year. That would make a fine parade, all those trees crossing the  continent back and forth on flatbed trucks.  </P> <P> Spray the city or spray the farm. That looked like it in a nutshell until this  entomologist fellow Jim Carey came along. Farmers are slow to take to experts.  They've been burned. A lot of what farming's about ain't taught in graduate  school. But Carey's worked up a map and it's hard to argue with. It shows  Medflies being trapped since 1988 in all six of the areas where they turned up  in 1980 through 1982, sometimes just a few blocks away.  </P> <P> A couple of the other scientists on the California Department of Food and  Agriculture's science advisory panel thought that looked more like a continuing  population than new introductions. One of them, Richard Rice, even allowed the  reporter who interviewed him to use his name. The panel recommended saturation  trapping over the next two years to see if Carey's right or wrong. Out here  we're betting he's right. Flies get around.  </P> <P> If Carey's right, then the Medfly's already your neighbor. You know what that  means. You Angelenos wasn't standing behind the door when the brains was passed  out. It means you and the farmers over in the next valley have a common  problem. You ought to sit down together, listen to your experts (but don't take  their word for it) and work out something permanent. Something better than  toad-strangler nights spraying malathion bait. Something fair to both sides,  city people and farmers trying to grow you a decent crop.  </P> <P> Y'all have howdied, but you ain't shook.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: DINING DOESN'T MEET THE MOTIF  </P> <P> Somewhere at the new Coco Palms in Encinitas there may be a basket of garlic  bread with my name on it, traveling from table to table and, possibly, back to  the kitchen every so often for a quick rewarming.  </P> <P> This basket of bread is something like the man in the Kingston Trio song who  descended into the Boston subway, never to return. The lyrics supposed that he  might still be riding around down there, and the same may be true of the garlic  bread, ordered at the beginning of a recent Sunday dinner that stretched out  and out in length until it seemed that none of the dishes ever would arrive.  </P> <P> Part of the problem was the succession of servers who briefly took the table  and then dropped out of sight, to be replaced, sometimes much later, by another  equally cheerful young person who promised the imminent arrival of the bread  and, indeed, of the meal itself.  </P> <P> Dinner finally made its way to the table, but, alas, in a bread-less state.  </P> <P> The wait provided a more than ample opportunity to get the feel of the place,  which makes an effort of sorts to recreate the Southern California of the  1940s. A pleasant, palm-motif paper covers the walls and suggests the ocean  breezes that blow outside the picture windows, some of which offer excellent  views of the coast just north of old Leucadia. Coco Palms also romanticizes the  Forties with a wall-length, iridescent mural of a moonlit beach. However, the  familiar manners of the staff and the general rush of the place locate it very  much in 1990.  </P> <P> Because of the emphasis on the 1940s, a decade associated with Hollywood and  its stars, the menu names every dish as a particular personality's own. For  example, there is John Wayne's Porterhouse steak, which sounds likely enough,  but also Sophia Loren's "blackened" chicken fettuccine, a dish that one must  doubt the great actress would endorse.  </P> <P> The menu in general is a hodgepodge of dishes and the lack of focus suggests  that the menu writer said to himself, "Well, Cajun stuff is kinda popular these  days, and I guess we better have some Mexican food and some pasta, fish, salads  and steaks." Needless to say, the appetizer list includes stuffed potato skins,  fried zucchini and "Cajun" chicken drumettes.  </P> <P> Steaks may be the kitchen's great strength. A coulotte top sirloin was notable  not only for the care with which it had been grilled and for its tenderness,  but for fine flavor, an attribute not generally applicable to beef these days.  </P> <P> The crab-stuffed prawns also had the virtue of careful preparation, so that the  large shrimp and their filling remained moist and tasty. However, the "lobster  bisque sauce" that purportedly moistened these was a mysterious but utterly  tasteless composition that may have been nothing more than flour cooked in  butter. A saute of squashes in fiercely flavored tomato sauce accompanied both  entrees and added quite the wrong note to each.  </P> <P> Meals also include the choice of a typical green salad or clam chowder, the  latter flavorful but, as is often the case in these parts, so thick that it  seemed more a white sauce than a soup. The list of prepared-on-premises  desserts is brief but does include a light, sprightly flavored strawberry  mousse.  </P> <P> At its calmer moments, the entree list includes prime rib, teriyaki steak or  chicken, baby back ribs and Cobb salad. Further afield are the Jackson Square  Caesar salad (attributed to Elizabeth Taylor and garnished with hearts of palm  and "Cajun" croutons); the "chicken Vista Del Mar" of chicken, shrimp,  scallops, salsa, cheese and sour cream (Betty Davis rather appropriately gets  the credit for this one) and the chicken Popeye, which tops a broiled breast  not only with creamed spinach flavored with nutmeg, ginger and curry, but with  cheese, mushrooms and the house version of sauce bearnaise. What would Olive  Oyl say?  </P> <P> COCO PALMS  </P> <P> 1950 N. Highway 101, Encinitas  </P> <P> Calls: 942-1444.  </P> <P> When: Dinner served nightly.  </P> <P> Cost: Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, about $30 to  $60. Credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

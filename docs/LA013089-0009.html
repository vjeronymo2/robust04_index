			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMING ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> The competition for Los Angeles' morning radio audience could soon turn into an  all-out war with the move here from New York of Scott Shannon, creator of the  "Morning Zoo" concept of slap-happy hip talk on morning rock radio. He'll be  taking over the morning show on KIQQ-FM. That will put him head to head in the  mornings against KIIS-FM's long-time ratings champ Rick Dees and his close  runner-up, KPWR-FM's Jay Thomas. In addition, Shannon has been named vice  president for programming of Westwood One Radio Station Group. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

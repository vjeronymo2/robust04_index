			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling and yen surge ahead THE D-MARK continued to show signs of weakness against most currencies yesterday, allowing sterling to break through the DM2.52 barrier at one point, and falling to new lows against the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's trading brought little in the way of fresh news to the market. However, the D-Mark continued to trend downwards at the end of a week which has brought Denmark's ratification of the Maastricht treaty and new confidence in European Monetary Union. Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the French franc again broke below the FFr3.37 level against the German currency and closed at FFr3.365, despite the fact that most of the French market remained on holiday. The Dutch guilder also broke through to a new 5-year high against the German currency, moving from NFl 1.1230 to a London close of NFl 1.120. By the close of trading, the guilder was some 59 basis points higher than the D-Mark in the ERM grid. Another indication of the D-Mark's softness was the fall in its ERM divergence indicator from minus 17 percentage points to minus 23 percentage points. It was 38 basis points above the weakest currency, the French franc. However, the D-Mark could recover next week if provisional data for consumer price inflation in Germany indicate lower annual inflation. The dollar benefited from the D-Mark's general softness to close 1.4 pfennigs up on the day at DM1.6275. But sterling and the yen moved higher against the D-Mark as a result of special factors. Sterling broke through the DM2.52 level, peaking at DM2.5215 following retail price inflation figures that were a little better than the market had expected. However, it later succumbed to profit-taking to close at DM 2.5075, down  1/4 pfennig on the day. A good inflation figure would normally raise speculation of another base rate cut, weakening the currency. But Mr Mark Austin, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, said the figure underlined that the government's inflation target was intact - and that this compounded the general confidence in the UK authorities following the Maastricht ratification vote in the House of Commons. The Japanese currency also moved strongly against the D-Mark, closing at Y67.90. from a previous Y68.53. The yen is likely to remain on the firm side in the run-up to next week's trade talks between the US and Japanese government. In the wake of this week's very poor US trade figures, there are expectations that the US authorities will again push Tokyo into a strong yen policy.</p>

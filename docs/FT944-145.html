			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / IoD chief outlines action for growth Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, yesterday backed Mr John Major's suggestion that the scene was set for continued growth in 1995 but urged further steps to ensure prosperity. He said that with inflation below 3 per cent, growth at 4 per cent, exports rising strongly and unemployment falling, 'we have a very sound platform for cementing the recovery'. But in a new year message he stressed that other measures were needed to take full advantage of the upswing. A business-friendly tax regime to encourage investment and expansion and a smaller proportion of the national wealth being spent by government 'would put Britain back on the road to prosperity', he said.</p>

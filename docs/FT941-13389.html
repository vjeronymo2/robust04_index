			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Labour MP's death will test Tories The death yesterday of Mr James Boyce, the Labour MP, presents the government with a daunting electoral test in the by-election in his Rotherham constituency. Mr Boyce, 46, had been ill for some time. It was announced recently that he would carry out his duties from home while he waited for a heart transplant. He had a majority of 17,561 in the South Yorkshire constituency at the 1992 general election, with 63 per cent of the vote. The Conservative candidate was second with 23.7 per cent of the vote. The by-election could provide an opportunity for a return to the Commons of one of several Labour MPs defeated at the election, including Ms Sylvia Heal, a former frontbencher. However, interest will focus on the Conservatives' ability to prevent erosion of their vote by Labour and the Liberal Democrat party, which polled 12.3 per cent at the election. A poor performance, even in such a solid Labour seat, would confirm the low standing of Mr John Major's government, especially if the Conservatives also do badly in the local and European elections in the spring. Mr Boyce was a former foundry worker who joined Labour in 1979 and won Rotherham at the last election after serving as a Sheffield city councillor. He was beginning to make his name in the Commons as an authority on housing, employment and training. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said Mr Boyce was a fine colleague and an excellent constituency MP. 'That he should die at such a young age is a tragedy,' he said.</p>

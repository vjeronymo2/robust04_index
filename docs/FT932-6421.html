			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Technology: Aerosol answer to infernal parking - Worth Watching A drawback of hot, sunny weather is the stifling heat that builds up inside parked vehicles. The answer may be a cooling spray which, claim manufacturers France Med, of London, can reduce the temperature by as much as 40`C almost instantaneously. Magicool is a combination of water, fragrance and a chemical coolant. The latter cools the surfaces while the water evaporates and reduces the air temperature. As the coolant is approved for cosmetic use, Magicool can also be sprayed on the skin. France Med: UK, 081 645 0773.</p>

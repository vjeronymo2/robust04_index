			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Property: IPD emphasises slowdown in property prices The slowdown in the surge in property prices that began in late 1993 has been underlined by a second consecutive monthly fall in the IPD Monthly Index total return. The total return for May was 1.2 per cent, the lowest monthly level since August last year. Capital growth was down to 0.5 per cent in May, the lowest monthly movement since April 1993 when yields started to shorten. Over the past three months, the total return was 6.1 per cent, suggesting that the total return for 1994 is likely to be lower than the 7.8 per cent recorded in the quarter to March. Total returns continued to slow across all three sectors in May reflecting a decline in the rate of capital growth. Industrials regained their lead as the best performing sector in May with a total return of 1.4 per cent. Retail property slipped into second place with a return of 1.2 per cent, while offices showed a monthly return of 1.0 per cent. In the year to May, the total return for the retail sector was 27.4 per cent, an increase of 0.8 percentage points over the year to April; the total return for the office sector was 25 per cent, a marginal improvement over the 24.7 per cent return for the 12-month period to April; the total return for industrial property was 26.6 per cent for the year to May, compared with 25.8 per cent for the year to April.</p>

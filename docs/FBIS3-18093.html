German  Deputy Foreign Minister (Helmut Scheffer) will go to Skopje on  Monday [28 February] as mediator. British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd is expected in Athens tomorrow. Furthermore, the  issue of Skopje is expected to be discussed in Brussels at the  EU Council of General Affairs. At the same time, EU  Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans van den Broek had a  telephone conversation with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias and told him that [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov's  regime considers the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed  by Greece as a necessary precondition for the beginning of the  process of solving the dispute with Athens.    In the meantime, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's  answering letter to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and  the note with Greece's legal arguments to the European  Commission on the issue were presented yesterday in Brussels.    Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the  Greek prime minister's answer to Delors is purely political in  character. Regarding the legal issues raised by Delors, the  prime minister called attention to the note sent to Brussels by  the Greek Government. Venizelos stressed that Greece is the  first to wish for the lifting of the measures as quickly as  possible, but for this to happen Skopje must give the three  practical signs of goodwill that have been set demanded by the  Greek side.    Prime Minister Papandreou will brief President Konstandinos  Karamanlis in the next few days regarding developments on the  Skopje issue.</p>

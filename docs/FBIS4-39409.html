			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Gorlov report: "Debtors Should Be Bought By </F> Tender"]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the edict  "On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises" 2 June. Sergey  Belyayev, general director of the Federal Administration for  Insolvency (Bankruptcy), comments on it.    "The new presidential edict marks the start of practical  selective [selektivnyy] work to restructure industry. Let me  say right away that it will not be a case of treating everyone  alike. For instance, there are enterprises owed money by the  budget. Naturally, an entirely different approach will be taken  with them.    "Clearly, a general point will be that labor agreements with  the leaders of insolvent enterprises will be torn up and  management transferred to a newly created collective organ with  the participation of state representatives.    "In principle the sales procedure laid down in the edict is  aimed at preventing bankruptcies. I am confident that many  enterprises and their leaders who receive insolvency notices  will themselves try to get out of the danger zone.    "As I have already said, the measures stipulated by our  legislation will be taken against those for whom this proves too  much. Incidentally, apart from selling off enterprises, there  could also be decisions on state support, reorganization, and so  forth.    "Talking specifically about the sale of enterprises, this is  a question of espousing the generally accepted world practice  and moving to a fundamentally new type of privatization. Any  corporate bodies or individuals will be able to take part in the  tenders -- including foreigners, who are permitted to do so  under existing regulations.    "A whole host of extra conditions -- on the procedure for  repaying debts, on investment, the retention of jobs, and so  forth -- may be stipulated when a debtor enterprise is being  sold off."</p>

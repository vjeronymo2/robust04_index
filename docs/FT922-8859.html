			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / The European Market: Central Europe surveys an imperfect pact - Benefits from a trade accord with the EC could take time to materialise THE European Community's trade liberalisation agreement with Poland, Czech-oslovakia and Hungary is designed to give the countries' goods greater access to western markets. In practice, at least for the first few years, the main benefits will probably be felt not by industries in these countries but by their western competitors. Well-financed and technologically superior exporters from the west are likely to profit more quickly from the advantages of free trade than struggling industries in the former communist states. This would accelerate the process of structural change under way in central Europe - but could also heighten the risk of a political backlash as the economic pain spreads. The mere act of signing the March 1 agreement was 'the art of the possible', says Mr Karel Lukas, Czechoslovakia's ambassador to the EC. 'It brought us closer to the Community. It was the maximum of what was possible.' Exporters from Czechoslovakia, like others from central and eastern Europe, have already made progress in carving out fresh markets in the west over the past two years. None the less, the accord runs the risk of being seen as lop-sided. Barriers are maintained on exports of key products such as steel, textiles, chemicals and glass, although they will be gradually lowered and removed altogether after 10 years. Curbs on sales of farm produce into the EC's heavily protected agricultural market will remain in force. Confronted by a collapse in trade with the former communist bloc, many industries from the three central European countries have diverted export efforts to the west. But they still have a long way to go. Illustrating the anxieties about whether the EC accord may prove to be inadequate, one official at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris says: 'For the areas where they (the three) are most competitive, the industrialised countries are the most protectionist. This is virtually insoluble.' Possible problems ahead are underlined by OECD estimates of the balance of payments outlook for the countries. According to the projections, prepared for a series of international economic meetings in Paris beginning this week, the current account deficit of five central and eastern European countries will rise from Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 1.75bn) in 1990 and Dollars 3.6bn in 1991 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. The deficit - for Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - is projected to fall to Dollars 4.8bn in 1993. Mitigating the gloom about future prospects, data collected by the OECD show that most central and east European countries succeeded in keeping foreign trade with the west on an even keel last year. The exception was Poland, which saw its trade balance with the 24-nation OECD swing from a surplus of Dollars 1.2bn in 1990 to a deficit of Dollars 2.7bn in 1991. Poland managed only a moderate increase in exports, while imports soared. The OECD blames a deline in exports since the middle of last year partly on an overvalued zloty. Czechoslovakia, by contrast, increased its exports to the OECD area by 39.2 per cent last year (measured in European currency units), against a rise of only 1.8 per cent in 1990. Hungary achieved a 20.8 per cent export rise, while Bulgaria increased exports by 30.2 per cent. Mr Jan Truszczynski, an economic diplomat at Poland's EC office in Brussels, points out the extent to which his country has switched trade towards the EC. In 1988, a year before a five-year trade and economic co-operation agreement between Poland and the EC came into force, the Community accounted for 28 per cent of Poland's total exports and imports. Last year trade with the EC made up 54 per cent of exports and 48 per cent of imports. Mr Truszczynski emphasises, however, the twin pressures on Polish industries facing competition from abroad. Polish farmers are demanding faster liberalisation for their produce and are, at the same time, pleading for extra duties against 'well-advertised, attractively packaged food products' pouring into their country. Such imports are likely to continue. In view of the swing away from trade with the former Soviet Union and the other Comecon countries towards more integration with the west, the EC clearly has a greater responsibility than before for central and eastern Europe's economic fate. Economic output in most of the states there is estimated to have dropped by between 10 and 20 per cent last year. On average, two thirds of the output decline is estimated to have been caused by the collapse in intra-Comecon trade. This year a further decline in output, though at a slower rate, is expected across the region. The OECD is then hoping for a modest upturn from 1993. Eventual hopes for recovery depend on the former communist states being able to develop efficient and well-managed export industries. Unless the west provides the markets, these efforts are unlikely to succeed.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / US space export ban 'a commercial decision' INDIA yesterday alleged that commercial considerations were behind a US decision to ban exports to the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and 'to thwart India from growing into an important economic entity in the international space market.' The allegation was made by Prof UR Rao, Isro chairman. He claimed the US was aware of India's low launch costs, saying: 'We are going to be an important economic entity in the multi-billion dollar space market. Therefore, reasons for the two-year ban on exports to India are totally commercial.' Prof Rao said the US sanctions would delay Isro's projects and would force it to exceed its budget. India's satellite development programme could be crippled by the ban. Although India has made limited progress in rocket technology - the purchase of which from Russia attracted US sanctions against India and Russia - its satelite programme is progressing well and it has many potential buyers. But satellite development depends heavily on US supplies of components now banned. Electronic components required for satellites form a big share of imports from the US. It is not clear, however, whether joint ventures between Indian and US companies involved in supply of such components are covered by the ban. Prof Rao said Isro chose Russian technology when bids by General Dynamics of the US and France's Arianespace were four times the Dollars 250m (Pounds 139m) quoted by Russia's Glavkosmos, also covered by the US ban. Prof Rao said General Dynamics told India its cryogenic engines, which Isro is buying from Russia, did not come under Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) regulations.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Cuba anxiously beckons the outside world: Damian Fraser on efforts to lure foreign business to Havana THE Cuban government yesterday gave a red-carpet welcome in Havana to nearly 80 foreign businessmen, asking them to invest in its beaches, oil, gold, bio-technology, and any other enterprise of possible interest. They were enticed with lengthy presentations on the state of Cuba and top-level meetings with officials of their choice, and entertained at an official drinks party. Representatives from PepsiCo, Eastman Kodak, RJR Nabisco, BFI International, the US Rice Council, and a host of tourist developers, lawyers, investment bankers, and curious Cuban-Americans all made the trip. Most of the visitors were from the US, although US law prevents them from doing business with Cuba or even spending money there. But sensing a slight easing in US policy to Cuba, Cuban officials and backers hope the meetings will generate opposition to the three-decade US trade embargo against the island. In the meantime Cuba is hoping non-US businessmen will prop up its faltering economy with foreign capital. Cuba has found foreign partners in tourism, mining, light industry, agro-business and electronics, and claims to have attracted some Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) in foreign investment in the past couple of years. So far such investment has not stopped the economy's decline, provoked by the collapse in trade with former Comecom countries. It is expected to have halved since 1989, with imports down to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 8.1bn. Eight-hour electricity blackouts are common, malnutrition is a problem for the first time since the revolution, and trade in all but the most crucial products has ground to a halt. 'You could sign fantastic letters of credit for Dollars 1m of business tomorrow,' says Mr Sem Davies of Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company which has experience in Cuba, 'but you would never get paid'. The potential investors were briefed by earnest bureaucrats. Mr Raul Amado Blanco, of the central bank, said Cuba would allow foreign banks to set up branches in partnership with the government in Cuba. Cuba's need for credit, trade guarantees, import and export financing, credit card operations and more meant the country's financial sector was ripe for take off. Mr Antonio de los Reyes, deputy minister of basic industry, said laws that gave Cubans majority ownership of joint ventures could be 'negotiated'. His department is to auction 11 oil fields to foreign investors - some 45 have shown interest - in August. Three foreign oil companies, most notably Total of France, are already exploring in Cuba. Mr Carlos Lage, Cuba's top economic official, said yesterday plans to allow Cubans to hold and spend dollars were in the final stage. Mr Lage hoped the measures would increase the amount of hard currency in Cuba, and suggested the government was taking steps to reduce the amount of local currency in circulation. The moves could bring transactions now conducted in the black market to the formal market. Unsurprisingly, the US businessmen who came along thought the US trade embargo should be lifted. 'We have sent 55,000 people back in rubber bags from Vietnam and we are doing business with them. Why not with Cuba?' said the representative from BFI waste disposal company. Despite the precarious state of the Cuban economy, many are enthusiastic about the market's potential. 'The embargo could be lifted in three years,' said the PepsiCo man. 'Then Cuba will be the largest (Kentucky fried) chicken market in the Caribbean.'</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks on the Footsie following GDP data - Market report The UK stock market put its hopes of an early base rate cut back on the shelf yesterday and moved to new peaks after the latest data on gross domestic product, money supply and bank lending data indicated further strengthening in the domestic economy. The FT-SE Index, led by the stock index market, challenged the 3,500 mark to establish a new trading high before closing 14.2 up on the day at 3,484.2. The announcement that GDP had grown by 0.7 per cent over the final quarter of last year brought a confident response from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who repeated his budget forecast that the UK economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year. Equities were uncertain at first, in spite of a firm performances overnight in Far Eastern markets and on Wall Street. Second line stocks traded more calmly as the interest returned to the Footsie, futures-related stocks. Satisfaction with the economic data was quickly reflected in the futures market where the March contract on the Footsie raced above the 3,500 mark again. The FT-SE Index itself turned from its early fall of nearly 7 points to touch 3,496.1, for a net rise of more than 26 points. But the futures contract came off, and that proved to be the peak of the day for share prices, although a firm start to the new session on Wall Street, when the Dow Average broke through 3,900, buoyed London at the close. The FT-SE 100 Share Index has risen by 183.6 points, or about 2.5 per cent this week in good turnover. Seaq volume slipped to 979.7m shares, still at the higher end of daily averages for the past 18 months. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 1.1bn shares returned a retail worth of Pounds 2.53bn, around twice recent daily averages. But much of the excitement at mid-week came from the massive rise on the Mid 250 Index which has gained nearly 5 per cent since last Friday. Investors have been buying Mid 250 stocks because they are on lower rating than the blue chips which captured the buying interest in the dramatic advance in the stock market before Christmas. London was helped by strength in the leading oil stocks, on the back of US markets, and by another round of substantial gains in stocks linked to Far Eastern markets. Traders said that buyers were highly stock selective, and are now shying away from the highly rated blue chip stocks which are on prospective earnings multiples of 25 times. Base rate hopes were resurrected this week after news that retail sales dipped last month, but the London market has been discouraged by the absence of any move from the Bundesbank. The president of the German central bank said yesterday that it appeared right to hold interest rate policy 'steady' for now. Although confidence on UK inflation prospects remains high, bonds slipped lower yesterday as prices were readjusted at the end of a very successful week for the sector. Short-dated issues recorded small losses, with the longer end down by around  1/4 of a point. Index-linked followed the trend of the long dated conventional government bonds. Overseas and domestic demand for gilts, which has sustained the market this week, was reduced yesterday although the GDP and money supply data was regarded as within the bracket of market estimates.</p>

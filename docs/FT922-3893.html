			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kobe Steel pins its faith in chip expansion - Prospects for the group's joint venture with Texas Instruments IN THE rural surrounds of western Japan, executives of Kobe Steel and Texas Instruments last week celebrated the completion of the world's latest semiconductor plant, a monument to US-Japanese co-operation in electronics and to Japanese steel companies' diversification programmes. At the same moment, back in Tokyo, representatives of the two countries' chip industries were haggling over foreign market share in Japan. These squabbles were not heard by the celebrants gathered in a gaily-decorated local hall at Nishiwaki, whose mayor thought it appropriate that the factory was finished just as the world semiconductor market had taken a turn for the better. The mayor appears to have been looking at the wrong spread sheets. Prices for the memory chips to be produced at the Y55bn (Dollars 429.7m) wafer fabrication plant in its first phase of operation have been in steep decline for the past year, and the industry is still characterised by excess capacity and weak demand. But Kobe Steel likes to see itself as different to other Japanese steelmakers, whose electronics ventures have generally soaked up enormous amounts of investment and returned little in profits. And Kobe remains confident, even though established Japanese electronics companies are reviewing their ailing chip operations, which were partly responsible for profit falls ranging from 43.1 per cent to 68.6 per cent in the year to the end of March. Mr Sokichi Kametaka, president of Kobe Steel, said the joint venture company, KTI Semiconductor, in which his company has a 75 per cent share, will accelerate Kobe's 'diversification into the mainstream' of the electronics industry. 'The semiconductor field is seen as an area with strong growth and is expected to have a very positive impact on the Kobe Steel group,' Mr Kametaka said. Japanese steelmakers are looking for the positive in a year in which steel demand is slowing and diversification projects are in difficulty. Kobe can point to a 15.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year: that was below the 45 per cent drop at Sumitomo Metal Industries, the 37 per cent fall at Nippon Steel and the 25.5 per cent decline at NKK. NKK, Japan's second-largest steelmaker, has just released a review of its long-term management plan that re-emphasises the importance of the core steel business, and concedes that new business areas are likely to contribute less to profits than previously forecast. In a previous plan, drafted in 1988, NKK reckoned that new business would account for 25 per cent of annual sales by the year 2000 - that figure has been revised down to 16 per cent. Engineering business is expected to account for 31 per cent of sales, up from the previously forecast 25 per cent, and steel for 53 per cent, instead of 50 per cent. Kawasaki Steel, which has a joint-venture chip factory with LSI Logic of the US and its own plant, said last week that its recruitment of semiconductor staff has been capped. By the year 2000, Kawasaki hopes, optimistically, that chip sales will be Y200bn, or about 10 per cent of total sales. However, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) senses that the traditional chipmakers and the newcomers, such as Kobe and Kawasaki, may have got their numbers wrong. The EIAJ last week warned companies not to expect a repeat of the rapid market growth of the late 1980s, and advised them to develop new products, while refraining from 'excessive' investment in increased capacity for memory chips. In opening a plant two days after the EIAJ advisory, Kobe Steel is counting on the upturn in demand that the entire industry has sweated on for the past year. Meanwhile, US industry officials hinted last week that they were content to leave the crowded memory chip market to Japanese and Korean companies, while themselves concentrating on customised chips and microprocessors. KTI is planning to start production in the autumn with a new generation of 16Mbit memory devices. But the company is unsure whether there will be sufficient demand, for example, from makers of work stations, for these high-capacity chips and whether the venture will have to turn to the present generation 4Mbit chips in order to ramp-up the fabrication facility. After gathering expertise from memory chip production, the facility will be turned over to application-specific chips for consumer and industrial electronics. These items tend to have smaller production runs designed to suit customer requirements, and KTI hopes there will a queue of such customers. Kobe Steel began diversifying well ahead of the competition, and steel now accounts for only 48 per cent of total sales, with machinery, aluminium and copper products comprising most of the remainder. The shift into electronics began in late 1987 with the establishment of Genesis Technology (GTI), which provides testing services for chips. If not actually providing much steel 'synergy', the new Nishiwaki plant does have a certain political synergy. The finished products will be marketed through Texas Instruments and counted as foreign semiconductors in the Japanese market and, in a small way, perhaps ease trade friction with Washington. For the US company, which already has four plants in Japan, Kobe Steel's enthusiasm for electronics provided an opportunity to share the considerable costs of a new facility. Mr Jerry Junkins, TI's chief executive officer, told the people of Nishiwaki that 'with many other demands for resources on us in other parts of the world, it was desirable to seek a partner for this additional effort in Japan'.</p>

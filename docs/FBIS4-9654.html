			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero at Los Pinos Presidencial </F> Palace from the "ACIR Radio News" newscast]    [Text] At noon today, we said that calm had returned to the  official Los Pinos residence. But this does not mean inactivity.  At approximately 1400 today, the president held a meeting with  members of the national security cabinet: National Defense  Secretary Antonio Riviello Bazan, Government Secretary Jorge  Carpizo McGregor, Attorney General Diego Valadez, Federal  District Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevillo, and  National Security General Director Jorge Tello Pon.    Although we do not have any official information on this  meeting, we believe the president and his officials must have  discussed, among other matters, the appointment of Dr. Cordoba  Montoya as Mexico's new permanent representative to the  Inter-American Development Bank, headquartered in Washington;  the general situation in the country; Chiapas issues; Luis  Donaldo Colosio's murder; and, quite probably, how Mexico and  especially Mexico City will get along in the coming days.    Although it has not been officially announced, it seems  President Salinas de Gortari will take a few days of rest after  all and go to Agualeguas, Nuevo Leon. This is one of two times  during the year that he takes a holiday. This has not been  officially confirmed, but it seems everything is ready for him  in Agualeguas. Therefore, he must have talked with his officials  about how things will go in Mexico City during his probable  absence.</p>

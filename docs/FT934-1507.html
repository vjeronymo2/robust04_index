			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Imaginisation' runs riot a bit Sir, Lucy Kellaway's article, 'Are you a vine, an egg or a train?' (November 17), led her to 'imaginise' calling her boss a hedgehog, rather than saying straight out: 'You're prickly.' If her boss is a hedgehog carer, being likened to one of her charges could lead her to think she is being called a disgustingly noisy eater, or that she puffs and snorts vigorously when making love. Possibly not the intended message. If hedgehogs could send their own message at this time of year it would be for people to take care when tending the garden. Hedgehogs hibernate among piles of leaves and twigs, so please check these carefully before consigning them to the bonfire.

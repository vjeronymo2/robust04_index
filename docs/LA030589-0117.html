			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> AT OKLAHOMA, BUCK STOPS WITH SWITZER  </P> <P> Like the Roman Empire during its decline and fall, American civilization tends  to value bread and circuses above all else. There is never enough money to  build shelters for the homeless, but there is always enough to build another  $80 million football stadium that will be used 10 times a year.  </P> <P> And when host Miami's Super Bowl is upstaged by cries of police brutality and  bloody rioting, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, on the morning of the league's  annual Superbash, reminds the media that the party leftovers will be  distributed to the homeless. As Marie Antoinette said when told the starving  masses had no bread, "Let 'em eat cake."  </P> <P> A society like ours, so in love with bread and circuses, must have gladiators  to entertain it. But when the care and feeding of those gladiators gets so out  of hand that we treat them as if they were above the law -- and instead attack  those who would bring them to justice -- we are the biggest sickos of all.  </P> <P> The sickos seem to be enjoying a clear majority in Oklahoma, where telephone  polls conducted by the Tulsa World and KTUL-TV in Tulsa indicate more than  three-fourths of the callers -- 76 percent in the newspaper's poll, 77 in the  TV station's -- said Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer should not resign.  </P> <P> "Basically, we got three themes from the pro-Switzer people," Alex Adwan,  editorial page editor of The World, told the New York Times. "First, OU and  Switzer are not responsible for what every football player does. Second,  everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  </P> <P> "The third argument was, 'He's not hired to be a babysitter; he's hired to win  those games.' "  </P> <P> Assuming there were no more arrests of Oklahoma football players while we were  sleeping, here's a quick update on some of the reasons 24 percent of the  callers think Switzer should be replaced:  </P> <P> Start with mid-December, when the NCAA placed the Oklahoma football team on  three years' probation for what it called "major violations." Those included  offering cars and cash to recruits and giving airline tickets to players. The  NCAA committee on infractions noted that for "at least several years, the  university has failed to exercise appropriate institutional control" over its  football program.  </P> <P> And that, sports fans, is the Mickey Mouse stuff. The NCAA is concerned only  with recruiting and academic violations. Not with Hill Street Blues-Perry Mason  style criminality.  </P> <P> Apparently, three of every four Oklahomans polled aren't, either.  </P> <P> On Feb. 10, running back Glen Bell, offensive tackle Nigel Clay and tight end  Bernard Hall were arraigned for allegedly gang-raping a woman Jan. 21 at Bud  Wilkinson House, Oklahoma's all-jock dorm.  </P> <P> Eight days earlier, cornerback Jerry Parks shot offensive lineman Zarak Peters  in the chest after an argument in the dorm. Sports Illustrated reported Parks  then allegedly aimed the gun at his roommate, starting quarterback Charles  Thompson, then pointed it at his own head and pulled the trigger, but the gun  misfired.  </P> <P> As for Thompson, three days after he had lectured grammar-school kids on the  evils of drug use, the FBI arrested, handcuffed and charged him with selling 17  grams of cocaine for $1,400 to an undercover agent Jan. 26. If convicted,  Thompson, the Sooners' leading rusher last fall, could receive 20 years in jail  and $1 million in fines.  </P> <P> After Thompson's arrest, the university disclosed that he had spent part of  last summer in a drug rehabilitation center. Nor was this the first time  Thompson had run afoul of the law. In Tulsa in August 1986, he pleaded guilty  to a charge of petty larceny and no contest to an assault and battery charge  for pushing a store clerk and stealing a pair of gloves.  </P> <P> In the wake of the arrests, The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City and the Tulsa  World ran editorials saying Switzer should resign.  </P> <P> At a news conference following Thompson's arrest, Gov. Henry Bellmon, an  Oklahoma State graduate, said he was "thoroughly disgusted" with OU football.  But Bellmon later showed up at another news conference wearing a red OU jacket  and gave Switzer his blessing.  </P> <P> Was Bellmon having a genuine change of heart? Or was it because, like any good  politician, he'd seen the results of those pro-Switzer polls?  </P> <P> Switzer's most famous and most outwardly outrageous player, of course, was The  Boz, linebacker Brian Bosworth, now playing for the Seattle Seahawks of the  NFL. The Boz was banned from the 1987 Orange Bowl when the NCAA said he had  tested positive for anabolic steroids.  </P> <P> Bosworth's autobiography, "The Boz," describes Oklahoma as a school where  berserk behavior by football players -- drug use, gunplay and off-the-field  violence -- was anything but uncommon.  </P> <P> Defenders of the Sooners said Bosworth's book, which was released before the  NCAA probation and 1989 arrests, was full of exaggerations and lies. Maybe they  still feel that way. If you stick your head deep enough in the sand, you could  probably ignore a nuclear bomb.  </P> <P> Switzer has called each of the charges and arrests "isolated incidents." He has  said he doesn't deserve blame for his players' misbehavior any more than their  parents do.  </P> <P> Switzer has always run one of the loosest, and one of the most successful,  programs in college football. He prides himself on his open-minded outlook  about today's styles, and he has one of the best reputations for getting along  with black players.  </P> <P> But is it a coincidence that (as detailed in the Feb. 27 issue of Sports  Illustrated) Cincinnati Bengals running back Stanley Wilson, who has a history  of drug problems and was suspended from the Super Bowl for drug abuse, played  at Oklahoma? That former offensive guard and 1978 Outland Trophy winner Greg  Roberts, charged in Tampa, Fla., with racketeering and drug-related offenses,  played at Oklahoma? That former running back David Overstreet, who was killed  while driving drunk in 1984 and was charged in 1982, along with Roberts, with  raping an Oklahoma student (she dropped the complaint), played at Oklahoma?  </P> <P> If Switzer isn't at fault, who is? Oklahoma players run amok because he allows  it. Because they get the signal soon after their arrival on campus that as long  as they win football games for Oklahoma, they can do just about whatever they  want. As long as they are good gladiators, the rules don't apply.  </P> <P> If you believe the newspaper and television polls, that's how the people of  Oklahoma want it, too. To many of them, aside from family and friends, Oklahoma  football is their primary source of interest.  </P> <P> But while the problem of athletes running amok may be on the grandest scale at  Oklahoma, it is not confined to Oklahoma. Hardly. It is happening more and more  all over this land.  </P> <P> It's a frightening statement about how warped our values are, and about the  type of society we've become.  </P></p>

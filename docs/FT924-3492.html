			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Israeli deaths mark intifada PALESTINIAN gunmen yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the intifada - the uprising in the occupied territories - with the deadliest attack so far on Israeli soldiers in the West bank and Gaza Strip, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The army said three reservists were killed when three Palestinians in a car raked their vehicle with gunfire as they were patrolling a road in Gaza busy with locals heading to work in Israel. The attack was the bloodiest incident in a surge of violence which has presaged the fifth anniversary of the intifada, which according to most Palestinians started on December 9, 1987. Responsibility was claimed by Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group which was founded a few days after the uprising erupted and has become the second most popular group in the territories after the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Army officials said it was the highest number of soldiers to have died in a single attack in the occupied territories since the intifada began. The authorities say Hamas, which is opposed to the Middle East peace talks, which reopened in Washington yesterday, is trying to upset the negotiations. However, PLO factions which support the peace talks have also stepped up the use of guns in the intifada, which in its first three years was marked mainly by mass demonstrations and stone and petrol bomb throwing. Army figures show more than 340 shooting incidents this year, compared with 38 in 1988.</p>

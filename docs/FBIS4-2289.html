			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will establish  more vegetable farms and adopt a series of other measures to  keep prices of staple foods down, a senior municipal official  said.    Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, told deputies attending the  second session of the 8th Municipal Political Consultative  Conference here that the municipal government has begun to sell  grain and cooking oil reserves to its citizens as a way to lower  prices.    The cost of daily necessities has been growing rapidly in  recent months in the Chinese capital.    Last year's retail prices rose by 16.9 percent in the city  and many members at the conference have shown concern whether  the city can achieve the target to keep the price rise under 10  percent this year. This target was announced by China's Premier  Li Peng in his government work report to the recent National  People's Congress session.    Zhang Liyuan, a professor at Beijing University, proposed at  the city's on-going session that Beijing should supervise the  prices of daily necessities item by item.    Prices should be checked daily, individually, on such daily  necessities as grain, cooking oil, meat, vegetables, eggs and  milk. Citizens should be given price check results regularly,  according to the professor.    The mayor said that Beijing is to increase its investment in  vegetable farms and adopt a series of other measures to ensure a  booming market supply and to slow down price growth.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> A PRESCRIPTION FOR ADOLESCENT MEDICINE MISUSE  </P> <P> Mary Poppins did it with a spoonful of sugar, but it turns out that to "make  the medicine go down" can be a tricky business indeed when you're dealing with  millions of reluctant little sick chicks who need to take it.  </P> <P> It can be a serious problem for adults too, of course, especially for the  elderly, who tend to amass prescriptions from multiple sources -- prescriptions  that sometimes interact with each other and cause physical and psychological  problems.  </P> <P> But the problem with children and teen-agers has largely gone unnoticed, even  though it too can often be dangerous, occasionally fatal. According to Louis W.  Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, of the  estimated 13 million youngsters who need to take prescribed medicine in any  two-week period, nearly half -- about 46% -- are taking their medicine the  wrong way.  </P> <P> Researchers came up with this number after reviewing dozens of studies. In  addition, they found that adolescents were the most likely to make mistakes,  although the problem exists at all ages, and that "the tendency toward not  following treatment guidelines holds true even when the medicine is for serious  illnesses such as cancer and kidney transplants."  </P> <P> They also found that almost 5% of all pediatric hospital admissions were  related to reactions to or improper use of medicines and that nearly half were  serious or fatal.  </P> <P> Sullivan, along with Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug  Administration, and Paul Rogers, chairman of the board of the National Council  on Patient Information and Education, last week issued guidelines for parents,  doctors and children to help solve what they are calling "America's 'other'  drug problem."  </P> <P> A report prepared by the council, a nonprofit organization supported  principally by the prescription-drug industry, identified some specific ways  medications are misused, with some suggested methods of countering them.  </P> <P> Young, in remarks accompanying the release of the report, noted that the  over-the-counter drug problem is also knotty but that manufacturers of those  medicines -- mostly for colds, fevers, rashes and stomach upsets -- are  currently working with the FDA to make directions clearer and measurements more  exact.  </P> <P> An article in the FDA magazine, the FDA Consumer, cited a study conducted at  the universities of Michigan and Rochester in which 3,900 medication decisions  made by 500 mothers over a nine-month period were judged by a panel. The panel  found that the parents did only slightly more good than harm in dosing their  sick kids.  </P> <P> One would think that prescription drugs would be more carefully administered,  but parents are apparently no more likely to read a doctor's directions than  they are those on the back of a box of cough drops, and instructions from  physicians and pharmacists are not notably adequate.  </P> <P> The report found that medicating mistakes centered on four major categories:  </P> <P> * Stopping a medicine too soon. Grown-ups do this too. The minute they feel  better, they stop taking the medicine. The minute the kids feel better, the  parents stop giving the medicine. This can be a serious mistake with serious  consequences.  </P> <P> Take antibiotics, for example. The child feels better, and the infection  appears to have cleared up. However, if the medicine is stopped too soon, not  only is the child vulnerable to re-infection, but the organisms that have  survived the first onslaught of the antibiotic will, in the best Darwinian  tradition, likely have built up a resistance to the medicine so that the next  infection will be much harder to stamp out.  </P> <P> The specialists also cited anti-epileptic medicines, which may need to be taken  even during seizure-free periods to prevent a recurrence of the attacks.  </P> <P> * Not taking enough of a medicine. Doses may be skipped or forgotten. Medicines  that must stay in the blood at a specific level in order to be effective --  medications for people with asthma, for instance -- will not work properly if  they are not given promptly and precisely around the clock. This may mean  waking the child up for medicine at least once a night. Any parent whose  asthmatic child is sleeping peacefully at last simply doesn't want to wake him  or her. (One study cited in the report found that among patients required to  take the asthma medicine theophylline every eight hours, compliance was poor --  there was only 25% adherence. Compliance was much better when once-a-day doses  were provided.)  </P> <P> The report also noted that liquid medicines cause special problems. If they are  not shaken, for example, the active ingredient may not get into the spoon.  What's more, the measurements may be inexact.  </P> <P> * Refusing to take a medicine. Studies found a variety of reasons for this --  including objection to the taste and bothersome side effects.  </P> <P> As another factor, the report cited "a covert expression of parental  resistance" that led to refusal of the medicine.  </P> <P> * Taking too much of a medicine. The if-a-little-is-good-more-is-better school  of dosing is a serious medical problem among adults as well as kids more  frequently with over-the-counter medications than with prescription drugs.  </P> <P> Parents, the report found, also may be overly casual in giving children small  portions of over-the-counter medicines prepared for adults. Children are not  just smaller versions of adults, and sometimes adult medicines (cough and cold  preparations, for example) are suspended in alcohol, which can be particularly  dangerous to children. Children may react in vastly different ways than adults  do to certain medicines.  </P> <P> Parents come in for the most criticism in the report -- in not seeing to it  that their children take the medicines properly, regularly and religiously --  but physicians, pharmacists and care-givers also are faulted for failing to  talk to the children themselves and explain adequately the importance of taking  medicines the right way. "The parents can hear, but they should be talking  directly to the kids," noted Robert M. Bachman, executive director of the  council.  </P> <P> Sidney Wolfe, a physician and director of the Public Citizen Health Research  Group, said a better approach would have been the printed inserts that were  scheduled to be required in many prescription drug packages in the early 1980s  until the regulation was killed by the Reagan Administration. The council,  formed shortly after that action, "is an inferior replacement for a guaranteed  automatic flow of information to the patient," Wolfe said.  </P> <P> Bachman said the council's report did not deal specifically with the problems  involved in testing drugs for pediatric use. "It is a complicated problem," he  said. On the one hand, especially in drugs specifically targeted for diseases  of children, it seems essential that there be full and appropriate testing.  However, the ethical considerations involved in using children in research  protocols makes such testing an especially difficult and expensive proposition.  </P> <P> The FDA is wrestling with regulations that would permit testing of drugs to  treat pediatric AIDS on children without waiting for thorough tests to be  completed in adults. AIDS researchers have expressed concern that lives are  being lost because of the delays caused by the current rules.  </P></p>

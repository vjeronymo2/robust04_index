Talks with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, Polish President  Lech Walesa, and Slovak President Michal Kovac took place in the  U.S. Embassy in Prague. These talks were a followup of Bill  Clinton's talks with President Vaclav Havel and other Czech  Republic representatives yesterday. During the talks with the  delegations of the four Visegrad countries, President Clinton  emphasized the importance of the Partnerhip for Peace plan as a  path designed to promote these countries' integration into  Western structures and prepare them for admission into NATO  later. Expansion of technical assistance and Western  investments into these states was another important topic of the  talks.    The bilateral talks will be followed by a working lunch  given  by President Clinton for the presidents, premiers, and foreign  ministers of Visegrad countries. A short statement for the  press is expected after the meeting. Before he departs from  Prague, the U.S. President will take part in a discussion about  privatization and the prospects of Czech-U.S. trade in the  department store K-Mart.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Senior FedEx executive resigns MR Tom Oliver, head of worldwide customer operations at Federal Express and the effective 'number two' executive at the nation's largest overnight delivery company, has resigned. Mr Oliver said he was taking up the post of chief executive and president of VoiceCom Systems, a San Francisco-based voice processing services provider. Also leaving Memphis-based Federal Express is Ms Carole Presley, senior vice-president for marketing and corporate communications. She will remain a consultant to FedEx but will start her own consulting business in Florida. Federal Express has suffered problems in its international division and was forced to retrench from an ambitious European expansion plan last year. Since then, losses on the international front have been diminishing, although competition has put pressure on domestic earnings. Mr Oliver, 52, who had headed the international business, became executive vice-president of worldwide customer operations in 1991. He oversaw much of the European restructuring. FedEx said Mr Oliver would be replaced by Mr William Razzouk, currently senior vice-president of sales and customer service.</p>

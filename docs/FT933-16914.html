			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The cover at yesterday's gilts auction was the lowest since January 1988, but the market was quick to overcome initial disappointment. For the time it seems determined to look on the bright side. Including funding carried over from 1992-93, the authorities have raised over Pounds 20bn so far this financial year, of which nearly Pounds 6bn has come in June. The speed with which demand revived as the market fell yesterday suggests an appetite for more despite the recent fall in yields. The Bank is so far ahead that it can afford to slow the pace of its borrowing substantially if it chooses. With hindsight it could even be argued that low cover was a sign of how confident the market actually is. It may have deterred bargain hunters from making rogue bids. Such arguments advanced after the event, though, begin to smack of complacency. With so many gilts to sell, the authorities need the help of overseas buyers. They in turn must have some confidence in sterling's exchange rate and a reasonable yield premium over alternative paper. The message from yesterday is that there are still enough international investors who feel comfortable even with sterling at a rate around DM2.55. But the yield differential between gilts and German bunds has shrunk to little more than 100 basis points, which starts to look tight. The markets have treated Mr Kenneth Clarke kindly so far, but he does not have much room for error. Just Pounds 350m fewer bids out of yesterday's Pounds 3.56bn would have left the auction uncovered. One wonders how quickly the market would then have regained its poise.</p>

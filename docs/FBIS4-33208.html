			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santa Fe, 1 Jun (NA) -- The National Constituent  Assembly resumed sessions today. It continued discussing the  rules and regulations that will govern the Constituent Assembly  sessions. Neuquen Grand Front Jaime De Nevares has resigned as a  constituent assembly member.    The Neuquen bishop emeritus supported his resignation,  claiming that the Constituent Assembly "is completely null and  void," adding that the Constituent Assembly is "a farce."    With De Nevares' departure, the Grand Front loses a seat  because vacant seats are not replaced after members have taken  the oath. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rights aftermath hits Fiat shares SHARES in Fiat, the industrial group which this week announced Italy's biggest rights issue, fell sharply yesterday as investors digested the implications of the highly-dilutative deal. Fiat's ordinary shares dropped by almost 8 per cent, to L5,595, while preference shares fell by more than 9 per cent to L3,085 on the Milan stock exchange. Trading in the shares of Rinascente, the Fiat-controlled retailing chain which is to be sold, remained suspended. The Consob stock market authority, meanwhile, also called a halt to trading in Ifil, the listed investment group, dominated by Fiat's controlling Agnelli family, which is to launch a takeover bid for Rinascente. After having had time to consider Tuesday night's complicated package of cash-raising proposals, analysts focused on the negative aspects of the complex Rinascente deal. Rather than announcing a takeover by a big foreign retailer, as had been widely expected, Fiat said it would sell its 58 per cent stake in the ordinary shares of Rinascente, Italy's biggest stores and supermarkets group, to shareholders. Fiat shareholders will be entitled to buy four ordinary shares in Rinascente for every 100 Fiat shares, of whatever category, currently held. Precise pricing and timing for the deal have yet to be announced. Subsequent to the sale, Ifil will launch a takeover for an indeterminate number of Rinascente shares at a price yet to be revealed. Analysts criticised the arrangement to sell Rinascente stock to Fiat shareholders, who indirectly already own the company. 'It's like somebody robbing you of your wallet and then asking you to pay for getting it back,' said one. The unusual structure of the transaction, whereby control of Rinascente will first pass to Ifil via Fiat's shareholders, rather than directly, was seen as a ruse to avoid triggering Italy's new rules on compulsory takeovers. The main doubt was whether Ifil would launch a full takeover bid for all of Rinascente's stock, or just on enough shares to obtain a bare majority. Ifil and Ifi, the quoted company which controls the former, will automatically gain a substantial stake in Rinascente, as they are already among Fiat's biggest shareholders, Separately, Ifil reported net group profits up 7 per cent to L225.1bn (Dollars 142.7m) in the first half from L210.4bn last year. The group, which already has a substantial cash pile, is to make a one-for-five rights issue, raising L492bn, to provide additional funds for the Rinascente takeover. Lex, Page 20</p>

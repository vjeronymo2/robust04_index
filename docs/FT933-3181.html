			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No way to warn about profits Sir, How sad that brokers (S G Warburg excepted) did not receive until early on the morning of Monday September 6 a copy of a letter to Thorn EMI's shareholders from the company's chairman ('Surprise at Thorn disclosure', September 7). They should count themselves lucky to have had access to a copy available for inspection in the Stock Exchange on that day. That letter, which has been largely responsible for a fall in the share price, was allegedly posted on Friday September 3. By second class post. The copy to a shareholder in this house arrived on September 9 with no postmark. As far as the shareholder is concerned, until accounts of the matter were available in newspapers on Tuesday, everybody else was indulging in insider dealing. The matter does warrant some sort of inquiry, and afterwards, some action. Cynical shareholders will laugh up their sleeves at the thought of uninformed brokers, while simultaneously demanding that individual shareholders, as members of the company, deserve better than a second-class letter that takes nearly a week to arrive.

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: GM media purchasing brought under one roof General Motors, the world's biggest car maker, yesterday announced that all its media-buying activities - with an estimated annual spend approaching Dollars 1bn a year - were to be consolidated under the umbrella of Interpublic, the world's second largest group of advertising agencies. At present GM's media buying is split between several agencies. Two of them  -Lintas: Worldwide and McCann-Erickson - are Interpublic subsidiaries. The two biggest losers from the new arrangement are believed to be Leo Burnett and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. Two units will be formed within Interpublic to look after the GM account, one of them will deal with television buying and the other print buying. The new national broadcast unit will be headed by Mr Marc Goldstein, currently executive vice-president and director of national broadcast media and planning at Lintas: USA. The print buying unit will be headed by Ms Karen Ritchie, presently senior vice-president and director of media services for McCann-Erickson Detroit. Until a few years ago each GM division handled its own media buying, but in 1986 the group started consolidating this activity in the search for greater efficiency. However, GM said divisions would still independently employ advertising agencies to create and develop campaigns for GM products.</p>

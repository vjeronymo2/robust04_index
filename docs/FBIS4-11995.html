			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jamal Khashuqji from Jeddah; Algerian names as published] </F>   [Excerpt] The dissolved Algerian group of the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] has asserted that it has not pledged to  halt violence.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS  Executive Committee operating abroad, has said, in the first  press statement since the German authorities ordered him to halt  his political activities, that FIS leaders have not made any  commitments to President Zeroual to halt "armed action." He  added that FIS leaders have not made any decision in this regard  contingent upon consultations with free FIS leaders.    The FIS reaction came less than 24 hours after the Algerian  Presidential Office announced that Major General Zeroual had  held personal contacts with the jailed FIS leaders, who asked  Sheiks Ali Jedi and Abd el Qader Bou Khamkham to work to stop  the violence.    In a related development, informed Algerian sources informed  AL-HAYAH that the Algerian Army continues to "initiate" battles  with armed group members, and that it is waging "a calculated"  war against them. The Army's withdrawal from a certain area,  the sources continued, does not mean that it is incapable of  confronting these groups. Any military move hinges upon a  full-blown and calculated plan, the sources maintained.    The sources declined to delve into military details.  Nonetheless, they underscored the Army's cohesion, unity, and  ability to keep things under control. They noted that the Army  is currently engaged in large-scale pursuit operations against  gunmen.

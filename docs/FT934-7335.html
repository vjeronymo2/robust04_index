			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Trade data lift growth hopes: Non-EU deficit at lowest level since 1988 BRITAIN'S trade deficit with countries outside the European Union fell last month to its lowest level since January 1988, according to figures published yesterday, wrapping up a week of economic statistics that have been far better than expected. News that the trade gap with non-EU countries narrowed sharply to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 293m in October from Pounds 921m in September reinforced the picture of an economy enjoying steady growth, with few price pressures and which is slowly increasing its share of export markets. It came after Thursday's announcement of an unexpectedly sharp fall of 49,000 in the total of unemployed last month and Wednesday's news that inflation had dropped to 1.4 per cent in October from 1.8 per cent the month before. The week's most disappointing figure - the disclosure on Tuesday that the government is still heading towards a Pounds 50bn budget deficit for 1993-94 after borrowing Pounds 2.7bn in October - will have done nothing to dissuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, from raising taxes in his Budget. But City economists said yesterday that the week's other news - of weak money supply growth, subdued bank lending and slower retail sales growth in October - should leave the chancellor free to cut bank base rates to help counter the impact of any fiscal tightening. The Central Statistical Office yesterday confirmed that the economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, with gross domestic product 1.9 per cent higher than a year ago. Consumer spending was the main engine of growth, advancing 0.9 per cent in the quarter and 2.4 per cent compared with last year. But improved exports also supported activity. Investment rose slightly, with provisional estimates pointing to a 5 per cent increase in manufacturing investment compared with the second quarter and 2 per growth compared with the same period of last year. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the economic outlook was especially good compared with expectations at the time of the March Budget. 'Output growth is firmer, inflation weaker, unemployment lower and the trade deficit better behaved than people anticipated,' he said. However, Mr Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers International, warned that a week of 'astonishingly good figures' did not necessarily mean that the economy's problems were over. Some economists were sceptical about the reliability of the trade statistics. Mr John Marsland, UK economist at brokers UBS, said the sharp 11 per cent rise in export volumes between September and October reflected 'an unusual bounce' in car exports. The Treasury also sounded a note of caution about the big drop in the October non-EU trade deficit and warned against placing too much emphasis on one month's figures. But it said the GDP figures 'confirm the preliminary view that recovery is continuing across a broad front'. Spending on cars, Page 6 Budget crunch, Page 8 Lex, Page 24</p>

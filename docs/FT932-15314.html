			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / NatWest in talks on link-up with two continental banks NATIONAL Westminster, the UK's second largest bank, is in talks with Societe Generale of France and Commerzbank of Germany about co-operating on providing improved services to small businesses and personal customers. The bank said yesterday it was exploring two possible joint initiatives: Linking the payment systems of the three banks, so that all customers can make cheaper transfers of funds between France, Germany and the UK. Allowing the three banks' medium-size corporate customers to have access to the full range of services provided by the banks. 'Talks are at a very preliminary stage,' NatWest said. No decision had been taken on whether the banks' computer systems for funds transfers should be connected or if any linkage should be 'less formal'. However, plans to combine the banks' services for medium-size companies are better developed. NatWest said the intention was that any medium-size corporate customer of the UK bank should be able to use the services of Commerzbank in Germany or Societe Generale in France, if that customer is planning to do business in those countries. Many businesses complain about the difficulty and expense of obtaining banking services on the continent. To date, bank initiatives to take advantage of the single European Community market in financial services - which was created at the beginning of this year - have been modest. The NatWest proposal conforms with a general banking trend. Banks have been reluctant to acquire branches in large numbers of European countries. Their preference has been to co-operate on specific projects with other European banks. Last year, Royal Bank of Scotland launched an electronic system, IBOS, linking its branches with those of Credit Commercial de France, Spain's Banco Santander and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. IBOS guarantees a 'same-day' transfer of funds between accounts at the member banks. Royal Bank purchase, Page 23 Bank disposal, Page 24</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister  of protection of the environment and natural resources, held  talks with Japanese Ambassador to Russia Koji Watanabe on 4  April. In the talks, the minister stated that a decision on  dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into the sea should be made  only by the Russian Government, and that the Maritime Kray  administration has no authority to independently decide on the  issue. Minister Danilov- Danilyan made the remarks in response  to Ambassador Watanabe's concern over Japanese media reports  that the Maritime Kray administration seems to be preparing to  authorize additional dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into  the Sea of Japan.    In proposing that Japan provide financial and technological  assistance to Russia at an opportune time, Minister  Danilov-Danilyan stated that it would be possible for Russia to  completely prevent the dumping of liquid radioactive wastes into  the sea if it can construct temporary tanks for storing the  radioactive wastes in the maritime region with Japanese  cooperation. In the meeting with Ambassador Watanabe on 4  April, Minister Danilov-Danilyan highly appraised Japan's  cooperative position in the field of dealing with nuclear  wastes. Moreover, the minister assured that Russia would  conduct a thorough environmental survey at storage tanks for  liquid radioactive wastes as well as facilities for solidifying  these wastes.</p>

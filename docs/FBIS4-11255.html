			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign ministers of Latin American countries are  meeting in Sao Paulo with their European Union [EU]  counterparts. This is the first time such a meeting has been  held in Brazil. Issues ranging from economy to nuclear  disarmament will be discussed.    Brazil was chosen to host the fourth ministerial meeting  between European and Latin American countries because the Latin  American Parliament, Parlatino, is headquartered here. Army  policemen supported by military policemen are handling security  because the Federal Police are on strike. The 25 foreign  ministers, all of them interested in finding common solutions to  comparable problems being faced by their countries, are meeting  at the Parlatino building. The main topics to be discussed  during this meeting -- which will end tomorrow -- are democracy,  disarmament, non-proliferation of atomic weapons and, naturally,  economic growth.    Minister Celso Amorim has said that the Common Market of the  South, Mercosur -- which is as yet only partially operational --  has already succeeded in quadrupling trade among South American  countries. Amorim thinks this fact proves that through  understanding and mutual assistance, sustained and continuous  development can be achieved in any country.    [Begin Amorim recording] Mercosur is an integration model  that seeks to follow the example of the EU. We have a great  deal to learn from them. This is an important issue that will  be discussed here. [end recording]</p>

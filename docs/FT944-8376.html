			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder sees mid-term fall Goodman Fielder, the ailing Australian food company, yesterday warned shareholders that first-half profits in the current year would fall, although an improved second half should produce a full-year increase. The news of continuing poor performance - described by the chairman, Mr John Studdy, as unacceptable - was given to investors at the com-pany's annual meeting in Sydney yesterday, setting the scene for three hours of stormy proceedings. At the meeting, shareholders voted down the proposed appointment of Mr Neil Lister to the board, although Mr Studdy subsequently asked for a poll, the results of which will be announced on Monday. Mr Lister is one of the three new board appointees which Goodman agreed to accept as part of a deal with unhappy institutional investors in September. Mr Lister is a director of Agrifoods, the privately-owned business belonging to Mr Doug Shears, a Melbourne-based businessman. Mr Shears received a small stake in Goodman when his Uncle Toby's business was acquired by the quoted group. The objection to Mr Lister as a director came after one shareholder pointed out that he - along with Mr Shears - had been directors of another company which went into receivership in 1990. The reappointment of Mr Donald Hughes as a director proved contentious, with some shareholders arguing that he had been part of the board which approved generous, non-performance-related remuneration packages for now-departed executives. However, Mr Hughes was finally re-elected on a show of hands.</p>

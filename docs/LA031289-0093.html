			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO RUNOFF CANDIDATE MAY ASK FOR RECOUNT  </P> <P> Valerie Dombrowski, who missed an outright victory by only four votes in  Redondo Beach's municipal elections Tuesday, says she may ask for a recount of  the ballots cast for her and opponent Terry Ward in the District 4 City Council  race.  </P> <P> "I'm seriously contemplating it," she said Friday after an infusion of 20  disputed ballots in the city's vote totals failed to push her over the  50%-plus-1 mark needed to avoid a May 16 runoff and be declared the winner.  </P> <P> Election officials added the ballots after the county registrar-recorder's  office verified the signatures. They were among 24 ballots pulled aside by  polling place inspectors, mostly because the names of the voters did not appear  on precinct rosters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conferring With Backers  </P> <P> Dombrowski said she would confer with her supporters over the weekend,  particularly about the cost of a recount, and then make her decision after the  election canvass is completed and accepted by the council Tuesday.  </P> <P> City Clerk John Oliver estimated the recount cost for District 4 at $250. The  cost would be paid by the person requesting the recount, unless it changes the  outcome of the election, in which case the city pays, he said. He said such  requests must be made within five calendar days of the election certification.  </P> <P> Oliver said four of the 20 disputed ballots were cast in District 4, with  Dombrowski and Ward each receiving two. The new count left her with 467 votes  and Ward with 419.  </P> <P> "Four votes is awfully close," Ward said. "I wouldn't blame Val if she asks for  a recount."  </P> <P> But if the runoff is still on, Ward added, "I'll be out there working hard to  win in May. I've learned a lot, and with a little change in strategy, I think  I've got a real good shot at winning."  </P> <P> In the school board race for two seats, the 20 disputed ballots left incumbent  Howard Huizing an unofficial winner with nine votes more than third-place  challenger Andrew Deliman. That was a gain of one vote for Huizing.  </P> <P> Incumbent Rebecca Sargent easily won reelection to the other seat on the  Redondo Beach City School District board.  </P> <P> Deliman said Friday that he does not plan to ask for a recount since he thinks  it "highly unlikely" that the election computers made enough mistakes to  reverse the outcome.  </P> <P> The disputed ballots did not affect the District 2 council race, which will  continue into the runoff with incumbent Kay Horrell facing challenger Michael  F. Ford, or the mayoral runoff between candidates Brad Parton and Frank  Bostrom.  </P></p>

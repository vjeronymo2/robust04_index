			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> FIRE DESTROYS HOME AT TREASURE ISLAND  </P> <P> A fire destroyed a seaside mobile home Wednesday, causing $35,000 damage and  killing two pet birds, Laguna Beach fire officials said.  </P> <P> Battalion Chief Joe McClure said no one was injured in the 8:42 a.m. blaze at  the Treasure Island Trailer Park, 30801 Coast Highway, which began while owner  Vicki Wantland was at work.  </P> <P> No other structures were damaged in the five-minute fire, which shot out  through the windows and was fueled in part by the mobile home's wooden  paneling, he said.  </P> <P> Wantland's two pet cockatiels died in the fire, McClure said.  </P> <P> The fire appears to have started because a fireplace in the structure was aged  and cracked, allowing heat to penetrate to a wall, McClure said.  </P> <P> "The heat over the years had turned the wood in the wall to become like  charcoal and have a fairly low ignition (temperature)," he said.  </P> <P> He said homeowners should periodically inspect fireplace mortar by poking it  with a screwdriver to check for brittleness.  </P> <P> "If it appears weak, they should contact a masonry contractor and have it  repaired," he said.

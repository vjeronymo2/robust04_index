Thus, business circles are showing active moves  to expand trade and investment in North Korea.    Conglomerates that have received invitations from North  Korea  or have applied to visit North Korea including Hyundai, Samsung,  Daewoo, and Lucky-Gold Star are aiming at once again examining  their North Korean-related business projects that have been laid  aside.    In 1993, Daewoo received approval from the National  Unification Board to carry out South-North economic cooperation.  When Daewoo Chairman Kim U-chung visited North Korea in 1992,  he met then-Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon and concluded a contract  to promote nine pilot projects. Therefore, if the opportunity  comes, Daewoo is ready to jump into the projects with North  Korea.    In particular, Daewoo is planning first of all to start the  project of developing the Nampo complex which is near Pyongyang  and only five minutes away from the sea.    Rather than concentrating on heavy industry, Daewoo's  strategy is to actively use North Korea's cheap labor to produce  textile products and daily necessities of life such as blouses,  jackets, and bags.    Based on the economic cooperation established with China,  Samsung is showing high interest in the Tumen River development  project; the road construction linking Jilin Province, China and  Chongjin; and the project to develop Najin-Sonbong.    It was learned that in this connection, about one month ago,  Samsung invited officials of the Jilin Provincial team dealing  with economic cooperation between China and North Korea to the  ROK and held deep discussions on jointly developing key  industries such as railway, road, harbor, and communications.    It was learned that during the meeting a Chinese official  said: "North Korea conveyed through an unofficial channel to  China of the position that it will be possible for businesses  advancing into North Korea to operate and possess property in a  capitalistic way."    Samsung is also promoting at the same time the establishment  of joint venture plants in producing sweaters, foodstuff, and  electronic products.    Hyundai's Honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong visited North  Korea in 1989 and held discussions on the development of making  North Korea's Mt. Kumgang and Myongsasimni tourist attractions  and on the Wonsan Bay railway project. Currently, it is  promoting large-scale projects. It is also promoting to  establish a cotton textile plant.    Lucky-Gold Star has been producing and selling working  clothes and men's suits in the form of processing-on-commission  trade in North Korea from 1993. In the long run, Lucky-Gold  Star's goal is to advance into North Korea in the field of  electricity, electronics, and synthetic fiber which are its main  business forces.    Sunkyong is promoting to establish a joint venture marine  products processing plant, and a clothing and sewing plant.  Ssangyong is promoting to establish a joint venture shoe plant  and marine products processing plant.    Forty other domestic businesses including Miwon, Hyosong,  and  Kolon are planning to carry out foodstuff business and  establishment of department stores and textile plants in North  Korea.    An official of Lucky-Gold Star said: "The greatest barrier  in economic cooperation with North Korea is the fact that  businessmen and technicians are not able to go to North Korea.  Since economic cooperation is dependent on the political  situation, there is no stability in investment."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the "Azerbaijan" rubric: </F> "Gyandzha Under Threat. Republic's Second-Largest City  Threatened by Major Armenian Offensive"]    [Text] According to an Azerbaijan Defense Ministry report,  in the past few days Armenian troops have launched a large-scale  offensive in northeastern Nagorno-Karabakh, involving a great  number of tanks and armored personnel carriers. Although the  Defense Ministry still claims that the Azerbaijani troops have  been able to withstand the onslaught of the Armenian forces,  your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from  confidential sources that the Armenian troops have advanced a  few kilometers toward the district capital of Geranboy (Shaumyan  -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) adjoining the Agderin (Mardakert --  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) district of Nagorno- Karabakh. It is well  known that the Geranboy district, which was recaptured by  Azerbaijan in a successful offensive in summer 1992, is  strategically important as a town located in direct proximity to  Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Gyandzha. The district's  possible capture by Armenian troops would, therefore, pose a  real threat to Gyandzha.    Observers in Baku point to the fact that the Armenian  troops'  offensive on the Gyandzha axis was launched right after Armenian  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan paid a visit to Moscow 8 April in  an atmosphere of strictest secrecy. According to reports from  sources in the Azerbaijan leadership, during his talks with  Russian leaders Ter-Petrosyan spoke about the possibility of  exerting military pressure on Baku so that it will soften its  stance on Russia's peace plan for Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan,  which, among other things, calls for Russian troops to be  brought to Azerbaijan as peacekeeping forces, was spurned by the  Baku authorities as violating the republic's sovereignty. In  addition, Baku was somewhat worried by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's edict on setting up Russian military bases on the CIS  countries' territory. Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi  Mamedov has stated that "none of external forces will manage to  impose on Azerbaijan the deployment of foreign bases on the  republic's territory."    Thus, on the eve of the meeting of the Council of CIS Heads  of State, scheduled to take place in Moscow 15 April, a fairly  critical situation is coming about in relations between Baku and  Yerevan, and a certain tension is felt in Russian-Azerbaijani  relations. To all appearances, Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev  will try to draw his CIS partners' attention to the stepping up  of hostilities on Azerbaijani territory by the Armenian troops.</p>

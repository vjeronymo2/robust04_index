			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA CALLS FOR RADON TESTING IN U.S. SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Sounding a new alarm about indoor air pollution, the Environmental Protection  Agency warned Thursday that unhealthy levels of radon have been detected in the  nation's schools and urged officials nationwide to test schoolrooms for  possible contamination by the cancer-causing gas.  </P> <P> The extraordinary health alert, issued by EPA Administrator William K. Reilly,  was based on preliminary results of an agency survey that found hazardous  levels of radioactive radon in more than half of the 130 schools tested in 16  states.  </P> <P> California's top public health official, reacting angrily to the sweeping  directive, contended that the recommendations could create "unfounded fear and  anxiety" in the state, where previous studies have indicated that radon is not  a major public health concern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Not Included  </P> <P> Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services, noted in  a letter to Riley that the EPA study did not include any California schools and  that the state's own survey of 29 schools had not found any hazardous levels of  the gas.  </P> <P> State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Thursday that he sees no  reason for alarm in California. Based on information provided to the state  Department of Education by the EPA and the state Department of Health Services  last fall, Honig said, school districts were advised that there was "little  likelihood that radon was a problem" in most of the state's public schools.  </P> <P> However, because of the latest EPA warning, Honig said he soon will be sending  a letter to school districts "outlining the conditions under which schools may  be exposed to elevated levels of radon" and providing guidelines for further  study.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District began testing schools for radon in  January, chief safety officer Susie Wong said. The district placed 300  detectors in classrooms in 80 schools. The detectors were collected Thursday  and will be sent to a laboratory today for analysis. The results are expected  in May.  </P> <P> "We did our testing to find out what kinds of levels our kids are being exposed  to," Wong said. "We hope it's not a problem, but we want to confirm that it  isn't."  </P> <P> The stern EPA warning reaffirmed a statement released by the agency last  autumn, when it joined Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in issuing a health  advisory exhorting homeowners across the nation to test their residences for  radon.  </P> <P> Far too few individuals have heeded that advice, Reilly declared. He said the  survey of schools raises new concerns about the danger radon poses to children,  who are believed to be particularly susceptible to the ill effects of the  radioactive gas.  </P> <P> In making the health advisory public, Reilly acknowledged that it was based on  preliminary and incomplete research. But he emphasized that the data collected  was so troublesome and the risks so severe that remedial efforts should not be  delayed until a more comprehensive survey is completed.  </P> <P> "The risks posed by radon gas are very real," Reilly told the National Press  Club. "But with a little thoughtful effort, we can solve this problem with  relative ease."  </P> <P> Critics of the EPA's findings say they could grossly exaggerate actual radon  levels because they are based on 24-hour monitoring even though radon levels  ebb and flow throughout the year.  </P> <P> Experts call radon the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States  and blame it for 15,000 deaths a year.  </P> <P> An odorless, colorless gas, radon is produced by the radioactive decay of  uranium and seeps naturally from the soil. Although it usually escapes  harmlessly into the environment, the gas can reach dangerously high  concentrations when contained by man-made structures.  </P> <P> The severity of the radon threat varies geographically according to the uranium  content of the soil. For example, the EPA estimates that radon levels exceed  healthful limits in 10% to 15% of American households. But a Times survey last  year indicated that radon levels exceed healthful limits in only about 1.2% of  Southern California homes.  </P> <P> In the EPA survey, 54% of schools tested -- and at least one in each of the 16  states -- was found to contain one or more rooms in which radon levels exceeded  the EPA limit of four picocuries per liter. Exposure to that concentration of  radon is believed to pose a cancer risk equal to that of smoking half a pack of  cigarettes a day.  </P> <P> The highest reading, in a Tennessee school, was 136 picocuries -- an exposure  equivalent to that of a four-pack-a-day smoker.  </P> <P> Such health hazards, Reilly said, are "significantly higher" than the risks  that the agency usually addresses in regulating such substances as pesticides.  </P> <P> Children are believed to face an even higher risk of exposure to radon than do  adults because of their small lung capacity and high breathing rates, according  to an EPA report. And because of their youth, radiation-induced cancer can  develop over many years.  </P> <P> The EPA recommendation calls on schools to test all frequently used rooms on  basement and ground-level floors, where radon most often accumulates. The  agency recommended that the testing be conducted during cooler months, when  doors and windows are more likely to be closed, allowing radon to accumulate  more easily.  </P> <P> No federal funding is to be provided for the recommended radon testing, which  Reilly estimated would cost a "few hundred dollars" per school site.  </P> <P> Only limited federal resources are available for schools seeking to eliminate  radon contamination, a process that usually involves improving ventilation to  allow the gas to dissipate more quickly.  </P> <P> In a statement critical of the EPA recommendations, California health director  Kizer declared that "testing every classroom in this state would be a marked  waste of money."  </P> <P> The state's survey, which took 373 samples from 29 schools in 19 counties,  found radon concentrations to be below detectable limits in 59% of the samples  collected. None of the schools exceeded the four picocurie limit.  </P> <P> Although the EPA study did not include California schools, it did monitor six  sites in Nevada. The highest radon measurements there were among the lowest in  the nation, tied with Indiana and Kansas. The most hazardous radon levels were  found in Tennessee, Washington, Montana and New Mexico.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Noel K. Wilson in Sacramento and Elaine Woo in Los Angeles  contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RADON IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS  </P> <P>  The California Department of Health Services tested for radon levels in 29  schools in 19 counties around the state. None of the samples exceeded 4  picocuries per liter, the level above which the federal Environmental  Protection Agency recommends taking action. Below are the mean levels expressed  in picocuries per liter found in schools in five Southern California counties.  These readings are for a 24-hour period and do not necessarily represent actual  year-around exposures.  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Castle Bay Lane: 0.58  </P> <P> Point Fermin Elementary: 0.84  </P> <P> Sierra Vista Elementary: 0.30  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE  </P> <P> Adams Elementary: 0.37  </P> <P> Hemmerling Elementary: 0.25  </P> <P> Landau Elementary: 0.36  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO  </P> <P> Adult Education Center: 0.53  </P> <P> Mary Tone Elementary: 0.99  </P> <P> McKinley Elementary: 0.35  </P> <P> Newman Elementary: 0.30  </P> <P> Park View Elementary: 0.28  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Pomerado Elementary: 0.56  </P> <P> VENTURA  </P> <P> Atherwood Elementary: 0.27  </P> <P> Rio Mesa High: 0.25  </P></p>

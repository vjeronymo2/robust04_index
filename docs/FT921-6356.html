			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Currency, asset and debt problems aired A JOINT committee of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians met yesterday in Kiev to discuss the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency and the division of the former Soviet Union's debts and assets, Chrystia Freeland writes from Kiev. Swimming against the current of the present troubled relationship between Ukraine and Russia, the committee is expected to produce a joint communique today outlining a mutually acceptable mechanism for the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency, due this summer. Seeking to defuse Russian worries that the introduction of the new currency will set off an inflationary wave of roubles into Russia, the Ukraine is reportedly offering to withdraw roubles from circulation and hand them over to Russia. An agreement on the division of debts and assets may prove more elusive as Russia's absence from a debt conference in Kiev earlier this week suggested.</p>

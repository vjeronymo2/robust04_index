			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Chechen Republic President Dzhokhar Dudayev </F> by Vakhtang Dzhanashiya, under the rubric "Separatists"; place  and date not given: "The Dark, the Secret, the Imperial...  Dzhokhar Dudayev Unmasks the Culprits in All Troubles"]    [Text] [Dzhanashiya] Dzhokhar, the situation in Chechnya is  very aggravated...    [Dudayev] We have operational data to the effect that the  secret chancery has prepared a scenario that will unfold within  days. Here, in Groznyy, they kill, slash, and bayonet, and do  nothing else. We should make a choice: Either to lead the  nations to rebuff any aggression that the personnel of the  secret, dark imperial chancery are preparing, or surrender  voluntarily into colonial slavery for yet another century. There  is nothing in between in this instance. The supreme command of  all special services, including the Armed Forces, and Yeltsin's  team have developed a scenario for a blockade and stepped-up  terrorism and subversion within Chechnya, with combat action  beginning subsequently. There are some young gung-ho generals  who are saying: "I will enter Chechnya!" However, they should be  asked how they will withdraw. They have already entered Chechnya  and Afghanistan many times, but they have withdrawn badly. They  have withdrawn very badly.    [Dzhanashiya] With some justification, they are apprehensive  about the "first shot" in Chechnya, where the blood-feud  tradition is strong and there are many weapons.    [Dudayev] An assessment of the situation, a projection, an  analysis, and a civic position--and in this case, there should  be no shooting, no woes, and no tears. This is the strongest  weapon of the time. Moscow is stuffing all republics of the  Caucasus with weapons on all pretexts for subversion and for  fueling wars. Later, disinformation is spread to the effect that  the weapons came from Chechnya, as if they were produced here  rather than in Russia. Chechnya itself fights the importation of  weapons, fights thousands of units of weapons, drugs, and funds.  These weapons are being spread in precisely the same manner  throughout the Caucasus--everybody is being stuffed with nuclear  charges. The secret chancery is perfecting the fueling of enmity  between peoples along national, territorial, ethnic, cultural,  and spiritual lines. There will be no mercy, just as there has  been none to date. The last aggressive forces of the imperial  chancery have put everything at stake to maintain  totalitarianism at any price, to break the will of democracy for  a normal life among the nations in this imperfect world by the  methods of intimidation, physical violence, terror, subversion,  and provocations. This is my position, and may the Almighty  grant us that everything will be brighter then I expect.    [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific, substantiated complaints  about the leadership of Russia?    [Dudayev] We should grasp clearly that methods used by the  so-called "new democratic forces" are so sophisticated and  perfidious that the mentality of a Soviet man is not prepared  for them. When Yeltsin and his team fought the empire of the  USSR, all nations of the Caucasus, and not just the Caucasus,  supported these endeavors. This is how democracy won. The  nations of the Caucasus stood in the same ranks with democracy,  and many manned the barricades. It was a most profound delusion  that days of a democratic thaw would come as soon as the Supreme  Soviet, which was so easily and simply shot up, became a thing  of the past. It turns out that a draft of the new constitution,  new far-fetched elections were being prepared in the dark  offices contrary to all common sense and laws of human  community. These elections are not legitimate in any way based  on a multitude of attributes of international law, absolutely  not legitimate. Their objective is simple: to suppress the will  of Caucasians through the force of physical pressure so that  they will obey the dictatorship of power of the new empire. It  is no accident that a few days ago a film about the training of  the internal troops was shown on TV in which it was  blasphemously announced that these guys had been in Khodzhaly,  Tajikistan, and Ingushetia. There were the same painted mugs,  the same bad element, the same brutal faces covered from the  camera, the same scenario. We should decide: either civil  courage, or slavery; and we should make this decision in the  most severe times of provocations, subversion, and terror on an  immense scale, emanating from the secret black chancery of the  former empire. This chancery has no intention of sparing the  nations, including the Russian, in order to once again throw the  people on their knees at any price, and onto the path of a  totalitarian regime in a new cycle of so-called democracy. I  will venture to assure you--no mercy will be shown. Such are the  realities.    [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific constructive proposals  for  improving relations with Russia?    [Dudayev] My specific proposals are outlined in the book  Thorny Path to Freedom, which has been published. The  main point is the recognition of the independence of Chechnya.    [Dzhanashiya] What is your attitude toward the CNC  [Confederation of the Nations of the Caucasus]?    [Dudayev] This is the only force that has stabilized the  situation in the entire Caucasus to some degree, and I attach  great hopes to it. I raised at a CNC congress the issue of  granting the status of Supreme Soviet deputies of their  republics to members of the CNC parliament in the republics of  Northern Caucasus.    [Dzhanashiya] Most nations of the CNC are in favor of  staying  within Russia. At the same time, you are resolutely fighting for  independence. Is there not a contradiction?    [Dudayev] Oh no. The expression of the will of the people  should be the foundation. If a nation wants to belong to  Russia--Godspeed! If the Chechens do not want to, there should  be "Godspeed" too! However, it is very hard to be together with  the current Russia, in which subversion, terrorism, and  provocation have been elevated to the rank of a state policy. I  do not know who voluntarily wants to go there, into such a  Russia. Let Russia achieve legitimacy and democratic legal  institutions, let it become capable of respecting its own laws,  primarily within itself, and later it will be possible to  conduct a dialogue with it concerning mutual relations.    [Dzhanashiya] To your mind, what are the prospects for the  development of the Caucasus situation?    [Dudayev] The Caucasus is, after all, the oldest  civilization  on the globe in the last 50 million years. The civilization of  the future should belong to it. It is precisely the nations of  the Caucasus that have preserved the ages-old traditions of  morality, spirituality, humanity, philanthropy, tactfulness, and  intellect. The Almighty is preserving this genetic pool in order  to regulate normal relations in the future. The stimulator of  mutual relations for the world is here, in the Caucasus. All of  this through freedom. Freedom is the loftiest possession of man.</p>

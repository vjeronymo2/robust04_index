			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING / DAN STANTON;  </P> <P> ANGLER DONATES BIG SHEEPHEAD TO MUSEUM  </P> <P> Bob Oyama of Long Beach has donated another fish to the Cabrillo Marine Museum.  </P> <P> Oyama, who was fishing for yellowtail Monday aboard the Matt Walsh at the  rockpile, sent his bait toward the bottom and hooked the largest sheephead of  the year.  </P> <P> The fish was netted and placed in a bait tank. After the boat docked, the  museum truck picked up the fish and transported it to the museum.  </P> <P> Oyama has donated fish to the museum on several occasions.  </P> <P> The male sheephead weighs 23 1/2 pounds and is on display at the museum in San  Pedro. Its brilliant orange and black coloring lights up the display tank.  </P> <P> Jack Wright of Redondo Beach was trolling in his skiff three miles out from  Redondo Pier when he got a strike.  </P> <P> Wright stopped his outboard motor as the fish was moving his small skiff toward  shore.  </P> <P> After 15 minutes, he was able to reel the fish to the surface and described it  as the largest bonito he had landed while trolling. It weighed 8 pounds, 2  ounces.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: The whopper of the week was hooked by Ted Thaser of West Los  Angeles. He was fishing aboard the Blackjack off Santa Barbara Island and  caught and released a black sea bass that was estimated to weigh more than 300  pounds.  </P> <P> Marc Sonodra of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Outerlimits, caught a 45-pound  bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Bob Zimmer of Long Beach, fishing at horseshoe kelp aboard the Sportking,  caught a 28-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Richard Hollaway of Gardena, fishing aboard the Freedom off San Clemente  Island, caught a 26-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Sonny Bennett of Marina del Rey, fishing from his skiff at the deep hole,  caught a 26-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Gary DuBoise of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Southern Cal, caught an 18-pound  white sea bass.  </P> <P> Mike Hagmaier of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Victory, caught an 18-pound  white sea bass.  </P> <P> Fish Reports: Local fishing for exotics has made a drastic change. A  late-season run of barracuda started over the weekend with some decent-size  fish up to 10 pounds being caught.  </P> <P> The local yellowtail bite seems to have leveled off. Tanner Bank trips continue  to produce yellowtail and some bluefin tuna.  </P> <P> Halibut fishing in Santa Monica Bay is showing improvement and anglers are  catching a mixed bag of bass and yellowtail at the outer islands.  </P> <P> At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Happyman, on a half-day trip, returned with  12 halibut, 40 sculpin and 20 bonito.  </P> <P> The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught 13 halibut, 65 sculpin, 35 sand  bass and five calico bass.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod trip resulted in a catch of 250 rock cod, three cow cod  and a lingcod.  </P> <P> The Sumo worked the deep rocks and returned with 120 rock cod and 11 sheephead.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished rocky point and anglers sacked  142 sculpin, 27 bonito and 15 sheephead.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo, on a half-day trip, returned with 55 calico bass and 22  sculpin.  </P> <P> The Blackjack fished Santa Barbara Island for 35 calico bass, 19 yellowtail and  17 sheephead.  </P> <P> The Isle of Redondo had a weekend total of 190 mackerel, 36 rockfish and six  bonito.  </P> <P> At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked Catalina Island and had a  variety catch of 141 blue perch, 97 calico bass, 91 bonito, 10 sheephead and a  halibut.  </P></p>

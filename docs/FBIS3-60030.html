The two Americans, identified as Yahya Ali Salim, 41, John  Charles Hulten, 29, and Daniel Game Mungah, 28, from Barbados,  were arrested in downtown Bangkok when police stopped a taxi  they were traveling in.    Police said they seized 1.3 kilograms (2.86 pounds) of  heroin.    In Thailand convicted drug traffickers face death penalty,  but the sentence is usually commuted to a lengthy prison term.    About two-thirds of the 1,200 foreigners in Thai jails have  been jailed for drug offences.</p>

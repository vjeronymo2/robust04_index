			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson expands via Pro Performance acquisition Owen &amp; Robinson, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer, has agreed to acquire 38 leasehold outlets from SSL Retail, a subsidiary of Sears, the speciality retail and home shopping group. Consideration will amount to a maximum of Pounds 1.06m cash, satisfied from existing resources. The outlets operate under the Pro Performance banner, and currently sell sports clothing and equipment, as well as footwear. They will be integrated into Owen &amp; Robinson's existing Foothold operation, raising the chain to 53 outlets and extending its presence nation-wide. Mr Liam Strong, Sears chief executive, said the sale would reduce the group's exposure to the sports footwear market 'which continues to decline' and allow it to concentrate on its Olympus offshoot. Sears will book a loss on disposal of some Pounds 5.8m although this will be more than offset by the release of provisions no longer required.</p>

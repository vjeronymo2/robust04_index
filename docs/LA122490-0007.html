			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S WATER PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The Metropolitan Water District water rationing plan will take effect in  February (Part A, Dec. 12). I hope that, before imposing local rationing and  penalties for overuse, Mayor Bradley, the City Council and the county Board of  Supervisors will remember to rescind (or cancel if still pending) the permits  for Playa Vista, Porter Ranch, the Farmer's Market development, the Marina  Triangle, the UCLA expansion and all the hundreds of other huge extravagant  projects now on the books and approved or pending.  </P> <P> All of them would use millions of gallons of water, require hundreds of  thousands of new sewer hookups to an already overburdened system and produce  insane additions to traffic congestion. Even now we have no extra water, no  more room on streets and freeways, and certainly not enough clean air to go  around.  </P> <P> ALICE MCGAUGHEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

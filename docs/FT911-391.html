			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Take care, volatile funds at large - A look at the ground broken by new investment rules for unit trusts NEW INVESTMENT rules for unit trusts unveiled by the Securities and Investments Board earlier this month have opened the way for mutual funds which concentrate on futures and options. Investors should tread carefully, because the rules are sure to prompt the launch of some highly geared and volatile funds. For example, a fund which invested 20 per cent of its assets (the maximum which can be invested in futures and options under the SIB rules) in the FT-SE 100 futures contract would be geared to around 700 per cent. This means that the assets of the fund would be completely wiped-out by just a 15 per cent fall in the UK equity market. However, the mainstream of the UK unit trust industry is taking a cautious approach. Many funds to be launched later this year are likely to maintain relatively low gearing and to spread their investment in futures and options across markets. Unlike the US, where futures funds play a whole range of financial and commodity markets, most UK fund managers said that they will concentrate on areas they know - equities, bonds and currencies. While the SIB rules allow funds geared up to 800 per cent or more, few funds are likely to maintain such high levels of leverage. 'Gearing for the sake of gearing does not offer optimal investment returns,' said Alan Wren, chief executive of Prudential Holborn. Prudential Holborn expects to have its first fund ready for launch by September. Wren envisages a fund with average gearing of perhaps 20 per cent, moving up to 50 per cent on some occasions and down to zero gearing at other times. This is comparable to the level of gearing offered by investment trusts. The difference is that investment trusts take on gearing by borrowing, rather than by buying futures and options. While the details have yet to be finalised, Prudential Holborn's favoured fund strategy concentrates on an international portfolio of equities. Futures and options would be used to adjust the exposure of the fund to different markets at lower cost than buying or selling actual shares. This sentiment is echoed by Trevor Robinson of Fidelity Investments, which also favours an equity-based investment strategy. In addition to new funds, a number of the off-shore futures funds already run by UK institutions will move on-shore once the new rules are in force. For example, John Govett already runs three open-ended off-shore futures funds, which are highly geared investments. For example, the company's dollar bond fund and dollar currency fund are geared at 800 per cent. The company plans to seek a UK listing for its lower risk Managed Futures Fund, which is geared to about 400 per cent. For the UK, however, it plans only a low-risk futures fund without gearing. However, while the bigger players are initially cautious, some new highly geared funds are certain to be launched. Investors are advised to look closely at what they are buying.</p>

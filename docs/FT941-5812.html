			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity The sight of even the most sleepy regional electricity companies lining up to take pot-shots at the deregulating gas market has finally provoked a response. Currently British Gas faces loss of market share by a thousand cuts while the Recs can sit secure in their monopoly franchise markets until 1998. On top of that, the franchise market in electricity covers users ten times larger than that for gas. It is hard to argue that the Recs should be able to use their databases to pick off British Gas's customers while remaining in a cosy monopoly market - particularly when that is supplied by long term coal contracts and gas stations in which the Recs have an equity interest. So the chances are that even if the Recs object, the electricity market will be liberalised early. Losing some of the marketing supply business should not have much direct impact on profits. Most of the Recs' money is made in the natural monopoly business of distributing the electricity through their wires. It may however, have knock-on effects. The distribution review currently under way will see excess profits made in that part of the business cut back. That, combined with a squeeze on marketing, will force the Recs to make cost savings which they have so far avoided. If it also depresses market sentiment and share prices, predators may emerge. The Recs have the kind of cast iron balance sheets, cash generation and stable UK earnings which any company with an advance corporation tax problem must dream of.</p>

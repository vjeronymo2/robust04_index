			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Sell-off guide hailed The Spanish cabinet yesterday sent to parliament a set of legislative initiatives governing future privatisations and deregulating the telecommunications sector, that were hailed as 'revolutionary' by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, writes Tom Burns. The new legal framework for upcoming privatisations establishes a principle similar to that of the 'golden share' that allows the government an effective veto over decisions considered to be of strategic interest, that might in future be taken by formerly state-owned institutions. The framework sets the stage for large-scale global offerings next year by the energy group Repsol and by the Argentaria banking corporation, which are both government-controlled. The telecommunications initiative establishes guidelines for the total deregulation of the sector in Spain by 1998 and it includes a new law that will soon go before parliament setting the terms for the introduction of cable TV. Mr Gonzalez said the legislative package represented a 'cultural change' for Spain and a strategic leap forward in its competitiveness.</p>

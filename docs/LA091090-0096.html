			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA HIGH HAS NEW PRINCIPAL  </P> <P> When John Johnson was hired last month to be Brea Olinda High School's new  principal, he inherited a state-of-the-art campus and a state-of-the-economy  budget.  </P> <P> Co-principals Gary Goff and Jean Sullivan both resigned over the summer from  Brea's only high school.  </P> <P> Sullivan retired after 25 years with the district and Goff, after 30 years in  the district, left to start a consulting business.  </P> <P> The new principal must start the new school year which begins today by  introducing himself to teachers, parents and students, and by coping with  questions surrounding the effect of $700,000 in cuts the district must make  from its 1990-91 budget.  </P> <P> And despite the luxury of the $36-million campus Johnson will oversee, the high  school's share of the cuts will have an impact.  </P> <P> One of Johnson's first tasks will be to cut one custodial position, one of at  least 10 that will be made in the district. And students will study in  ultramodern science labs, but supplies will be handed out carefully.  </P> <P> "We'll have to be very conservative with supplies," Johnson said. "It's going  to be tight."  </P> <P> Johnson, who has been a junior high vice principal in Corona for five years,  said he was awed by his first look at Brea-Olinda High.  </P> <P> "The reputation of its academics is unbelievable, the campus has a wonderful  performing arts building, a beautiful stadium -- it's a marvelous facility,"  Johnson said. "It's every principal's dream." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE  </P></p>

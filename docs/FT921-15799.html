			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals producers prepare for a grim year - The Soviet collapse is likely to help keep prices depressed METALS producers are bracing themselves for another punishing year in 1992. Recovery in the US is faltering at a time when economic activity in the two remaining generators of growth - Germany and Japan - is slowing. 'The outlook for the traded metals is looking gruesome,' says Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst with the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. 'Very little industrial growth can be expected in 1992 and a second year of depressed prices does not bode well for metals producers', he adds. 'In 1991 they could to some extent live off the fat from the previous three years of high prices. Now that fat has gone.' Base metals producers have so far seen London Metal Exchange prices drop by at least 39 per cent (for copper) and as much as 63 per cent (for nickel) from the peaks reached in 1989-90. Producers once believed they were in good shape to weather the expected recession. They had used windfall profits gathered in 1988-89 to repair damaged balance sheets. Metal stocks in western markets were low, whereas in the two previous recessions there was a great deal of excess metal. That took years to absorb after the economic recoveries began. In isolation, the present downturn would have been rough enough. The two industries that use huge quantities of non-ferrous metals - automotive and construction - had an awful 1991 and remain in deep recession. Car sales in the ten largest national markets fell by nearly 7 per cent in the first nine months of 1991; the equivalent figure for commercial vehicles was nearly 8.5 per cent. Meanwhile, construction activity in the 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries dropped by 4.5 per cent year-on-year in the first half of last year and the downturn has since become more widely based. Nevertheless, production and consumption of most of the traded metals would have been roughly in balance in 1991 if it had not been for the unexpectedly fast dissolution of the Soviet Union and its eastern bloc satellites, and the unforeseen impact that had on metals markets. Eastern European imports of lead, tin and zinc dried up while the region's exports of aluminium, copper and nickel to the west grew at a frightening rate. This swing in east-west trade was almost entirely responsible for depressing metals prices, particularly as so much of the eastern European material ended up by being highly visible in London Metal Exchange stocks. Could or should the western producers have reacted more quickly by cutting output? Mr Thomas Baack, chief economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German metals and industrial group, points out that it would have been extremely difficult for producers to have moved any faster because of the lack of statistics available from the eastern bloc countries. 'Their foreign trade figures are incomplete and their production and consumption statistics in part unobtainable. This applies especially to the former Soviet Union,' he says. For example, even though the Soviet Union was a member of the United Nations Study Group on lead and zinc, it never gave production figures. There have been widespread complaints that the Soviets have been dumping metals in the west. These cannot be substantiated, suggests Mr Baack, because London Metal Exchange prices are binding for almost all transactions, whether west-west or east-west, with only minor variations. 'However, it is true that supplies from the Soviet Union are not based on domestic cost calculations but solely on the need to earn foreign currency,' he adds. So perhaps the most important issue for metals producers in 1992 is: what can be expected from the former Soviet Union? Mr Briggs at MMRS points out that the accelerating political break-up of the region makes forecasting well nigh impossible. 'But most of the same factors which led to the massive exports of the past two years, namely domestic demand collapsing faster than production and the desperate need for foreign exchange, will remain in place. 'Neither is metals consumption in eastern Europe likely to pick up in the short term. East-west trade flows will therefore almost certainly remain a bearish influence (on metals prices) in 1992.' Mr Baack is more optimistic. He suggests that the new republics cannot allow their domestic economies to continue to fall further into disrepair. Moves already are afoot in Russia to limit the export of some raw materials so that its own processing industries have enough to maintain production. In addition, the Soviet energy situation is ever more precarious and reductions in energy-intensive production processes, such as the extraction of raw materials, cannot be ruled out, says Mr Baack. 'This would probably lead to a cut in production of non-ferrous metals. It would also signify that the metal glut from the east had passed its peak.' East-west trade will not be the only factor affecting metals prices this year. Extremely low prices last year forced producers to make output cuts - all the traded metals but copper have been affected so far - and the full impact will be felt in 1992. However, Mr Briggs of MMRS suggests that more production cuts will be needed in the coming months. 'The onus will be on western producers to rein back their output in order to prevent stocks rising considerably further,' he says. Much also depends on the US economy. Economists remain generally confident that it should recover enough this year to stimulate demand for metals, particularly because consumer stocks are very low. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company, points out, however, that although the US government will do its best in an election year to kick-start the economy, the impact will not be felt until the second half of 1992. He says: 'It is difficult to see any movement (in base metals prices) except downwards or sideways'. Mr Crowson adds the usual rider about the upheavals in the former Soviet Union, and also suggests 'we should not forget China' - formerly a big importer of metals from the west. 'China might come back in a big way as a metals buyer,' he says, recalling market rumours that the recent buoyancy in copper prices was based on Chinese purchases. While China's growing industrialisation offers metals producers a glimmer of hope for 1992, Metallgesellschaft's Mr Baack offers another. He suggests: 'In view of the unpredictability of developments in the former Soviet Union, even a complete halt to supplies from this region is a possibility. And a halt to Soviet metal exports could unleash a price explosion.'</p>

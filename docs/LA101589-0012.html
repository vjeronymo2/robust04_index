			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE SACRED PIPE BLACK ELK'S ACCOUNT OF THE SEVEN RITES OF  THE OGLALA SIOUX RECORDED AND EDITED BY JOSEPH BROWN (UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA  PRESS: $7.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Black Elk, the Sioux holy man, explains the enormous importance his people  attached to what is commonly called "the peace pipe." The Sioux believed that  their ritual pipe was a gift from Wakan-Tanka, the Great Spirit, presented by  his intermediary, the White Buffalo Cow Woman. Its sacred origins made it an  essential element in tribal ceremonies involving the purification of the soul,  relations with the dead and preparations for entering womanhood. These rituals  focused on the relationships that linked humanity, the Earth, its other  inhabitants and the all-embracing Great Spirit. At a time when people are  realizing that they may have irrevocably damaged the planet, the Sioux  veneration of the Earth seems a worthwhile subject for contemplation.  </P></p>

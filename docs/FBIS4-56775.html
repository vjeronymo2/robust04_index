			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 May (PL) -- Today, the daily GRANMA  carries a decree-law empowering the government to confiscate  goods "resulting from theft, speculation, and diverting  resources," as was announced over the weekend during a meeting  of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP].    Decree-Law No. 149 establishes the "confiscation and  appropriation by the Cuban State, without any right to  compensation, of goods and income acquired by persons who have  increased their assets through the black market or the illegal  purchase or sale of goods and products.    The legislation seeks to stop money hoarders, called macetas  here (from the Spanish word mazo that means wad, referring to  the wads they hoard by exploiting the shortage of goods and  services caused by the economic crisis Cuba has been  experiencing since early this decade).    The measure is part of an economic reactivation plan that  was  outlined during an extraordinary meeting of the ANPP held last  weekend. The plan also seeks to eliminate an excess of currency  of over 11 billion pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the  official exchange rate) and a budget deficit of over 4 billion  pesos.    The decree-law, which contains nine articles, orders the  confiscation of ill-gotten goods from the "owner or holder" and  the investigation of owners and those who appear to be covert  owners.    The Republic's Attorney General and Finance Ministry will be  the institutions tasked with conducting the investigation and  confiscation [words indistinct] according to the law that voids  the legal force "of actions taken to hide the improper nature of  the acquisition of goods and income" in question.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Cold Shower From Damascus"] </F>   [Text] The Israelis were looking forward to the Syrians  too soon. The autonomy agreement with the Palestinians was  under way and now -- so goes the good news from the eternal  optimist, Foreign Minister Peres -- one was having one's "heads  and hands free to deal with Syria." After all, his boss,  Yitzhaq Rabin, had been more and more clearly offering the  Syrians a deal on the Golan: "For peace I am ready to clear  settlements."    On Sunday [1 May], a member of the Israeli delegation in the  negotiations even "anonymously" announced the implementation:  Damascus was ready to respect Israeli security needs, and that  "is encouraging." After all, so far Syria had always insisted  that questions of security "can be dealt with only after the  complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights."    The next day, the icy shower came from Damascus. There, U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher conveyed to dictator al-Asad  Jerusalem's most recent proposals, the essence of which is: the  gradual withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for  gradual peace -- according to the time-tested recipe "one piece  of land, one piece of peace," which was so successfully tried  out by Egypt and Israel with the Camp David Agreement.    Yet, hardly had Christopher departed than his Syrian  colleague al-Shar' began to attack the trial balloon with a  pike: "Never! We will not accept peace in steps." Complete  withdrawal first, and only then will peace talks be possible.  Just as his boss al-Asad, al-Shar' also knows that the Israelis  will not accept such a deal. So why the brutal public rejection?    First, because such tactics are a part of any poker game.  For months, the Israelis have presented the Syrians as more  willing than they really are to build up pressure against the  enemy in the form of expectations. And Damascus has as often  resorted to cold water to achieve an even better price. And  since Damascus has so far fared well with this tactic -- Rabin  has continually increased his offer -- the Syrians will not  abandon their course unless they have to. Second, in the Middle  East nothing is being negotiated in public, let alone being  discussed in public, because there are no free media in the Arab  region. What is announced hardly ever reflects the real state  of negotiations. Third, the Syrians believe that they have time.  The Golan is mainly of symbolic value for al-Asad; Syria has  existed without it for 27 years, so a few more do not really  matter.    Still, even this most cunning of all tacticians knows that  Jerusalem will not give away one inch of soil without a return  service. Whether the Israeli Army controls the attack axis  toward Galilee, or, conversely, Syrian cannoneers can directly  look down on territory of Israeli settlements is a question of  life and death for Israel. Thus, Israel will give way only step  by step in order to test Syria's intentions. After all, al-Asad  also knows that he is unable to get a better deal than Egypt,  Israel's far more dangerous opponent.</p>

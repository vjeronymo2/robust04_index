			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Kashmir valley, the two British kidnapped by  militants continue to be under their captivity despite the  promises made by the abductors that they will be released at any  time. The father of the kidnapped 16-year old boy, Mr. David  Housego, told our Srinagar correspondent that his anxiety is  increasing because of the attitude of the militants. Relatives  of the kidnapped persons had even gone to Pahalgam in the hope  of securing their release, but returned to Srinagar last evening.</p>

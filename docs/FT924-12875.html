			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (1): The change is positive - Maastricht treaty conditions require the Italian government to slim down state ownership of industry and improve its competitiveness. But performance will depend on radical moves to reduce the public service deficit ITALIAN industry this autumn confronts an awesome list of turbulent variables, each capable of shattering a crystal ball. Obvious variables are the inflationary effect of devaluation; high interest rates and squeezed profits; increased taxes, labour unrest; a weak government in a fast changing political environment. In short, the plight of industry can no longer be isolated from the more general crisis affecting what the press likes to call Azienda Italia (Italy Incorporated). Since the April general elections, a way of life which once seemed immutable is in a state of flux - from the electoral rules, the shape of the political parties, the nature of the welfare state and the role of the public sector right down to public morality. Painfully, at times chaotically, Italy is pointing towards the creation of new political alignments within a reformed constitution which will tidy up an unworkable system of proportional representation and produce more stable government coalitions. The entire public sector is going to be slimmed down and made more transparent, starting with IRI, the giant holding company. Irresponsible public spending, which cocooned Italy from the effects of recession elsewhere, has finally been brought face to face with a crude reality: the country cannot afford the old subsidies and welfare state which have been both generous and inefficient. The mountain of debt at over 104 per cent of GDP - the servicing of which accounts for nearly the entire budget deficit - has risen too high. Nor will the electorate tolerate the incestuous relationship, now being exposed by Milan magistrates, between industrialists and politicians, whereby seemingly every public works contract involves a kick-back paid into party coffers. It is a time of changing habits and policies in the worst possible circumstances: an unstable coalition government catching up on long-delayed political, economic and industrial reform, amid a currency crisis and a recession. But Italy's change of direction is positive and may well be irreversible. Pressure from European partners in Brussels to kick old habits and meet the demands of convergence are an important factor for change. This 'European' pressure also has an unusual domestic twist - the fast-growing power of the populist Lombard League. The latter has broken the hold of the discredited traditional political parties in the north, and is advocating at best a new federalism - or, more disturbingly, a form of northern separatism. The logic of the League is that if Italy as a whole fails to meet EC standards, then the north will turn its back on the centre and south to cut its own deal with the D-mark. The markets are the other external force imposing change. Lack of confidence in Italy's ability to tackle its uncontrolled public spending and comply with the minimal criteria for convergence made speculation against the lira inevitable. Beginning with the April general elections, speculation culminated in the lira's devaluation on September 14 - in a free float since September 17, having devalued nearly 20 per cent against the D-mark. Ironically, this nadir of international confidence comes when Italy for the first time has a government committed to attack the budget deficit with structural reform of the principal culprits: pensions, health care, local administration and the civil service. In its dealings with the bloated state sector, however, the government's touch has not been as firm as is needed. The three and a half month-old Amato government has done itself unnecessary international damage by the clumsy handling of the liquidation of Efim, the loss-making state industrial holding. Creditors were kept in the dark, then told at first that Efim's L3,500bn of foreign debt would be frozen. Again signals on privatisation have been confused. The government has broken far too ambiguously the psychological barrier of surrendering 51 per cent control, and been slow in showing its hand over what is to be sold. Only two modest sell-offs have been announced: Credito Italiano, the sixth largest commercial bank controlled by IRI, the state holding; and Nuovo Pignone, the turbines and engineering subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern. Equally, the first attempt in July to reorganise the public sector by forming two super-holdings had to be quickly dropped. In its place the treasury has now become sole shareholder of the four main public entities. IRI, ENI, ENEL (the electricity authority) and INA (the insurance institute) are now joint stock companies. This initial step has removed IRI and ENI from the direct tutelage of the political parties which formerly treated them as fiefdoms for patronage. A significant opportunity now exists for establishing a coherent industrial strategy, and the government must decide quickly on the shape this will take. The opportunity should come at the end of next month, when IRI and ENI announce their new strategic plans. The government is understandably torn between realising assets through the easy sale of 'jewels,' and the longer term creation of units with industrial logic. Here Italy's rigid labour market, which makes shedding manpower both costly and controversial, will be put to the test. Elsewhere in Europe, crisis industries have reacted by shedding labour, while in Italy loss-making operations are sustained as 'strategic sectors,' largely to avoid job losses in depressed regions with political clout. Aerospace, aluminium, chemicals, defence industries, steel and ship-building are the most glaring examples. The bottom line will be the need to gain confidence from the markets and raise money from privatisation - even if a strong body of political opinion continues to favour sizeable state control. Market sentiment cannot be lightly ignored these days. The recent decision by IRI to sell off Finsiel, its software subsidiary, to STET, its telecommunications holding, was greeted with a 23 per cent fall in STET shares. The market judged this to be an unnecessary shuffling of assets to boost IRI's balance sheet without entering a broader international alliance. Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, recently prepared a paper offering the government guidelines for an industrial strategy with five principal objectives with a view to the private sector playing a more prominent role: Increase the average size, productive capacity and capitalisation of companies. Broaden and strengthen the technological and innovative base of industry in highly competitive sectors such as textiles, footwear and clothing. Equip industry to cope better with environmental considerations. Greater internationalisation, with more transitional alliances and overseas production/distribution - Italian industry being the least multi-national of the G-7 countries. Better territorial distribution of production. To these laudable objectives might be added improvement in infrastructure, a more attractive environment for foreign investors and a better developed financial market. For the world's fifth largest industrial economy, Italy attracts remarkably little investment. Over the past 18 months industry itself has been tackling its cost base, and wages have risen this year at marginally below inflation of 5.2 per cent. Although pay is still above the European average, the recent devaluation should provide a competitive edge. Many small companies, the life-blood of Italian industry, find themselves in poor shape, caught in a net of costly short term debt, declining domestic demand and fierce international competition. All companies will also feel the squeeze from this month's decree imposing a one-off tax on net worth of 7.5 per cent per L1,000. The unions, for their part, have begun a series of politically motivated strikes directed both against proposed budget cuts in health care and pensions and against the prospect of job losses and reduced earnings. The union leadership is in danger of losing control of growing grass-roots militancy, and this is likely to complicate the fate of the July outline agreement ending the scala mobile, the post-war system of indexed wages. However, the unions are on the defensive over job losses. Resisting the unions' demands will be a test of the employers' and the government's nerve in coming weeks.</p>

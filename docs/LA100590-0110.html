			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> BELL NOT TALKING MUCH ABOUT BILLS  </P> <P> Tailback Greg Bell, a former Bill, declined to give his old team any bulletin  board material for the Raiders' Sunday night game in Buffalo. While playing for  the Rams last season, Bell criticized the Bills, who then defeated the Rams,  23-20, in a Monday night game.  </P> <P> But the normally outspoken Bell is keeping quiet this week. "It's just another  trip," he said. "It's just another away game. It's been too many years now to  worry about it. It's a completely different team with a whole new attitude. I'm  still friends with a lot of those guys back there and I don't have any  feelings. It's just going to be a hard-fought game."  </P> <P> Injury report: Raider defensive tackle Mike Wise, who sustained a sprained  ankle in Sunday's 24-10 victory over the Chicago Bears, is questionable because  of a sprained ankle, as is safety Mike Harden, who sat out the Bear game  because of a neck injury.

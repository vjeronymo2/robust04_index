			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rallies in coffee and cocoa prices surprise traders COFFEE AND cocoa futures prices rallied at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday after their recent 'corrections'. But dealers were at a loss to explain the rise. The January delivery coffee position, which at one point last week dipped to Dollars 1,139 a tonne, closed at Dollars 1,207 a tonne, up Dollars 29 on the day. But that was still Dollars 128 below the 2 1/2 -year high reached at the end of August as bullish assessments of the likely impact of the producer's export retention scheme reached their peak. The scheme, to hold 20 per cent of supplies off the export market until prices rise to a target about 12 per cent above the present level, came into operation on October 1, but by that time confidence in the producers' ability to make the strategy work was already on the wane. 'The real problem is the retention scheme is a paper tiger which is not yet biting. No-one is trying to buy coffee and not being able to get any because of the retention scheme,' one trader told the Reuter news agency. In the absence of news to justify the price rise of the past few days, dealers said it was due to speculative activity that began in the New York market last Friday. The March cocoa position's Pounds 21 rise to Pounds 936 a tonne was also seen as a purely technical bounce after last week's Pounds 72 setback. 'People are trying to push the market higher in the hope there is lots of buying above current levels,' said one dealer. 'At the same time there's also quite a bit of selling waiting below the market if near March dips back again towards Pounds 900.' In its daily commodity report GNI, the London trade house, said Pounds 900 a tonne was 'the critical level' for the prompt December price, which closed at Pounds 905 tonne. But it was not looking for recent 40-month highs to be re-tested. 'While we remain positive long-term,' it said, 'we doubt that we will see a significant jump from here while the West African crops are coming in.'</p>

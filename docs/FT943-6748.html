			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs rail against partition proposal: Laura Silber finds little enthusiasm for the plan to hand back a third of the territory they now hold We would rather all die than accept this plan, said Mr Bozo Popovic as he prepared to vote in this weekend's referendum on an international proposal to end the war in Bosnia. 'There is no world power that can force us to support the (partition) maps,' continued the elderly Bosnian Serb peasant from where he sat in the battered town hall of Trnovo, south-east of Sarajevo. 'This is our historic land.' Mr Popovic's remarks reflect the general defiance of the Bosnian Serbs, and an overwhelming No is expected in the poll today and tomorrow throughout the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb state, despite pressure from the international community and Serbia proper. Their leaders have already rejected the plan, which calls for Serbs to hand over a third of the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently control. Put forward by the US, Russia, Germany, France and the UK, it divides the war-torn country roughly in half between the Bosnian Serbs and the new Moslem-Croat federation. Bosnian Serb leaders have been resisting pressure from President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to back the plan amid threats from the international community to tighten sanctions against Belgrade and lift the arms embargo against the mostly-Moslem Bosnian army. Furious with Bosnian Serb intransigence, the rump Yugoslavia (comprising Serbia and Montenegro) imposed trade sanctions earlier this month against the self-styled Serb state, stopping delivery of strategic supplies - including oil - and severing telephone lines. Mr Dragomir Gagovic, a local boss in Trnovo of the ruling Serbian Democratic Party, suggested that the embargo was being circumvented. 'Just yesterday 10 fuel tankers passed through Trnovo,' he claimed, and doubted that the measures amounted to little more than a ploy to hoodwink the international community. A town of 7,000 inhabitants before the war, Trnovo changed hands from Serbs to Moslems and back to Serbs over the past 28 months. 'All but three of 63 surrounding hamlets were completely demolished,' said Mr Savo Popovic, the burly party boss of the town and Bozo Popovic's nephew. Despite its dilapidated state, Trnovo remains of crucial strategic importance for both the Serbs and the Moslems. It lies on the road joining Serb-held lands in eastern Bosnia with the southern part of their crescent-shaped statelet. On the other hand, the Moslems fought a bitter battle for Trnovo, where they once comprised a 69 per cent majority, in a bid to secure a road-link between Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. Trnovo is part of the Sarajevo region and the plan places it under UN administration for an interim period of two years. To the Serbs - there are no Moslems left - this means more war. 'The maps create islands adrift in a sea of Moslem enemies,' said Mr Savo Popovic. His leaders cite the status of Trnovo as one of the key reasons for rejecting the maps, which they argue obliterate land links between Serb-held regions and force them to hand over 13 cities, the bulk of power generators and the fertile river valleys. They complain that the maps destroy the viability of their self-styled state and give the Moslem-Croat federation an unfair strategic advantage in any eventual future war. Also the focus of bitter criticism is the narrow land corridor in the north linking Belgrade with Serb-held lands in western Bosnia and Croatia. 'We would not even be able to pass through it on a bicycle, not to mention lorries or tanks,' said Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader. He predicted last week that 90 per cent of Bosnian Serbs would vote against the plan. The Belgrade authorities charge that the figure of 900,000 eligible voters is inflated, pointing out that there are no electoral lists in Republika Srpska, the self-styled state. While apparently unanimous in their opposition to the maps, Bosnian Serbs are confused, but not worried, about the embargo imposed by Mr Milosevic. They even defend him - they credit him for being the first leader in post-Tito Yugoslavia to address their grievances - for having no choice but to impose the blockade. Mr Savo Popovic dismissed speculation that Mr Milosevic, in meetings tomorrow in Belgrade with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, will agree to the despatch of some 400 international monitors along the border between the rump Yugoslavia and Bosnia. In return, the UN has drafted a resolution to open the airport in Belgrade and lift the ban on international sports competition. 'The bridge can never be burned between us. We are one nation,' said Mr Savo Popovic. 'Milosevic will realise that we are defending Serbia here in Trnovo.' The 75-year-old uncle, Bozo, seated under a portrait of General Draza Mihajlovic, his Chetnik commander executed by Tito after the second world war, agreed that his fellow Serbs will defend their land: no matter what. 'We fought against the Germans with pitchforks, we'll do it again.'</p>

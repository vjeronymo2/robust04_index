			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc shakes off attackers THE FRENCH franc emerged shaken but not stirred yesterday following a week of sniping and skirmishing by speculators. Understated rearguard action by the Bank of France was enough to see off what amounted to little more than renegade hunting parties, writes Peter John. Much of the recovery reflected a shifting of technical positions in the markets but there was some support from a statement by one member of the right-wing coalition expected to take power in March. Defending the government's strong franc policy, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the UDF said; 'To consolidate this policy, I have asked the UDF shortly to table a bill to reform the Bank of France's statute and guarantee the central bank's independence.' Although an independent French bank is expected one foreign exchange dealer said: 'Anything which focuses market minds on a monetary move that will strengthen the franc can only be helpful.' Dealers added that the Bank of France was once again dipping into the market, buying francs and selling D-Marks. The franc, which had breached FFr3.42 against the D-Mark earlier, rallied yesterday from FFr3.4190 to a more comfortable FFr3.4150 before closing at FFr3.4160. It also dropped back from above the minus 75 percentage points level on the ERM's divergence indicator, the level at which some believe central bank intervention kicks in. In fact, there is no automatic response generated by the 'magic' 75, it is merely a warning light. There was a feeling by the close of trading in London that the week's assaults had not been backed by a significant weight of money and were merely a warm-up to a full scale attack in the New Year. Several economists have said that currency traders are not prepared to jeopardise the hefty bonuses earned during the sterling crisis in September. The situation is expected to change in January when dealers return with a fresh page to their trading books. However, one economist said; 'There has to be some limit to the power of the speculators and when the fundamentals are strong they add to the case for the defence.' Elsewhere, currencies traded within recent ranges. The dollar recorded an early one pfennig gain but there was no fundamental support and it closed 30 basis points up at DM1.5655. On the downside, the pound saw some impact from the release of worse than expected lending figures and closed lower against the dollar, D-Mark and franc. The D-Mark was mixed, gaining against a number of European currencies but easing against the yen and dollar.</p>

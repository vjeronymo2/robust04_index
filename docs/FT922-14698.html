			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Disappointing US jobs report adds to gloom THE publication yesterday of lacklustre US employment figures for March pointed to only a slow recovery from recession. The Labour Department said non-farm employment rose by 19,000 last month, less than half the increase expected on Wall Street. The rise was hardly discernible in an economy with nearly 109m non-agricultural jobs. Figures for February were revised down to show a job gain of 107,000 rather than 164,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged last month at 7.3 per cent, the highest level for six years. The jobs report - seen as the most important monthly statistical publication  -may lead to more cautious assessments of the US economic outlook. Big increases in consumption spending in January and February were interpreted by some analysts as evidence that a robust recovery was under way. 'The numbers for February were too strong,' said Mr William Griggs of the Wall Street analytical firm Griggs and Santow. 'The March figures provide a more realistic picture of the economy.' The figures, while worse than expected, were not seen as bad enough to prompt an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has held short-term interest rates at 4 per cent since December. The Fed regards employment as a lagging indicator and hopes that recent increases in demand will reduce unemployment later this year. Yesterday's report, however, confirms there has been no significant increase in employment since last spring, despite three quarters of slow growth of gross domestic product. Employment rose last spring and summer, fell in the autumn and winter and now appears to have stabilised. Manufacturing employment fell slightly last month after a small gain in February. In construction, the upturn in residential real estate has yet to translate into job growth. International Stock Markets, Page 21</p>

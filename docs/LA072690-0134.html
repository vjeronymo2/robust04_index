			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATELLITE EXPECTED TO LIGHT UP MAGNETIC FIELDS DURING STUDY  </P> <P> A newly repaired unmanned rocket blasted into space Wednesday with a satellite  that will use chemicals to transform Earth's invisible magnetic field lines  into brilliant bursts of color.  </P> <P> The 143-foot Atlas rocket roared into a clear sky, and the satellite separated  from the booster 28 minutes after launch, drawing applause at the control  center.  </P> <P> It was the fourth attempt by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  and rocket builder General Dynamics to launch the Atlas, the first commercial  version of the rocket ever flown.  </P> <P> "We have about the best flight we could possibly hope for," launch commentator  George Diller said.  </P> <P> Monday's scheduled launch was called off after the Atlas failed to transfer  power just before liftoff. A corroded power transfer switch in the rocket was  replaced.  </P> <P> Four liquid helium vent ducts were replaced a few days earlier. One of them  slipped off an engine outlet in the rocket's upper-stage thrust section,  forcing postponement of Friday's launch attempt. Threatening thunderstorms  caused Sunday's delay.  </P> <P> The weather was perfect Wednesday as the Atlas boosted the $189-million  Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite to an elliptical orbit 217  miles by 22,236 miles high to study radiation in space.  </P> <P> The two-ton satellite holds 24 chemical-filled canisters that will be released  starting this fall. A 25-minute timer in each canister will release barium,  lithium and other chemicals in vapor form once the spacecraft is at a safe  distance.  </P> <P> Ultraviolet rays from the sun will ionize the chemicals, creating glowing  clouds that will spread along Earth's magnetic field lines.  </P> <P> The barium-laden clouds will resemble the aurora borealis, or the northern  lights. All of the displays will be visible to the naked eye. Scientists will  be able to measure electric fields and see how they interact with normally  invisible charged particles.  </P></p>

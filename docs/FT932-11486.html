			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: Never had it so good - Sculpture Sculptors may complain of the practical difficulties they face, and the lack of opportunities to show their work, but then sculptors in general do complain. Break through to any kind of critical or curatorial notice and the world, it seems, is theirs. The Henry Moore Institute, which was set up in Leeds 10 years ago for the study and encouragement of sculpture, as we saw last week, flourishes mightily. The Yorkshire Sculpture Park, now well into its second decade at Bretton Hall near Wakefield, has become one of the prime public attractions in the whole of the north of England. There is sculpture now in Grize-dale Forest, where sculptors from all over the world go to work on site, and in the Forest of Dean. From next month, some 60 sculptors, at the invitation of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and P&amp;O, the shipping company, are to show their work at Chelsea Harbour in the largest-ever such show in London in the open air. Sculpture commissions and competitions proliferate. Every new development or office block, every refurbished city square, must have its proper monumental and celebratory piece. Birmingham's Victoria Square now has its Anthony Gormley and its Dhruva Mistry to set beside Her Majesty; the London Dockland's Development Board has its Nigel Hall, Michael Kenny and Zadok Ben-David each adorning one portico of the new Limehouse Link. All this is as it should be, but it has a more regrettable side. The received wisdom is that it is sculpture the world wants to see - a self-fulfilling limitation at best. So it is that sculpture has come to dominate such treats as the Turner Prize, the New Contemporaries and the Barclay's Young Artist Award. Sculpture it was that supplied the Hayward's latest comprehensive survey of recent art. When did the British Council last give the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale to a young painter? Only 21 years ago? Surely not. Could it be that sculptors will form the British contingent to the Aperto, that is always dedicated to younger artists, at this year's Biennale? Don't ask. But it is the work that counts, and our galleries, squares and gardens are full of it. David Nash is a wood man, working, as the title to his current show tells us, At the edge of the forest. He burns, scrapes, chops and saws his way into the living wood, improvising and responding to the particular chance of form and context. He does only what is necessary to realise the particular image he has decided upon in general terms, which is not to say that he does not work with extreme technical refinement and sophistication. Rough-hewn and unpolished his surfaces may be, but exquisitely so. These tall, simple, ambiguous modern totems confirm rather the more monumental than the wry and playful qualities of his work, with the forms often simplified by the optical density of the carbonised surfaces. The exception is the floor piece that consists of lumps of charred oak interspersed with somewhat clumpier carved lumps of alder, set out as it were in a fairy ring. Materially seductive though it is, its essentially arbitrary and precious aestheticism soon takes over. He is a better artist than that. Anish Kapoor, our hero at Venice in 1990 and last year's Turner laureate, is another carver and splitter and opener-up of secret cavities, though of stone. His new work continues his preoccupation with the cavity, so deep, secret, unfathomable, impenetrable, the interior space invested with blue or magenta pigment so dense as to seem all but solid. But now he pierces the cavity at its furthest side, a little to relieve the secret perhaps, if not release it. Or, having smoothed a facet of his rough block of stone, he then carves within the cavity a swelling, amorphous form. Here, he seems to say, is the eternal egg, or the omphalos of the Sybil, that might reveal the secret of the universe. For Kapoor's work is nothing if not fraught with symbol and ambiguous possibility, pervasively sensual, inescapably sexual. Paul Neagu's symbolism is more recondite and idiosyncratic, founded in personal metaphysics and cosmology. His eight Catalytic stations, set out in a ring beside the Economist Building in London's West End, are for him, like the stations of the Cross, individual points of contemplation and realisation, yet part of a coherent whole. Together they represent the full range of the formal imagery he has developed over the years - the broken star, the rectangle held aloft, the splayed, extended feet of the tripod. The artist's own interpretation and intention are, of course, for us to take or leave as may be. What remain are objects beautifully made, sculpturally complex yet resolved with a wonderfully ingenious and satisfying simplicity. Each summer, the New Art Centre's sculpture garden at Roche Court in Wiltshire allows young and comparatively unknown sculptors to show alongside their established peers - to say nothing of Moore, Hepworth, Gill, Frink - and in a most beautiful setting. Notable in this year's large selection are Anthony Gormley, whose sentinel-figure stands alone in the bluebell wood above the garden, Katherine Gigli, Mark Dunhill, Kim Lim, Phillip King, Barry Flanagan, Peter Randall-Page, Peter Logan, whose metal rods swing in the wind, Bryan Kneale, Sven Bayer with his large garden pots, and Sarah More, with some fine carved lettering.

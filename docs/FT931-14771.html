			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Openness on drugs backed THE government yesterday indicated support in principle for a Labour MP's bill to increase information on the safety of medicines - but its qualified endorsement means the proposals are unlikely to become law. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, backed more openness in the drugs industry but said there were parts of the bill with which the government would have difficulties. Much information supplied by pharmaceutical companies to drug licencesing authorities was highly sensitive commercially, he said. Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, said his Medicines Information Bill would give patients more information about the risks and benefits of drugs. However, Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, warned that it could have a 'devastating' effect on the pharmaceutical industry, which strongly opposes the measures. The bill was given a second reading in the Commons but will almost certainly require a more positive government stance to become law. It is backed by the Consumers' Association and the Campaign for Freedom of Information. At present, section 118 of the 1968 Medicines Act makes it a criminal offence for officials to disclose information about the safety of medicines supplied by pharmaceutical manufacturers to licensing authorities. Mr Radice regards the bill as a test of the government's commitment to reducing secrecy. It seeks to overcome fears about the confidentiality of information by restricting access to those who have no links with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Life breathed into stone - Colin Amery admires the work of Eric Gill / Sculpture and architecture If you feel the need before Christmas to escape from crowded festivities, I thoroughly recommend some calm moments at the Barbican Art Gallery. I went to see the exhibition of sculpture there by Eric Gill (which runs until February 7) with some reservations, a lot of prejudiced, and muddled preconceptions about Gill's life and work. But this exhibition does what a good exhibition should: it both delights the eye and stimulates the mind. It also presents with great clarity the personality of the artist within the context of his creative life. Much of Gill's figurative sculpture is hard to see because it is either in private collections or is permanently fixed to buildings. This is the first retrospective of his figurative sculpture - and it is no mean achievement to have assembled nearly 50 important works, mainly of the period 1910 to 1930. They are beautifully displayed in a way that brings out the direct quality of Gill's work. He made stone breathe quietly and many of these works exude a tranquil life of their own. I also braved the architectural terrors of the Barbican, because I believe that there is no real future for architecture as an art that can inspire and nourish unless its practicioners have a sympathy for all the visual and plastic arts. I am permanently baffled by the separation between architecture and the fine arts. There is still very little communication between architects and artists in educational establishments, and there have only been marginal improvements in the last decade in the commissioning of public art. The official artistic bureaucracy wastes millions on schemes like 'per cent for art', which sees art as some kind of expendable 'add-on', not as an intrinsic part of any creative initiative. understood that it is possible for fine art - which embraces the irrational, imaginative and sensual - to be a crucial part of everyday life. His sculptures for the BBC, London Transport and his war memorials have a sense of propriety and rightness where they are. He understood architecture and its relationship with sculpture - perhaps because his creative life began as an apprentice to an architect. When he was 18, Gill joined the office of WD Caroe, the leading church architect of the time and from whom Gill learned the disciplines of architectural drawing. In the transitional years of the 1900s style was as much a matter of debate as it is today. Caroe, who was often thought of as a rather dull gothicist designed in a whole range of styles. Gill soon became fascinated by the theories of William Morris and John Ruskin and absorbed from them some of his early ideas about craftsmanship, labour and art. He decided not to attend evening classes in architecture, but to study the art of lettering under Edward Johnston at the Central School - and to learn practical masonry. These two skills flourished and in 1903 another architect, Edward Prior, gave Gill his first lettering commission. He invited him to design the lettering for the new medical school in Downing Street, Cambridge. So it was architecture and lettering that enabled Gill to become a freelance artist craftsman, and to put some of his theories into practice concerning the sacredness of work dedicated to the service of art. By 1909 Gill was beginning to make figurative sculpture and felt that he had made a most important discovery. He wrote: 'it was like a new alphabet - the word was made flesh.' Gill's method of working was to carve directly in stone. He would not consider modelling in clay or employing the help of other craftsmen - he cut directly into the stone and was probably one of the first sculptors in England to work in this way since the Middle Ages. It is this sense of directness that is so evident at the Barbican exhibition. The remarkable nature of Gill's talent as a sculptor was soon recognised and he secured an important commission as early as 1913, when he was asked to carve the Stations of the Cross for the new Roman Catholic cathedral at Westminster. The pencil, ink and water colour drawings in the exhibition are no substitute for going to Westminster Cathedral to see the full size carved originals, but they are fascinating as working drawings squared up for transfer to the stone. As drawings, they have that heraldic, almost diagrammatic, quality that is also present in the stone reliefs. For such relatively early work they are extraordinary and potent icons. The mixture of eroticism and religious faith is a thread that runs throughout Gill's work and life. We all learned more than we really needed to know about his communal attitudes to sex in Fiona MacCarthy's biography of Gill. What is surprising - and wonderful - about this collection of sculptures is that they exist with lives of their own - quite apart from all the hypocrisy of Gill's life - as very pure works of art of great integrity. Even 'Ecstasy', Gill's most sexually obvious work (which was owned by the same collector who commissioned Rodin's 'The Kiss') has more of a moment of wonderment about it than any sense of pornography. The two major architectural works, 'Prospero and Aeriel' for the BBC's Broadcasting House in London, and the 'Four Winds' for London Transport's headquarters, are well known. It was more interesting to see the drawing for the huge relief for the headquarters of the League of Nations in Geneva (1935) on the theme of the 're-creation of man', and the actual Portland Stone relief from the Midland Hotel (1933) in Morecambe on an Odyssian theme  -which is wild and spirited and curiously scaled. We need more artists like Gill, prepared to work with architects and to be sympathetic to the idea that every man - especially the craftsman and builder - is also an artist. Sadly, we are today miles from that idea, as most building is merely mechanical assembly of manufactured parts. Gill shows the intense, creative fulfilment of working with the hand and the eye. This exhibition quietly and carefully illuminates that idea.</p>

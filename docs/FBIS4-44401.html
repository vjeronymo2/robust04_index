			<p>CSO     [Text] "The time has come to take overall charge of public  security. The matter must be put on the agenda and energetically  handled." This was a forceful call to the people's  representatives attending the second plenary session of the  eighth autonomous region people's congress.    In 15 years of reform and an open door policy, the issue of  public security is increasingly prominent. Our region has gone  from being closed to open. The economy has developed  considerably. At the same time, some bad things have taken the  opportunity to come in. Moreover, in recent years personnel from  elsewhere have flooded into our region. In 1993 throughout the  region there were more than 11,000 crimes tried, a relatively  great increase over 1992. In Urumqi criminal activity was even  more serious; the number of criminal cases tried was up 27  percent. Representative Xie Jianxun [6200 1696 8113] said that  when society was closed we used static public security. Now that  people, money and things are in great circulation, we use  dynamic public security. Now, motives for committing crimes are  complex: blind pandering, seeking high levels of enjoyment,  undisclosed remuneration of profit distribution to heads of  enterprises, etc.; leading to cases of graft, robbery,  explosives, and beatings. In mentioning criminal cases,  circulating people must be mentioned. They account for more than  30 percent of the crime rate in Urumqi and 70 percent of those  harmed are personnel in circulation at the southern railway  station. Representatives He Bingxian [0149 4426 6343] and Zhang  Xuewen [1728 1331 2429] are deeply empathetic. Many thefts and  robberies are committed by personnel circulating independently.  Before the spring festival in particular, they steal chickens  and seize dogs everywhere, stealing whatever they can, robbing  whatever comes along, "bagging things to take home and pass the  new year."    It is noteworthy that the age of criminal elements is ever  younger now. Youths account for 80 percent of crime. Many  representatives believe that this is related to our greater  social environment. In schools there is little moral training  but lopsided seeking of high grades and advancing grades. Some  periodicals, movies, and television propagate violence and sex.  These factors enticing many young people to take the path of  crime cannot be overlooked.    Representative Xie Jianxun said that ineffective attacks on  criminal elements and low solved case rates are current problems  we cannot dodge. Yet the serious difficulties of weak police  forces, lack of funds and backward equipment affect the speed  and quality with which law enforcement departments try cases.  Our entire bureau has a total of more than 3,500 people. Overall  quality is insufficiently high. Only one-third of the personnel  has undergone systematic training. Communications equipment is  far from up to date. In one instance our cadres and police  caught a fleeing criminal. The jeep had only gone several  hundred meters when it died and they watched the criminal run  away. It now costs more than 10,000 yuan to catch a criminal but  our annual costs only pay wages to support common office work.    Law enforcement sectors' prime job is to face the flashpoint  issues in public security, adopt effective measures and curb  rising crime. Representative Chen Jinchi [7115 6855 3069]  believes public security organizations must further implement a  "serious attack" policy: quickly and doubly attack various  criminal elements. Enhance overall control of public security,  issue control measures with all social forces, augment  watchguard work, establish various watchguard measures and  systems suited to developing a socialist market economy.  Additionally, we must enhance public security work, improve the  quality of cadres and police, perfect grass roots security and  control systems and street offices, allowing grassroots  organizations to play fully the important role of maintaining  public security. He also called on society to show more concern  and support for the work of public security troops.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Rafale's Mission Equipment Begins </F> to Take Shape"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION  MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The No. 5 RBE2 and No. 1 SPECTRA countermeasures  prototypes have just been delivered. The Front Sector Optronics  will not fly until 1996.    As of February, 1994, all the equipment that is part of the  Rafale SU0 user standard now exists as a prototype. All except  for the IFF (Identification Friend and Foe)  interrogator/responder, which has experienced delays. State  agencies waited until the 11th hour for NATO to define the  future NIS (NATO Identification System) friend/foe  identification standard, so that the Rafale would be  interoperable with the next generation of allied force equipment  as soon as it goes into service.    But by late 1992, alliance member states had not reached a  consensus on the NIS standard, and the General Weapons  Delegation (DGA) decided to launch the equipment based on the  IFF Mk XII standard. The latter can interrogate and identify in  "secure" encrypted modes, but does not offer the jamming  resistance or frequency-hopping ability the NIS promises.  Thomson-CSF (CNI division) has been selected to develop the  equipment, and plans to deliver the first prototype by the end  of the year.    The system settled on, however, will still constitute a  significant innovation with its totally new pair of antennas  shaped like a section of the system's front cone. The choice of  electron-scanning for the Rafale's radar antenna makes such a  configuration necessary.    Development of the RBE2 (2-plane Electron-Scanning Radar)  was  awarded to Thomson-CSF (RCM division) and Dassault Electronique  in April 1989. Official departments recently accepted the fifth  RBE2 prototype, out of a total of 10 to be delivered as part of  the development program. The radar's equipment design has been  frozen since the fourth prototype. The first four prototypes are  taking turns participating in the flight tests that began in  July, 1992, on a Mystere 20 belonging to CEV (Flight Test  Center). Since then, the RBE2s have logged in some 30 hours of  flight, including 20 on the Mystere 20, 10 on Rafale (B01 since  last July, and M02 now), and three outings on a Mirage 2000 test  bench. This may not seem like much next to the nearly 2,000  flight hours the RBE2 qualification program will rack up by 1998.    [But], say Rafale program officials at the DGA, "The small  number of flight hours proves that the radar works well."  Elements verified to date--essentially the proper functioning of  ancillary equipment and the radar's raw performances (such as  the measurement of air-to-air range on a calibrated  target)--have not presented CEV experimenters with any  unpleasant surprises. However, following catapult launches at  the Patuxent River base in the United States, program engineers  decided to reinforce the radar's carrier structure. The decision  did not affect plans for industrialization, which should begin  toward the middle of this year.    Test flights of the radar are scheduled to be stepped up  very  gradually, explains the DGA, as tracking algorithms, electronic  countermeasures, and new possibilities offered by the antenna's  design develop. Indeed, the radar's electron scanning operating  modes can be changed instantaneously, and even intertwined,  which will generate both huge signal flows for analysis and an  equal number of algorithms for comparison with real flights.    Rather surprisingly, these tests will culminate in 1997-98,  after the Rafale (and its radar) goes into service in the Navy.  There is a good reason for this, namely, the fact that the  operating modes which generate the most data, and consequently  require the most flight hours, are air-to-surface modes. That  is, the modes that are of greatest interest to the Air Force.    SPECTRA (Rafale Fire-Control Protection and Avoidance  System)  mission equipment follows the radar in the Rafale integration  plan. Development of the first countermeasures system to be  entirely (including chaff-launchers) borne inside a French  airplane got underway in March, 1990, at three subcontractors:  Thomson-CSF, Dassault Electronique, and Matra Defense.    SPECTRA is at a turning point in its development program,  now  that its first prototype is undergoing acceptance tests at  Thomson-CSF's Bretigny sur Orge Flight Test Center in a Paris  suburb. These trials are significant, for SPECTRA will have to  be able to process all electromagnetic spectrum bands, from air  defense radars to the millimetric or infrared homing heads of  anti-air missiles and the laser signals of so-called "beam  rider" missile fire control systems. In addition, SPECTRA will  have to be able to selectively jam several transmitters  simultaneously.    When ground tests are complete, SPECTRA will be ready for a  first test flight scheduled for next summer. Mass production of  the system will not begin until after the results of the first  flights are analyzed.    Meanwhile, SPECTRA component devices have been showing up,  one after the other, on the fuselage of various Rafale  prototypes. Atop the tail fin, for instance, a fairing sports  one antenna pointed forward and another toward the rear; two  MDDs (SAT-made Missile Departure Detectors) on either side; and  an LAD (Laser Alert Detector made by Thomson-TRT-Defense) that  covers the aft of the airplane. Two other LADs will also be  mounted in the front of the fuselage. Four antennas are now  visible, two at the canard roots and two under the engine air  intakes. Equipped with solid-state transmitters, the antennas  constitute a phase array that can channel jamming into a narrow  cone, making it more efficient than transmissions via the fixed  aerial of current-generation jammers.    The DGA is shortly expected to launch a program dubbed  Electronic Warfare Programming System (EWPS), concurrently with  SPECTRA. The EWPS is a ground device that will tune SPECTRA's  modes and operating sequences, and select them during mission  preparation based on the specific radar threats the aircraft is  likely to encounter. The program will aim to establish a  database on the effectiveness of countermeasures; generate  mission preparation libraries; and validate those libraries  through digital or hybrid simulations.    As for the Front Sector Optronics (FSO), the two partners in  charge of the program, Thomson-TRT-Defense (TTD) and SAT, are  working on it at their facilities. Development of the FSO got  underway in May 1992; the system is expected to go into service  around 2000 with the Rafale's SU2 standard.    The two manufacturer subcontractors are studying how to  integrate the FSO into the aircraft's other radar sensors and  countermeasures. (SAT is handling watch and infrared detection  functions; TTD is in charge of laser telemetry, TV imagery, and  the electronics unit). After acceptance of the first prototypes,  scheduled for 1996, the FSO will make its first flight tests.</p>

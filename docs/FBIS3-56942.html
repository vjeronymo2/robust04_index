We just  seemed to have begun to crawl away from the precipice of  hyperinflation, we just seemed to have grasped the anchor of a  stable ruble rate and told manufacturing enterprises: Sort out  production or lower prices.... But there is no holding us. We  decided on the union of the Belarusian and Russian monetary  systems. So that we can fall into the abyss together -- falling  is not so boring.    Over the past six months Belarus has suffered the total  collapse of its economic policy. The national currency, the  zaychik [little hare -- Belarusian currency carries symbol of a  hare], has been devalued at a rate comparable only to that of  the karbovanets. It is not surprising: Ukraine and Belarus  both did nothing to reform the economy, traditionally counting  on getting themselves out of a fix at Russia's expense. Whereas  previously the standard of living in these republics was higher  than in Russia, once Moscow introduced its own national currency  and once the credit-money umbilical cord was severed, the  situation changed before our eyes. The hunt was on for rubles  at a time when everything but the economy was prospering in the  fraternal republics. I have a friend, a so-called black  marketeer at the Minsk Refrigerator Plant; he described how the  trade in these very popular refrigerators is being "privatized"  there: The ministry takes a fair amount of the plant's output  and then sells it for a song (but for rubles!) to my "black  marketeer," the latter smuggles the goods into Russia and has a  good life. Everyone has a good life apart from the Belarusians  themselves, who don't have refrigerators or rubles, and now  their zaytsy [hares -- national currency] have fallen in value.    Why? What is the underlying reason for monetary union and,  what is more, on such preferential terms for Belarus? After  all, the plan is to exchange rubles for zaytsy at a rate of 1:1,  although only a complete idiot would get less than 5 zaytsy per  ruble on the market. As far as Russia is concerned, this means  an instant rise in all prices of at least 10 percent. For what  will we be paying?    The Central Bank of Russia led by Mr. V. Gerashchenko is  behind the great idea of union. Having temporarily piped down  over the past few turbulent months, Mr. Gerashchenko has once  again made a brilliant display of his political skill. He  prepared documents on the quiet and contrived to get them past  Gaydar and Fedorov, past everyone concerned about the future of  reform. And they, according to the plan, were to have made  fools of themselves, whipping boys responsible for the upsurge  in inflation which is absolutely inevitable in this situation.  Naturally the fathers of Russian reform refused to don the  dunce's cap. No, let the person accustomed to acting behind  people's backs and dealing calculated blows on the quiet -- Mr.  Gerashchenko -- try the cap on for size.    There are no sensible arguments in favor of union. There has  been some talk there [in Belarus] about aid -- but who will aid  us? Politicians have gone quite crazy if they are sacrificing  the economy and the prosperity of their fellow citizens for the  sake of a free handout to people who have no very great need  thereof. Does Belarus have no money? Does it have no means of  paying for energy resources? Does it have property? Well then,  hand over blocks of shares in enterprises to settle its debts.  Russian enterprises undoubtedly need the Belarusian market.  But why pay for this with hyperinflation?    Russian reformers were performing a single task in  disengaging the monetary systems, that of putting a stop to the  endless provision of subsidies for the former union republics.  That was achieved in the middle of last year. Is it all  starting up afresh now? Why then the need for the absurd  exchange of cash that caused the whole country to wait in line  outside branches of the savings bank?    Many politicians' rosy dreams will have obviously been  realized with leading economic reformers' departure from the  government. The national leaders of the former union republics  are happy to shift the burden of responsibility for economic  mistakes onto Russia, while however retaining all the other  attributes of a sovereign power.</p>

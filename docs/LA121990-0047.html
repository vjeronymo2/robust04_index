			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ARTS  </P> <P> Mass MOCA Nixed: State planning officials in Massachusetts have vetoed a  proposal to use state money to turn a vacant electronics factory into the  world's largest contemporary art museum. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was one of the  strongest backers of the proposed $77-million Massachusetts Museum of  Contemporary Art, or Mass MOCA. Last week, the state museum commission approved  a scaled-down version of Mass MOCA, but on Monday the revised proposal was  rejected. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League representative </F> Gianfranco Miglio by Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given:  "Miglio Throws In the Towel: `No Hope for Italy'"]    [Excerpt] Milan -- [passage omitted] [Passalacqua]  Professor, Bossi is abandoning federalism in order to attract  the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. What do you think of that?    [Miglio] I do not criticize him. I go even further. The  stance that he adopted recently has released certain  uncertainties that I have nurtured for the past six months. We  will never succeed in introducing a federalist Constitution in  Italy. The North has been tainted by the South, which expects,  and wants nothing more than, a welfare state. There is nothing  to be done about it; that is the way the Italian people are, and  that goes for me too. My friends in the League have not  succeeded in doing anything to curb this tendency; they have  merely been able to provide some kind of response to people's  protests.    [Passalacqua] Was this all expected? Were you not the author  of the Assago blueprint, which envisaged an Italy cut up into  pieces?    [Miglio] The institutions of the First Republic were the  only  ones suited to the Italians who were comfortable in that state,  and who remain so.    [Passalacqua] Which is why Bossi is turning toward  regionalism...    [Miglio] Regionalism will not alter the situation much,  because even if it is implemented, it will merely increase the  influence of the welfare state...    [Passalacqua] So the federalism thrown out of the door will  come back in through the window...    [Miglio] Yes, it is the only blueprint that enables Italy to  be a respectable state. Now, however, I realize that I made a  mistake, like inspector Rock on that television commercial many  years ago. To have imagined a different order for Italy -- the  federal order. The fact is that only a terrible economic and  financial crisis could lead to federalism, but I really do not  hope for such an end.    [Passalacqua] You seem embittered, professor.    [Miglio] A political scientist must tell the truth. I am a  realist.    [Passalacqua] Does your realism now prompt you to say  farewell to Parliament?    [Miglio] I am thinking about it, but this is not my foremost  thought. I will stay on only if it is possible to change the  system, but I am sure that there is nothing that can be done.    [Passalacqua] So are you totally pessimistic?    [Miglio] The system seems to me unchangeable. Despite all  its defects and misdeeds.    [Passalacqua] Why?    [Miglio] From within, I can see the real nature of the  Italian people who have always enjoyed excessive welfare  benefits and are therefore unable to engage in a market economy.  Do you know what I am going to tell you? We should not have  signed the Maastricht Treaty, since we will be forced to violate  them.    [Passalacqua] You are saying farewell to politics, and think  that it is impossible to change anything. At the same time  Bossi is seeking agreements with [Pact for Italy ideologue]  Buttiglione, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Rooting for  Italy leader] Berlusconi. It is legitimate to suspect that  there is no complete concordance of views between you....    [Miglio] Once again it is I who am imparting a profound  significance to Bossi's options. If my analysis is correct, all  this feverish activity on the part of the liberal democratic  alignment is a waste of time.    [Passalacqua] Is it your realism that prompts you to bury  the  alignment for freedom even before it is born?    [Miglio] Indeed, the left-wing alignment will win.    [Passalacqua] Is there no hope?    [Miglio] Berlusconi and Segni are very likely to lose, short  of a miracle.    [Passalacqua] Do you think the same about Berlusconi as  [resigning IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli does?    [Miglio] Montanelli is a cynic; I am a skeptic.    [Passalacqua] But whom do you side with in the dispute  between Montanelli and Berlusconi?    [Miglio] If I were a newspaper publisher, I would expect the  editor to follow my general line.    [Passalacqua] Professor, how does the League regard the  situation?    [Miglio] The League is fine.    [Passalacqua] Before Assago you used to describe Bossi as a  crazy bruiser. What about now?    [Miglio] He is fine.    [Passalacqua] Many interpret your remarks as not very veiled  criticisms of Bossi.    [Miglio] Utter nonsense.    [Passalacqua] Would you kindly give us your description of  Bossi.    [Miglio] A great extemporizing leader with a great intuition  with respect to political phenomena.    [Passalacqua] You said "extemporizing." For some time there  has been increasing criticism of Bossi's oscillations. In LA  REPUBBLICA yesterday, Giorgio Bocca said that if you fool around  too much in politics you will suffer a pratfall....    [Miglio] A large number of people vote for the League  because  that is the way Bossi is.    [Passalacqua] But the phenomenon of rejection does exist; it  cannot be denied.    [Miglio] These things will undergo the acid test in the  elections. I read Bocca's charges against Bossi: He said that  we lack a strong program focus. He regrets the passing of  localism. But, you see, when we were localists we were  criticized. The League, remember, has always found a political  identity in the electoral melting pot. Bossi thinks up the  watchwords and points of policy at public rallies. So, my dear  Bocca, have no fear. When the right moment comes, political  identities will emerge.    [Passalacqua] Bocca said that the League is finished as a  major political force.    [Miglio] Nonsense. Right now I do not think that the only  option is to vote for the League. People know that we deserve  their votes.</p>

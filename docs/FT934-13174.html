			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Catastrophe respite lifts Allstate A respite from big catastrophe losses during the third quarter enabled Allstate, one of the US's biggest insurers, to report a sharp improvement in post-tax profits for the period. Allstate's net income reached Dollars 325.7m, or 72 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 485.8m, or Dollars 1.96 a share, a year ago. Catastrophe-related losses, which reached Dollars 1.9bn in the third quarter of 1992 due to claims in the US arising from Hurricane Andrew, amounted to only Dollars 47m in the latest period. The lack of any big US hurricane-related claims this year - the hurricane season officially ended last week - is likely to have buoyed the profits of other big property/casualty insurers, which are due to report shortly. Net income at American General, the biggest door-to-door seller of life insurance in the US, fell to Dollars 118.7m from Dollars 138m the year before. This was due to a one-off Dollars 30m charge prompted by the rise in the US corporate tax rate. Before tax, the company reported record earnings of Dollars 233m, compared with Dollars 206m in the third quarter of 1992. The figures reflected solid earnings gains in consumer finance and retirement annuities, but a decline in profits from the door-to-door insurance business. An agreement to settle outstanding asbestos-related claims, reached in August, led to a Dollars 130.6m third-quarter loss at Chubb, compared with a Dollars 146.1m after-tax profit a year before. Excluding the Dollars 357.5m charge, which Chubb had announced previously, the company made an underwriting profit on property/casualty business of Dollars 17.1m, compared with a Dollars 10.3m loss the previous year.</p>

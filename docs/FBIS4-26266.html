			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Jiaquan (2621 1367 3123): "Where Are His </F> Emotions as a Chinese? -- Commenting on Li Teng-hui's  Conversation With Ryotaro Shiba"]    [Text] Mr. Li Teng-hui said after taking charge of the  government in Taiwan: "I am a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese."  Li traces his ancestral home to Fujian Province's Yongding  County, and he was born and brought up in Taiwan. Indeed, like  he says himself, he is a Taiwanese as well as a Chinese, a  Chinese who lives in Taiwan. Precisely because he has this kind  of status and does not have the burdens known to Chiang Kai-shek  and his son, people expect him to play a special and  irreplaceable role across the strait, dissolve the "complex"  left behind by history, and enable cross- strait relations or  the Taiwan question to have a solution which is more reasonable  and acceptable to various sides, thus, accomplishing a historic  project which is even greater than the recovery of Taiwan and  the "democratization of Taiwan." However, at this moment,  people are indeed somewhat disappointed.  <H5>  Great Revelation of the Secrets in His Heart </H5>   Mr. Li Teng-hui's conversation with Ryotaro Shiba is a  "great  revelation" of the secrets in his heart. It seems that we do  not see any feelings of him being a Chinese. In his  conversation, he could not help revealing a certain kind of  feeling that he missed being "Japanese," an identity which  ceased when he was 22 years old. Regarding Ryotaro Shiba's words  beautifying the aggressive behavior committed by the Japanese  colonialists and imperialists in the past, and words which were  hostile and encouraged the dismemberment of China, he listened  comfortably and even went along with him and chimed in with him.  On the other hand, he talked glibly about the so-called "sorrow  of the Taiwan people," and traced the root of this sorrow to the  Chinese mainland. He said the Kuomintang was a "regime coming  from the outside," and he had doubts about the concept of  "China." He even said explicitly that Beijing's idea of the  reunification of the two sides of the strait was a "weird  dream." In the beginning and at the end of the conversation, he  compared himself with Moses, who, according to "Exodus" in the  "Old Testament," led the Jews across the Red Sea to their native  place to rebuild their houses and farms. His intention is very  clear. No wonder many Chinese people on both sides of the  strait, as well as overseas Chinese, are "shocked."  <H5>  What Are the Emotions of a Chinese? </H5>   As a Taiwan Chinese, one should understand the sentiments of  the people there, and this is beyond reproach. Whether Li  Teng-hui has really been able to do this is another matter. But  I think that as a Taiwan Chinese, Mr. Li Teng-hui must not only  understand the sentiments of the people there, but must also  understand the sentiments of all Chinese people, and these two  are in fact inseparable. The history of modern China is a  history of China being invaded, exploited, and humiliated, and  almost all the imperialist countries in the world have committed  aggression against China. Situated on China's frontier, Taiwan  suffered the most. The people on the mainland felt as if they  themselves had suffered. In modern history, the rulers of China  were weak and incompetent when dealing with foreign countries,  but practiced sanguinary rule at home, and people on both sides  of the strait suffered together. Speaking from this sense, the  Taiwan people's sorrow is also the mainland people's sorrow, and  is the common sorrow of the people on the two sides of the  strait. The hearts of the people on the two sides of the strait  are completely linked. It is neither adequate nor complete to  see only the Taiwan people's sorrow.    The entire modern history of China is, first, a history of  conflict between the people and imperialist aggressors, and  second, a history of conflict between the people and reactionary  rulers. The ceding of Taiwan to Japan by the Qing court after it  lost the 1894 Sino-Japanese War, and the "28 February" incident  which took place in Taiwan after its recovery and came under  Kuomintang rule, are embodiments of these two major conflicts.  Regarding this history, Taiwan's Chinese people should also  have a clear understanding; they should not distort the nature  and orientation of the conflicts or blame mainland people for  the "Taiwan people's sorrow," or attribute that sorrow to a  "regime coming from outside" the mainland, or even use it as an  excuse to "fight communism and resist peace" and oppose the  reunification of the two sides of the strait.    The emotions of the Chinese people on the two sides of the  strait are inseparable. In history, the Chinese people on the  two sides of the strait, in order to resist foreign aggression,  oppose reactionary rule at home, fight for the independence of  the Chinese nation, and safeguard the country's sovereignty and  territorial integrity, have struggled hand in hand, shed blood  and sacrificed, and stepped into the breach as others fell.  Bravely and indomitably, they have together written down  numerous moving and glorious chapters. This kind of historical  and national sentiment, which was crystallized in blood and tear  can never be distorted and dispersed by the agitated and  emotional words of a few people.    The mainland people are very happy to see the economic  achievements made by the Taiwan people in the last several  decades. What is strange is that, while Chinese people  throughout the whole world are jubilant at the economic  achievements made by the mainland over the past several years,  some in Taiwan do not feel very comfortable; first, in the  economic arena, they have adopted various measures to try to  cool down the "mainland craze"; then, in the political arena,  they made a fuss over the Qiandao Lake incident," trying hard to  distort the feelings of Taiwan compatriots toward the mainland.  What is their intention?  <H5>  Must Not Mislead People's Emotions </H5>   Regarding the emotions of the Chinese who are in Taiwan,  there is the question of "understanding," as well as a question  of "guidance." Whether these emotions can be properly  understood and guided is to a great extent determined by whether  those in power can properly perceive themselves and history. We  have noticed that Mr Li Teng-hui, as a scholar, is quite capable  of considering "how to exercise self-restraint," just as he  himself said during the conversation, and that he is quite  humble and objective when handling matters; in short, he has  scientific attitude, and this is precisely one of the important  reasons why he has earned "trust" and "respect" from various  quarters in Taiwan. However, now, along with the changes in his  power and status, just like someone has said, he has become  "complacent." This time, when Ryotaro Shiba flattered him by  boasting about his "key to grasping politics" and said that he  was quite "at home using political strategy," Li immediately  told him: "I have been very keen since I was a child," and  people even "alleged that I am a military genius!" Perhaps that  is a fact. But judged from history, when a person, especially a  political figure, sees only his own role or overestimates his  own role, then he begins to make mistakes, as if the world is  his and nothing is impossible. He sees himself as a "savior," as  if what he "thinks" is what the people "want." The result is  divergence from the people, divergence from reality, and  breaking his head to the extent of bleeding.    Judged from Taiwan's actual conditions, people are not free  from this kind of worry. Since Li Teng-hui took charge of the  government in Taiwan, he has indeed done some good things for  the Taiwan people, and has made his own contribution to the  improvement of cross-strait relations. However, after  accomplishing "constitutional reform" with "high proficiency,"  some unrealistic ideas of his have emerged. Taiwan is an  inseparable part of China, and Taiwan people are Chinese people.  But recently, a sense of separation with Taiwan as the mainstay  has grown infinitely. The so-called "independent sovereignty"  theory, "the country of Taiwan" theory, "the nation of Taiwan"  theory, the theory of "giving priority to the interests of  Taiwan," the theory of the "life commonwealth of Taiwan," the  theory of "reinterpretation of sovereignty," the "Republic of  China in Taiwan," and the "expedient measure of two China's"  have all emerged. During this conversation, Mr. Li Teng-hui  explicitly proposed the building of "a Taiwan people's country."  Is this a deliberate attempt to "mislead" the people? When one  considers that some people on the island worship Li Teng-hui as  "Emperor Li," and express Li Teng-hui's "ideas and achievements"  as "Li Teng-hui-ism," there is cause for worry.    It is understandable that as Chinese people living in  Taiwan,  they advocate love for Taiwan, "lifting heads," and "being the  master." However, if certain people who have other intentions  set love for Taiwan against love for the motherland; set  "lifting heads" and "being the master" against the great  undertaking of the reunification of the motherland; set the  well-being of 21 million people against the long-term and basic  interests of 1.2 billion people, that is, the whole nation;  separate Taiwan people from Chinese people; and engage in the  so-called "Taiwan people's country," then they will jeopardize  the basic interests of the entire Chinese people, including  those in Taiwan. Furthermore, it is very dangerous to do this  as this would bring disastrous results to the 21 million Taiwan  people, and the 1.2 billion Chinese people will never allow them  to do this.  <H5>  Chinese People's Affairs Should Be Handled By Chinese People </H5>   A Chinese proverb goes: "A fly does not sting an egg which  has no crack." Some unresolved "complexes" between the two  sides of the strait and some people's speeches which advocate  separation or have a separatist tendency, have already give  opportunities to certain foreign forces. They fear China's  reunification, unity, and prosperity, so they try hard to sow  discord between the Chinese people on the two sides of the  strait. The common trick they use is to "restrict Chinese with  Chinese" and "separate them to control them." Is it not true  that the so-called "restricting the Kuomintang with the  Democratic Progressive Party," "restricting the CPC with the  Kuomintang," and "restricting reunification with 'Taiwan  independence'" are new tricks employed by certain aggressive  foreign forces under the new historical conditions? History is  a mirror, and individual and political parties alike must guard  against being used as a tool by aggressive foreign forces to  deal with his own motherland and compatriots.    The affairs of the Chinese people should be settled by the  Chinese people themselves. Perhaps, due to personal experience,  although Mr. Li Teng-hui admits being a Chinese, he lacks a real  and thorough understanding of the Chinese people in Taiwan, and  he has even less understanding of the Chinese people on the  mainland, nor does he understand the thinkings and emotions of  the entire Chinese people. Otherwise, it would be difficult to  answer the following questions: The people on the two sides of  the strait are Chinese people, but are unable to sit down  together to discuss their home affairs, while every effort is  made to have foreigners "weigh down" the Chinese. Is this not  just the opposite to what people wish? Why cannot the leaders of  the political parties or those in power on the two sides of the  strait "talk face to face," while with this Japanese, who still  harbors a great deal of hostility toward China and cherishes the  Japanese occupation of Taiwan, he could sit side by side and  talk intimately, sticking to each other like glue?    Why, in front of foreign leaders, can he "lower his body,"  "speak softly," and even "act humbly" to seek dialogue and  communication, but mention "status," cite "price," pursue  "equality," and in fact refuse others completely when hearing  repeated calls from mainland leaders for dialogue and  communication between the leaders of the two sides of the  strait? There can only be one answer, that is, "using the  external to restrict the internal"; as a result, foreigners reap  the benefits.  <H5>  True Meaning of So-Called "Sovereignty Rests With the </H5> People"    Mr. Li Teng-hui has another theory, that is, "sovereignty  rests with the people." The intention of preaching "sovereignty  rests with the people" is to deal with the CPC's one country,  two systems, to negate China's sovereignty over Taiwan, to use  it as a banner in an attempt to enter the United Nations, and to  create a "Taiwan people's country" which is separate from the  mainland. In fact, this is precisely what certain foreign  forces want. However, this can never be a way out.    What kind of "people" is the "people" in "sovereignty rests  with the people?" Is it a people controlled and misled or a  "people" completely free of control and who really understand  the actual situation? Is it a portion or a minority of "people"  or is it the entire and majority of "people?" These are great  topics to be discussed. In history, we see various incidents in  which the will of the "people" has been stolen to serve some  people's political ambitions, but, eventually, even though they  might have succeeded for a while, they could not escape the  punishment of history. What is particularly worth mentioning is  that, concerning the big matter of a country's sovereignty, it  is never changed by a small number of conspirators who plot the  "will of people."    The government and people on the mainland have exercised  great restraint toward recent outrageous speeches made by some  persons in the Taiwan authorities. Perhaps, because some of  them are Taiwan-born people, the mainland has more or less "held  back from doing anything against them for fear of involving good  people," and this is also not to give foreigners loopholes to  infiltrate. I hope they will not go too far down the road and  will not see restraint as weakness with which they can take  liberties, as they would be completely wrong.    Finally, I suggest that Mr. Li Teng-hui comes to the  mainland  to carry out research and inspection in the capacity of an  individual. Since he says he can visit various countries in the  name of "Dr. Li" or as an "agricultural expert," then why can he  not come to the mainland with such a status? Please be aware  that it is not feasible to formulate a mainland policy based on  "assumptions" and the "emotional" thoughts of a small number of  people without understanding the mainland and without  understanding the real thoughts and emotions of 1.2 billion  Chinese people.</p>

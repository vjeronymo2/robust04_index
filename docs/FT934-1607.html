			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Good first half for Dickson Concepts Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong-based luxury wholesaler and retailer, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in profits to HKDollars 143.56m (USDollars 18.6m), after tax and minority interests, for the six months to September 30. This compares with HKDollars 130.46m for the comparable period last year. Mr Edwin Ing, executive director and company secretary, said the interim period marked a phase of consolidation for the group in its position as a premier international retailer and wholesaler of luxury goods. It was also broadly a time of expansion, as Dickson forged stronger links with the China market and creamed off bigger profits from London store Harvey Nichols, which it bought for Pounds 53.7m (Dollars 80m) from the Burton Group in October 1991. Overall, turnover rose 2.8 per cent to HKDollars 1.32bn from HKDollars 1.29bn, and earnings per share improved 1.9 cents to 20.9 cents. The interim dividend is to be maintained at 10 cents. Dickson Concepts next year plans to follow up its successful launch of upmarket designer labels on the mainland with the opening of two new boutiques: exclusive Polo/Ralph Lauren and Harvey Nichols stores in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Also in Shanghai, the J. J. Dickson Arcade - 100,000 sq ft of luxurious shopping, into which the group invested an initial USDollars 24m - is due to come on line next month. Mr Ing said: 'The group's retail network across the world has now been expanded to well over 200 outlets. 'With development programmes being implemented throughout the group's operations worldwide, the group is confident that given its healthy debt-free financial position and its strong recurring income base, it will be able to substantially increase its turnover and profits capabilities once these projects reach fruition.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by K.I. Angelopoulos: "Mr. Berisha's `A La </F> Turks' Policy"]    [Text] The behavior of Albanian leaders toward Athens and  the policy that they use against the Greek minority and the  Orthodox Church in Albania have caused big problems. Everything  shows that Sali Berisha's (formally democratic) regime follows a  specific line.    It tries to prove in our Balkan region and internationally  that Greece has territorial designs on Albania, the Orthodox  Church there is a "political agent" of the Greek Government, and  our country is a threat to the Balkans because of its relations  with Belgrade.    The government has so far shown restraint on this issue,  which passed through a phase of strong tension after the  well-known fatal incident at Peshkepi, and it exhausted every  diplomatic possibility to prevent deterioration of  Greek-Albanian relations. However, Tirana's "response" to this  cool behavior has shown that the Albanian regime seeks the  deterioration of bilateral relations.    Apparently believing that he has secured some international  "protection" and that his relations with Ankara will yield some  profits for him, the Albanian president is attempting to  formulate a "scenario" that would offer him the possibility of  eliminating the Greek Orthodox minority from his country so that  North Epirus would soon be inhabited by Albanian Muslims.    With such Albanian intentions, it is not surprising that the  Zurich meeting on 3 May between the two countries' foreign  ministers did not achieve any substantive results. Will there  be positive results from another ministerial meeting as Tirana  now wants? This could happen only if Sali Berisha and those who  support his "line" decide to change their policy toward Greece  and the Greek minority. However, this does not seem possible.  The most probable thing that will happen is that Tirana will  adopt Ankara's methods: Escalation of provocations along with  invitations for "dialogue" at times to preserve the  international community's impression of "good intentions."  Given the current Tirana policy, Athens is obliged to consider  a specific "Albanian policy."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts: "Russia and United </F> States: Is Mature Partnership Taking Over from `Breakthroughs'"]    [Text] Journalists are well acquainted with the situation:  The people who prepare the latest summit meeting try to "boost"  it, to lend it more importance than it actually has. It looks  as though something like the opposite has happened with U.S.  President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia. On the eve of the  visit Russian and U.S. representatives warned very frankly that  no special sensations were to be expected. And this despite the  fact that the program for the visit envisaged very important  events. They included the signing of the Russian-U.S.  declaration containing, informed sources in the Foreign Ministry  assert, provisions on the nontargeting of the two states'  strategic forces against each other. They also include the  sensational meeting with the Ukrainian president's participation.    In brief, there were many opportunities for "boosting" the  visit. But they decided to refrain from doing this. And it was  not a question of the modesty of diplomats and politicians. In  my view the point is that U.S.-Russian relations have indeed  reached a level when they do not need breakthroughs. That is,  they do not need risky political decisions based on the  intuition of leaders and the degree of their trust in each  other. These relations to all appearances have indeed reached a  stage which can be called, as the documents which have been  prepared call it, a mature strategic partnership.    Some people may say that this is also an attempt to make out  what is desired as reality. Our countries' positions are too  different now and their clout in the world is too different.  That is true, just as it is true that over the past few months  and weeks each side has had the opportunity to take a realistic  look at its partner and to rid itself of unjustified hopes.  Whether they are illusions of the creation of a new world order  with the United States' undoubted leadership. Or hopes for a  rapid way out of the crisis in Russia as a result of aid from  abroad.    As a result of this sober assessment the sides concluded  that  we need each other. And Washington needs Moscow no less than  Moscow needs Washington. Take questions of economic  cooperation, which have become central in bilateral relations.  On this score you can hear diametrically opposed views. It  would be wrong to say that the United States is not rendering  aid to Russia. Approximately $2 billion a year are being  assigned for this purpose -- more than to any other foreign  state. Yet after all this aid is simply insignificant if you  bear in mind the scale of the reforms undertaken in Russia. It  has now finally become clear to everyone that to implement them  Moscow needs not credit, still less humanitarian aid. It needs  honest partnership, whose aim would be to emerge onto the world  market with its own output, already entirely competitive today,  be it aluminium or space high technology. The aim of this  partnership is to ensure conditions for the broad investment of  private business funds in our economy.    But for that to happen it is not enough simply to repeal  COCOM [the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export  Controls] or to renounce discriminatory legislation of the cold  war times. We must start to remove trade and customs barriers.  Russia also expects the United States to influence those  international financial institutions which are so far very cool  toward the need to support our reforms.    But does that mean we expect charity from the United  States? Obviously not. I think the Clinton administration  realizes that whether Russia remains a democratic, peace-loving  state depends on the success of the reforms, and it is that  which will determine whether or not global stability will be  successfully ensured on our planet or not. After a number of  painful defeats in foreign policy the U.S. Administration seems  to have agreed that this global stability is possible only on  the basis of a new Russian-U.S. partnership. Only by joint  efforts is it possible to respond to the threats which have now  appeared in the security field.    For instance we must ensure a regime of the nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons. Here too we cannot fail to mention the  forthcoming meeting in Moscow between the presidents of Russia,  the United States, and Ukraine. It is believed that documents  will be signed which will finally determine Ukraine's movement  toward nuclear-free status. The voices of skeptics are already  being heard: It has become the Ukrainian leader's style to  review agreements that have already been concluded. But one way  or another it remains a fact that the United States and Russia  are persistently moving together toward the solution of this  complex issue.    One more confirmation of the level of this cooperation: The  American "partnership for peace" plan. One cannot fail to see  that it was born and was adopted primarily with a consideration  for Russia's legitimate interests in the field of security. It  is entirely possible that Moscow will announce its participation  in it. Here Russia sees in partnership for peace not an end in  itself but one element of the architecture of European security  that is taking shape.    Peacemaking still has to become a notable element of  cooperation between Russia and the United States. There is not  yet complete clarity here in approaches, there are different  views of how to implement the settlement of local conflicts  particularly in the post-Soviet area. But the fact that the  question has already been raised of assigning Russian and U.S.  troop formations to carry out emergency peacekeeping operations  under the UN mandate says a lot. In general Moscow believes that  our strategic partnership is a good basis for discussing  problems of the fundamental restructuring of the entire system  of international relations.    And these are just a few of the problems which are to be  discussed during the Russian-U.S. meeting. And in addition  there is a very broad agenda: from agreements on human rights  to documents on cooperation in eliminating chemical weapons,  from problems of banning the production of fissionable materials  for military purposes and banning nuclear materials to the  coordination of actions in a Near East settlement.    It is not simple to earmark the main, key problem and we  should scarcely do so. I very much liked the working term  "comprehensive" which is used in our day with regard to  Clinton's visit. It is not only that during the visit the  entire complex of bilateral and global problems is being  discussed. It is also that the importance of each of these  problems can only be understood in combination with others. And  only in this way, by assessing what is happening as a package,  can we reach the conclusion that our states really do need close  cooperation with each other.</p>

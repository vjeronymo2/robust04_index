			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Hungarian court blocks communists' trials HUNGARY'S constitutional court yesterday blocked trials of communists who murdered and sold out their country to the Soviet Union in the early and most brutal years of the former dictatorship. The judges unanimously threw out the government-supported Zetenyi-Takacs amendment, crippling the right-wing drive for Nuremberg-style trials. The court deemed unconstitutional the amendment's suspension of the statute of limitations on crimes of murder and treason which were allowed to expire by the former regime. Yesterday's decision lifts the threat of prosecution from communists who had a hand in the violent suppression of Hungary's 1956 uprising, who were the most obvious targets of the Zetenyi-Takacs amendment. The judgment stops in its tracks the conservative government's Justice plan to compensate the victims of the communist regime, and punish and purge those who persecuted them. The plan has repeatedly run up against constitutional principles when it has been translated into law. Mr Arpad Goncz, the president, had opened the way for a compromise under which old communist criminals would be exposed but not prosecuted. Demands for retribution are weaker in Hungary than in neighbouring countries. The communist regime became liberal in its later days and now stability, the main condition of economic recovery, is given top priority. Attention now turns to the goverment's proposal to purge former agents of III/III, the hated internal security arm of the communist secret police. The bill to vet political, business and media leaders for secret service links goes before parliament for voting this month. Opposition MPs have questioned whether it is legal to discriminate for membership of an organisation which was legitimate at the time.</p>

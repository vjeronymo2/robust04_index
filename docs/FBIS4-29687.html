			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Still Cannot Be Optimistic About the Future </F> of the `North's' Suspected Nuclear Arms Development"]    [Text] There is a new movement afoot to find a way out of  the current situation concerning the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected nuclear arms development. However, it seems that  enforcement of nuclear inspections on facilities not declared by  the DPRK, which are the key to dissolving suspicion, and other  matters, depend on future vice ministerial talks between the  United States and the DPRK. There will be twists and turns  before the suspicion is completely dissolved. We believe  international society will have no choice but to continue to  send strong messages to the DPRK.    President Clinton announced he will agree to the holding of  U.S.-DPRK vice ministerial talks if North Korea freezes its  nuclear arms development program. This is a result of his  appraisal of President Kim Il-song's pledges made at a meeting  with Former President Carter. Among other things, Kim Il-song  promised he will allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspectors to remain in North Korea. However, international  society needs to watch the development of U.S.-DPRK talks to  make sure North Korea's recent attitude is not designed merely  to gain some time.    We cannot have an optimistic view of the future because it  appears to us that North Korea's past actions have been nothing  but an abuse of its nuclear cards. Last year, North Korea  announced it would secede from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) and is still mulling this decision. This time,  immediately before the Carter-Kim talks, North Korea announced  it would split from the IAEA. This is a North Korean tactic of  making its compromises look big by raising hurdles before  negotiations and lowering them afterward.    We can say the United States and the rest of international  society have been fooled by these tactics and forced to make  compromises over the past several years. For example, when the  suspected nuclear arms development was disclosed, the United  States demanded North Korea accept not only IAEA inspections but  also mutual inspections by North and South. Now, however, the  United States is demanding North Korea accept "inspections by  the IAEA at least."    Initially, the United States said acceptance of special  inspections of facilities which have not been declared is a  prerequisite for resuming U.S.-DPRK talks. Now, the United  States is calling for resumption of talks by actually  withdrawing the prerequisite. International society is giving  such considerations in order not to corner North Korea. If it  is a member of international society, North Korea has a  responsibility to sincerely respond to the call.    We pointed out before that international society needs to  take practical actions to settle the North Korean issue. We  also said that, if circumstances require it would be unavoidable  for international society to be prepared for the possibility of  imposing sanctions, while aiming to settle the issue through  dialogue.    The United States already announced a draft proposal for  sanctions which will be studied at the UNSC [United Nations  Security Council]. The draft proposal calls for introduction of  a 30-day grace period before sanctions and imposing them in two  stages. It shows the United States' hope of avoiding an attempt  to incite North Korea.    President Kim Il-song's true intentions are still not clear.  But, we would like to believe that what he told Mr. Carter -- if  it was North Korea's willingness to settle the issue in a  positive manner -- is the result of efforts by international  society. We cannot coexist with a Korea peninsula armed with  nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons on the peninsula will  jeopardize stability in Northeast Asia and could create a  dangerous situation in which Japan may start talking about  owning nuclear weapons.    We cannot allow North Korea to gain time. We strongly hope  that North Korea will promise international society to freeze  its nuclear arms development project without delay, and it will  accept inspections of its nuclear facilities, including those  which have not been declared.</p>

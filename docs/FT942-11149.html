			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks wary ahead of economic data Wall Street US stocks moved in a narrow range yesterday as many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of today's important economic data, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.78 easier at 3,695.97, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.34 to 451.38 in uninspired trading. NYSE volume came to 255.7m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite receded 2.09 to 441.70 but the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.25 to 740.55. With the Labor Department due to release its report on April employment trends this morning, investors were generally unwilling to make fresh commitments. The data will give them the first comprehensive reading of the economy's strength in the second quarter, and could suggest the timing and aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve's next move to lift interest rates. Economists were expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 170,000, after March's surge of 456,000, the largest monthly gain since October 1987. The announcement yesterday of a slight rise in claims for unemployment benefit last week gave reason to be optimistic that inflationary constraints were not developing in the labour market. Bonds were little changed, but equity investors in recent sessions had tended to downplay movements in the Treasury market. A modest rally by the dollar against the yen and D-Mark was generally ignored. With US chain stores reporting April sales, retailers were relatively active. The results were mixed. Sears Roebuck rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 5/8 on a 12.3 per cent sales jump for stores opened at least a year. Gap, with no change in same-store sales, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/2 . FPL Group, the holding company for Florida Power &amp; Light, dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 when Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on the stock. British Petroleum ADRs jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 71 7/8 on strong first-quarter results. In financial services, Salomon climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 after its board waived a restriction preventing Berkshire Hathaway, controlled by Mr Warren Buffett, from raising its stake in the company to more than 20 per cent before October. Southwest Airlines retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 amid fears that it would lose booking after being ejected from a big computerised reservation system. Canada Toronto finished a cautious session easier as golds declined and nervous traders awaited the Ontario budget, presented just after the market close. The TSE 300 index slipped 9.4 to 4,259.8 and falls led rises by 412 to 302 after volume of 71.4m shares. The golds group lost 2.0 per cent as the bullion price fell USDollars 2.90 an ounce. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo dropped 8 per cent, hit by a sharp fall in blue chips and a general sense of frustration with the government's handling of the economic plan. The Bovespa index ended 1,259 down at 14,479.</p>

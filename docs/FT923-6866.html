			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Small businesses criticise quality scheme MANY SMALL businesses fear the quality assurance scheme BS 5750 will raise their costs without improving the quality of products or services, according to research by the Open University. Just over half of small businesses have no intention of seeking certification under the scheme, while a further 19 per cent are undecided about what to do, according to the survey of more than 1,500 companies. The standard was introduced in 1979 and more than 10,000 companies have been certified. Quality standards are tailormade for each company and assessed by independent experts. The British Standards Institution, which oversees the scheme, said certification was increasingly being demanded by organisations before they awarded contracts. The researchers say a number of small businesses fear they will be forced out of business because they cannot afford the costs associated with certification. 'Whilst the majority of those making comments regard BS 5750 as an additional and pointless bureaucratic burden, many were critical of its relevance to small firms and wanted to see simplified applications of the standard,' the study says. Comments from those surveyed included: 'We are besieged by red tape and interference and if we comply with all the extra paperwork imposed on us we will be left with no time to transact any business . . . Regrettably the cost of the consultants et cetera is too prohibitive - something like one third of our annual profit.' The institution said the standard was neither bureaucratic nor expensive - certification can cost as little as Pounds 1,000. NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small Business.

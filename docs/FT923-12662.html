			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Decision helps ease pressure on UK THE City and Whitehall breathed a collective sigh of relief when it became clear that the UK would not be forced into following the German discount rate rise. Although the  3/4 percentage point increase in the German rate exceeded expectations, the Bundesbank's decision to leave its internationally important Lombard rate unchanged at 9 3/4 per cent meant no market pressure for an increase in British bank base rates from 10 per cent. The news that average earnings in Britain showed the lowest annual increase for 25 years in May, with an underlying rise of 6 1/2 per cent, lent some support to sterling. The German decision was welcomed by the UK government as 'clearly preferable' to a Lombard rate increase. While City analysts warned that the pound would be vulnerable to mood swings in the days ahead, the government repeated its commitment to take sterling into the narrow band of the European exchange rate mechanism at the existing DM2.95 EMS central rate. Officials made clear that the government would keep this pledge in the unlikely event of Germany revaluing the D-Mark. They said that Britain would set interest rates at the level necessary to keep sterling in the ERM. The pound, which dipped immediately after the Bundesbank's decision, recovered in London to finish at DM2.855, up 1 pfennig from Wednesday's close. Money market rates in London eased slightly: the 3 month interbank rate, which usually acts as the bellwether for base rates, dipped to about 10 1/8 per cent, from 10 3/16 per cent the day before. The London equity market fell prey to doubts as the conviction grew that there could be no reduction in German - and hence UK - interest rates this year. The FT-SE 100 index finished down 3 at 2,483.4. Events in Frankfurt overshadowed UK jobless figures, which were unexpectedly good. The 7,000 rise to 2.72m in seasonally adjusted unemployment in June was the smallest for two years. Economists expect a higher rate of increase this month, but longer-term trends suggest unemployment growth is slowing. The slowdown in average earnings growth to 6.5 per cent in May from 7 per cent in April points to lower inflation ahead. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg Securities, said research by Warburgs and Income Data Services, the pay information group, suggested that average UK private sector wage settlements have fallen below 4 per cent this month. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers, said retail price inflation could fall to 2 per cent in the second half of 1993. Speaking for the Confederation of British Industry, Professor Douglas McWilliams, its chief economic adviser, said the faster-than-expected fall in inflation meant there was 'no case for a rise in UK interest rates'. Sir Brian Hill, president ot the Building Employers Confederation, said: 'The construction industry is already on its knees. A rise in British interest rates at this stage would be disastrous.'

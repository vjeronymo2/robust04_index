The town of Volsk is situated a few dozen kilometers away  from Shikhany, which hosts a test site of the Defense Ministry.  At the moment, the Moscow city court is conducting closed  hearings of the case of another former employee of the same  institute, Vil Mirzayanov, accused of revealing confidential  information on the production of chemical weapons in Russia.    Uglyov said the weapons were destroyed in Shikhany by  burying  in the ground. Substances containing arsenic, in particular  lewisite, were simply dumped into pits dug especially for this  purpose. Such substances are supposed to lose their poisonous  features in a short period of time.    "However, the background level of arsenic in the region  exceeds the maximum limit three times," Uglyov said. From  August 1992 to August 1993, the number of illnesses went up by  1.8 times in the region, he said. Uglyov pointed out that the  test site was situated not far from the river Volga and did not  rule out the possibility of the poisonous substances' leakages  into the water.    The scientist said he had never received a response to his  repeated appeals to the president and government to take  measures to improve the ecological situation in the region. He  pointed out that he had worked on the development of chemical  weapons for 15 years.    "If the detrimental consequences of the destruction of  chemical weapons remain ignored, I will make public the  poisonous substances' formulas and names, sources of raw  materials, techniques of their manufacturing and combat use,"  Uglyov said. He said he was doing that only to draw everyone's  attention to the health of people residing in the Saratov region.</p>

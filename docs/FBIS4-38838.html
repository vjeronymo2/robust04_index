			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Romanov] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun -- A claim by the U.S. magazine U.S.  NEWS AND WORLD REPORT that several thousand scientists and  technical specialists from the former USSR are currently working  to contract in China on the creation of new weapons systems was  described as "absolutely without foundation" today by a  representative of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.    Replying to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Chinese diplomat  remarked that reports of Russian weapons experts helping his  country to modernize its armaments crop up from time to time in  the U.S. media. He laughed at the magazine's citing of U.S.  intelligence sources. "U.S. intelligence always gets it wrong,"  he said.    On Wednesday, the U.S. magazine's story was denied by a  senior official from the Russian Foreign Ministry.    "I suppose there are some contracts for our technical  specialists to go to China," he told ITAR-TASS, "but I very much  doubt their number is as high as that, especially in such a  delicate and sensitive area of cooperation. I think that it  does happen, but in single figures."    "Thousands of them--that is a crazy figure," ITAR-TASS was  told on the same day by a qualified source at the Russian  Federation Foreign Intelligence Service. "Until recently," he  added, "we had no instances of anybody working in arms  production."    According to other sources, Russian specialists, especially  in aircraft construction, are attracting great attention from  Beijing. These are mainly middle-ranking technicians whose pay  in China would as a rule not exceed 1,000 dollars a month. That  is considerably less than they would get in the West, but a lot  more than in Russia.</p>

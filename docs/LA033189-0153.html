			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKERS CAN PICK TRADITIONAL INSURANCE OR HMO;  </P> <P> 2 COUNTY COMPANIES OFFER DUAL HEALTH PLAN  </P> <P> PM Group Life Insurance Co. and Health Plan of America -- two county companies  competing for group health insurance premiums -- said Thursday that they have  joined forces to market a dual health plan to Southern California businesses.  </P> <P> The companies said they started jointly selling PM Group Life's traditional  health insurance and Health Plan's health maintenance organization (HMO) this  month.  </P> <P> Employers who sign up for the dual policy will offer workers a choice of PM  Group Life or Health Plan of America. The dual policies will be managed as one  by PM Group Life, which will cut overhead.  </P> <P> Typically, HMOs and insurance plans offered by an employer are administered by  separate companies.  </P> <P> For PM Group Life, a Fountain Valley-based subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life  Insurance Co., the agreement will broaden its services and make it more  competitive with the largest insurance companies, which have started their own  HMOs.  </P> <P> Health Plan of America, an Orange-based subsidiary of the nonprofit St. Joseph  Health System, will benefit by being able to more easily sell its plan to  companies already established with PM Group Life. In addition to basic health  coverage, long-term disability and dental and vision plans will be available.  </P> <P> PM Group Life insures about 230,000 employees in its group health plans. Health  Plan of America has about 96,000 members.  </P> <P> The plan will be marketed by sales representatives of each company; the two  companies will equally share expenses and revenues.  </P> <P> Michael Turpin, an assistant vice president at Johnson &amp; Higgins, an  employee benefits consulting firm in Costa Mesa, said the agreement is a  necessary response to competitive changes in the industry.  </P> <P> Traditional health insurance companies have lost clients to HMOs, which are  particularly popular among younger workers. Consequently, insurance companies  have a disproportionate number of older workers who tend to have bigger medical  bills, he said.  </P> <P> He said that medium-size operations such as Pacific Mutual Group Life have  moved slowly in offering HMO plans and that some still have no HMO options.  </P> <P> PM Group Life spokesman Jim Burke said his company has not started its own HMO  because the costs of establishing a network are staggering. He said PM Group  Life considered buying an HMO about 18 months ago but decided to study  alternatives.  </P> <P> Burke said there is no plan to buy Health Plan of America's operations.  </P> <P> Health Plan of America President Lawrence Kugelman said Health Plan of America  could gain up to 10,000 customers a year through the joint marketing agreement.  The plan is to be sold statewide later this year.  </P></p>

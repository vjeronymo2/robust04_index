			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / International Company News: No basis for court action against Spanish bankers MR EMILIO BOTIN, the president of Banco Santander, the acquisitive Spanish commercial bank, was yesterday released without bail after giving evidence in chambers to a Madrid judge trying to find out who bought Dollars 1bn of credit assignments made by the bank between 1987 and 1989. The Spanish tax authorities and the court suspect that many of the buyers of the credit assignments - off balance sheet transactions designed to bypass Bank of Spain liquidity ratios and withholding taxes  - may have used them to launder undisclosed income. Mr Rodrigo Echenique, Santander's managing director, also gave evidence to the judge yesterday and was also released without bail. Banco Santander said the judge had decided there was no basis for taking any action against the two men. The judge, however, made no public statement and it is possible, as a nationwide investigation continues, that they may be recalled to give evidence to the inquiry. Mr Botin, on leaving the court, said the credit assignments - the sale of loans to third parties to remove them from the bank's balances - were perfectly legal at the time. 'Although I was not aware of it, there may have been an excess of zeal, some negligence or a lack of information about the client's intentions,' he said. 'We have co-operated fully with the authorities in their investigation.' The tax authorities say they have been unable to identify the buyers of about 3,000 credit assignments and suspect that many may have been fictitious. Most Spanish banks used the assignments but Banco Santander is understood to have been the most aggressive seller of loans.</p>

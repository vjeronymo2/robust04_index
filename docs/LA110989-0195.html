			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: THE CLINTS LOOK, DON'T SOUND, LIKE A WESTERN BAND;  </P> <P> ROCK: 'I DON'T EVEN LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC. NONE OF US DOES,' SAYS GROUP'S ELDEST  NAMESAKE.  </P> <P> Rock bands wearing cowboy hats? That's been done.  </P> <P> Rock bands with each member taking the same name? That's been done, too.  </P> <P> Then along came the Clints, an Orange County band that figured one way to  invent a new promotional ploy was to splice together two old ones.  </P> <P> The Clints maintain -- adamantly, although not very convincingly -- that each  of the four band members really and truly has borne the name Clint from birth.  They didn't sprout the black cowboy hats until two years ago, when the band was  formed.  </P> <P> This does not make the Clints promotional geniuses. It's hard to fathom why a  band debuting in 1989 would want to rehash the image of the "cowpunk" bands who  briefly rode the range in the early to mid-'80s -- especially because many of  those bands (among them Rubber Rodeo, Rank &amp; File and Lone Justice) wound  up in premature graves on pop's version of Boot Hill.  </P> <P> The Clints figured that cowboy trappings would give the band an instant image,  and an excuse to spin some wild Western tall tales about themselves, explained  Clint Ambuter, the oldest Clint, whose shadowy beard would probably typecast  him as one of the bad guys in a cowboy movie. Unlike the cowpunk bands, who all  wove country influences into their sound, the Clints never intended to carry  over any Western stylings into their music.  </P> <P> "I don't even like country music. None of us does," Ambuter said. Instead, he  said, it was sheer process of elimination that left the Clints wearing cowboy  gear and planting their concert stages with fake cacti.  </P> <P> "When the band was formed, we said, 'We can't go out and be punk, because there  are so many out there with spiked haircuts.' We didn't want to be a glam band  with long hair. Our music wasn't like that."  </P> <P> But cowboy gear would stand out, they figured. And, after all, didn't everyone  in the band already bear the first name of a certain hard-bitten film hero from  the spaghetti Westerns?  </P> <P> Well, maybe. Asked during a recent interview to produce legal identification  verifying their authenticity, self-proclaimed Clints Ambuter, Wade and Harrison  demurred, mumbling something about stolen or misplaced wallets.  </P> <P> Setting aside the name game and the hokey cowboy jokes, the Clints' debut  album, "No Place Like Home" is a solid, wide-ranging effort that holds up  without recourse to gimmickry. While not afraid to let go with some  satisfyingly noisy blasts of guitar feedback or toss in some punkish thrashing  rhythms, the Clints always keep the emphasis on melody. On a couple of songs,  they silence the raging electric guitars and speedily flailing drums and strum  folksy, airy-sounding campfire music.  </P> <P> Ambuter's husky singing voice recalls his hero, Peter Gabriel, and his songs  about romantic trials and existential crises display an admirably lean and  concise approach to lyric writing. Wade's songs -- flightier, abstract, and  strewn with tangled thickets of words -- offer an enjoyably quirky counterpoint  to his sidekick's concrete images and straightforward emotionalism.  </P> <P> The Clints admit that what's on the record doesn't mesh in the least with the  band's promotional trappings: "The clothes don't tell you who we are. What  tells you who we are is the songs," Ambuter said.  </P> <P> Ambuter, 28, and Wade, 27, are childhood friends who grew up on the same block  in Huntington Beach. "We used to take tennis racquets when we were 10 years old  and pretend we were in a band," recalled Wade, an effusive talker with a sunny  disposition. After playing together first in a progressive rock band, then in  an early-'80s punk band called the Cement Bugs, the two guitarists hooked up  about five years ago with bassist Clint Harrison, 25. The band's newest member  is drummer Clint Villalobos, 24, who, the others say, was recruited through a  musician-wanted ad seeking drummers named Clint.  </P> <P> The Clints hooked up with a Los Angeles record producer, Dan Matovina, and made  demo recordings that they say drew some big-label interest. But the first  concrete offer came from Skyclad Records, a small New Jersey company that  Matovina had approached at the New Music Seminar in New York City.  </P> <P> "Skyclad said they could have the album out in three months, and the other  labels could have still been talking about it in three months," Ambuter said.  "It's a good way to start -- small and solid."  </P> <P> Since the album came out in July, the Clints have gotten good notices in the  alternative music press, as well as a fair amount of college radio airplay.  While all four members hold day jobs, they plan to begin working in some  touring outside Southern California, with dates in Northern California and Las  Vegas set for after Thanksgiving. In the meantime, the Clints have a round of  local shows coming up: Saturday at Bogart's with fellow Skyclad acts the  Popelopes and Russ Tolman; Nov. 24 at the Meadowlark Country Club, with the  Vandals; and a Nov. 25 acoustic set at the cozy Doll Hut in Anaheim.  </P> <P> When "No Place Like Home" came out, it contained one surprise that had the  Clints scratching their heads under those black hats. It turns out that the  folks at Skyclad Records know a thing or two about grabbing attention with a  promotional image -- the company logo printed on the record features a  blood-red splotch set against a background photo of the exploding space shuttle  Challenger.  </P> <P> "Isn't that horrible?" Wade said. "Don't ask."  </P> <P> The Clints play Saturday at 10 p.m. at Bogart's, in the Marina Pacifica Mall,  6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Also playing are Too Many Joes, Russ  Tolman and the Popelopes. Tickets: $6. Information: (213) 594-8975.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SO LONG: Jim Palmer, one of the leading figures in developing Orange County's  alternative-rock scene over the past five years, has moved to Las Vegas. There  is still an Orange County connection in Palmer's life, though: He'll be working  as a concert promoter and publicist for Calamity Jane's, a rock nightclub  co-owned by Coach House owner Gary Folgner.  </P> <P> "I'll be dealing with bigger artists and management companies and record  companies," said Palmer, an ex-Marine corporal who has been involved in the  Orange County rock scene since 1984. "I'll still be in touch with Orange County  as much as I can be. I still have a real interest in that."  </P> <P> Palmer booked concerts at local clubs, released several albums by local bands  on his own Out There label, and touted such upcoming Orange County bands as  Imagining Yellow Suns, the Swamp Zombies and Don't Mean Maybe to others in the  music business who could help them advance. Palmer said he will continue to  operate his own national tour booking agency, Plaza Booking, although on a  scaled-down level.  </P> <P> Palmer has made one of his finest contributions as the organizer and promoter  of the annual "Orange County Music For The Needy" benefit, which raises money  and gathers food, clothing and toys to provide a festive Christmas holiday for  poor families in the county. The daylong benefit also serves as a showcase and  a get-together for the local rock scene. The fifth annual Music For The Needy  benefit will take place Dec. 17 at the Coach House, with Dick Dale (solo), the  Wild Cards, the Joe Wood Project, James Harman, and the Louisiana Cajun Trio  among the featured acts.  </P></p>

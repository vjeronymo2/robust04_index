			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Justice and Peace Archdiocesan Commission in  Port-au-Prince has published an overwhelming report on  repression in Haiti, entitled "The Cry of the Executed People of  Cite Soleil." [passage omitted]    Since the coup d'etat, Cite Soleil has been turned into a  true refugee camp. About five Front for Haitian Advancement and  Progress [FRAPH] offices keep the population in anguish and  fear: one is located in Projet Drouillard and is headed by a man  named Herve Black. Four other offices are located near the  former Babeth Cinema and is headed by Gabriel Saint-Lot; on the  wharf; in Soleil 4; and in Soleil 17. These offices make  arrests, imprisonments, tortures, executions, and openly act in  collusion with and under the protection of the Army.    In only two days, seven bodies were found in the area. On 16  March, three bodies were found in Soleil 17; and on 17 March,  four bodies were discovered in Cite Belacour and Cite Lumiere.  The Sarthes slaughter, which occurred on the night of 2  February, resulted in 12 deaths, one person missing, and one  wounded. The missing persons are Jean-Pierre and Toussaint.  Survivors from this same group of youths are still being pursued  by the Army and FRAPH members. On 9 March in Soleil 9, Clotaire  Francois, 23, was murdered with cold steel. Witnesses  identified, among the attackers, a FRAPH member, Reverend  Hubert, who leads a church in Soleil 17. The attackers heavily  pressured the victims, who revealed the whereabouts of three  other youths.    Finally, the Commission established a more or less final  assessment of victims from that horrible day, 27 December 1993,  when 37 people died, 23 disappeared, and 10 were wounded and  [word indistinct] were recorded.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Uncertainties on the fringe of volatility - The Nordic markets With a strong economic recovery under way throughout the region, Nordic shares should be doing better. But fundamentals have counted for little even on the periphery of international volatility since US interest rates began to climb. Nordic bourses have been in thrall to developments in international bond markets, with equities tending to fall as bond yields have risen and vice-versa. Stock markets in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark all reached their year peak around late January and early February just before the US Federal Reserve lifted interest rates for the first time. Since then the trend has been downward, although it has been a modest rather than a dramatic decline. In Finland and Sweden shares are still up slightly on the year, while the fall in Denmark and Norway has been correspondingly small. Nobody was expecting the Nordic stock exchanges to be able to repeat their exceptional performance in 1993, when Finnish shares rose 91 per cent and Denmark, the region's worst performer, climbed nearly 40 per cent. However, most analysts would probably have expected shares to be higher than they are today. The main problem has been the sharp fall in bond prices, which has been exaggerated by the risk premiums associated with fringe markets. The immediate outlook is not particularly encouraging and not just because of the continuing tumult in the bond markets. Inflation has started to rear its head again. Political uncertainties are also on the increase. Both Sweden and Denmark are due to hold elections in the autumn while referendums on membership of the European Union are scheduled in Sweden, Norway and Finland for October and November. Counterbalancing these influences is burgeoning economic recovery. For the first time since 1990 all four countries will have positive economic growth in 1994, led by Norway and Denmark where GDP may grow by as much as four per cent. Company profits are rising strongly in most sectors. In Finland and Sweden, the recovery is export-led and comes on the back of a huge surge in corporate earnings. The earnings improvement has been spectacular, reflecting weaker currencies, extensive cost-cutting, as well as recovery in key markets. First quarter figures from Sweden's big multinationals showed clearly how strong the recovery has been. Many companies upgraded their full-year forecasts, citing a faster-than-expected recovery in Europe, confirming earlier expectations that 1994 is going to be one of the corporate sector's best-ever years. But Sweden, the biggest Nordic market, has had an uneven development in 1994. January's gains were wiped out by the end of March amid bond market tumult and a spate of rights issues. A cautious recovery got under way in April and May, supported by strong earnings reports. In June trading has again been dominated by the rise in long-term interest rates, dragging shares lower and leaving them just 3.6 per cent higher than they were at the start of the year. It is difficult to see the market making headway in the next few weeks, as Sweden heads into the summer holidays and awaits six month figures due out in August. Uncertainty is increasing ahead of the country's September general election which - the polls suggest - will return a Social Democratic government. If the victory materialises, it would be bad news for the market in the short term as the party has promised higher taxes on capital gains and dividends. The EU referendums are also weighing on sentiment. With opinion polls suggesting that both Norway and Sweden will say 'no' to the EU, international investors, in particular, may be wary. Denmark, never as volatile as its fellow Nordic markets because it has fewer cyclical stocks and a smaller influence from foreign investors, will be less influenced by these pressures. But the Danish market will have its own uncertainties in the run-up to the general election which has to be held by the end of the year. Norway, too, may find it hard to make progress. Shipping markets are depressed, particularly for very large tankers, and there is little support from the oil price. The nervous mood is likely to continue in the Nordic markets in the short term. 'The worry is interest rates going up and money not coming into the market on the back of it,' says Mr Peter Lawrence, head of Scandinavian research at Kleinwort Benson in London. That applies particularly to foreign buying which has done more than anything to drive up share prices, particularly in Sweden and Finland, over the last 18 months. The short-term bearish mood is echoed by Mr Richard Davidson, European equities strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. He is underweight on the region because of the political uncertainties and signs of rising inflation. He also believes much of the good news is already factored into prices. In the longer term, the view is more positive, due to economic and earnings recovery. Mr Klas Andersson at Goldman Sachs, taking a 12-month view, expects Norway and Finland to rise by up to 20 per cent, and Denmark and Sweden by 15 to 20 per cent.</p>

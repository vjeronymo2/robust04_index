			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Appointments: Greycoat founder goes Ronald Spinney has resigned as deputy chairman and joint managing director of the Greycoat property company. Although one of the founders of Greycoat in 1976, his career has not survived the company's decision to reduce its development activity. Greycoat is focused on the central London office market, which has been particularly badly hit by the property downturn. He was involved in building offices such as Embankment Place above Charing Cross and 123 Buckingham Palace Road. Now 50, he will act as a consultant to Greycoat, while pursuing other activities in the commercial property market. Greycoat confirmed that Richard Guignard, finance director, will act as chief executive while Geoffrey Wilson, executive chairman, is recovering from a heart operation. ***** Graham Jacks is appointed finance director of BRYANT Properties Developments and Bryant Properties Investments.</p>

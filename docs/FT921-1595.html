			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): Walking back to happiness THE MAN WHO BROKE OUT OF THE BANK . . . by Miles Morland Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 216 pages HERE IS my early (and not-too-serious) nomination for the best, by which I mean the most enjoyable, 'Business Book' of 1992. That may seem surprising, as it is not exactly an endorsement of the challenges and satisfactions of the life of the international financier: on the contrary, it is irresistible case for the wisdom of giving it all up. Miles Morland had spent, as he puts it, 'Twenty-Two Years Shouting Down A Phone'. After nine years on Wall Street he ran First Boston's brokerage office in London. At 45 he was - well, not quite bored, but he knew he had stopped learning. So he quit, and went off with his wife to walk across France. This is the story of The Walk, though the brief sequences in the City - Rudloff, Von Klemm, etc - are fascinating (and funny) enough to make one wish he would write at length about these things. (Says his 'rabbi' Luis in New York when told of his resignation: 'You're not gonna work for those fockers at Solly, are you?'. Before the Walk was over, Luis had quit too.) 'Non-City people think the satisfaction is in the money,' Morland says of his professional life. 'They're wrong. Most of the pleasure comes from the sheer competitive intensity of the work. But when I became successful in the City, I had the same feeling I had had at Oxford or Radley as a successful sportsman. I was wearing a suit that looked good, but hadn't it been made for someone else?' So at 45 he called a halt. 'Everyone else was secretly longing to do it too.' It is 350 miles from Mediterranean to Atlantic (Narbonne, Carcassonne, etc) and Morland writes of provincial France better, more convincingly, less sentimentally, than Peter Mayle. Having a half-French wife helps. The hotels are more often grotty than charming, the natives are frequently rude, the dogs are terrifying. Blisters, tendons, boots, showers, figure prominently for this out-of-condition couple; ants, wasps and cockroaches seem to feature on every page, as do many, many enthusiastically described meals of (sometimes) wonderful food washed down with many a bottle. It is agony and ecstasy in a mid-life crisis, set candidly in the context of a marriage with a tricky past - they had divorced and remarried when he was at the height of his career. Best of all, it is extremely funny, and the fun never flags until they are paddling in the Atlantic. I foretell a rash of resignations in EC2 in coming weeks. 'Do you miss it?' Guislaine asked. 'What do you think?'</p>

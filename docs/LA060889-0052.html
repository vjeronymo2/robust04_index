			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MEETING IN TORRANCE;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS TO AIR VIEWS ON SCHOOL SITE'S ZONING  </P> <P> Torrance city officials will meet with residents tonight to get their views on  the future use of the former Columbia School site, which is at the center of a  dispute between the school district and the City Council.  </P> <P> The district wants to build up to 120 apartments on the five-acre, triangular  lot on 186th Street, but council members question the density of the project  and some fear it could include subsidized housing -- a politically hot issue in  Torrance.  </P> <P> Tonight, city officials will meet with residents at Magruder Middle School to  discuss the zoning of the land. The site, which has been vacant since 1987, is  owned by the school district and is zoned for public use.  </P> <P> Paul Mackey, the district's special services administrator, said the district  wants to build apartments on the land because Torrance schools would raise the  most money by developing the lot to its fullest. He said the district is in the  process of requesting that the land be zoned for high-density residential use.  The school district needs the approval of the Planning Commission and the City  Council for a zone change.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joint Venture  </P> <P> The plan to develop the land would be a joint venture between the district and  the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, he said. The  commission develops publicly owned land and provides real estate advice to  public agencies at a nominal fee.  </P> <P> State law requires that any profits from the sale of school lands go toward  building improvements and purchase of other property. By developing the  Columbia site instead of selling it, the district can use the profits any way  it wants, Mackey said.  </P> <P> Councilman Tim Mock said that, although the district has not offered any  specific plans, some council members are concerned that the district is  considering a project too dense for the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Mock said the council has not decided what it would like to see on the lot. The  city staff has suggested the land would be best suited for senior citizen  housing. But because there are few shops nearby, Mock said senior housing would  not be suitable. He said he is also concerned that such a housing project would  also be too dense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subsidized Housing Fears  </P> <P> Some council members, including Dan Walker and Bill Applegate, have said they  are concerned that, if the district and the county work together to develop the  land, the district may be required to provide subsidized housing.  </P> <P> County officials have said they know of no requirement that would force the  district to provide subsidized housing.  </P> <P> Walker said last week that he opposes subsidized housing in Torrance because it  would bring down property values in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Mackey said the district has "no intention of involving the city or the school  district in subsidized housing."  </P> <P> Subsidized housing is a sensitive issue with the City Council. In 1980, four  council members faced recall petitions because they voted for a federally  subsidized housing project in order to continue receiving federal grants.  </P> <P> Faced with overwhelming opposition from residents, the council ultimately  dropped out of the federal housing program and the recall effort was abandoned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Community Feeling  </P> <P> Mock said tonight's 7 o'clock meeting at Magruder Middle School will help the  city to "get a feeling of what the community wants."  </P> <P> William Largent, president of the North Torrance Property &amp; Homeowners  Assn., said last week that residents in the neighborhood near the school fear  that apartments will produce too much traffic and congestion.  </P> <P> "I think the city and the people want low-density or single-family houses,"  Largent said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Re-Evaluate Plans  </P> <P> Mackey said that, if the city rejects the district's zone change, district  officials will re-evaluate their plans for the lot.  </P> <P> In July, the school officials asked the community development commission to  evaluate the vacant property and recommend how to get the highest financial  return. The commission said the most profitable use would be a high-density  apartment project.  </P> <P> It has not been estimated how much the development may cost, but Harvey  Oelkers, the district's assistant superintendent for business services, has  said the district plans to borrow all of the money needed. He estimated that  the profit to the district over a 10-year period could be as high as $13.5  million. The land alone is worth about $4.5 million.  </P> <P> If the project is completed, the district plans to hire a private agency to  manage the property.  </P> <P> Developing vacant school sites instead of selling the land has become popular  with school districts throughout the state, according to officials at the  School Facilities Planning Division of the State Department of Education.  </P> <P> In Redondo Beach, the elementary school district is working with developers to  build two senior citizens homes, one at the old McCandless Elementary School  site and the other on the site of the former Andrews Elementary School.  </P></p>

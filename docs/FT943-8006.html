			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: HunterPrint raises Pounds 1.9m from MBO HunterPrint, the lossmaking printing group, is selling its only active subsidiary in a bid to reduce its debt burden. The Corby-based group said that a management buy-out team had agreed to pay Pounds 1.85m cash for Hardy Printers, the specialist forms manufacturer which it acquired for Pounds 5.8m seven years ago. Mr Geoff Eades, HunterPrint's finance director, said funds from the disposal would be used to cut the group's net borrowings of Pounds 19.4m. 'We are determined to reduce our debts and this offer was the best we had,' he said. The disposal follows the sale this year of a surplus printing site to Associated Newspapers for Pounds 1.5m and the group's success in winning a release from future lease payments of Pounds 1.5m on a new press. Mr Eades admitted that the group's borrowings - incurred largely by over-ambitious expansion in the late 1980s - remained unmanageable and ahead of shareholders' funds of Pounds 11.8m. Banking facilities have been fully utilised, and he warned that the full-year results would be 'very poor'. However, Mr Eades said capacity had been improved and the group would soon start to generate the cash necessary to reduce its borrowings. The shares, which have fallen steadily from a high of almost 70p a year ago, closed down 2p at 16p.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea growers face problems over falls in prices and production THE INDIAN tea industry is facing critical problems over production and prices. The country's tea output declined by 26.21m kg in the first six months of 1992, compared with the same period last year, to 237m kg. Meanwhile, the average price realised at the Calcutta auction in the period to the end of July was down Rs3.78 (6.75p) at Rs44.05 a kilogram. The combination of lower production and reduced prices has badly affected the profitability of Indian tea companies, particularly the ones owning estates in south India and West Bengal, according to industry officials. First-half production in the south Indian estates was down by a little over 18m kg at 75m kg. Tamil Nadu alone suffered an 11.3m kg shortfall; Kerala's output was down by 6.6m kg; and Karnataka's by 256,000 kg. Plucking in earlier months of the season suffered because of a severe drought. West Bengal, which missed out on pre-monsoon showers, produced 44.43m kg in the first half, compared with 55.11m kg a year earlier. The production shortfall in Dooars was 7.58m kg, in Terai 2m kg and in Darjeeling 1.1m kg. According to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the brokers, the Darjeeling gardens, which have a small production base but earn a very high unit value for their tea, will be hit badly by the substantial drop in production. Out of India's total production of 742m kg in 1991, the share of Darjeeling was only 13m kg. Assam, where the largest quantity of Indian tea is grown, had in the first half of the year gained 2.7m kg to 117m kg. There has since, however, been a marginal fall in production to 47m kg in June. While India may find it difficult to achieve its production target of 720m kg in the current year, the quality of tea in all centres has turned out to be good, says Mr Dudeja. He attributes this to a growing realisation among the planters that the only way they can make profit is by concentrating on the production of quality teas. The price difference between good and plain categories has increased to about Rs20 a kg. The reduced presence of Russia, traditionally the biggest buyer of Indian teas, at the auction centres is said to be partly responsible for low tea prices. Russia has so far bought 14m kg of Indian tea, compared with 40m kg in the corresponding period of 1991. Among all the tea producing countries, Sri Lanka has suffered the most, with production declining by 34.6m kg to 68.5m kg in the five months to May. The Kenyan crop is estimated to have fallen by 10.08m kg to 76.7m kg. The world tea crop shortfall during the current year will be about 100m kg, according to Mr Dudeja.</p>

The telephone conversation was described by Meshkov as  "well-wishing and calm". The meeting will be held on February 4  in the Ukrainian capital where Meshkov will go right after his  inauguration in Simferopol.    In the words of Meshkov, "there are no reasons for any  complications. The image of pro-Russian politician Ukrainian  nationalists are trying to make has nothing to do with me. But  this has provoked certain watchfulness of the Kiev authorities".    Meshkov noted the need for a stable Russian-Ukrainian union,  referring to historical experience of both states.    "The time of Mazepa -- striving for isolation -- has gone,  the epoch of Bogdan Khmelnitsky returns," the Crimean president  told ITAR-TASS.</p>

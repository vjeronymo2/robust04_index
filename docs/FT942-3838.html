			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Observer: Merck's odd injection Merck chairman Roy Vagelos is one of the most brilliant US scientists of his generation and has made Merck one the most admired companies in the pharmaceuticals business. But in one respect Vagelos has failed. He has not been able to groom an internal successor and has had to hand over the chairmanship of one of America's top ten companies to a virtual unknown. It is hard to imagine other US blue chips like Exxon, General Electric or Coca-Cola prepared to take such a risk. Merck is not another IBM. It is not short of good managers. So why has it turned to Raymond Gilmartin, 53, boss of Becton Dickinson, a much smaller medical supplies company? Gilmartin, who has spent 18 years with his firm, has no big drug company experience and is not the sort of corporate super-star to stir Wall Street. Admittedly, he has done the sorts of things on a small scale that Merck will need to do if it is to prosper over the coming decade. Becton Dickinson relentlessly cut costs during the mid-1980s and Gilmartin also boosted the company's research and development budget to take it into more profitable areas, such as diagnostic equipment. The hope is that Gilmartin can work the same sort of magic at Merck. But despite the best efforts of Merck's PR machine, Wall Street's initial verdict is that he's a high-risk choice. Gilmartin will be in charge of a Dollars 1.3bn R&amp;D budget, yet he has no background at all in the discovery and development of new drugs. He joined Becton Dickinson after an electrical engineering degree, an MBA from Harvard, and a stint as an Arthur D Little consultant. He's said to be charismatic and a hands-on manager, like Vagelos, whom he succeeds on Thursday. Even so, the management succession at one of the world's most admired companies looks like a botched job. Vagelos's abrupt exit at Merck has given the impression that it's a one-man show, which it is not.</p>

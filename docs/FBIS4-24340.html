			<p>BFN     [Text] Joao Lourenco, information secretary of the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA], says it is  important that the international community understand that in  Angola there is only one violator.    [Begin Lourenco recording] It is not the government which  has  been hampering peace so far. It is the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Over the past few hours  we heard that even the U.S. Administration thinks that the  government has satisfied all the mediator's proposals and  requests UNITA to follow the government's example. This only  confirms that if there is no peace in the country at present, it  is because UNITA is not ready for it. [end recording]</p>

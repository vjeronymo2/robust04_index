			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Joaquin Alvarez] </F>   [Text] The reform of the power structure and the  strengthening of the federal system, which will give the nation  a "new and equitable political balance," are irreversible  pledges that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon will champion and  strengthen, according to the National Executive Council of the  PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. Meanwhile, former PRI  President Pedro Ojeda Paullada defended the substitute  presidential candidate's political experience and role as  activist, stating "he is certainly no newcomer."    During an interview yesterday, Ojeda Paullada advised  Zedillo  to increase his public consultations and to discuss the party's  basic political proposals in an effort to place his personal  stamp on the presidential campaign. He referred to the PRI's  political situation and said Fernando Ortiz Arana's timely  refusal to accept the party's nomination prevented an internal  split.    Meanwhile, Ernesto Zedillo's campaign team said that over  the  weekend the presidential candidate studied the political  strategies he will implement in the next few months, adding,  "they will be consistent with the democratic principles of Luis  Donaldo Colosio and the party." A source within the campaign  coordination team said Zedillo will design his own political  philosophy and that it will be consistent with the statements,  pledges, and thesis he defended when he was in charge of the  Programming and Budget Secretariat, which no longer exists, and  the Public Education Secretariat. The source said: "Zedillo is  well aware of the nation's problems. Let us not forget he was  directly involved in the state reform strategy and policy, one  of the current administration's leading achievements."    Pedro Ojeda Paullada, former president of the PRI's National  Executive Council, said the candidates' nomination to the post  of assembly member, deputy, and senator will entail some  modifications within the party, but he denied that these include  changes in the PRI's national leadership. He also said there is  no statute that prevents national leader Fernando Ortiz Arana  from being nominated to the post of senator and remaining in  charge of the organization.    At about 2100 last night -- the eve of the formal start of  the campaign, which promises numerous political activities in  Mexico City -- a group of community leaders and land holders  from Magdalena Contreras and Santa Ursula personally delivered a  list of proposals to resolve land ownership problems to Zedillo.  Raymundo Munoz Ocadiz, adviser to the group, said Zedillo  agreed to contact Manuel Jimenez Guzman, PRI leader in Mexico  City, and that the two may discuss the group's problems with  Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and Agrarian Reform  Secretary Victor Cervera Pacheco.    According to Ocadiz's version, Zedillo "promised to defend  and protect Los Dinamos ecological reserve in Magdalena  Contreras." The meeting between the community leaders, the land  holders, and Zedillo was held at his private residence in Cruz  Verde 172, Lomas Quebradas neighborhood, southern Mexico City.    Sources within the PRI's National Executive Council  consulted  yesterday said Luis Donaldo Colosio's public pledges to reform  power and to strengthen the federal system as well as to bolster  the autonomy of the municipalities will be endorsed and  championed by Ernesto Zedillo, who will even "strengthen" these  pledges. "PRI members will fulfill all of the pledges assumed by  the man who was our candidate," the sources confirmed. One  source recalled that the issues of a new balance between the  Union's branches -- reform, particularly within the judicial  branch, and the strengthening of the federal system -- remain  firm.    At the same time, Pedro Ojeda Paullada, currently a federal  deputy, openly defended Zedillo's political experience; his role  as an activist; and his well-known "capability, skill,  knowledge, intelligence, and sensibility" to lead the country  should he win the election. Asked about the criticism  surrounding Colosio Murrieta's substitute, Ojeda Paullada  adamantly said: "He is certainly no newcomer. Quite the  contrary, he is knowledgeable about the party because he  participated in Carlos Salinas' campaign. At that time, he was  programming and budget secretary, and, until recently, he was  public education secretary. These secretariats gave him an  ample vision of the country and its current reality."    Referring to the PRI's internal situation he said: The fact  that Fernando Ortiz Arana did not vie for the post (the  presidency) shows there is no division because this would have  engendered another position, and, at this time, I only see one  -- one that supports Zedillo Ponce de Leon's candidacy.    Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Barberena, leader of the National  Front of Organizations and Citizens, said Zedillo's candidacy  restores confidence because it endorses the late Luis Donaldo  Colosio's ideology and goals. He said there is unity within the  PRI and its members are advancing united toward an election  victory in August.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Philips executive sets three-year profit target Correction (published 20th August 1993) appended to this article. THE HEAD of Philips' lossmaking consumer electronics business reaffirmed his prediction that the sector would reach break-even point this year, but said that the longer-term goal must be to achieve operating profit equivalent to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of net sales. Mr Henk Bodt, chairman of consumer electronics at the Dutch electronics group, said he 'would certainly feel very unhappy' if this target were not attained in three years. Consumer electronics, Philips' single largest business, posted an operating loss of Fl 150m (Dollars 77m) in the first half, down from Fl 177m a year earlier. The group as a whole saw net profit soar to Fl 1.32bn. This was due largely to a Fl 1.1bn extraordinary gain on the sale of its stake in a Japanese-based semiconductor joint venture. 'I am more confident than I was a year ago, and first-half figures gave some signs of hope,' Mr Bodt said. He stood by previous forecasts that Philips would go through the break-even point in consumer electronics in the course of this year, but declined to say whether the sector's full-year result would be positive or negative. Mr Bodt, speaking ahead of an important consumer electronics trade show in Berlin later this month, said the company was stepping up its marketing of the 'digital compact cassette'. This is a successor to the standard cassette and a product which will in part help determine Philips' future in the consumer field. Philips will use the show to promote a car stereo and a portable version of the DCC. Mr Bodt said he was 'not completely satisfied' with the initial marketing of DCC, which was launched in September last year, and added that he wished the portable and car products had been available earlier. DCC's rival, the MiniDisc produced by Sony, is so far available only in a 'Walkman' version. Mr Bodt declined to be drawn on reports that DCC sales were below expectations. However, he said he expected car and portable players to account for 60 per cent of total DCC sales a year from now. CORRECTION Philips of the Netherlands expects its consumer electronics business to break even during 1994, and not this year as wrongly stated yesterday.</p>

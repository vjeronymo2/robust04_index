			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Italian telecoms shake-up approved ITALY'S complex state-controlled telecommunications sector is set for unprecedented change after cabinet committee approval of a long-awaited restructuring. The move opens the way to creating a single company to run Italy's telecommunications services, where seven different state-controlled groups now operate. The cabinet committee, which called on the IRI state holding company to present rationalisation plans by June 30, also accepted that the government's stake in the future single telecoms group could fall below 51 per cent. Italy's telecoms sector comprises a patchwork of companies, all state-controlled, which are often in conflict with one another, and sometimes deeply divided internally. The sector is co-ordinated by Stet, the IRI-controlled listed holding company. Stet in turn controls Sip, the main telephone utility, which is also listed, as well as Italcable (international communications) and Telespazio (satellite links). Two other companies, Sirti (network engineering) and Italtel (equipment manufacturing), supply the group, while a third, Iritel, was formed last year after the long-awaited transfer of ASST from the post office to IRI. ASST provides domestic trunk connections and some shorter international links. The new Telecom Italia would probably include all the companies, except Italtel and Sirti. Although rationalisation plans have been aired for years, they have been postponed by political difficulties or squabbling among the companies. Managements have become increasingly politicised, with some companies having a carefully-balanced team of chairman, deputy and up to two managing directors appointed on the basis of party affil-iations. False starts have led to analysts' scepticism that rationalisation will now take place in earnest. However, the timetable envisages the creation of Telecom Italia by the end of 1995 at the latest. Rationalisation was 'an indispensable step', said the committee, which warned that the state would retain a 'significant' minority stake. Tariffs would be determined by a 'price cap', linking charges to productivity and quality. Although the destiny of Iritel, which is widely expected to be merged with Sip, remains unclear, the committee called for the integration process to be accelerated.</p>

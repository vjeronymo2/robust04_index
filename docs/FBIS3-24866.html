The third worker died from his wounds in hospital  Wednesday following the attack by opposition rebels Tuesday.    Reopening the railway was to have been one of the first  achievements of a fragile peace in conflict torn Congo following  a sudden ceasefire agreement reached Sunday between the party of  President Pascal Lissouba and the main opposition of Bernard  Kolelas.    The two parties agreed Wednesday to put back the reopening  of  the railway until February 8. The 400-kilometer (240-mile) line  between the capital and its main port and economic centre has  been cut for over 40 days by barricades and removed rails.  During that time, food has become scarce in the capital and  prices have soared. The delay should give time for the parties  to tell their supporters of the ceasefire, the parties added.    The attack on the carriage carrying state railway workers  was  a result of "a lack of awareness" of the ceasefire and "lack of  coordination" between the parties, said Michel Malonga, a member  of Lissouba's party.</p>

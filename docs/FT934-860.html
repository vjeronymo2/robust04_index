			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: CGM sees reduction in deficit next year Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM), the financially troubled French shipping group, hopes to reduce its losses next year in preparation for its eventual privatisation, said Mr Eric Giuily, chairman. He said he was moderately optimistic that CGM would be able to reduce its net loss to around FFr75.2m (Dollars 12.9m) in 1994 due to its restructuring programme. However, he warned that CGM, which is still in the throes of restructuring, would produce a net loss of FFr475.2m for 1993. On the trading front, CGM returned to the black in the second half of this year due to a modest improvement in operations. The company expects to post operating profits of FFr32m in the second half of 1993, against a loss of FFr6.1m for the first half. The group has been restructuring its activities and finances since Mr Giuily took over as chairman last year. It has cut its workforce (excluding dock workers) by 460 to 2,823 since early 1992 but its attempts to shed labour have been complicated by the dockers' dispute with the French government over the latter's attempt to modernise working practices. CGM has also been selling assets and generated FFr230m in 1993 through the sale of two ships and various investments. It plans further property and other asset sales. Despite the sales, CGM still requires an injection of capital from the government to stabilise its finances. Mr Giuily said it had asked for FFr500m and expected a response early next month. Mr Giuily said that CGM, named as a candidate for privatisation by the Balladur government, would not be ready for sale next year. In the meantime, he said, the group planned to strengthen its commercial activities by forging alliances with other shipping companies such as the Bollore group's sea transportation business.</p>

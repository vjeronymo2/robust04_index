			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Every time Rwanda seems on the verge of getting  its transitional government inaugurated under the terms of last  August's Arusha accord between President Habyarimana and the  Tutsi-led RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels it all goes  wrong. [passage omitted]    In the thick of it all is the UN military mission sent to  keep the peace between the rebels and government forces. On the  line to Kigali, Robin White asked the UN commander in Rwanda,  General Romeo Delaire, how alarmed he was by these developments.    [Begin recording] [Delaire] Well, we are concerned that the  violence has escalated over the last three days to four days as  we have seen more use of weapons, more use of grenades, and of  course, we have had the two assassinations that have created  enormous amount of reaction in the population, and fear.    [White] Is there anything that you can do to get things back  to some kind of normality?    [Delaire] Well, if you are asking me as the force commander  on the UN force, we are deploying with the gendarmerie and  police communale [municipal police] all the resources we can to  instill in the populations a sense that there is still order....    [White, interrupting] Exactly what are your men now doing?    [Delaire] My men are conducting patrols; they are conducting  checkpoints to see if there are arms being moved around. They  are monitoring all the military installations to ensure they  respond to the weapons secure area. They are providing escorts  for the RPF and for government officials; they are conducting  investigations on any cease-fire violations. They are  monitoring, through our civilian police, the judicial actions  and investigations by the gendarmerie, and providing technical  assistance.    [White] Now, are you going to hang on in there or might you  just give up and pull out?    [Delaire] My God, those are words that do not at all provide  for the mandate nor the attitude that the UN has toward these  peacekeeping missions. I think we are in a difficult political  impasse. I think the people are very concerned because there  are extremist elements that are conducting extremist activities.  I think that in those circumstances the UN must remain firm and  assist and maintain with the local authorities the (?mortigum)  of reference points so that the political process can still have  an opportunity of succeeding.    [White] Yes, but people are beginning to talk of an all-out  civil war. In those circumstances, what would you do?    [Delaire] Well, the first thing is that the minute there is  a  significant cease-fire violation by either side, then we do not  have a peacekeeping role anymore, because the only reason we are  here is that both sides wanted peace, both sides were prepared  to implement the peace process and also to respect the peace,  and so if there is a civil war, which has the violations of any  cease-fire agreement that has been established, then we are no  more in a peacekeeping role and my mandate does not exist here  any more.    [White] But you do not think you have reached that point  yet?    [Delaire] No, I do not. I think we have some significant  concerns. I think that the gendarmerie is being pushed to its  upper scale of capability. I think that we are also being  committed to put everything we can into this effort be it  militarily and politically. But no, I do not say that the road  has ended. I think that people are still talking, they still  want peace and until this thing collapses, which I still do not  see, we are going to hang in there and do our job.    [White] Now, presumably the RPF people in Kigali, the  capital, must be pretty scared at the moment. Can you guarantee  their safety?    [Delaire] First of all, they are very concerned, yes and  anybody would be who had been sitting here for 56 days waiting  for these decisions to be able to permit them to continue the  normalcy that was anticipated in the broad-based transitional  government. They get more concerned every day. They also get  concerned when people who are sympathetic to them are also being  singled out and that creates more pressure. I am more concerned  about them remaining disciplined as they are, remaining calm as  they are, and willing to abide by the peace agreements and the  cease-fire agreements that they signed with the government and  within the mandate of the UN mission.    [White] But can you guarantee their safety?    [Delaire] My job is not to guarantee safety. If I wanted to  guarantee safety I would need 40,000 troops here. And even at  that, to guarantee means that there would be no altercations.  My aim here and my mandate is quite clear: It is to provide  both parties with the assistance they need to establish an  atmosphere of security that they feel essential and confident to  move ahead with the peace agreement of Arusha.

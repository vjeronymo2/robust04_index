			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: Harold Pinter's No Man's Land The star of Harold Pinter's No Man's Land, which has moved from the Almeida in Islington to the Comedy Theatre in the West End, is not so much Pinter the writer as Pinter the actor. Pinter plays Hirst, the part originally taken by Ralph Richardson in the National Theatre production in 1975. In the second act he shows one of the most commanding stage presences I have seen, often by not speaking. Paul Eddington plays the other sexagenarian, Spooner, following John Gielgud in the original. The influence of TS Eliot is pervasive and presumably deliberate. This is Pinter as the author must wish it to be done. It is often vacuous, but it is sensational to watch.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Toyota also submitted data on a single vehicle which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated for 30,000 miles on MMT-containing fuel after which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygen sensor and catalyst were replaced with new components and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then driven on fuel not containing MMT for 30,000 miles. Toyota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also used a driving cycle with an average speed (41.7 mph) higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than that used by Ethyl for mileage accumulation and used fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with what Toyota believed was a relatively high trace level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead than that usually found in unleaded gasoline (0.0045 gpg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead) and oil with a relatively high phosphorus level (0.13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight percent). Toyota referred to this test procedure as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Toyota 9-Laps'' and presented evidence which it said suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the catalyst degradation seen by vehicles using the Toyota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9-Lap test was very similar to in-use catalysts tested by Toyota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, Toyota suggested, these ``adjustments'' made in creating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota 9-Lap make the testing of a vehicle more consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what would happen in actual in-use driving. Toyota's data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated an HC level after the first 30,000 miles of vehicle use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (on MMT fuel) about 0.1 gpm higher than the same vehicle after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle was driven for a second 30,000 mile interval with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new catalyst and oxygen sensor. Toyota also submitted data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that the efficiency at which the catalyst was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating for the MMT-exposed components was less than that for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the non-MMT exposed components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some time after EPA's January 8, 1992 denial decision, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Ethyl entered into discussions concerning a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement of the court case which Ethyl had filed. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context of these discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data it had developed since the denial decision. Ethyl tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six 1991 Escorts, using both the relatively high-speed driving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pattern similar to that utilized by Ford in its testing of 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Escorts (the Ford cycle) and, also, after changing emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system components (catalyst and oxygen sensor), the driving cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used by Ethyl in the original test program (EPA's durability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification cycle also known as the AMA). Half of the vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilized MMT-containing fuel and half were run on clear fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (fuel not containing MMT). Ethyl also performed some catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency tests on these vehicles utilizing a ``slave engine.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl also tested six 1988 Escorts which were used in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original test program driven on the AMA cycle. In the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, after replacing the catalyst and oxygen sensor, Ethyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued mileage accumulation, from 75,000 to 100,000 miles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing the Ford cycle. Likewise, Ethyl tested six 1988 Buicks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from its original fleet accumulating mileage (100,000 to 115,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> miles) using the Ford cycle but without replacing any components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl also accumulated mileage on seven pairs of 1992 vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (four Crown Victorias, Six Buick Regals and four Ford Mustangs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in test programs covering from 45,000 to 100,000 miles beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> break-in with and without MMT, using the Ford cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency ultimately concluded that Ethyl's program had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated driving cycle does not contribute significantly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMT-induced increases in hydrocarbon emissions. However, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's 1992 fleet or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the original 1988 Ethyl fleet). The Agency was concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these data could indicate that certain engine and emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system configurations were more vulnerable to an MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further assist the Agency in developing a test program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA held a workshop in October of 1992 and presented a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test program which could address in a timely manner specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing MMT have significant adverse effects on emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet future standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ultimately the court case was not settled; however, the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program presented by the Agency at the workshop was largely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted by Ethyl and is the basis of its most recent test program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the 1993 fleet. These vehicles (with the previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned 1992 vehicles) comprise Ethyl's most recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dataset. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On May 25, 1993, and on subsequent dates, Ethyl provided summaries of the 1992/93 test data to EPA staff and these have been placed in public docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl accumulated mileage on three 1992 model year vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (four Crown Victorias to 100,000 test miles, <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  six Buick Regals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 65,000 test miles and four Ford Mustangs to 45,000 test miles)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and six 1993 model year vehicles (six Toyota Camrys to 85,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test miles, six Oldsmobile Achievas to 65,000 test miles, six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dodge Shadows to 55,000 test miles, six TLEV Ford Escorts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 85,000 test miles, six Honda Civics to 80,000 test miles and four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49-state Ford Escorts to 30,000 test miles) with and without MMT. The driving cycles used for these vehicles were an intermediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driving cycle of 45 mph on average for the 1993 model year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, an average 55 mph driving cycle (i.e., the Ford Cycle)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all mileage accumulation on the 1992 Ford Mustangs and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the initial 45,000 miles of operation on the 1992 Crown Victorias  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Buick Regals and an average driving cycle of 45 mph was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilized for these two models thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As referred to here, ``test miles'' indicates mileage accumulated after break-in (break-in mileages vary among these models) and during which some vehicles were run on fuel containing MMT while control vehicles were run on clear fuel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

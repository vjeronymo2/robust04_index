			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: ICI forges ahead with a split personality - Paul Abrahams assesses the implications for the small investor after the UK's biggest demerger SO IMPERIAL Chemical Industry's board pushed the green button. On Wednesday afternoon, at an historic meeting, it decided to split the UK's biggest manufacturer into two parts. The following day, the group's executives announced the decision. They also revealed an horrendous Pounds 384m pre-tax loss on Pounds 12bn of turnover, and a Pounds 949m provision for restructuring. The demerger plan, to be confirmed at an extraordinary general meeting in May, is to create a fully-independent quoted company called Zeneca. This will comprise ICI's drugs division, its agrochemicals and seeds operations, and most of its speciality chemicals businesses. Zeneca's demerger will be followed by a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue to reduce ICI's debts. Investors in ICI will be given one Zeneca share for every existing ICI share they own. They will retain their existing holding unchanged, though they will then be given the option of buying additional shares in the rights issue. On the day of the announcement, ICI's shares rose 70 1/2 p to Pounds 11.52 1/2 . Yesterday they rose another 55p. That does not mean the market necessarily thinks that the demerger is a good idea. Institutions have been off-loading the stock for weeks, fearing an immediate Pounds 1bn rights issue on Thursday. The ICI board has decided to maintain the dividend at 55p, in spite of bleak trading prospects, so institutions have been picking up stock in preparation for the dividend on March 15. What happens to the share price once the stock goes ex-dividend should prove interesting. Some private investors may want to forsake the dividend, sell the stock, benefit from the sharp rise in the share price and avoid the dangers and complications of the demerger and rights issue. But what of the prospects for those investors who decide to stick with the separated groups? Will the split be as successful as those of BAT or Courtaulds? ICI, according to Alasdair Nisbet, of UBS, faces a black hole - that of the continental economy, which is rapidly decelerating. That will have a knock-on effect on the chemicals groups. Cefic, the European chemicals association, estimates that growth in west European chemical demand will slow in all product sectors this year apart from fertilisers. In 1991, about 25 per cent of new-ICI's turnover was on the continent, with a further 25 per cent in the UK. Only 19 per cent was in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region and 28 per cent in the US, where the economy appears to be recovering slowly. Ronnie Hampel, new-ICI's chief executive, said the company would get no help from the world economy over the next 12 months. Nevertheless, a happy combination of cost cutting and currency benefits could enable ICI to leap gracefully over the black hole. Hampel plans a rigorous cost-cutting campaign. The company is proposing yet another restructuring and a further round of job losses - 7,000 staff will leave the group over the next three years. Charles Lambert of broker Smith New Court believes that the job losses alone could eventually save about Pounds 210m a year. In addition, this year's figures will be helped by the devaluation of sterling on what Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, calls 'sunny Wednesday'. On a rule of thumb, every cent the US dollar falls adds between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m to ICI's pre-tax results. Lambert estimates that currency benefits - at about Pounds 150m - will form the largest element in ICI's earnings improvement this year. The danger is that ICI might leap - and then tumble into the hole. If it does, the group's promise to maintain the dividend at 27 1/2 p during 1993 looks hard to keep. Much of the share price rise at the end of this week was based on the promise to maintain the dividend. If ICI looks as if it will break that promise its shares could be in trouble. An economic recovery has already been discounted into ICI's share price, although recovery is far from certain. Nisbet at UBS says that if the market has underestimated the benefits of currency and the recovery, then investors might prefer to pick up second tier chemicals stocks rather than buying more ICI. The UK, following the devaluation, is the best place in Europe to manufacture chemicals at the moment, according to Nisbet. On the other hand, one final reason for buying ICI might be to pick it up as a takeover play. US broking houses in London have been making noises about a hostile takeover aimed at breaking up the business. However, new-ICI will have Pounds 600m of debt after the demerger. Some analysts believe the board left it there as a poisoned pill to prevent such a takeover. Zeneca poses a problem for investors. Drugs stocks are out of favour at the moment. Institutions have piled out of defensive stocks such as pharmaceuticals and invested in cyclical companies instead. Even if the recovery is some way off, institutions are unlikely to move back into drugs stocks for fear of missing out on the recovery when - and if - it comes. An added disincentive for pharmaceuticals stocks is pricing pressure, particularly in the US. President Clinton will not reveal his health care reforms - which could affect the drugs groups - until May, almost the same time as Zeneca's rights issue. As for Zeneca, the company is not even a pure drugs stock, given that more than 60 per cent of its sales concern agrochemicals and specialities. It will have to be valued at a discount to groups such as Glaxo and Wellcome. Should investors take up their rights? The answer depends on Zeneca's price and the discount being offered by the company and underwriters. Zeneca's operating profits actually dropped from Pounds 682m in 1991 to Pounds 587m last year. Most of the decline was due to the expiry of the US patents for Tenormin, Zeneca's top drug and once the world's fifth best-selling medicine, generating sales of nearly Dollars 1.2bn a year. American sales fell up to 50 per cent last year. David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, believes US sales of Tenormin will stabilise soon at about 25 of its peak. Meanwhile, revenues from newer products are increasing rapidly. Sales of Zestril, a heart drug, improved 30 per cent, while Diprivan, an anaesthetic, and Zoladex, a cancer treatment, both rose by 50 per cent. There may also be some recovery potential from the specialities businesses, especially dyes, which represent about 30 per cent of the division's Pounds 936m turnover. These have been suffering from the recession in the textiles industry. Zeneca's 27 1/2 p dividend offers a yield of about 5 per cent - far higher than traditional drugs stocks. Given that its earnings can only move up, if the company is offered at the right price, Zeneca could prove an unfashionable, but valuable, stock to acquire.</p>

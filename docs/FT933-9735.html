			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: PAYE poser looms or else risk the wrath of your waiter by not leaving him a tip. This complicated state of affairs has arisen because of a recent decision of the House of Lords which appears to have considerably widened the scope of the Pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. PAYE is the linchpin of the Inland Revenue's tax collection system. It obliges every employer to act as the taxman's agent in deducting the appropriate amount of tax from all salary payments. The tax then has to be handed over to the Revenue once a month. PAYE applies only to cash payments and not to perks such as company cars. However, the value of perks may be taken into account by the Revenue when it determines PAYE deduction codes. The House of Lords case arose out of an attempt by the Inland Revenue to extract tax from one Charles Herd. In 1980 Herd was appointed an executive director of an engineering company and as part of his signing-on-package was given the chance to buy 10,000 shares in his employer company for the sum of Pounds 1. In 1983 his employer's parent company bought the shares back for Pounds 380,000. There was no dispute that Herd's profit of Pounds 379,999 was subject to income tax under the rules applying to share incentive schemes. However, Herd argued that since this was an income tax liability, it should have been paid under PAYE. If that was right, then the taxman would have to chase the parent company for its money and Herd would get away scot-free. Although the Revenue generally tries to spread the PAYE net as widely as possible, in this case it naturally took the opposite tack. It argued that PAYE could not apply to a payment made by somebody other than the employer - in this case the parent company. However, the law lords did not accept this. Though their decision was in the taxman's favour, it was on the basis that PAYE could not apply to a payment which was only partially taxable. Herd had received Pounds 380,000 but only Pounds 379,999 was taxable because the final Pounds 1 was the repayment of the price he had originally paid. That this is an arbitrary distinction is illustrated by the facts. It seems that if Herd had received the shares for nothing instead of paying a nominal pound, he would have won his case. The ramifications of this decision are likely to be particularly arbitrary in the fairly common situation where a company making a takeover buys out share options held by executives of the target company. Until now, the Revenue has taken the view that these payments are not subject to PAYE because the bidder lacks the information it would need in order to make the correct deductions. Now it seems it will depend on whether the optionholders have paid anything for their options. Many options are granted for nil consideration; many others for a nominal Pounds 1. Which option is chosen usually depends on the whim of the adviser who drew up the option scheme. And until now, nobody thought it made any difference. Apart from the nuisance for the company which has to make the deduction, the application of PAYE will also mean a cashflow disadvantage for the recipient. If he receives the payment gross, he will have the use of all the money until the Revenue gets round to issuing an assessment against him - which could be up to 12 months later. How wide are the ramifications of the Herd decision? Will the Revenue now expect PAYE to be deducted from all fully taxable payments made to an employee, irrespective of the identity of the person making the payment? The example of a tip given to a waiter highlights the absurdities of such an approach. The practical difficulties would be immense, if not insuperable. Apart from not knowing how much tax to deduct, the payer may not even know whether the recipient is employed or self-employed. The Revenue is studying the Herd judgment and will decide whether to issue a guidance note. David Cohen is a partner in the City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co.</p>

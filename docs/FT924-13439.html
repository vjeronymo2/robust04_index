			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Major seeks summit talks on currencies MR John Major, the British prime minister, has confirmed in a letter to his European Community partners that they should discuss recent monetary developments, but without drawing any detailed conclusions for the moment. To prevent any further turbulence in the markets, Mr Major's original idea that the Birmingham summit on Friday should discuss reform of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), has been dropped. 'This will not be a detailed operational discussion, but I hope we can come to some procedural conclusions,' the prime minister said in his letter. British officials said in London that more detailed discussions on European monetary problems, including possibly proposals for the ERM's reform, would be held later by EC finance ministers. The finance ministers would not, however, participate in the Birmingham summit. Sir Nigel Wicks, a British Treasury official, has this week been visiting the main EC capitals to prepare the monetary discussions. Mr Major, who will be in the chair at the meeting, made clear in his letter that he had also been forced to drop another of his proposals as the result of opposition from some of his partners, that of holding a one-hour opening session of the meeting in public. Though favouring greater transparency of the Community's decision-making process, the opponents of open sessions argue that they would merely result in formal speech-making and give no insight into the detailed negotiating process that usually goes on in ministerial councils. However, ways of making the Community more open, together with subsidiarity  -the principle that action should be taken at Community level only if it cannot be taken more effectively by member states - and the closer involvement of EC citizens in the Community's affairs, remain at the top of the summit's agenda. It is not yet certain whether Mr Major's wish to see the summit issue a declaration on subsidiarity will be fulfilled. But even in the absence of such a declaration, heads of government intend to lay down clear guidelines on how ministers should proceed in defining and giving practical effect to this principle. A formal document will then be prepared in time for the Edinburgh summit in December. The British presidency is also anxious that the summit should have a thorough discussion of the Yugoslav problem. British officials have pointed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' warning that 2.8m people are directly affected by the crisis. Insufficient relief supplies were getting through to Bosnia and there was a serious danger of tens of thousands of people dying this winter. It was up to the European Council (heads of government) to show that the Community and its member states would take the necessary action to respond to humanitarian needs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fabbri on the `Russian Problem,' </F> Italian Adherence"]    [Text] Rome, 25 Feb (ANSA) -- For Italian Defense Minister  Fabio Fabbri, "the West once again faces the Russian problem"  created by the void left after the dissolution of the Warsaw  Pact.    "Either the West fills that void, or Russia will return to a  position of dominance," said Fabbri, speaking at the sidelines  of a ceremony to inaugurate the 84th course of the NATO Defense  College at which he participated today along with President of  the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.    "The active role of NATO thus remains very important," the  minister said, adding he concurred with the view of German  Military Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann, who expressed with  "crystal clarity" said Fabbri, what was usually said only  cautiously in the political-diplomatic sphere: "The unpleasant  truth that the West now has to face the Russian problem."    While that country was "politically and economically weak,  it  remains strong in conventional and atomic weapons," he added.  "Perhaps as a result of this weakness," Russia now wants "a new  Yalta conference and the right to a free hand over what it  considers its untouchable sphere of influence," he said.    In other comments, Fabbri called Communist Refoundation's  position on NATO "out of tune and frankly surprising." That  left-wing party's secretary Fausto Bertinotti has declared that  NATO was out of date and no longer needed.    "Never before as in this moment has the Atlantic alliance  been so timely," said Fabbri "precisely because the cold war is  over and it is necessary to seek a new equilibrium." NATO is  "essential for Western security and for international order," he  said.    (In other related news, it was announced that the secretary  of Italy's Left Democrats would visit NATO headquarters in  Brussels Monday [28 February], where he would meet Secretary  General Manfred Woerner just before noon before attending a  lunch with top members of the Alliance's military and political  staff.    Occhetto's visit will be the first by a Left Democrat or  former Italian Communist to the Allied command.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith confounds sceptics with sale of Newmont shares MANY analysts were sceptical when Sir James Goldsmith, the international financier, said three years ago that he would find a way to sell most of his 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining, North America's biggest gold producer, without damaging the share price. But he appears to have achieved that objective. The 9.65m Newmont shares he and his colleague Lord Rothschild are to sell via public offering are to be priced at Dollars 54.75 each. Analysts suggest the price is about right given the state of the gold market. Newmont shares were priced at just over Dollars 52 last week when the financiers announced their intention to make a secondary offering - representing 12.5 per cent of Newmont. Sir James and Lord Rothschild paid Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 39 a share, for their holdings in October 1990. After the offering, Sir James's stake will have been reduced to 4.9 per cent. Lord Rothschild's holding will be 1.5 per cent. They have taken advantage of the fire they helped ignite in the market in April by selling, at Dollars 39.50 a share, 10 per cent of Newmont to US funds managed by Mr George Soros. A further 9.5 per cent was sold to a banking consortium in May. These were sold on at Dollars 45.50 each. The latest sale, by public offering scheduled for delivery on July 14, will raise Dollars 528m. 'This is a fairly full price, but not an outrageous price,' said Mr John Phizackerley, analyst at Lehman Brothers. 'Sir James has kept his word that he would exit Newmont without damaging the price for everybody else. Whether Mr Soros exits so gracefully is another matter.'</p>

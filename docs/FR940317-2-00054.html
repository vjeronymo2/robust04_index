Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit BOMC to vary the consideration on mortgage loans for customers who have obtained or will obtain a traditional banking product from any of Banc One's subsidiary banks. BOMC originates and refinances mortgage loans, primarily for sale into the secondary market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1994, Banc One intends to reorganize BOMC as an operating subsidiary of Bank One, Indianapolis, N.A., Indianapolis, Indiana. In this connection, Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit its banks and BOMC to continue to offer customers the price reductions described above after the reorganization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank from engaging in these same activities on condition that the customer obtain any additional credit or services from any affiliate. The Board may grant an exception that is not contrary to the purposes of this provision. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 12 U.S.C. 1972(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banc One contends that its proposal is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because the proposal is not anticompetitive. Banc One argues that the market for mortgage loans and for traditional banking products is highly competitive, and that BOMC does not have sufficient market share on a local, nationwide, or other basis to adversely affect competition. Banc One also argues that the proposal will promote competition and will not limit the availability of products to consumers because the traditional banking products offered by Banc One's subsidiary banks and mortgage loans from BOMC will be separately available to customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Banc One's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than April 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

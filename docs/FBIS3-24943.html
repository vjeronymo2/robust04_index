			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says those who  had hoped to see a new National Party [NP] grappling with the  realities of the country will have been bitterly disappointed by  the party's election manifesto. The manifesto was announced  earlier at the NP federal congress at Kempton Park.    In a statement in Johannesburg the ANC says that instead of  presenting concrete proposals, NP leaders have attempted to  undermine the ANC. It said the NP remained wedded to policies  that would leave 75 percent of the population living in poverty  and squalor.</p>

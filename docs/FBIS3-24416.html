			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Samoylenko: "Everyone Is Happy With </F> the Elections in Kazakhstan. Except for Certain Skeptics From  the CSCE?"]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty]--The elections for the new  parliament in Kazakhstan were not the most routine news of  recent days. On 8 March such press agencies as ASSOCIATED PRESS,  REUTERS, and ITAR-TASS greatly distressed women of the world  community with the news that "the elections in Kazakhstan did  not correspond to international standards of democracy."    Men were also distressed. Particularly on the Central  Election Commission of Kazakhstan. They were so upset that they  lost the power of speech for the three women's days, and this  whole time "enemy radio voices" (the enemies are all those who  do not flatter!) tarred unimpeded the facade of young Kazakhstan  democracy.    It is impossible to take what happened seriously. It was  foolish to expect in the parliamentary births the daughter of  Democracy, not having conceived her in good time (surely the  nomenklatura fathers of Kazakhstan understand this?!), and it  was just as foolish (on the part of the CSCE observers)  heart-rendingly wailing to the world that in Kazakhstan (ah, in  Kazakhstan itself!!!), apparently, there is a tight situation  when it comes to freedom and fairness.    I personally am amazed by something else--the fantastic  haste  with which Jan Van Hauvelingen's delegation at the news  conference on 8 March accused Kazakhstan of "the aims of free  and fair elections not being met."    The trouble with these Dutch and Americans and the  miscellaneous world community is that, despite the imagination  of the ladies and gentlemen, they are not given to understand  the entire "distinctiveness," "youthfulness," and  "individuality" of our democracy. Whence it transpires that what  for them is nomenklatura willfulness is for us "the  indisputable"--in N. Nazarbayev's expression--"success of young  Kazakhstan democracy." What for them is staggering confusion is  for us "difficult weather conditions." Earlier spring did not  indulge the farmers, now (who could have thought it!) the  climate is hampering democratic transformations also.    In other words, the misfortunes of some are the blessings of  others. The CSCE observers were extremely upset by the fact that  Kazakhstan had not in its organization of the elections abided  all that much by the Paris Charter. And a polling station of an  Alma-Ata district could not even remember this charter when,  prior to the counting of the vote, "extra" ballot boxes full of  ballots miraculously appeared. In the opinion of the CSCE  experts, the Kazakhstan elections were not in the best harmony  with the Helsinki Final Act either. And at other polling  stations the ballots were printed either only in Kazakh or only  in Russian.    But if there is a desire to be at one with the world  community (which was why observers were summoned to the  elections), there had to be some response to the critical  passages of the CSCE broadcast to the world. And a response was  forthcoming. The Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan  called its own news conference and... tore to shreds the  conclusion of the observers of the CSCE, and this was done with  such assured self-satisfaction, what is more, as though  Kazakhstan had accumulated a wealth of experience of life in the  channel of international charters and acts.    This was an odd news conference. The Central Election  Commission pressed invitations on the ambassadors of Iran and  Turkey (why not Britain and the United States?), and for some  reason or other the presidium contained representatives of the  General Procuracy and the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan, the  ministers of the press and foreign affairs, and the deputy  chairman of the Council of Ministers in charge of the press! Why  had I, a journalist, to work in the presence of ambassadors of  foreign states and, simultaneously, people from the General  Procuracy?! Dissatisfaction with the elections was expressed by  "individual" representatives of the CSCE. Why were the opinions  of the ambassadors of France and Romania distributed in the  cloakroom of the news conference? What, did they not agree with  the CSCE in its evaluation of the elections in Kazakhstan?    In short, the Kazakhstan Central Election Commission smeared  findings of the group of observers of the CSCE on the wall,  going so far as to say that they did not have the right to stage  their news conference and "should have notified us."    What can we say.... The ways of the former party  functionaries of assessing themselves as the inspiration behind  and organizers of all our victories remain exactly what they  used to be. They never allowed and do not now allow anyone, the  CSCE included, to cast doubt on their "successes." Yesterday  they were foaming at the mouth, defending the sanctity of the  CPSU and pushing into parliament milkers, plasterers, and  slaughtermen. Today these same people are proud that in the  "new" parliament there are one worker and three Jews--and all  have higher education.    The most distressing thing is that Kazakhstan's first  contact  with the CSCE ended, through the fault of local functionaries,  in a row. A shame. It is time to break ourselves of the habit of  pouting and bawling out dissenters. It is time to learn to  listen closely to people, from a long way off included, and to  thank them for their assistance, even if these people have in  some respects artlessly erred.</p>

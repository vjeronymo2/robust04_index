			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / BAe wins Pounds 570m missile contract BRITISH AEROSPACE has won an order worth Pounds 570m to supply a new air combat missile for the RAF after a fierce international contest. The decision announced in the Commons yesterday by Mr Tom King, defence secretary, provides a crucial lease of life to BAe's Dynamics division. It is, however, unlikely to quell speculation about a reorganisation in the UK guided weapons business. Under the order, BAe will complete development of its Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (Asraam) with Hughes Aircraft of the US, and provide initial supplies for the RAF. Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, said the contract 'will provide a firm foundation for Dynamics for the foreseeable future'. The group has estimated its potential export market for the close-combat missile, including the US, at more than Pounds 5bn. The decision comes after successive delays and setbacks to the project, launched 12 years ago as the European element in a joint US-European scheme for arming new fighter aircraft. Failure to win the contract would have resulted in up to 1,000 further redundancies at BAe's Dynamics division and deprived it of its only immediate prospect for a newly developed missile. Competitors for the deal were GEC-Marconi in collaboration with Matra, manufacturers of the rival French Mica missile, and BGT of Germany, which proposed an upgraded version of the US-designed Sidewinder. The decision is a setback for GEC-Marconi, which recently took the first step towards becoming a producer of complete missile systems by concluding a Pounds 38m takeover of Ferranti International's guided weapons business. GEC-Marconi, which has acted until now as supplier of guidance systems for BAe missiles, said: 'We will carry on regardless.' It had lost a significant business opportunity but still had other prospects and expected to continue its relationship with Matra. The contract announcement followed widespread speculation about a merger between BAe and GEC-Marconi in the missile sector. While the Asraam order may make it less imperative for BAe to sell a stake in its Dynamics division, analysts see it as strengthening the company's hand in trying to obtain good terms for a joint venture deal. A plan to merge the division with the guidance systems activities of Thomson-CSF of France fell through a year ago. Yesterday's contract is BAe's biggest for guided weapons for about five years. BAe is believed to have trimmed its price for Asraam substantially since the Ministry of Defence opened the deal to competition 18 months ago. RAF Harrier jump-jets and the planned European Fighter Aircraft will be equipped with the missile. Most of the work will be carried out at BAe's plants in Stevenage, Herts, and Lostock, Lancs, and at Hughes' facility in Glenrothes, Fife. The main sub-contractors include Thorn EMI, Lucas Aerospace and MBB of Germany.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Tailor stitched up by the recession: John Thornhill finds price-cutting in an unexpected area of retailing EYEBROWS may rise today along Savile Row, home of the gentleman's wardrobe, at the news that one of Britain's most famous tailors has been obliged to make the unkindest cut of all - a cut in prices. Bernard Weatherill, the sporting tailor which supplies hunting clothes to the Queen, has reduced prices by up to 30 per cent for suits, coats and shooting jackets in a move intended to stimulate sales. A three-piece gentleman's suit can now be had for Pounds 1,150 plus value added tax, while hunt coats have been reduced to Pounds 725 - representing a saving of Pounds 275. Mr Hugh Holland, managing director, said the move had been prompted by the recession, in which sales had fallen by more than 60 per cent. Tough trading conditions had been worsened by uncertainty about the future of hunting, he added. 'We have built a client base of English country gentlemen, but they will not order their hunt coats and affiliated items if they feel the sport is going to be banned,' he explained. 'Some of our customers feel that is inevitable if the Labour party wins the election. Those that can vote will certainly vote Conservative.' The organisation was formerly the family company of Mr Bernard Weatherill, the retiring speaker of the Commons. In the past, it has discreetly cut prices for those brazen enough to ask for reductions. 'But we thought it was wrong to offer discounts to the one-off punter when we were not offering them to our most valued long-standing customers,' Mr Holland said. 'I therefore sent a letter to our 4,500 customers announcing these price cuts.' However, all is not desperation on Savile Row. Bernard Weatherill's sister company Kilgour, French &amp; Stanbury, which relies heavily on overseas customers, has continued to enjoy strong sales. 'As far as the Americans are concerned, the customers we deal with are recession-proof,' Mr Holland said. 'They are still ordering half a dozen suits at a time. Thankfully that type of business is not diminishing.'</p>

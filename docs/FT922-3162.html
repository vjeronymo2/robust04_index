			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Critics doubt Japanese motives - Tokyo's readiness to help clean up the Third World, says David Lascelles, is partly self-interest A RUMOUR raced through the hall of delegates at the summit this week: Japan had pledged Dollars 100bn (Pounds 55bn) in environmental aid to the Third World. It was quickly denied by the Japanese office in Rio. But the fact that people were prepared to believe in such a staggering sum was no surprise, for Japan has taken a high profile there, and everyone expects it to back this with an offer of hard cash. Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, who is in Rio, says Japan intends to act as 'a bridge' between countries to help make a success of the conference. Tokyo's message has caused a stir because Japan seldom seeks a lead role in global matters. Yet here is clearly an issue for which it is eminently suited. It has made an impressive job of cleaning up its own industrial mess, and it now has the money and technology to transfer that experience to poorer countries. Even so, summit participants are treating Japan's initiatives with caution because its motives are not clear. It is easy to find reasons why Japan sees its interests threatened by growing concern about the environment. As the world's largest importer of resources, it is vulnerable to measures taken by other countries to protect their natural wealth. Also, though Japan has instituted tough internal controls to clean up its own land, air and water, it has yet to back its professed concern for the environment with measures to curb its appetite for imported raw materials. Tropical timber and whales are the issues that stir most controversy. Organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth operate in Japan, but on a tiny scale by western standards, and their campaigns have drawn little public response. Japan's clean-up has come through administrative measures rather than pressure which adds to foreign suspicions that the real driving force behind Japan's environmental diplomacy is its national, and particularly its big business, interests. Not that there is a shortage of high-minded motives. Dr Shuzo Nishioka, director of the Centre for Global Environmental Research in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo, says: 'People here get nervous when they hear others say that Japan has succeeded economically, but that it is not contributing to the world. Countries which get to the peak of their era give the world something: France gave notions of freedom, the US gave the mass-production system. The global environment is a good issue for us to tackle.' The real question is whether Japan is willing to make a sacrifice, in particular to reduce the ravages its industry makes on the raw materials of other countries. As Mr Yu Tanaka of Kiki, an environmental group, points out, Japan's imports weigh seven times as much as its exports. The difference is either consumed domestically or goes to waste. Like many critics, he maintains that Japan has cleaned up its industries only by relocating the worst of them abroad. This accusation is not always convincing. Last year, however, a bill that would have extended domestic environmental regulations to the overseas plants of Japanese companies was dropped by parliament, under pressure from industry. Instead, Keidanren, industry's powerful trade group, has tried to head off environmental regulation by taking a leading role in setting standards itself. In 1989, Japan took its first big step towards tackling the environmental problems of other countries by allocating a specific sum for them in its Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme. This was Y300bn (Pounds 1.29bn) over three years. In fact, the money was spent in only two years, and Japan is expected to announce the next stage of the programme in Rio. But even this initiative has attracted controversy. Green groups say much of the money is being spent to sustain Japan's sources of raw materials in other countries by, for example, building access roads, or by teaching countries to grow even more trees for Japanese loggers to cut down. This accusation is denied by the Japan International Co-operation Agency, which administers much of the ODA programme. Japan's interest in greenery is also obviously linked to promoting exports of anti-pollution technology. However, poorer countries hope Japan will give it away rather than sell it, posing a further test of Japan's seriousness about the environment. What critics are looking for in Rio is a commitment by Japan to reduce its call on world resources. Rather than spend aid money on Malaysian forest management, it should be trying to reduce timber imports. If it really wants to help other countries it should raise its ODA budget from the present level of 0.31 per cent of GNP. On the other hand, Japan has made enough progress in cleaning up its own environment and boosting industrial efficiency to allow it to ask other industrial countries to match it before they criticise.</p>

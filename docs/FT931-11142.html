			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The DAF Crisis: Arthur Andersen partners appointed as receivers MR JOHN Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, partners in Arthur Andersen, the sixth-largest accountancy firm, were yesterday appointed as receivers to Leyland-Daf's principal UK subsidiaries. They have three months under UK insolvency law to hold a creditors' meeting. During that time they may be able to hold a number of the trading companies together and sell them as operating businesses. The receivership is not affected by the jurisdiction of the courts in the Netherlands, where the Leyland-Daf holding company is based, or by those in Belgium. The management is applying for protection from creditors in both countries. In practice, the receivers are likely to work closely with their counterparts in these countries. The appointment of the British receivers prevents any creditor being able to launch separate legal proceedings to seize the company's assets and recover outstanding debts. They have assigned a number of other accountants and insolvency specialists from the firm to take control of the management of three UK operating companies on six sites. Unless they are granted an extension, the receivers will be expected to provide a statement on the financial state of affairs at a creditors' meeting by early May. A creditors' committee would normally be elected at that time, and any future negotiations - including monitoring the professional fees charged - would be channelled through this committee. In the meantime, they can expect a series of potential buyers for the Daf businesses to come forward.</p>

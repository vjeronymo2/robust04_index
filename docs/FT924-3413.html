			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Barclays set to complete refinancing at Imry BARCLAYS BANK is set to complete the refinancing of Imry, the troubled property company that owes it Pounds 440m, within the next two weeks. The financial restructuring, which will keep Imry out of receivership, is likely to involve a provision against bad debts of about Pounds 240m. It will also severe the company's ties with its chairman, Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, a Canadian-based businessman who also controls Castor Holdings, a property finance group that went into receivership this summer with estimated losses of over CDollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). Mr Andrew Buxton, chief executive of Barclays, said yesterday that some disclosure of the bank's provision against loan loss in Imry would be made as part of the company's restructuring announcement 'within 14 days'. Mr Buxton said he did not know how explicit the disclosure would be, and whether it would include details of the size of Barclays' provision. He said the bank normally did not give figures for specific provisions against company loans. Barclays' involvement with Imry goes back to 1989, when Imry Merchant Developers was the target of a highly-leveraged Pounds 314m agreed bid, which was backed by a Pounds 215m loan from Barclays. The decline in the property market forced Barclays to refinance the company in June 1991. Barclays doubled its exposure by providing a new Pounds 200m loan. Mr Stolzenberg bought out the other investors and took over as chairman. Barclays has already made provisions of some Pounds 140m on the Imry loan, but it is likely to make a provision of about Pounds 100m in its results for the second half of 1992.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: Fast-track train runs off the rails - What began as a petition has turned into a key political battle THE TWO widely divergent visions of free trade with Mexico expressed in the italic paragraphs accompanying this article capture the polarities of the mounting debate over President George Bush's request for a two-year extension of his 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority. What was a pro forma petition by a president to a Congress has turned into a key political battle. Congress has until June 1 to make up its mind whether to promise - as it does when it grants fast-track authority - not to amend any trade pact negotiated by the President. The same authority is needed for continued talks under the stalled Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now that is being jeopardised by President Bush's more controversial plans for free trade with America's southern neighbour. Opposed to the Nafta are the labour unions, textile and apparel manufacturers, farmers, consumer and liberal church groups. In support are hundreds of business leaders who see benefits in access to cheaper labour and a more lucrative market for US products. Both sides have mobilised for the battle. President Bush, with his entire trade policy at stake, has reverted to street-fighter mode reminiscent of his presidential campaign. His opponents are dismissed as heavily-financed 'fear-mongers' who practise 'defeatism'. His lieutenants in the cabinet are being deployed en masse to congressional hearings to reiterate the Administration line. The Administration is arguing that the Nafta is a building block, not only to a hemispheric-wide free-trade region, but to the President's vision of a 'New World Order'. Mr Robert Zoellick, the State Department counsellor, says it sends a signal of encouragement to new Latin American leaders committed to democracy and market economics. Most of those opposed to the fast-track facility insist they are not so much against increased trade with Mexico, even free trade eventually, as they are the fast-track procedure itself. They want to slow the process, bringing the continent's three economies more in line as well as their regulatory and political systems. Mr Mark Anderson, the AFL-CIO representative spearheading labour's fight against the fast-track, contends that the negotiations are not so much about jobs as investment in Mexico, when investment is vitally needed in the US. If the Administration wants to help Mexico, he says, it should be providing more debt relief and foreign assistance. Dr Adolpho Aguilar, a visiting professor from Mexico at the American University in Washington, is another opponent of the Nafta. He has warned congressmen against the promise by Mexican leaders of new environmental and job safety laws. 'Mexico is not a country where there is rule of law,' he says. 'Every Mexican citizen knows how to get things done in spite of laws. The Congress and the judicial system are controlled by a king who serves for six years and chooses his own successor.' Thus far, there is little sign of a consensus emerging and observers say a congressional vote would be too close to call at this stage. Compromise plans have found their way into the debate through Senator Donald Riegle and Congressman Sander Levin, both from Michigan, where the motor companies want the fast-track and unions oppose it. They propose to grant the fast-track for the Uruguay Round but allow a limited number of amendments to the Nafta. These would ensure congressional control over issues of most concern: environment, rules of origin, health and safety standards and dispute-settlement mechanisms - issues opponents do not believe they can trust the Administration to address. The Nafta would cause a mass exodus of low-skilled US manufacturing jobs and a deluge of exports (including food tainted by polluted waters and unregulated pesticides) to the US produced by exploited Mexican workers. Real wages in both countries would decline. Mexican peasants, unable to compete with mechanised American farms, would be thrown off their lands. Meanwhile, the US would have given approval to one-party rule in Mexico The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) would provide untold economic benefits, bringing trade and wealth to the entire continent. It would raise Mexican living standards and 'lock in' recent Mexican free market reforms. The only injury would be to a few US sectors, which would have several years to 'adjust' and probably should not survive in any case because superior American workers should be doing only high-skill jobs</p>

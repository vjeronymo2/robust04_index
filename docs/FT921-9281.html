			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / W Australia to sell off financial institutions DR Carmen Lawrence, the premier of Western Australia, plans to privatise the state's two largest financial institutions as part of an economic package announced yesterday. Dr Lawrence said the government's Insurance Office would be sold outright and that 40 to 49 per cent of the R&amp;I Bank would be sold off. However, she said, the economic environment precluded any immediate sales and the government would wait until 'the time was right'. She did not specify whether the two institutions, both of which were involved in lending to many failed entrepreneurs, would be floated or offered for trade sale.</p>

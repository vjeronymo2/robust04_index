			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: KEEPING NEW MOMS FIT  </P> <P> In this day and age of stress awareness and physical fitness, employers are  spending big bucks to help workers alleviate stress in the workplace.  </P> <P> But what if you are a new mom and your work is home, sweet, home?  </P> <P> Beginning July 19, Port Hueneme's Recreation Department will offer the first of  four weekly classes for mothers and children designed to address women's  physical and emotional needs as well as their practical needs. The 1 1/2-hour  class will meet Thursdays at 11 a.m. at the Port Hueneme Cultural Center.  </P> <P> After a brisk walk along the beach or through the park, the group will return  to the center for an informal rap session. Among the topics will be coping with  daily stress, how to set up a baby-sitting exchange and places to go for  discount children's clothing.  </P> <P> "Each week, there will be a different speaker, such as a child psychologist or  pediatrician, to share information. But the main focus of the group will be on  fitness," said Brady Cherry, director of recreation and community services in  Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> "Many mothers are very concerned about getting back into shape after childbirth  and also about proper nutrition. The idea was to get some kind of a program  going that would get them on the right track."  </P> <P> Cost for the four-week session is $16 and can be paid at the first class.  Children are welcome to attend. For information, call 986-6584 or 986-6592.  </P></p>

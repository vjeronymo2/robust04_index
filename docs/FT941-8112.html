			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Revamp for United Westburne United Westburne, the North American plumbing, heating and electrical equipment wholesaler, plans a CDollars 38m (USDollars 28m) restructuring to restore profitability, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Westburne, controlled by France's Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, cut back in 1991-92 because of the broad construction slowdown. It cut staff by 1,000 and sold a US division. But recovery has been slow, mainly because of the construction slump in eastern Canada. Mr Robert Chevrier, recently appointed chief executive, said 350 jobs would go and the Burlington warehouse near Toronto closed. A CDollars 18.5m special charge will be taken to cover the expenses. Other warehouses may be closed and some transport services contracted out. He said Westburne would report operating net profit of CDollars 4.5m for 1993 but a final loss of CDollars 29.8m after special charges. In 1992 the loss was CDollars 10.8m, or 29 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 2.1bn.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MORE SPECIAL ED BUILDINGS PLANNED  </P> <P> County and Tustin school district officials celebrated the groundbreaking for  new school buildings for special education students on Thursday.  </P> <P> The new facilities are additions to existing elementary schools, allowing the  integration of handicapped students with other students, said Robert Ours,  administrator for facilities and planning for the Orange County Department of  Education.  </P> <P> The first such project in the county opened Thursday with 60 special education  students at Phillip J. Reilly School in Mission Viejo, Ours said.  </P> <P> When two new buildings are completed at Robert P. Heideman School in Tustin in  about a year, 50 special education students will be integrated with the 470  students now registered at the school. The estimated cost of the state-funded  project at Heideman is $3 million.  </P> <P> Heideman School was built in 1969 with 15 classrooms. This project will add 12  classrooms to be used by both special education students and others.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled," said Heideman Principal Patricia James. "The discussion and  planning have been going on for about three years now." SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

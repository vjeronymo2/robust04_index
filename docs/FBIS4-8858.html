			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] [Unidentified announcer] The situation in Gorazde is  extremely difficult. The fighting is going on both on the right  bank of the River Drina and on the Ustipraca side of town. This  was the first information we received from Esad Ohranovic, the  president of the Gorazde district executive council, who  answered questions by domestic and foreign journalists through  the radio-bridge with Gorazde this evening. Mr. Ohranovic goes  on to say:    [Ohranovic] ``The part of town on the right bank is being  shelled particularly heavily. This is where the hospital and  refugee accommodation are located. What we know now is that 26  have been killed and 71 wounded during the day, I mean between  0800 and now. The figures are not final.    ``The hospital has been hit by at least 10 shells. All  personnel and the wounded are in the cellars -- so the wounded  are being treated in poor conditions. The situation is  extremely alarming, particularly at the hospital.''    [Announcer] Have the defense lines been moved, and where are  the Chetnik tanks now -- this was the next question Mr.  Ohranovic was asked.    [Ohranovic] ``The defense lines have not been moved today.  The town is being shelled from tanks, howitzers, and mortars,  and this from all three directions. Some residential buildings  and the hospital are being targeted from three directions. It  is extremely difficult. One cannot see this part of town, on  the right bank, for the smoke and fire. The education center,  the department store, and three blocks of residential buildings  are now burning.    ``From where I am now we can see three tanks, at a distance  of about 1,500 meters. I am now in the part of town closer to  Cajnice [southern part]. Earlier today I spoke from the area  closer to Ustipraca [north east]. The situation there is  unchanged.''    [Announcer] How far are the Chetnik tanks from the hospital?    [Ohranovic] "About 1,000 meters."    [Announcer] And the aggressor's soldiers?    [Ohranovic] "Between 200 and 300 meters."    [Announcer] The Serb-Montenegrin aggressor also launched  infantry attacks today?    [Ohranovic] "Four infantry attacks were launched during the  day. They were mainly repulsed."    [Announcer] The residents of Gorazde and the refugees are  under constant artillery and sniper fire, with no roof above  their heads.    [Ohranovic] ``A lot of people, in particular on the left  bank, have nowhere to go. Fifteen minutes ago I was at the UN  offices. They are having problems now, because the people are  trying to squeeze into their buildings, looking for protection.  Believe me, that is a big problem.    ``Houses that have been burned down are full of people. The  street is like a cauldron. The situation is extremely  difficult, caused by the withdrawal of people before the  attack.''    [Announcer] Water and electricity?    [Ohranovic] "The last convoy arrived in Gorazde on 22 March.  All Gorazde water wells are on the right bank, where the  shelling is the heaviest. You can imagine what the situation is  like. The people on the streets have fled their houses,  carrying perhaps an armful of supplies."    [Announcer] How many foreigners are there in Gorazde?    [Ohranovic] ``There are four members of the UN team, two  UNHCR officers, two members of the Medecins Sans Frontieres  [MSF], and two members of the International Red Cross [IRC]  team. They are still here, but have announced their departure.    ``The IRC center was shelled several times today. Four  people were wounded.''    [Announcer] Enemy propaganda tried to launch another lie  today, that two MSF members had been arrested.    [Ohranovic] "This is a lie. I had some coffee with these  people some 15 minutes ago. It is very unfortunate for us that  the only anesthetist in Gorazde has been seriously injured and  cannot work. He was wounded at work, has been pulled out of the  hospital and is currently with the UN team. Our hospital does  not have an anesthetist at all, people who have no previous  experience are doing his work."    [Announcer] Are the Chetniks withdrawing?    [Ohranovic] "Not for the time being. What they are saying --  that they have withdrawn -- is a downright lie."</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (9): When 1+1 does not always make 2 - Andrew Jack finds many discordant notes in the move towards harmony in financial reporting across Europe during the past few years / Divergence accounting THE ACCOUNTS of companies in the different European countries have one thing in common: they contain numbers giving some indication of financial performance. Some critics believe the similarities stop there. While there has been substantial progress towards harmonisation in financial reporting across Europe in the past few years, wide divergences in disclosure and treatment remain. Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director-general of the EC commission on financial institutions and the law, is relatively optimistic. In a preface to a survey of the accounts of larger European companies in 1991, he wrote that the quality of financial reporting had improved considerably. He said there were also many similarities between the accounts of companies in different EC and Efta countries. Nevertheless, the survey showed considerable continued variation in issues such as fixed assets, pension provisions, foreign currencies, off-balance sheet commitments and complex financial instruments. Mr Christopher Nobes, professor of accounting at Reading University, adds a further proviso even where comparability appears to exist. 'A lot of the larger European companies depart from their national characteristics,' he says. 'The accounts of the top companies are extremely atypical.' Mr Nobes says that many of the discrepancies can be explained - and that changes continue to be resisted - because of the widely-differing characteristics and justifications for accounts in different EC states. He highlights two types of accounts. On the one hand, those prepared under the Anglo-Saxon system, which are oriented towards shareholders, focused on disclosure, prepared in countries with a strong, long-established accountancy profession, and stress substance over form. On the other, continental accounts are rooted in Roman law, are oriented towards creditors, geared around secrecy, guided by government rules and dominated by the requirements of the tax authorities. There is no doubt that greater harmonisation has taken place in the EC, driven particularly by the fourth and seventh directives which codify the contents and format of company and consolidated accounts. These are now all but implemented in member states, while detailed regulations for insurance companies and banks are well advanced. Mr Nobes sees improvements in consistency in the last five years with significant changes taking place in countries such as France and Spain. But he believes further progress will be difficult. 'German accounts are perhaps the most resistant to change,' he says. 'The companies are being very political, saying that standardisation is too difficult.' Some are providing greater information in their annual reports, but most, he argues, are still adhering firmly to German rather than international accounting practices in doing so. The result is profit figures which are to say the least opaque. Some prospects for increasing comparability may still come through the International Accounting Standards Committee. In the past two years, the body has been embarking on a simplification programme which reduces the number of alternative options it judges acceptable in its standards. But so far the results are inconclusive. The IASC's latest annual report last summer showed that just 94 companies had made reference to its standards in their annual reports, including one from the UK. Many national standards-setters and companies still question the organisation's legitimacy. Equally, there is little future in additional legislation from the EC to foster greater harmonisation. The Commission said in 1990 that it had no intention of introducing new standards. That has been welcomed by some standards-setters, particularly in the UK, who have found their hands tied and flexibility reduced by requirements for compliance with rigid laws. Among the leading European companies, the most powerful incentive for future harmonisation or comparability will come in the drive for new sources of capital which take companies beyond their own borders. That may force them to compromise - especially if they need to seek equity outside the EC. Companies such as BASF, Siemens and Daimler Benz are calling for wider application of the mutual recognition of accounts in other countries. That now exists between the stock exchanges in the different EC states such as between Germany and the UK. But while the New York Stock Exchange might be willing to consider taking a similar, sympathetic approach, there is little sign that it will be permitted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which takes a tough line with domestic companies. No surprise, therefore, that no German companies are quoted in the US. The result is likely to be a system of 'double reporting', with companies producing one set of accounts to meet national, legal purposes in their own country, and a separate set for international purposes. The additional costs could well be worth the new sources of funds which result. That is unlikely to have much effect on the vast majority of European companies, which do not seek international funding, do not have shareholders and do not even file publicly-available accounts. But that was never the original point of the drive to harmonisation, which was fuelled by a desire to protect shareholders. 'Who cares whether grocery shops in Frankfurt and Manchester use the same accounting system?' says Mr Nobes. At the moment, it sometimes seems that calls by the accounting profession to improve harmonisation and comparability are moving well ahead of the perceived need for such changes among companies and investors. But as these needs increasingly overlap and cause tensions, change will almost inevitably follow.</p>

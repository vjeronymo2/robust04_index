			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (7): The city's largest employer - Coventry City Council has substantial property holdings COVENTRY City Council has long tentacles. This is not just a matter of the number of people it employs, or the extent of the services it provides. It also has substantial property holdings, more and more of which are likely to become the subject of joint venture developments with the private sector. At the same time, the Council's position as the city's largest employer suggests that it is a significant influence on the local labour market. It is in a position to act as a role model for the private sector, through, for example, the pursuit of active training policies and the practice of equal opportunity. Whether such influence will be sustained during a period in which increasing constraints are being placed on local government expenditure remains to be seen. Contrary to the national trend, the size of the Council's employment roll has actually increased over the last two years, although it is now starting to drift down. In 1990 the Council had, in the jargon, 12,982 full time equivalent employees. The latest figure, said Mr John McGuigan, the assistant chief executive, is about 14,000. The numbers are up to 300 fewer than a year ago, but, said Mr McGuigan, 'the progressive reduction has not been as dramatic as other authorities.' This is largely because Council staff have won contracts for rubbish collection, housing maintenance and sports and leisure facilities' management that had been put out to tender. But the total will drop as, for instance, further education passes away from local authority control and as spending cuts take effect. The spending cuts spring from the disparity between what the council wanted to spend and what the government thought it ought to spend. The government's standard spending assessment for Coventry for the 1992-93 fiscal year was Pounds 234.9m, an increase of 5.6 per cent over 1991-92; it was prepared to allow spending of Pounds 245.3m, but any spending over that second figure would have resulted in poll tax capping. The initial City Council spending proposal was Pounds 251.7m. It has thus had to shave that by Pounds 6.4m to avoid capping and, effectively, the imposition of a government budget on the city. It came through with Pounds 6.9m of cuts, after an anguished spending survey which put potential council economies into three categories: those which are politically unacceptable, those which the Council is unwilling to face but would have to, and those which it would have thought about doing anyway. The burden of the cuts fell on the education service - Pounds 5.38m - followed by personnel and administration, accounting for Pounds 1.24m, and transportation and highways, accounting for Pounds 1.14m. The financial position of the Council would have been stronger had it not lost Pounds 0.5m in property rents, because of the weakness of the property market and because of the necessity to make provision for failures to collect the poll tax. In both these regards, Coventry is not in a markedly different position from any other council in the UK. In fact, its position on poll tax collection has been better than most. Mr McGuigan estimated that about 10 per cent of the city's people had not paid anything at all. This is a relatively small proportion, given the political agitation about payment. There was, indeed, a local campaign waged against poll tax waged by Mr Dave Nellist, the former Labour MP for Coventry South East who fought the seat - vainly as it turned out - in the general election as an Independent. The council budget for 1992-93 assumes a six per cent non-payment rate. The council, best described as 'pragmatic Labour,' has played the poll tax issue quietly, as its label might suggest it would. Equally, it is adopting a pragmatic approach to development, especially where its own landholdings are concerned. It has dropped a passive approach of simply responding to private sector approaches which might be forthcoming on a particular piece of land, or on a particular social scheme. Instead, it has been identifying possibilities for development and making it clear that it is prepared to talk with anybody who is prepared to envisage a joint venture, the structure of which would have to meet certain broad criteria. These include long term partnership, as opposed to short term funding, and a readiness to meet council objectives as well as producing private sector profits. Cases in point include the search for a partner to run and develop Coventry Airport, the rehabilitation of Coombe Abbey and the creation around it of more leisure facilities (covered in an article on the China Connection; see facing page), a scheme to generate power from waste incineration, the enhancement of the area around Coventry Cathedral and the expansion of business parks around the outside of the city. Co-operation with the private sector is necessarily an integral part of Coventry's 1992 City Challenge bid. It is competing with other local authorities to win government funding of Pounds 37.5m, spread over five years, to revive the inner city wards of St Michael's and Foleshill. Within this bid there are three large schemes where private sector companies will play the major role. British Gas and Carroll Business Parks plan to reclaim the old Foleshill gas works for a new business park. Courtaulds and Inner City Enterprises wish to turn a vacant headquarters building into a centre for the clothing industry and a new enterprise centre. Ideal Homes and Moorfield envisage new homes and offices on a derelict part of the Coventry Canal Basin. For the Council, over and above the question of developing links with the private sector, the City Challenge bid is of fundamental importance. Its success or failure could speed or retard plans for revival in the poorest part of the city. If the bid is successful there will be an injection of central government funds. But if it fails there is likely to be less funding for the city from the government's Urban Programme. This is because the funds allotted to City Challenge by the government come out of existing budgets. So, more spending on City Challenge means less spending elsewhere.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CINDERELLA VIDEO PORN, SUIT CLAIMS  </P> <P> Two youngsters got an eyeful of explicit sex when a videotape labeled  "Cinderella" turned out to be hard-core porn, their parents say.  </P> <P> Laura and David J. Burdick Sr. of Shelton filed suit in Superior Court on  Tuesday against New Toys 'R' Us of Paramus, N.J., claiming the mix-up  traumatized their children.  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit, the Burdicks bought the tape as a Christmas present  for the children in 1987, popped it into their videocassette recorder and left  the room. When they returned later, they found the youngsters glued to  "Hollywood Confidential: Diary of a Sex Goddess," the lawsuit said.  </P> <P> The couple claim their children, then 7 and 8, suffered emotional distress and  loss of sleep and appetite.  </P> <P> The lawsuit claims Toys 'R' Us was negligent in failing to inspect the tape and  in failing to protect children from exposure to pornography.  </P> <P> Angela Bourdon, a Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman, said today she could not comment on  the lawsuit because the company had not yet received a copy.  </P> <P> The best-known "Cinderella," the animated musical version of the fairy tale  made by the Walt Disney studio was not released on videotape until 1988, a year  after the alleged incident.  </P></p>

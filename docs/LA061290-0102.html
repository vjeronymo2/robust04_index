			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE;  </P> <P> BIDWELL JOINS EXODUS OF CHRYSLER OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Outspoken Chrysler Corp. executive Bennett Bidwell ended months of speculation  about his early retirement and joined the executives leaving the No. 3 auto  maker Monday.  </P> <P> The departure of the company's most colorful executive next to Chairman Lee A.  Iacocca was the fourth announced in the past six weeks.  </P> <P> Bidwell is chairman of Chrysler Motors, in charge of car- and truck-making  operations.  </P> <P> "It's time to put all this speculation to rest and let the media go back to  covering some of the other important stories of our day such as perestroika,  democracy in Eastern Europe and the search for a cure to AIDS," Bidwell said.  </P> <P> The resignation is effective Jan. 1. Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said it was  too soon to name Bidwell's successor.  </P> <P> Chrysler has lost to resignations its vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, and vice  president for international operations, Michael Hammes. Treasurer Frederick  Zuckerman has said he plans to leave this summer.  </P> <P> Greenwald left Chrysler on May 30 to head a union bid to buy UAL Corp. for  $4.54 billion, and Hammes left earlier to head Black &amp; Decker's tool-making  operation.  </P> <P> Because of those departures and Bidwell's expected early retirement at age 63,  Iacocca said late last week that he would stay on past Dec. 8, 1991, when his  four-year contract was to expire.  </P> <P> Bidwell reportedly had sought a reduction in his workload but because of  problems at the auto maker didn't get it.  </P> <P> "I'm in reasonably good health," Bidwell said, "but it's time to decelerate a  little."  </P> <P> He held out the possibility that he would stick around past the end of the year  "if the environment were to change significantly and I were really needed."  </P></p>

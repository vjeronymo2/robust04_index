In the same connection, Mr. Morteza Sarmadi, the spokesman  of  the Foreign Ministry, yesterday strongly denied the charge, and  he expressed regret that the president of a country has asserted  such baseless and unfounded comments merely on the strength of  fabricated and distorted information against the Islamic  Republic of Iran. Comments of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak  against Iran have appeared in his recent interview carried by  the Kuwaiti-based daily of AL-QABAS. These say that the Islamic  Republic of Iran, by paying $13,000 to an Egyptian terrorist,  has allegedly tried to kill the Egyptian prime minister.    In the opinion of political observers, baseless charges  leveled by Egypt against the Islamic Republic of Iran are not  viewed as new development. It is not for the first time that  political and propaganda circles have sought, by making use of  such a tactic and without presenting any acceptable reason and  evidence, to distort Iran's political image in the region.    In fact, this attempt by leaders of the Egyptian regime,  aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust against Iran in the  region in political terms, is a move which can supplement the  U.S. policies in the area. This is the point that the Egyptian  president and the politicians of that country have often clearly  stressed during their meetings with the U.S. officials. The  regional media affiliated to the West too have added fuel to the  fire and have tried to project in the region an image of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, which because of its opposition to the  so-called Middle East peace plan is interfering in the internal  affairs of the regional countries, including Egypt, and in  certain instances, as the Egyptian president has said it, has  even attempted to assassinate the prime minister of that country.    This is a fact that the Cairo leaders are fully aware of the  weak points and the vulnerable foundation of the ruling system  in Egypt; and the world people, who are daily witnessing the  suppression of the opponents of the Egyptian regime by the state  elements, are quite sensible to think about what is going on in  that country. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the  motive of the Egyptian regime in deviating the public opinion  and linking the country's critical situation to beyond the  Egyptian borders.    This should, however, be reminded [as heard] that the  Islamic  Republic of Iran considers it very essential to counter this  propaganda firmly, since it is considered as a kind of political  assassination committed against a country on the international  and regional scene. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran  will never allow the use of various tactics for destroying the  climate of confidence towards the Islamic Republic of Iran in  the region and not allow the use of these tactics as a tool to  further the common design of the Egyptian regime and the U.S. in  the region.</p>

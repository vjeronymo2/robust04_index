			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP waits for news from US The struggle between UK and US investors over BP - the US houses have been aggressive buyers while UK firms have been equally aggressive sellers - continued yesterday when over 16m shares changed hands in London. The stock settled 1 1/2 up at 269 1/2 p ahead of an important presentation last night to New York investment institutions by Mr John Browne, BP's head of exploration and production. The presentation was hosted by Paine Webber, the US brokerage house. Dealers in London said the US institutions had been accumulating BP stock in front of the speech by the BP director on hopes of good news from BP's big Cusiana oil discovery in Colombia and elsewhere. 'The market is very finely balanced, awaiting the news from New York,' said a London-based analyst. US investors have focused on BP's good yield but UK institutions, dismayed by the poor results, the disappointing dividend payment, and by worries about BP's ability to maintain future dividends, have been reducing their exposure to the stock. Sainsbury deal A block of 10m shares in J Sainsbury, the food supermarket group, loomed over the stock market yesterday, and there were suggestions that a member of the Sainsbury family had offered the block of shares to several investment houses. It appeared that the successful bidder, an integrated securities house, had paid 392p a share but was still trying unsuccessfully to pass the stock on when the market closed. The attempts to do so probably represented about half of yesterday's 4.8m turnover in the stock. The shares closed one lower at 393p. Reuters in reverse The frantic buying and subsequent rise in Reuters shares at the start of the week, when US investment banks were revealed as running substantial short positions in the stock, was reversed yesterday after news that testing of the company's Globex 2000 dealing system failed yesterday. News that the tests, carried out in London, New York and Chicago, had gone wrong saw Reuters shares plummet to 1,168p at one point before they stabilised and eventually closed a net 39 lower at 1,186p. Turnover in the stock expanded rapidly to reach 5m, the highest individual day's activity since November 1990. Globex 2000 is a financial futures trading system being developed as a joint venture between Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Along with Dealing 2002, a foreign exchange dealing system, it is seen as a substantial long-term profits earner for Reuters. Worries that the system may be delayed for some time were shrugged aside by a number of analysts. Mr John E. Clarke at Daiwa, the Japanese-owned stockbroker, said 'any rescheduling is unlikely to mean a significant delay' and pointed out that Reuters shares had closed above last Friday's level. BTR upset A setback in BTR was at first attributed to reports that it had dropped plans to create a global electrical engineering business in the wake of its Pounds 1.5bn takeover of Hawker Siddeley last November. However, the fall in the shares was later ascribed to nervousness ahead of next week's preliminary figures. The shares ended 10 down at 397p as turnover reached 4.4m. Electronics group GEC featured as the fourth-heaviest traded stock in the London market, with BZW seen to be a strong supporter of the shares which touched 221 1/2 p before settling a net 5 higher at 220 1/2 p on turnover of 10m. BZW reiterated its positive stance and will tomorrow embark on a series of presentations to institutions. Dealers said much of yesterday's activity in GEC had taken place between marketmakers. Earlier this week, GEC shares were unsettled by a downgrading by Nomura, the Japanese-owned securities house. Profit-taking left Cadbury Schweppes 3 lower at 460p, retreating from levels of around 468p shortly after it was announced that 1991 profits were up 13 per cent at Pounds 316.4m, compared with analysts forecasts of about Pounds 310m. The initial strength also reflected relief that the company had not made a rights issue. It was generally agreed that the later retreat reflected consolidation in a stock that has performed very well, but that the future will not be easy. Mr Charlie Mills, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said 'forecasts may edge up but not very much', while Mr Tim Potter at Smith New Court, remarked that 'people won't really be able to upgrade. Profits will be hard earned and life tough'. Lonrho, the international conglomerate, held at 117p after some exceptionally heavy trading in the shares, including a block of 3.8m shares traded at 116 1/2 p and another of 4m traded at 117p. The US investment grouping of FMR Corporation and Fidelity International announced they had increased their aggregate holdings in Lonrho to 6.27 per cent or 41.2m shares, from the previous figures of just over 4 per cent. BICC shares rallied from an initial 307p to end a busy session a net 12 higher at 324p on heavy turnover of 6.5m, responding to the preliminary figures. These showed a maintained dividend and better-than-expected cash flow. Hoare Govett said the shares had 'plenty of upside' and pointed out the 30 per cent underperformance against the market over the past 12 months. Shares in SmithKline Beecham were hit in late afternoon trading after rumours on Wall Street that Mevacor, a cholesterol lowering drug, was experiencing problems. Although SmithKline has no direct interest in Mevacor, which is manufactured by Merck &amp; Co, it does help market a sister product, Zocor, and it is the knock-on effect from this that damaged SmithKline. The shares lost 18 to 908p. Glaxo also fell back on the news, closing 3 off at 795p. Leading property stocks fell on familiar concerns over the weakness in central London office rental values. Wates City of London Properties, which reports next week, led the way down after comments at the end of last week over the group's dividend. This had undermined the shares all week, yesterday falling a further 6 to 69p. Strong French buying pushed Euro Disney 20 higher to 1,610p. Busy volume in Owners Abroad included an agency cross of 650,000 shares. The stock was 2 1/2 off at 118 1/2 p. Electronics and entertainment giant Thorn EMI continued its poor run as worries persisted over its chances of winning a large share of Virgin's music division. Latest news from market sources in New York suggests that Thorn has matched Bertelsmann's bid of Dollars 750m and negotiations are continuing. The shares slipped 3 to 797p. Food manufacturing group Hillsdown Holdings remained firm on the expected flotation of its housebuilding subsidiary and positive comments from brokers, gaining 4 to 166p. Turnover was sharply reduced however at 779,000 shares. Dalepak remained volatile following the recent disclosure of preliminary talks with potential purchasers. Monday's rise of 71p has proved to be overdone, according to analysts, and after falling 15 on Tuesday the shares lost another 25 to 393p yesterday. GKN cheered the market by reporting results at the top end of market forecasts and a maintained dividend. The shares responded by jumping 20 to 352p. Profits fell from Pounds 172m to Pounds 95m but the dividend was maintained at 12.5p. British Aerospace firmed 5 to 332p after announcing it had agreed with Asda that Asda would not serve notice to exercise a put/call option which could have led to the ending of the Burwood House joint venture between the two companies. Two large blocks of Singer &amp; Friedlander, each of 7.7m shares and totalling 7 per cent of the equity, traded at 40 1/4 p. The shares closed unaltered at 41p.

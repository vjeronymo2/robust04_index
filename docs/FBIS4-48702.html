			<p>BFN     [Text] Fighting is reported to be intensifying between  ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and  the Lofa Defense Force in Lofa County. Thousands of displaced  people fleeing the fighting in the country have reportedly  arrived in Monrovia and other parts of the country. Reports say  the intensification of the fighting stems from an attack  launched against the Lofa Defense Force by ULIMO. Recently a  spokesman for the Lofa Defense Force said his forces have  flushed out Mandingo fighters of Alhaji Koromah from several  parts of Lofa County, including Zorzor, (Fezebu), and other  areas along the Guinea-Liberia border.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNING ISSUED ON DEUKMEJIAN'S PLAN TO CUT BUDGET  </P> <P> Budget cuts proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian could curtail public treatment  of the mentally ill and gut important programs for juvenile offenders, the  medically indigent and the aging, Ventura County officials warned this week.  </P> <P> "It would be devastating for our department and for the families we serve,"  said Mental Health Director Randy Feltman, whose department would suffer the  most severe cuts with a reduction of as much as 38% in its operating budget.  </P> <P> At a press luncheon, Feltman called the governor's proposals "not only tragic,  but stupid." He contended that the dollars saved by eliminating mental health  programs will be lost many times over when the untreated mentally ill wind up  jailed, homeless or institutionalized.  </P> <P> Ventura County stands to lose about $8.3 million if Deukmejian's proposals are  approved. A $14-million county reserve garnered from cost-cutting measures last  year will soften the blow, but not for long, said Richard Wittenberg, the  county's chief administrative officer.  </P> <P> "We'll probably be OK this year," Wittenberg said. "We have a large fund  balance. But we can't depend on it. We're talking about a systemic problem that  will hurt us more and more as the years go by."  </P> <P> The problem involves a one-two punch delivered by laws designed to limit state  spending. For a decade, state spending has been bridled by the so-called Gann  limit. This year, it became further restricted by Proposition 98, which  earmarks at least 40% of all state expenditures for public schools and  community colleges.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Social Services Targeted  </P> <P> The two have led the governor to propose far-reaching budget reductions,  focusing largely on social services. Statewide, mental health funding could be  cut by as much as 46%, according to Deukmejian's critics. "His blue pencil will  be as destructive as any assault weapon we've been reading about," Democratic  Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy has told crowds of mental health workers and patients  rallying against the cuts.  </P> <P> The governor's budget, which has been criticized by some Republican lawmakers,  faces tough sledding in the Legislature. But, confronted with a lame-duck  governor who wields the power of the line-item veto and needs no political  favors for future campaigns, local officials are bracing for the worst.  </P> <P> "The loss will be pervasive," said Feltman, who predicted more jail crowding  and greater numbers of disturbed homeless people wandering through the county's  downtown areas. He said the county would not likely give his department the  entire $5 million it might lose.  </P> <P> "Last year, we were worried about cost-of-living adjustments," he said. "Now  we're worried about layoffs."  </P> <P> Operations at other county departments would also be threatened by the  governor's budget.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Medical Center would face a direct loss of about $1.5  million, said Phil Wessels, director of the Ventura County Health Care Agency.  "It's not feasible for the hospital to absorb that kind of loss," he said. "The  county will be on the hook."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Jeopardized Programs  </P> <P> Programs to reduce truancy and deal with juvenile offenders before they become  full-fledged criminals are also in jeopardy, as is a program that provides  household help to the elderly, officials said. Moreover, cuts in state family  planning programs could cost the county an additional $4.9 million in welfare  payments for unwanted children, they said.  </P> <P> "We're playing political games with the elderly, the frail, the feeble and our  children," said County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, "and they're pretty awful  games."  </P> <P> The outrage over Deukmejian's proposals is the latest chapter in what is now a  familiar tale, told regularly by officials of almost every California county.  As the taxing limits of Proposition 13 and related measures put a tight lid on  counties' ability to raise money, the state and federal governments were  mandating that they operate increasingly expensive health, corrections and  environmental programs.  </P> <P> The result, they say, has been a plunge in the counties' abilities to provide  basic services. Parks have closed, libraries have cut their hours, jails have  become overcrowded, roads have deteriorated, and hospitals and clinics have  gone understaffed and even shut down.  </P></p>

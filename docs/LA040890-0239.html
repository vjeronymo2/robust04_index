			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW, ZSA ZSA THE VIDEO  </P> <P> Poor Zsa Zsa Gabor.  </P> <P> She makes that dreadful error of slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after  being charged with a variety of small crimes against society (operating a  vehicle without a valid driver's license and having an open container of  alcohol on the seat).  </P> <P> The result was a media circus that turned Zsa Zsa into one long and obnoxious  joke, laughed at during news broadcasts, daytime talk shows and late-night  comedy programs. It was one of the low points of modern journalism. Watching  local newscasters guffawing aloud about Gabor was degrading to all concerned.  The Gabor jokes rank among the cheapest shots ever taken by such usually clever  folks as Jay Leno, Johnny Carson, Bryant Gumbel and Geraldo Rivera.  </P> <P> If that wasn't enough, here comes "The People vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor," a 60-minute  grab-bag home video that the producers swear was not "approved or endorsed by  Zsa Zsa Gabor." This video hodgepodge of courtroom testimony, TV news footage,  person-on-the-street comments and an unctuous voice-over narration is a hurried  mess. Much of the video is dreadful, and the sound quality is often worse,  especially during Gabor's testimony.  </P> <P> Anyone who wants a newsy look at what happened to Zsa Zsa will find it here.  There are no perspectives or thoughtful commentaries. No analysis by Zsa  Zsa-her sentence included a two-year gag order; she can't say anything about  the case, even if she wanted to. If you saw much of the massive news coverage  and snide asides, then the only piece of this video that might interest you is  the blowup of Gabor's altered driver's license. The changes are so obvious that  they are laughable; it is as if a child's scrawl had changed the birth date,  height and weight on the card.  </P> <P> If you're still interested, the tape is produced by IVP/Tri-Coast International  at 1020 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, Calif. 90405. A standard-play VHS version  costs $14.95. A long-play VHS version is available at $9.95 and is almost  unviewable.  </P> <P> VIDEO RESCUES MADE-FOR-TV MOVIES  </P> <P> Some of the finest motion pictures ever made used to play once on prime-time TV  and then disappear, except for the occasional rerun and foreign theatrical  showing.  </P> <P> Home video has changed all of that. Many made-for-television movies now are  being released on videocassette and disc. One of the best, the 1989 "Roe vs.  Wade" is now available on Paramount tape (no list price).  </P> <P> This 92-minute docudrama, based on the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court  decision declaring a Texas anti-abortion law unconstitutional, is an  intelligent piece of work dramatizing the major issues of a highly  controversial subject. There are no villains, just flesh-and-blood characters  played with dignity and affection. Allison Cross' script, Gregory Hoblit's  direction and the lead actors (Holly Hunter as "Jane Roe" and Amy Madigan as  pro-choice Portia) breathe life into various elements of a social issue now  ripping the country.  </P> <P> There are no caricatures or oversimplifications. This is the kind of rare  film-making that makes it easier to understand the complexities involved in a  very complicated subject.  </P> <P> Made-for-TV movies and miniseries, such as "The Autobiography of Miss Jane  Pittman," "Blind Ambition" and "War and Remembrance," deserve more viewing than  one or two showings on prime-time television. They deserve the availability  that home video can give them.  </P></p>

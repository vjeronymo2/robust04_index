			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Saison Russe' in Paris / Review of the Kirov's 'Bakhchisaray' and 'Coppelia An important Saison Russe (shades of Diaghilev in 1909) has started in Paris. The opera and ballet troupes from the Mariinsky / Kirov Theatre, complete with orchestra, are installed at the Theatre des Champs Elysees until the end of December, and will make intermittent forays into the regions. The opera repertory is significant: Sadko; The Invisible City of Kitezh; The Queen of Spades; Khovantschina. The three ballet offerings are less impressive, though none has before been shown in the west by the Kirov. I saw the old (1934) Fountain of Bakhchisaray and a new (1993) Coppelia; the remaining item, Vainonen's version of The Nutcracker, turns up in December. Fountain of Bakhchisaray is an intriguing example of Soviet ballet because it was made when creative artists were shackled by Stalinist aesthetics and the theory of 'socialist realism', where art for the people valued political correctness above all else. Bakhchisaray's theme was 'correct' because taken from Pushkin. Tartar horde ravages Polish manor house, and kills everyone save the fair Maria, who is lusted after by their Khan Guirey. End of Act 1. Act 2 is set in Guirey's harem where his chief mistress, Zarema, takes on alarmingly at the arrival of Maria, who shrinks from every Tartar suggestion. In Act 3, Zarema kills Maria in a fit of jealousy. She, in turn, is tossed from the castle walls. Guirey mopes, and has a fountain installed to remind him of events - a happy combination of sentiment and sanitation. The ballet has been popular since its first performance, when Ulanova was the exquisite Maria. Rostislav Zakharov's choreography and Boris Asafiev's music were of their time and, not surprisingly, unadventurous. The Bolshoi brought the ballet to London in 1956, and it was memorably danced by Struchkova and Velta Viltsin as Maria and Zarema - the roles are matched in much the same way as Nikiya and Gamsatti in La Bayadere - and by a tremendous collection of men as Tartars, led by the magnificent Alexander Lapauri. The Bolshoi's style then - dramatically weighty, intense in meaning as in dynamics - exactly suited Zakharov's dances, which smacked of the silent cinema but were effective for all that. The Kirov's account, looking cramped on the Champs Elysees' stage, was unconvincing. The Polish dances were daintily trodden on the spot, and neither Julia Mkhalina as Maria nor Viktor Baranov as her fiance Vaslav, were anything but visitors to their roles. The subsequent acts, which look like fuzzy memories of Scheherazade for the harem and Bayadere for the confrontation between Maria and Zarema, went for little. It was the Zarema of Sylvie Guillem, a guest with the Kirov, who provided the glamour and sheer physical drive that can make the piece credible. Zarema was one of Plisetskaya's great roles, which suggests something of its potential. Mlle Guillem indulged herself, and gave resonance to the part. The music is tuneful and efficient, but thin. The staging looked no less thin (the original designs, with Bakstian moments, by Vera Khodasevich are still used) and the burning of the manor at the end of the first act, which made us gasp in 1956, is now as uninteresting as the Polish dances which precede it. The way of preserving these old but significant pieces is something which Russian ballet will have to consider very seriously. This touring version is an unworthy lightweight. About the Coppelia, given in a new staging by Oleg Vinogradov, the ballet's director, I find it difficult to comment. In the right hands it is the most joyous ballet. It has been absent from the Mariinsky stage for 60 years, but the traditional Petersburg version exists in notation and memory. It is cogent as drama, touching, and above all, happy. Vinogradov's version is confused, conscienceless - Delibes' perfect score is Frankensteined, with bits chopped, repositioned, and disfigured with one egregious interpolation  -and cursed with choreography where manic vivacity is no substitute for heart, grace, wit, sense. Many dancers rush about the stage in tasteless and complex costuming by Irina Press. Vinogradov - whose patron is St. Vitus - repeats his usual choreographic tricks of ceaseless and crude activity. The delightful Irina Shapchits is lost as Swanilda, and is required to behave like an apprentice termagant. Mikhail Zavialov is a featureless Franz, and he has a quartet of friends who dance well. Coppelius is Woody Woodpecker impersonating Voltaire. Delibes is made to sound glossy, brisk and unfeeling by the orchestra under Alexander Viliumanis. And that is exactly the way in which Vinogradov misinterprets and destroys this beautiful ballet.</p>

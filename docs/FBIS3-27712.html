			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States has postponed until early next  month the decision about Thailand's status on its Priority Watch  List, or PWL, because an assistant of the U.S. Trade  Representative will arrive here first to observe Thailand's  handling of piracy against intellectual property rights [IPR]  and its copyright law. Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon told  newsmen that it is good that the U.S. official will make an  on-the-spot observation to see that Thailand is serious about  suppression of intellectual property right violations and has  adjusted its copyright law, making it closer to the  international standard in order to benefit international trade.    [Begin Uthai recording, in progress] ...who will inspect  trade related to the issue of copyrights or intellectual  property rights here. In my opinion, this is good because he  will see with his own eyes and then be able to use that  information as criteria for the U.S. decision. Regarding the  decision to be made in January, the United States has informed  us that it will first send an official to make an assessment of  the situation. A decision will be made after that. I thanked  them. This is good because they will be able to see for  themselves what is going on here. They will be able to see that  we are serious about solving the problem. We realize that the  measures taken will also benefit our trade. If our own people  do their business properly, this will be an incentive for others  to come here and do business with us. We only stand to lose if  we think only of copying others' products. By so doing we are  only blocking the chances of new products and new technologies  arriving in our country. By copying products we have also  deprived ourselves of the chance to allow new products and new  techniques to gain access here; moreover, we have deprived  ourselves of the use of high quality products because their  owners are afraid of imitation here. This is a disadvantage  which only a few of us realize. [End recording]</p>

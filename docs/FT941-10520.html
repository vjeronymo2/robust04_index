			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Arts: Funny icons of youth - Television Comedy, we are told with irritating frequency, is to the 1990s what rock and roll was to the 1960s. Comedians, it is said, have taken over from rock stars as youth icons. Stand-up comedy, they claim, used to be a low-key occupation for journeymen, but today's young comedians are stars: look at Paul Merton in all those soap commercials. Once it was the Rolling Stones who represented rebellion and the rejection of the older generation's values, but today it is Steve Coogan, Christopher Morris and the rest of the team from The Day Today. It is drivel, of course: part of the naive arrogance of the younger generation which always thinks it has just invented everything 'shocking', from free love to loud music. They believe Merton and Ben Elton are unprecedentedly big stars because they do not realise how large Max Miller and George Formby loomed in the public imagination of their grandparents' generation. They honestly believe that there is something quite new and different about the success of French and Saunders because they are too young to remember how Morecambe and Wise bestrode the nation via television in the 1960s. Tell them that M &amp; W used to attract audiences of 20m and more, as did Steptoe And Son, ratings much larger than any comedian gets today, and either they refuse to believe you or they say 'Ah, well, that was in the days before the audience was split by all these new channels,' overlooking the fact that Coronation Street is still able to pull in more than 20m today. There may have been a brief period when London's Comic Strip was brand new, before The Young Ones reached the screen, while Alexei Sayle was still doing ''Allo John Got A New Motor?' with hysterical energy (last week on BBC2's All New Alexei Sayle Show he was sending up his own youthful performance of that rap satire as though it had been some sort of Vera Lynn number; he is becoming sadly mellow) when only a small band of cognoscenti realised what was happening. For a few months, while the spore remained underground, perhaps there was some strength in the Rolling Stones analogy; had she known about it, your mother wouldn't have liked it. But today? The comedy rebels of the underground burst through the surface long ago to be assiduously cultivated by television's head gardeners. Some of them are proving perfectly acceptable successors to the older generation of comedians. Harry Enfield is more than a match for Dick Emery, though not notably more revolutionary. Newman and Baddiel operate at much the same intellectual level as Cannon and Ball. Trying to decide whether Reeves and Mortimer are funnier than Little and Large is like trying to decide which is more sophisticated, steamed cabbage or boiled sprouts. In The Man From Auntie on BBC1 on Thursday nights Ben Elton is showing that he can easily abandon the tedious political correctness with which he used to curry favour from crowds of lager swilling students, and deliver sustained comedy monologues which are worthy of Dave Allen. True, Allen has a tougher line on religious and what you might call philosophical subjects, as you can currently see in his Monday night repeats on ITV. But Elton can build a bigger head of laughter in those increasingly frenetic attacks that he launches on - say - 'crap design'. Last week's onslaught, beginning with the all-metal teapots in motorway service stations, which can only be picked up after the tea has gone cold, was a highly professional and very funny piece of work. However, the idea that Elton represents for the 1994 teenager what Brian Jones represented for us in 1964 is laughable. Or it would be were it not so sad. What it indicates is not the strength of television comedy but the weakness of rock music: after the rebel years of the Stones, then androgyny, punk and grunge, where was there to go? The supposed wickedness of today's youth programmes such as The Word on C4 on Friday and Saturday nights is so pathetic that it is easy to see why young people would be keen to find something else with which to identify. Comedy might serve if there really was something stirring going on, but the enthusiasm which Elton and some of his contemporaries bring to talk of 'poos' and condoms just does not seem very outrageous these days. The chief characteristic of much of the new generation of comedians is not any sort of rebelliousness, let alone dangerous anarchy, but an inward-facing fascination with the mass media. The main strength of Absolutely Fabulous is the accuracy with which Jennifer Saunders' scripts have satirised the world of glossy women's magazines and PR parties, and the eclecticism of excess - booze, drugs, food, sex, new age crazes, clothes - among those who throng the fringes of this little universe. The mistake of the second series has been to enlarge the role of the boringly square daughter, Saffron, who was originally just a foil to her mother and Patsy; and to step more and more often outside that claustrophobic little world of Bollinger, poser phones, and bikini-line waxing. Tomorrow, we are told, Edi and Patsy are off to Morocco. Better, surely, to have mounted an expedition to Harvey Nicks. Even Sayle, who has tried to distance himself from the 'alternative' comedy brigade, though working with virtually all of them, frequently looks inwards to the mass media for laughs. Last week he told us that Sarah Dunant of The Late Show had been taken down the nick for a good kicking because the police profoundly disagreed with something she said about the poetry concrete of John Cage. He ended the programme with a sight gag, appearing in consecutive shots wearing ludicrously different outfits, flowery trousers and so on, and complaining 'I'm sure I didn't have these on in the last shot', a joke concerned entirely with the concept of continuity. As for The Day Today, they not only limit themselves to jokes about the mass media, but specifically to jokes about news and current affairs programmes. Since its strength comes from the precision with which they parody the manners and mannerisms of foreign affairs reporters, news anchormen and so on it is difficult to convey the feel of the programme. Though standards vary from series to series (Abfab 2 may improve but so far it is sadly inferior to Abfab 1) and even from week to week, there is surely little doubt that many of the programmes coming from this new generation of comedians are an improvement on much of the old stuff. Channel 4's new American series Home Improvement, and ITV's new vehicle for Penelope Keith, Law And Disorder, remind us how lazy, repetitive and predictable the conventional sitcom has become. There is just the one gag in Home Improvement: dad, who presents a DIY television series, is a complete disaster when it comes to doing anything around his own home. And the series trundled out for Penelope Keith these days remind you of those boards at fairgrounds with holes to stick your head through: you just provide the face. So the younger comedians are wafting a bit of fresh air into the system, which is surely no more than they should be doing. It would be exciting if they were leading a revolutionary movement, intent upon some radical form of cultural subversion, infiltrating the dusty corridors of television comedy, taking with them an army of young viewers ready to turn things upside down. However, the evidence on screen suggests that most of them are about as rebellious as Harry Worth or Benny Hill, and most of the programmes coming our way are approximately as unsettling as a Bing Crosby musical. Even today Lenny Bruce really would look revolutionary on television - and he has been dead for 28 years.</p>

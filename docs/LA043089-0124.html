			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGNING A ZOO THAT MEETS NEEDS OF ANIMALS, CHILDREN  </P> <P> Keeping tarantulas cool was not something architects John Grist and Ara  Zenobians had ever had to plan for in their work on Southland hotels, shopping  centers and upscale homes.  </P> <P> But they were hired to be flexible, think simple and work fast on what would be  the most primitive-looking project in their portfolio -- the new Los Angeles  children's zoo, which opens Friday at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> "It was a stretch in one sense," Grist said recently as workers prepared  Adventure Island for the arrival of its first tenants. "We had to do a lot of  research, but architects being the egotists that they are, think they can do  anything."  </P> <P> The $8.3-million job was complicated by the fact that the zoo's future  occupants couldn't help the architects with the design. So the architects had  to poll the zoo's in-house experts before they could sit down at the drawing  board.  </P> <P> And this was to be a zoo that doesn't look like a zoo.  </P> <P> It had to incorporate an aviary, tide pool, petting zoo, an animal nursery  built hacienda style, high-tech interactive devices, an outdoor theater for  animal performances, a cave built into a mountain, a fast-food restaurant and  bathrooms.  </P> <P> The project would be built across four distinct biomes, or habitats, (mountain,  meadow, desert, shoreline) that seem to flow from one to the other in a  2.5-acre corner of the Los Angeles Zoo, which is located in Griffith Park near  the interchange of the Golden State (5) and Ventura (134) freeways.  </P> <P> The architects had to find ways to accommodate features they had never used in  their previous work: A wired-for-sound mountain lion hopscotch game -- with  squares having real paw prints cast in bronze -- on a busy pathway and a scary  (but not too scary) vampire bat imaging device inside the cave that seems to  move the bats from one stalactite to another, within reach of young visitors.  </P> <P> Every phase of the project, from planning to completion, was monitored by the  Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., which raised the budget from donations. The  largest gift, $3 million, was provided by the Weingart Foundation.  </P> <P> Architect Riener Nielsen, who usually designs hotels and upscale homes, had no  zoo experience when he was hired by GLAZA as project manager, to serve as both  buffer and trouble-shooter on the project. Getting it off the ground was the  hardest part.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ground Broken in July  </P> <P> "For this project," Nielsen said, "there's no comparison to cost relationships  like there would be for a hotel or an office building, where you would have  dollars per square foot. We needed to get subcontractors on board early to  define it and verify the pricing."  </P> <P> Ground breaking was last July, after the deteriorating original children's zoo,  built in 1963, was demolished.  </P> <P> The project, the largest in the zoo's history, was nearly a full-time challenge  for the architects.  </P> <P> "There were weeks Ara lived over there," Grist said. "There were phone calls by  the hour every day."  </P> <P> Although the project was a melding of complex relationships, Zenobians said he  tried to keep all structures generically Southwestern and simple, with few  flourishes.  </P> <P> "I don't believe a building should be complicated to be nice," he said. "I  believe in simplicity very much. I go to basic design that can be appreciated  by all people."  </P> <P> The need to put safety first for human visitors and animal occupants required  extensive reworking of some of the plans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scaled for Youngsters  </P> <P> Adjustments were made in "window coverings" for outdoor habitats to restrain  the animals comfortably and keep visitors at a safe distance, but close enough  to enable even toddlers to see the creatures up close.  </P> <P> Step-ups were added in front of exhibits to give smaller children a better  view, and some facade work was designed especially to bring adult-scale  buildings down to a comfortable level for young visitors.  </P> <P> But there was the occasional gentle conflict between builder and zookeeper.  </P> <P> The fencing at the petting zoo, or hacienda, looks like wood but is made from  textured concrete. Zoo Director Warren Thomas was concerned that the animals  would chew on the concrete posts and hurt themselves, but a decision was  reached to go with concrete anyway.  </P> <P> Grist thought air-conditioning the tarantulas seemed ridiculous. "They seem to  do very well in the desert without it," he said. But Thomas explained that life  in captivity is stressful to spiders and that air conditioning is essential to  their survival.  </P> <P> Fancy technology is scattered throughout the zoo to make each visit an  interactive adventure. It was created by ex-Disney wizards who formed their own  Burbank-based company, Art &amp; Technology, which uses contemporary technology  to design and build educational devices for zoos and amusement parks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stimulate Senses  </P> <P> Adventure Island's 20-plus interactive devices are intended to amuse both  children and adults and stimulate a variety of senses, said Art &amp;  Technology's Joe Garlington.  </P> <P> One device inside the cave will let visitors see a lifelike Betty White -- the  actress and animal lover -- in three dimensions and in miniature, explain how  and why skunks stink.  </P> <P> In the Little House Under the Prairie, also inside the cave, children will see  a cross section of a prairie dog burrow outfitted with three-dimensional models  defining each prairie dog "room."  </P> <P> Art &amp; Technology also created a series of "photo spots," humorous, colorful  bas-reliefs that will allow children to pose in life-size fantasies scattered  throughout Adventure Island.  </P> <P> At one, a giant vulture bears down on a rock slab. When a child has his picture  taken, he'll look like he's being attacked by the bird. Another provides a  photo opportunity with a snake and a third will give children a chance to  "hang" like a bat. You turn the snapshot upside down for this one.  </P> <P> In addition to the white stucco hacienda-style petting zoo, nursery and  Southwestern-flavored Greek theater, Grist and Zenobians also drew the plans  for the earthquake-safe concrete bunker that is the firm foundation for the  mountain/cave at the entrance to Adventure Island, located past the gift shop  in the regular zoo.  </P> <P> The cement-and-steel structure, fine-tuned by structural engineer Grossman  &amp; Speer, not only came up to city code, but it's so solid, Grist said, that  "when the bomb comes, where you want to be is in that cave. The footings are  higher than me, and I'm 5-foot-8. It's built like Ft. Knox."  </P> <P> The rugged-looking mountain with a wet and dry cave inside it was crafted with  dental tools, spray-painted and fitted inside with a dripping slime wall by the  Larson Co., a Tucson-based design and construction firm that builds grottoes  for millionaires in the South of France, waterfalls in Japan, water hazards for  golf courses and naturalistic habitats for zoos.  </P> <P> The landscape of Adventure Island was designed to enhance the various habitats  and make the zoo animals feel at home, but also to conserve water and guarantee  low maintenance.  </P> <P> Plants and trees selected for the site had to be nontoxic to children and zoo  animals, and had to blend in with the overall architectural design.  </P> <P> The job was done for $120,000 by Jon David Cicchetti Landscape Architect of  Long Beach and Irvine, which specializes in using native and ornamental plants  "to create (a) natural environment, whatever it happened to be."  </P> <P> "The idea was to have these zones -- mountain, desert, meadow -- but at the  same time have the zones come off as a total landscape," Cicchetti said.  </P> <P> In spite of the complexity of this project and the push to finish it by spring,  Grist and Zenobians said building Adventure Island was very enjoyable.  </P> <P> "We feel it was a very successful collaboration or it would not have come  together as quickly or as cleanly as it did," Grist said.  </P> <P> "I'd like to do another zoo."  </P></p>

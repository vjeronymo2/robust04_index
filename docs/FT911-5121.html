			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: TNT placing raises ADollars 70m AUSTRALIAN transport group TNT has ended weeks of speculation over its fund raising prospects by placing 15m shares at ADollars 1.50 apiece with a group of institutions. TNT said the ADollars 70m (USDollars 54.8m) proceeds would be used for 'working capital' purposes. Although the company did not reveal the names of the institutions offered the shares, it is understood that two were the AMP Society and National Mutual Life, two recent supporters of TNT in the market. According to one analyst yesterday's issue would reduce the group's liquidity problems 'significantly'. TNT was due to raise ADollars 140m from the exercise of options at a ADollars 1.60 strike price over May and June, but the recent weakness in the share price cast doubts on the company's ability to raise the money, Analysts have blamed TNT's unpopularity on its high debt of ADollars 2.2bn and its association with Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation which suffered early this year during negotiations with its banks to reschedule Dollars 10bn in borrowings. In January, TNT shelved plans to issue ADollars 255m worth of preference shares at about the same time as it was downgraded by the credit agency Australian Ratings to BBB-minus, barely investment grade.</p>

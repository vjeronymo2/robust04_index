			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel reviews creeper provision to protect companies THE RULE by which a shareholder with more than 30 per cent of a company can increase its stake without triggering a bid is being reviewed by the Takeover Panel. The so-called 'creeper provision' was brought in alongside the mandatory offer rule in 1974. The aim was to provide some flexibility in the wake of a rule that made a bid compulsory once a holding reached 30 per cent. The 'creeper' allows the holder of between 30 and 50 per cent of a company's shares to buy a further 2 per cent a year without triggering a bid. However, in a few cases the effect has been to leave a target company under siege even though the predator has failed to attract majority acceptance of an offer. For instance, Molins, the engineering group, beat off a bid from Leucadia National, the US financial conglomerate, in 1990 only to face the possibility that Leucadia would take control anyway. In the event, Leucadia failed in its attempt to win board control and last November sold its 48.4 per cent to institutions at a profit. Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director of Molins, said yesterday that he welcomed the panel's decision to review the provision. 'Molins' experience was that there was a real danger that a company with a major holding could gain control on a creeping basis without paying the full value to all shareholders.' The provision may lower the level of acceptances a predator needs in order to gain ultimate control. In 1990, Hartwell, the motor group, fought off a bid from the Saudi Arabia-based Jameel organisation. But the 43 per cent stake acquired by Jameel coupled with the prospect of it gaining eventual control through annual share purchases and preference share conversions led Hartwell's management to surrender - at the very price they had rejected - less than three months after their apparent victory. Now Hartwell is bidding nearly Pounds 26m for Trimoco, another motor trader, from the basis of a 39.4 per cent stake following the conversion of preference shares. No wonder Trimoco is sensitive to its shareholders misunderstanding the term 'mandatory' offer and believing that the compulsion is on them to sell rather than on Hartwell to offer. The Takeover Panel said it was continually reviewing its code. The creeper provision was being debated, but there was no overwhelming body of cases. It was not clear if the issue was worrying enough for the rule to be tightened up.</p>

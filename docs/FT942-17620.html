			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Leading Article: Back to go, painfully Few at Christmas predicted that the world's financial markets would look as shaky as they now do at Easter. Yet there is at least one important respect in which the unsettling behaviour of the markets gives grounds for hope. The successive squalls that have upset bond and equity prices, culminating in Wall Street's nervous slide this week, are partly a reflection of a healthier global economy. Bond markets always turn when the accelerating pace of economic activity starts draining liquidity from the system. Investment in inventory, plant and machinery then takes priority over the claims of portfolio investors. This is certainly true of the US, where business investment is buoyant and the economy is set to grow this year at between 3 and 4 per cent. The UK is following at a more sedate pace. But part of the global bond market shakeout has been to do with the growing perception that growth is reaching hitherto stagnant parts of the world. Surveys of business confidence in continental Europe reveal unexpected signs of optimism and economists are upgrading their growth forecasts for 1994. Even in Japan, where real gross national product contracted marginally in 1993 and business investment continues to fall, there is a hint that an economy which seemed poised for serious deflation may now have bottomed out. It looks at first sight like a return to normality after a lingering recession which was induced in large part by the lending excesses of the 1980s and by the strains of German unification. Yet to call this normality would be going too far, because the unusual financial conditions that prevailed in the recession continue to affect the behaviour of capital and credit. We have lived through a period in which the US Federal Reserve has engaged in a gigantic and astonishingly successful exercise in rigging the markets in order to recapitalise an American banking system shattered by bad debts. This involved maintaining short-term interest rates at artificially low levels, which precipitated a tidal outflow of dollars from bank deposit accounts into mutual funds and other longer-term investments offering scope for higher returns. Neutral stance Since his decision to raise interest rates in February, Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan has indicated that it is time to return to a normal or 'neutral' monetary stance. Yet the consequences of his earlier policy make it difficult to return to normal without causing markets to slide. In effect Mr Greenspan has to keep two separate and very different constituencies happy. The first consists of sophisticated professional investors, many of whom believe that the Fed has been slow to respond to a build-up in inflationary pressure. After growth at an annualised rate of 7 per cent in the final quarter of last year a federal funds rate of 3 1/2 per cent looks tame. The average federal funds rate since 1979 has been 3 3/4 per cent - and that average includes periods of very tight policy. Inflationary threat Such investors would have been happier to see the Fed move swiftly to short-term rates of 4 1/2 or 5 per cent, instead of moving from 3 to 3 1/2 per cent in quarter point steps. Yet there are fears that less sophisticated investors in the mutual funds - the second constituency - might then panic if they discovered, in any resulting market fall, that stock market investment is not protected by deposit insurance schemes. Small wonder Mr Greenspan has pursued a gradualist course. Yet the consequence is that the professionals become more nervous. If the inflationary threat is real, short-term rates of 3 1/2 per cent look low for this point in the cycle. Hence much of the recent market turbulence. The problem for Europe is that the impact of an overshooting US bond market is benign when prices are moving up, but threatening when they are moving down. Monetary policy in continental Europe has been too tight over the past 18 months or so when US capital has spilled over into European capital markets. Yet that same outflow has helped offset the monetary squeeze by pushing European stock and bond markets higher. This enabled European governments to finance their growing fiscal deficits more cheaply, while helping companies rebuild strained balance sheets by raising capital. Now the sharp fall in European bond markets is, in effect, tightening monetary policy through its impact on long-term interest rates, while short-term rates remain high in real terms. Yet the Bundesbank is reluctant to change monetary tack to offset the market induced tightening. This approach is understandable while the markets are still sorting themselves out. But if continued for too long it would kill off the European recovery. The resulting uncertainty is the opposite of a recipe for an immediate soft landing in the markets, especially against a background of unusual political weakness in Britain, Germany, France and Italy. Stand by for another squall.</p>

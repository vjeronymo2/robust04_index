			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Observer: Exit North If there is a bull market in finance directors, then Richard North, Burton's 44-year-old bean counter, must be one of the hottest properties. In the three years that he has been there, he has overseen three bank refinancings, two rights issues, sold Harvey Nichols, slashed costs and restored the group's integrity in the City. However, it's time to move on to bigger things. Wellcome, BOC, Prudential and Argyll are just a few of the big names looking for a finance director at the moment. The Wellcome job sounds the most challenging. But North is an ambitious sort and might have even bigger ideas.</p>

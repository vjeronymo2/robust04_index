			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Pearse to hand over reins at Midland Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, is to retire in March and be succeeded by Mr Keith Whitson, in changes to the Midland board that strengthen HSBC Holding's grip on the UK clearing bank it acquired last year. At the same time, Sir William Purves, chairman of the HSBC group, is to take over from Sir Peter Walters, whose impending departure as chairman of Midland was announced earlier this year. Sir Peter is becoming chairman of SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group. It had been widely expected within Midland that Mr Pearse, 60, would succeed Sir Peter as the bank's chairman. Mr Pearse refused to comment on whether he was disappointed at leaving Midland, though he said he had achieved what he 'set out to do' when he joined the group from Barclays in 1991. 'I think there could be an advantage (in Sir William's becoming chairman)', Mr Pearse said. 'It will help to knit the two cultures of the bank even closer together.' However, he added: 'I don't feel 60.' Although Midland's after-tax profits were wiped out in 1990 and 1991 by losses on loans to UK companies and consumers, its more recent performance has been much improved. In August it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 385m in the first six months, against Pounds 60m in the same period last year. HSBC said it was standard practice within the group for the chairman of the group to chair subsidiaries - Sir William already chairs, for example, the British Bank of the Middle East. Mr Whitson, aged 50, has been deputy chief executive of Midland since 1991 and has worked for HSBC for more than 30 years. He said yesterday that he saw his task as maintaining the progress that had been made since the acquisition, and in continuing the emphasis on customer service. As chief executive of Hongkong Bank's operations in the UK from 1987 to 1989, Mr Whitson worked closely with senior Midland executives, after HSBC acquired its first stake in the clearing bank in late 1987.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking keeps Dow under pressure Wall Street ALTHOUGH profit-taking continued to afflict US stock markets, underlying sentiment remained positive and losses were kept to a minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.11 at 3,286.25, although off its lows for the day when it had been down almost 15 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down 0.88 at 429.90, while the Amex composite gave up 0.41 at 392.56. The Nasdaq composite's recent record-breaking streak finally ended, with the index dropping 1.06 to 652.88. Turnover on the NYSE was 241m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 931 to 856. The day's only economic statistics, a 10.3 per cent fall in October new single-family home sales, were virtually ignored by the market because of their inconsistency. Analysts and investors were reluctant to read much into the latest numbers after the commerce department announced a big upward revision in the previous month's data. Most of the damage to prices was inflicted by profit-taking, and a fall in Caterpillar, one of the biggest constituents of the Dow average. The market was also nervous ahead of today's all-important employment report for November, which will give the best indication yet of current economic conditions. Investors were worried that because of structural weaknesses in the labour market, recent, positive economic data might not feed through into the job figures as some had hoped. Economists are expecting a rise of about 50,000 in non-farm payrolls. Among individual stocks, Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 54 3/8 after the management said that it appeared possible that the company would report a 'modest loss' in the fourth quarter. Caterpillar had previously said that it expected to post a small profit in the October-to-December period. LA Gear plunged Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 1/4 on a warning from the sports-shoe maker that it expects to report a loss from continuing operations of between Dollars 27m and Dollars 31m in the forth quarter, and a loss of between Dollars 69m and Dollars 73m for the full year of 1992. Consolidated Stores eased Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 17 in busy trading after the broking house Merrill Lynch lowered its intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'above average' in anticipation of a technical correction in retail stocks during the first quarter. Standard Federal Bank bucked the trend with a rise of Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 24 following a statement from the company pre dicting 1992 earnings of Dollars 3 a share, up sharply from the Dollars 2.11 reported a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, LaserMaster Technology dropped Dollars  25/32 to Dollars 2 23/32 after warning that it would not meet analysts' forecasts of earnings and revenues for both the second fiscal quarter and for all of 1993. Canada TORONTO stocks finished mixed after a financial statement from the Canadian government failed to deflect attention from Wall Street, dealers said. The TSE 300 finished 8.4 lower at 3265.3 on volume of 41m shares valued at CDollars 353m. Advances outstripped declines, 331 to 276, with 279 issues unchanged. Traders said the heavy volume was primarily due to traditional December tax-loss selling of small-capitalisation issues.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Customs seize jet parts destined for Iran CUSTOMS AND Excise officers are interviewing a number of UK businessmen after seizing about 12,000 counterfeit engine parts for US-made Iranian jet fighters. The Customs investigation is centred on a company called DBI based near Maidenhead, Berks. The company is run by Mr Richard Patrick, a Canadian-born former wing commander. The Customs and Excise Department refused last night to comment on the investigation. Customs have seized about 7,500 compressor blades for Northrop F-5 fighter engines with a sale value of about Dollars 1m. The parts were ordered by the Iranian government's foreign procurement mangement centre and the end user is believed to be the Iranian Air Force, which operates 65 ageing F-5E and F-5Fs. The blades are copies of parts made by General Electric of the US. The company said last night it had been contacted by UK Customs officials following the seizure of the blades to help in their identification. A General Electric representative based in the UK was instrumental in identifying the unmarked blades as copies of those used for a J85 engine used in F-5 fighter aircraft. General Electric ceased manufacturing the blades in 1987. DBI subcontracted the work to two unidentified engineering companies which apparently did not know the parts were destined for Iran. Mr Patrick, 75, has been investigated previously by Customs officers. On the last occasion in 1988 a prosecution was withdrawn when he agreed to pay a Pounds 40,000 customs penalty for exporting ball bearings for Iranian jet aircraft. The previous investigation involved a company called Dixie Barings International, then based at Heathrow. Mr Patrick, who could not be contacted last night, was reported in the magazine to have said that the Iranians told him the blades were for use on civilian Fokker F27 aircraft. Fokker said in the same report it had no knowledge of any kit designed to convert the propeller-driven F27 to be driven by jet engines. Six businessmen were initially charged after the previous customs investigation into Mr Patrick's exports, but all are understood to have reached a 'compounded settlement' with Customs which involves paying hefty penalties in return for the withdrawal of the prosecution. Sales of military spare parts, such as the blades for engines, to Iran have been subject to embargoes in the US and the UK both following the 1979 revolution and as a result of the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s. One defence industry expert in the US said last night that the embargoes were unlikely to be lifted while Tehran persisted in its death threat against Salman Rushdie. In Tehran Mr Akbar Torkan, the minister of defence, made clear recently, however, his country's overwhelming need for spare parts for equipment bought from the US before the downfall of the Shah in 1979. The Iranian Air Force includes among its aircraft some 60 F-4D and Es, and a further 60 F-5 Es and Fs in addition to squadrons of more modern F-14s and MiG-29s. Details of the investigation appear in today's issue of Flight International magazine. Mr Andrew Chuter, the editor, said: 'These are quite old aeroplanes and they are quite old engines used in them. But to actually make the blades, which are the most important parts of the engine, is probably beyond them, so they have to look elsewhere. 'They can't get them from the Americans because of the embargo. So they have clearly decided to get them engineered elsewhere. It's reverse engineering or it's pirated - call it what you want. 'Because this is mid 1950s technology we are talking about steel compressor blades - rather than the state-of-the-art stuff today which might be titanium or composites - the materials are probably not exotic as they are these days.'</p>

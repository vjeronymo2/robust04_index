			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / People: Freshfields attracts more foreign blood to its partnership council Freshfields, the international law firm that invited Sir John Nott on to its partnership council in 1991, has persuaded Herbert Jacobi, chairman of the managing partners of investment bank Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in Dusseldorf, to become its second non-executive member, thereby adding an extra European perspective to the deliberations of the strategy forum. The introduction came via Peter Opitz, a partner in Freshfields' Frankfurt office. Opitz knew Jacobi from the 1970s when both had been managing partners of BHF Bank, the merchant bank. A Frenchman, the managing partner of Freshfields' Paris office, its largest overseas operation, already sits on the council. John Grieves, Freshfields' senior partner, found Jacobi 'awfully likeable and very experienced'. He says the presence of outsiders 'helps us to dilute our insularity'. Few law firms have such an arrangement, and Grieves remembers the concerns voiced in his own stable before Nott joined. 'We were initially worried that the presence of non-executive members might alter the whole nature of the debate. We also wondered whether the job would actually be sufficiently interesting for them.' Freshfields has been after Jacobi for a long time; talks were suspended when HSBC Holdings acquired Midland, which owns 70 per cent of T&amp;B, causing Jacobi to be more than thoroughly occupied bedding down the new relationship. The council meets for a whole day four times a year. A native American who is half German, he worked with Chase Manhattan Bank before joining BHF. As well as being president of the Dusseldorf stock exchange, he is a non-executive director of Gillette, of Braun, its German subsidiary, and of Amtrol.</p>

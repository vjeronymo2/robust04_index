			<p>CSO     [Text] Ford Motor of the United States will jointly develop  a small world strategy car with Mazda with whom it has a capital  tie-up. First, it will begin development with the Mazda  main-force "Familia" car class as the base and produce it with  the three poles of Japan, the United States, and Europe  beginning in 1998 or 1999. The Familia is a mass-sales car  amounting to about 700,000 cars annually in Asia and North  America combined, with the cars sold by Ford. It appears that  the plan is to combine this with the same "Escort" car class of  Ford Europe, and the idea is for both companies jointly to  gather momentum in international strategy by expanding  production scale further and cutting development costs.    Besides the Familia, a strong candidate for "world strategy  car" where the same model will be sold throughout the world is  the "Festiva" that is being designed centering on Mazda.  Considering that it "would like to promote development of world  strategy cars in a wide class of cars" (Mazda chief executive),  it is possible that it will in the future include midsized cars  and above, which are the forte of Ford. The outline will be  firmed up in June and it is scheduled to develop side by side  various class cars beginning at the end of the year.    Both Ford and Mazda will position the "Familia," the next  after next after the current model that will be put on the  market in 1998 or 1999, as a world strategy car, Ford will  produce it in the United States and Europe and prospects are  that they also will export it. Mazda will center on production  and sales in Japan. Besides being able to share development  expenses with Ford, Mazda can also expect the supply of parts to  Ford.    Ford is promoting unification of its U.S. and European  organization and consolidation of car classes. The over 2,000-cc  "Mondeo" which Ford Europe handles is considered a world  strategy car. It is already on sale in Europe and production  will begin in summer in the U.S. market also. It is aiming at  annual production of 800,000 cars.    However, there remains an overlapping of car classes by the  various Ford-related companies in the United States, Europe, and  Japan, and they are cultivating the next-generation car with a  "Familia" base as a world strategy car in the 1500-cc class by  U.S. and Japanese cooperation.</p>

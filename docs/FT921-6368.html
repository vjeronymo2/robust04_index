			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (21): Tessa and other T-era treasures - Tax-efficient savings AVOIDANCE IS not a dirty word when it comes to tax. The Conservative governments of Mrs Margaret Thatcher brought in or bolstered a number of measures to encourage savings and investments through the sweetener of waiving or reducing tax. Tessas: Tax-Exempt Special Savings Accounts were introduced by John Major as chancellor in 1990, to encourage a savings mentality through a simple risk-free scheme available at high street banks and building societies. Individuals can save a total of Pounds 9,000 over five years in a Tessa, and earn the interest tax-free if the capital is not withdrawn. Tessas were launched on January 1, 1991. The maximum deposit for the first year is Pounds 3,000. A further Pounds 1,800 can be paid in on the anniversary of the account for each of the subsequent years, subject to the Pounds 9,000 maximum. The total return for the investor depends on interest rates over the five years, but for the first year the average rate of interest has been 12.9 per cent. This means a return of around Pounds 387, with the saver keeping the Pounds 96.75 that would normally be paid in tax so long as the capital is kept in the Tessa for the full five years. Investors can remove all net interest without penalty during the life of the Tessa. National Savings: There is no income or capital gains tax to pay on index-linked and variable rate certificates, nor on the Yearly Plan (See N for National Savings). Pensions: Your pension is one of the most tax-efficient forms of savings, because your contributions and those of your employer normally enjoy tax relief, as do additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). The fund into which they are paid is exempt from income or capital gains tax, so the return on investments should be higher than on other savings schemes. There are limits on the amounts of contributions qualifying for relief in any one year. If you decide to receive some of your pension as a lump sum on retirement, this will be paid to you tax-free, and the pension itself is taxed as earned income, not investment income. Employer's schemes: If the scheme is contributory, you get tax relief at your highest rate of tax on your contributions. Personal pension plans: Tax limits on contributions depend on the time you took out the plan. If it was before July 1, 1988, you make gross payments and get basic rate and higher rate tax relief through the PAYE system, a rebate or a lower tax bill (See R for Retirement planning). Life insurance: There is no tax to pay on the proceeds of a life insurance policy if you are a basic rate taxpayer. Higher-rate taxpayers may have to pay on gains made, but not if they have kept the proceeds of a qualifying policy for at least three-quarters of the term of the policy, or 10 years, whichever is shorter. (See Q for Qualifying policies). The amount of tax you might pay on a non-qualifying policy, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, depends on the gain, calculated as the amount you get when the policy comes to an end, less the total premiums paid - unless the policy is cashed early. (See S for Single-premium investment bonds, and L for Life insurance ). Baby bonds: These are offered by friendly societies (similar to life offices) and provide a way of sheltering gifts from parents to children. The funds of friendly societies are tax-exempt, which should lead to better performance compared with similar savings schemes. However, Money Management, the magazine for professional advisers, recently found that charges on a friendly society policy 'virtually wipe out the tax-free boost given to its fund performance'. The maximum contribution into the baby bond is only Pounds 200 a year or Pounds 18 a month. Premiums can be paid annually or monthly, maturing either at the end of a fixed period or on a selected birthday. You must hold the bond for at least 10 years to obtain the tax exemption. Personal equity plans: Peps were another Tory innovation to encourage wider share ownership. A personal equity plan is a way of holding equities which which offers shelter from both income and capital gains tax. You can hold a general Pep with Pounds 6,000 of equities in any one tax year and a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep (See P for Peps). Business Expansion Scheme: The BES will appeal to top-rate tax payers as a means of sheltering tax, but it is risky. Its least risky form is the 'buy back' scheme. A BES company buys accommodation on behalf of a third party - usually a college or a housing association - and receives in return a covenant to buy back the property at a fixed price after five years. Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise the money, risk is minimised. You can invest up to Pounds 40,000 in companies which qualify for investments under the BES by submitting a BES3 form (sent to you by the company) to the Inland Revenue. The total value of your investment is then deducted from your total taxable income. Thus, if you are a 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount you invested. So you ultimately part with only Pounds 24,000 to invest Pounds 40,000. You have to maintain the investment for five years to gain the tax benefits. Enterprise Zones: EZs are government-selected run-down regions which need investment. Like the BES, tax relief is the incentive. Top-rate taxpayers get a rebate of 40 per cent on the value of their investment. The tax breaks are potentially great, because there is no maximum limit on investment, but they are only allowed for non-residential property, and investors must usually commit themselves to a 25-year term. Enterprise Zone Trusts buy properties and split them into units, allowing investors to buy a share of a building which might otherwise be too expensive. The minimum for most schemes is Pounds 5,000. EZTs aim for a yield of more than 7 per cent of the initial investment per year from rental income. Combined with the capital gains you could obtain once the property is sold, the tax advantages could be substantial but have to be measured against the risk. Trusts: These are a useful tool in reducing inheritance tax. There are many types of trust, but the accumulation and maintenance trust is one that everyone, and not simply the very wealthy, can consider. Income made by the trust is kept in it (accumulated), although some income can be drawn if it is for the 'maintenance, education or benefit' of the children. The trust comes to an end, once the child is between 18 and 25 years old and the estate is given over (See W for wills).</p>

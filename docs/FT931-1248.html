			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Two senior analysts go in Baring Japan move BARING Securities Japan, Tokyo arm of the UK broker, has parted with two senior analysts in a reorganisation of its research department, writes Emiko Terazono from Tokyo. The move follows the resignation earlier this month of Mr Christopher Heath as chairman of Baring Securities after a disagreement over business strategy with its parent company, the Barings banking and financial group. Baring's Tokyo operation was one of the top performers among foreign houses in Japan. But its dependence on client commissions in the weak Tokyo stock market since 1990 has eroded profits. Almost 40 per cent of Baring Securities' revenues are still linked to Japanese trading. The number of staff at Baring's Tokyo operations has fallen from 240 in 1989 to 207, while the research team has declined from 32 to 25. Mr Henry Antsey, an official at Baring's in Tokyo, denied the Tokyo branch was restructuring, but said the company was trying to improve its research product, and the latest losses resulted from differences in management styles. But Baring's new strategy of concentrating on emerging markets - such as Singapore and Korea - has fueled speculation that the company may be shifting away from Tokyo. Norinchukin Bank, the central body for agricultural financial institutions, plans to apply to set up a subsidiary to deal in securities once Japan's financial reforms take effect on April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The bank will capitalise the offshoot at between Y15bn (Dollars 127m) and Y20bn. It will have a staff of about 40, which will double within a year. Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Trust and Banking have already announced plans to apply to the finance ministry to set up securities arms.</p>

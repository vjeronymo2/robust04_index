			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (2): Heathrow is challenged - The fierce competition to become top European hub The rapidly emerging role of airports as catalysts for economic growth is intensifying competition for market share among the hub airports of Europe. BAA is pressing for the development of the Pounds 900m Terminal 5 at Heathrow, London, to cope with relentlessly rising traffic and, just as significantly, to secure its position as the foremost hub airport in Europe. The development would lift capacity by 30m passengers a year to about 80m by 2013. A hub airport is one where many passengers change aircraft (and sometimes airlines) for onward flights - to 'inter-line' in airline language - because the airport is served by a lot of carriers. At Heathrow, more than 90 airlines from 85 countries offer direct flights to more than 200 destinations. These figures are bound to rise in conjunction with air passenger and cargo traffic, putting further pressures on slots - precious take-off and landing times. The slots problem at airports revolves around several factors: runway, terminal and air traffic control capacity and even the possibility of bigger aircraft. Improvements in ATC capacity by the UK National Air Traffic Services (Nats) and Eurocontrol, and the prospect of Terminal 5 support BAA's claim that it will not need a third runway at Heathrow. The most immediate challenge to Heathrow is from the nearest continental European cities where several other hubs are expanding rapidly. ACI Europe statistics for 1993 show that Heathrow was the busiest European airport, with nearly 48m passengers, of whom about 30 per cent were inter-lining. It was followed by Frankfurt with 32.5m, Paris - Charles de Gaulle (CDG) - at 26.1m, Paris Orly at 25.4m, Amsterdam at 21.3m and London (Gatwick) at 20.2m. At Frankfurt a new Dollars 3.86bn terminal opened in October, raising the airport's capacity by 10m-12m passengers a year. In the past nine months the airport handled 26.5m passengers, and is on target for 34m for the year. The airport is linked to the German rail network and expansion plans include a second station for advanced high-speed trains. The Paris Airports' Authority, which owns CDG, Orly and Le Bourget, plans a third runway at CDG and a third terminal. Another terminal opened at Orly last year, raising capacity by 10m passengers a year. Schiphol, Amsterdam, is a European hub already attracting many UK travellers who find it a more convenient inter-line airport than Heathrow. Its expansion programme will provide for 34m passengers a year by 2000 and 40m (plus 5m rail passengers) by 2015. A fifth runway is planned. These are the main developments at Heathrow's direct competitors but virtually every other airport in Europe is undergoing modernisation to meet the anticipated doubling of traffic by the early years of the next century. At Heathrow, the Pounds 70m Flight Connection Centre in the Central Terminal Area, designed for inter-lining passengers, opens next month. The Pounds 300m London (Paddington) to Heathrow rail link is due to open in 1997. Although still regarded by some as a 'holiday' airport, Gatwick is a scheduled services hub serving more than 100 destinations. Elsewhere in the UK, Manchester is planning a second runway, while a planning inquiry has begun into the development of Filton, near Bristol, as a substantial regional airport for the south-west of England. The Dollars 22bn that ACI Europe estimates its 261 member airports in 43 countries will be spending between 1993 and 1997 on facilities, is likely to go mostly on terminals and runways within existing airport boundaries. The number of airports planned on greenfield sites is small - at Athens-Spata and Berlin-Brandenburg, for example - largely because of lack of space and environmental constraints of governments. Progress since 1990 in improving and expanding airports and harmonising air traffic control facilities appears to have reduced traffic delays, leading to a downward revision in the forecast cost penalties of congestion from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 6bn a year by 2000. But delays are still 'unacceptably high', according to John Meredith, the Air Transport Action Group's executive director, who adds that 'governments must continue to make major investments in the aviation infrastructure if Europe is going to realise the economic benefits its air transport industry can bring'. There remains the question of how far the development of advanced high-speed rail transport throughout Europe, and especially the Channel Tunnel, will affect short-haul air transport and the hub airports. There is concern in the air transport industry that the emphasis being placed by the EU on developing 'inter-modality' between airports and high-speed rail services could divert attention from the need for direct investment in airports and ATC facilities. The tunnel seems certain to divert a significant volume of traffic from the airlines, especially if fares remain competitive. Whether any of those passengers will be inter-lining between rail and air is uncertain. The Paddington - Heathrow rail link will help ease UK transfers, but a Channel Tunnel link built into Heathrow would be beneficial.</p>

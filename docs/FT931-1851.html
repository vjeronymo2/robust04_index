			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Howard asks for toxic cargo ban MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, has asked his German counterpart, Mr Klaus Topfer, to prevent a shipment of German hazardous waste being imported into the UK. The cargo, believed to involve 1,000 tonnes of waste, is due to be shipped from a Hamburg plant owned by Boehringer-Ingelheim, the German group, to a high-temperature incinerator in Pontypool. Under existing legislation the UK is not able to prevent the waste entering the country. In May next year the international export of toxic waste from developed countries is due to be stopped. Mr Topfer has said he will look into the matter. Earlier this year he agreed to re-import about 420 tonnes of German toxic waste from Romania. The material, which included chemicals, pesticides, paints and varnishes, was illegally exported to Romania from both east and west Germany. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the trade in toxic waste and about the latest consignment in particular. Mr Smith said that in December last year Mr David Maclean, the environment minister, said the government intended to end the import of toxic waste into the UK from developed countries. 'Even if ministers have no legal power at the moment to prohibit the importation of this particular consignment, they should be flexing every political muscle they have to stop it coming in,' he added.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Turmoil eases as holiday calm settles on the market FOLLOWING the turmoil of last week's bond markets, calm descended on the primary Eurobond market yesterday as holidays throughout much of continental Europe precluded much activity. The focus for the rest of the week is expected to fall on the US and Canadian dollar markets, where sentiment has benefited from the poor performance of most European bond markets following last week's rejection of the Maastricht treaty by Denmark. Among European markets, the D-Mark and Swiss franc sectors are looking in good shape. Ontario Hydro's global bond offering, arranged by Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Nomura and Wood Gundy, is likely to be launched later today. The underwriting syndicate was assembled yesterday, and the maturity of the transaction was set at 10 years. Initial soundings of investors point to a size of more than Dollars 2bn, according to banks close to the transaction. The offering may be added to Ontario's existing 10-year global bonds, or structured as a separate deal. In either case, the launch spread over the Canadian government yield curve is expected to be close to the 68 basis point spread quoted yesterday on Ontario-Hydro's outstanding 8 5/8 per cent global bonds due 2002. In the dollar sector, the Asian Development Bank has mandated Goldman Sachs to arrange a Dollars 500m 10-year deal. The bonds, which are expected to be launched in the next week or so, are likely to be priced to yield 30 to 32 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury, according to dealers. Such a level is comparable with the current spreads of deals for Japan's Export-Import Bank and Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises (JFM). Goldman declined to comment on the timing and pricing of the transaction. Despite the absence of continental European investors, the decline of Ecu bond prices continued. The French government's 10-year Ecu OAT fell  3/4 point to close at 96.80. Bonds issued by Statni Banka, the Czechoslovakian central bank, wavered slightly in the secondary market following gains made by Slovakian nationalists in elections, writes Simon London. The result was seen as increasing the chances of a split between the Czech and Slovak republics or the development of a looser federation. Statni Banka bonds were yesterday quoted at a yield spread of 300 basis points over US Treasuries, from 285 basis points before the elections. However, Nomura International, which lead-managed the Dollars 200m issue in November last year, reported very little selling. The covenants of the issue make it an event of default if Statni Banca ceases to be the central bank of either republic. REPSOL, the Spanish oil, gas and chemicals group, has again extended its convertible bond issue. Initially set at Pta25bn, it was first extended to Pta50bn and is now going up to Pta80bn, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. The bonds were priced at Pta10,000 and investors were limited to buying a maximum of 800 for Pta8m. Bondholders can convert into shares in late September. Should they do so, the state's shareholding in Repsol will be reduced, at current share prices, by some 10 per cent to around 54 per cent. Repsol is also planning to make an international placement of shares for institutional investors after the September bond conversion.</p>

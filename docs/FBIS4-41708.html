			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivan Rybkin, State Duma chairman, told journalists  in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky that the country's regions had to be  given more leeway and that the Duma would do just that in  discussing the 1995 budget. He thought that the Russian Far  East could solve its problems without federal subsidies.    Rybkin currently heads a group of parliamentarians touring  Siberia and the Far East.    Asked about the proposal, made by Vladimir Shumeyko,  chairman  of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian  parliament, that elections to the the Federal Assembly be put  off, Rybkin emphasized that parliament had to earn this honor  and that two-thirds of the country's regions and republics had  to endorse this step.    He admitted that people were obviously tired of elections  but  said that the logic of life as well as the Constitution were  against this step.</p>

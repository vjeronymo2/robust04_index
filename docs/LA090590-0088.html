			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Johnson &amp; Johnson Sues Bristol-Myers: In a lawsuit filed in federal court  in New York, the New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical giant charged that  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s ad campaign that claims aspirin-free Excedrin is a  better pain reliever than Johnson &amp; Johnson's extra-strength Tylenol were  false. Because both drugs contain the same dose of the pain reliever  acetaminophen, the products are equivalent pain relievers, said Robert Kniffin,  Johnson &amp; Johnson's director of public relations. Bristol-Myers officials  could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

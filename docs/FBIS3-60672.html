			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said  there will be no roll back of our peaceful nuclear program.  Talking informally to journalists in Islamabad today, she  answered a number of questions, including those on the nuclear  issue and the Pakistan- American relations.    [Begin Bhutto recording] With the United States, we have  also started a two-way dialogue to see how the two countries can  overcome the problem that has arisen in their relationship. We  cannot roll back [the nuclear program] and this is the position  we have tried to explain to the United States that we cannot  roll back. At the same time, we have explained to the United  States that we support nonproliferation and we seek to have a  peaceful nuclear program and so long as there is no threat to  our security, our program will continue to be peaceful.    We feel that the Pressler Amendment is unjustified because  it  is not only discriminatory, but it does not serve the purpose of  regional nonproliferation. In fact, it is a veto in Indian  hands.    So, we are trying to pull Pakistan out of international  isolation. We are trying to put Kashmir in its proper  perspective and we are trying to put the Pressler Amendment in  its proper perspective. Obviously, this is not liked by the  opposition because our achievements only highlight their  failure, and, so, they are kicking up a big dust about a  non-issue. [end recording]</p>

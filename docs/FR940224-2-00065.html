			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the daylight overdraft penalty rate adopted by the Board will not be linked to the overnight penalty rate, but rather to the regular daylight rate applicable to depository institutions. The daylight penalty rate will be computed using the regular daylight rate plus a penalty add-on of 100 basis points, which is more proportional to the regular daylight rate. This policy will allow the Board to maintain a relatively high overnight rate that will provide a strong incentive to avoid overnight overdrafts, while maintaining a relatively low daylight penalty rate that will be less of a cost burden on affected institutions yet high enough to effect behavioral changes by institutions to avoid daylight overdrafts altogether. The Board may consider raising the penalty rate if such behavioral changes do not occur. Also, if an intraday market rate were to develop in the future, the Board may base the daylight penalty on that rate. The daylight penalty rate will be adjusted to account for the length of the Fedwire operating day (multiplied by 10/24, given the current 10-hour Fedwire day), as is the regular daylight overdraft rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A bank trade association recognized the Board's intent to prevent institutions that do not have regular discount window access from obtaining credit from the Federal Reserve, but stated that a penalty-oriented approach could result in risk-shifting from the Federal Reserve to the private sector, rather than reducing overall payment system risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the penalty fee is to induce institutions to manage their accounts so as to avoid overdrafts, this reducing overall risk. The Board recognizes, however, that some risk-shifting would occur if institutions affected by the penalty fee move their payments business from the Federal Reserve to the private sector. Presumably, however, the risk would be shifted to depository institutions that have discount window access and thus could obtain Federal Reserve credit to cover daylight or overnight overdrafts in their Federal Reserve accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several corporate credit union commenters stated that the proposed penalty fee formula unfairly penalizes corporate credit unions by not allowing a deductible. The commenters noted that the Board's stated purpose of the deductible for depository institutions was to refrain from charging a large number of institutions who present small amount of risk and that this reasoning should also apply to corporate credit unions. One commenter suggested that, as an alternative to a deductible, the Board allow a one-hour grace period before assessing a penalty fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board established a deductible for the regular daylight overdraft fee to account for Reserve Bank error and computer downtime. The deductible also provides a minimal amount of free intraday credit to depository institutions. The Board does not believe that it is appropriate to supply free intraday credit to institutions that do not have discount window access, and thus has not provided a deductible or grace period for the daylight penalty fee. Reserve Banks will be able to waive penalty fees that result from Reserve Bank error or computer malfunction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that no penalty fee be imposed until the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities system is redesigned to allow receiver control of securities deliveries. These commenters stated that the current system's design forces unanticipated daylight overdrafts and that the penalty fee punishes certain institutions for a shortfall in the Federal Reserve's book-entry securities transfer system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although institutions that receive securities versus payment over Fedwire do not have operational control over the timing of the transaction, they often know the approximate size and time of incoming securities deliveries. The Board believes it is appropriate to require institutions without access to Federal Reserve credit to manage their account so as to avoid securities-related overdrafts. The Federal Reserve is currently studying new service capabilities that would permit receivers of securities to control the use of securities-related intraday Federal Reserve credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An Edge corporation requested that, if a penalty fee is imposed, the Board clarify that an Edge corporation could pledge collateral to support regular discount window borrowing similar to the policy allowing bankers' banks to voluntarily maintain reserves, thereby allowing such Edge corporations to pay only the regular daylight overdraft fee rather than the penalty fee. This commenter also suggested that the Board should allow a parent bank to guarantee the daylight overdraft position of, or substitute itself for, an Edge corporation, similar to practice under CHIPS rules. This practice would allow a Reserve Bank to combine the daylight position of an Edge corporation and its parent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

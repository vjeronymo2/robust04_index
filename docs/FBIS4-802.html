			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rukira Commune, Kibungo Prefecture, the  combatants of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have just freed  600 people. There were previously 800 of them who were detained  after the death of President Habyarimana. Elements of the  Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe [Republican National  Movement for Democracy and Development militia] threw grenades  into the area which killed some people, while others died of  hunger. The 600 surviving people, just like the 2,000 survivors  of (Mugambazi) Commune, were evacuated to the area controlled by  the RPF where they are safe. However, the survivors are  destitute and need assistance from humanitarian organizations.</p>

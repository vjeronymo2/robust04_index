			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Personal View: Fossil fuel levy fails efficiency test The long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry white paper on coal reaffirms 'the government's aim of a market-based policy for energy', with a preference for taxes and subsidies rather than directives and prohibitions. Given that national security has already been achieved by the current diversity of fuel supply, generators should be free to buy in the cheapest market. British coal must compete with imports, and will need a transitional subsidy until the industry is privatised. The government's stated objective of bringing efficiency in energy policy makes sense, but there is one area in which it has failed by its own standard. Efficiency requires sensible taxes as well as competitive markets, and the fossil fuel levy (FFL) fails that test. A report by the Trade and Industry select committee calculated that the FFL would eventually collect Pounds 9.1bn, primarily to meet the inherited liabilities of Nuclear Electric (including reprocessing, radioactive waste management and decommissioning), estimated at Pounds 9.3bn. It recommended that both the liabilities and the FFL income be transferred from Nuclear Electric's accounts. Both the coal review and the select committee agreed that existing nuclear power stations should continue to operate, so the FFL will in effect pay for past mistakes, not current operations. If the FFL is needed only to pay for past mistakes, how should the revenue be collected? A good tax would fall on final consumers, as taxes on producers involve additional costs, because consumer prices are not only raised (as with any tax), but the tax also distorts production decisions, which further raises costs. If ICI was forced to close its chlorine plant because the FFL increases electricity prices, that would be an additional cost that could have been avoided if the tax had fallen only on final consumers, as value-added tax would. The obvious solution is to replace the FFL with VAT on electricity. The FFL currently raises about Pounds 1.3bn a year, while the value of domestic electricity consumption is roughly Pounds 7.6bn. VAT on electricity would raise Pounds 1.33bn, almost the same as the FFL. Replacing the FFL (10 per cent) by VAT (17 1/2 per cent) would raise the domestic electricity price by about 6 per cent, but this would be returned in the form of lower prices or higher profits from goods produced with electricity. VAT could be extended to other domestic fuels to avoid a bias against electricity, giving the government about Pounds 1bn extra revenue. In the Budget, the Treasury accepted the logic of VAT on electricity, but made it additional to the FFL, rather than replacing it. Holly Sutherland of Cambridge University's Department of Applied Economics has shown that increases in domestic electricity prices have very adverse effects on the poor. Double taxation of VAT and FFL is particularly harmful. There would be two immediate benefits from changing to VAT, correcting two shortcomings of the white paper. First, Electricite de France (EdF) exports 'non-leviable' electricity to Britain through the cross-Channel link, meaning that the levy collected is paid to EdF. These payments were Pounds 95m in 1991-92. The select committee wished to stop them, but the government believes that may be illegal. It makes no sense to pay France Pounds 95m a year just to finance past British mistakes. If it is illegal to remove the non-leviable status, the problem can be avoided by abolishing the FFL, and moving Nuclear Electric's liabilities to the Treasury. Second, the select committee suggested that larger users pay a lower and decreasing percentage of the FFL. The government accepts that certain large UK electricity users may be at a competitive disadvantage compared with their foreign counterparts, but responded with the fallacious argument that it would not be right to oblige smaller consumers to subsidise large users. The FFL is not a cost, only a device to recover revenue. It is good practice to exempt all producers, not just large producers, from such taxes. VAT automatically does that, and goes some way to removing an avoidable distortion in the electricity market. Doubtless other distortions remain, of which the most important is that created by the market power of the two large generators. The high costs of the pool and the misallocation of the costs of security of grid supply to large users make matters worse. These at least are subject to review, while the design of the tax system is completely under government control, and should be addressed urgently.

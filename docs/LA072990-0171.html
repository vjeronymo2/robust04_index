			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYOUT POSED PROBLEMS AT JOSEPHSON INTERNATIONAL  </P> <P> Facing losses from his Herzfeld &amp; Stern brokerage unit -- and discontent  among ICM agents, who felt that their profits were paying for the parent's  missteps -- Marvin Josephson began selling non-agency businesses in 1985. Three  years later, he and top managers tried to buy out Josephson International for a  package of cash and debt that they valued at $13.50 a share, only to have  outside directors reject the bid after several shareholders filed suit.  </P> <P> Eventually, the group paid $14.52 cash per share in a complex deal that split  off the remaining office products unit and gave Josephson 87% voting control of  ICM, while 60% of its equity was marked for distribution to agents.  </P> <P> According to Josephson, about 30 of ICM's 124 agents participate in company  ownership. But the largest portion of stock was sold, at half the price  Josephson paid for it, to ICM Chairman Jeffrey Berg, President James Wiatt and  Co-Chairman Cohn. (While holding a minority of votes, the three can veto new  acquisitions by Josephson. Josephson said he plans eventually to cash out much  of his own stake.)  </P> <P> That arrangement immediately caused problems when Lynn Nesbit, the highly  respected head of ICM's New York book operation, left to join an independent  agency closely allied with Creative Artists Agency because she had been  excluded from the core buyout group. "Lynne felt that a negotiation should have  been not just myself, Jeff, Sam and Jim," Josephson explained. Nesbit declined  to comment.  </P> <P> According to Berg, ICM expects to retire its $60 million in acquisition debt  well before a 1996 deadline. Since going private, however, agency officers have  declined to discuss finances, other than to say business has grown  substantially since 1988, when Josephson International last filed reports with  the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Even the number of clients is apparently a touchy subject. Josephson said the  agency has 3,000 clients, and an annual report three years ago put the client  list at 2,600. But Berg said a realistic count is closer to 2,000, partly  because many musical groups include several members. By comparison, CAA claims  about 600, though some alumni of that agency have put the count closer to 1,400  -- a number that CAA strongly disputes. MICHAEL CIEPLY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 (ITAR-TASS) -- "Historians and  politicians will probably describe the epoch we are living  through, as a period of `minor stagnation'," the NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA writes.    "Apathy and indifference to the present-day developments are  rapidly spreading to growing numbers of Russians. They are  losing respect for any form of power: for the reformer  president, for `tough economically-minded' premier and for  legislators who now know `their place' well.    "What can be expected after the end of the summer interval  in  the Russian political life? According to the most optimistic  forecasts, both politics and economy will gradually sink into a  state of stagnation which can continue for long months.    "The president will pay no attention to permanent  parliamentary wrangles and the government -- to trade union  ultimatums and pickets. If such a situation will stabilise, it  may turn advantageous (due to some reasons) for most political  forces. Nobody will want to take the risk of upsetting the  balance."    The same newspaper writes the following in another article:  "Everyone sees now the vital need for setting up a `flexible'  centre for pooling all social democrats and socialists to  exchange information and for discussions.    "Mikhail Gorbachev's participation would be also desirable  in  such a centre: His name has become a double symbolic borderline  of a kind, dividing the centre-left space from communists, on  the one hand, and from liberals, on the other.    "This structure would become not only a discussion club for  Russian social democrats. It would enable us, at long last, to  participate in the international movement on a regular basis,  including the socialist international, contacts with which  convince Russian politicians that, until Russia has only  disunited parties and groups, nobody will speak with them  seriously."    NEZAVISIMAYA also claims that "head of the president's  office  Sergey Filatov who remained at his post only thanks to a  ballyhoo raised concerning his possible resignation, decided to  prove his worthiness to Boris Yeltsin in the recent past.    "According to Filatov's plan, it is necessary to have a  subdivision (some 120 staffers) in the president's office, which  will launch even now a campaign for a new Russian president  --Boris Yeltsin."    According to information available to the newspaper, many  former legislators of "democratic" orientation received  proposals to join this subdivision. Some of them refused, not  in a very proper form at that.    Referring to a statement by deputy chairman of the state  statistics committee Aris Zakharov, the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  newspaper writes that "industrial production in Russia dropped  by 26 per cent over the past five months.    "While the fall amounted to 12 per cent in the fuel and  energy complex, its figure stood at 22 per cent in the food  industry, 45 in machine-building and 35 per cent in the chemical  and petrochemical industries.    "Every fourth major or medium industrial enterprise in  Russia  stood idle for more than one shift in may. Whereas a shortage  of material resources was the main reason for the drop last  year, difficulties with marketing and the problem of  non-payments were to blame this year."    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA also reports that "former Russian  Prosecutor- General Alexey Kazannik and his supporters from the  Urals-Siberian region are establishing a party of people's  conscience. Its first congress will be held in Yekaterinburg on  Friday.    "Preparatory documents say that the party intends to direct  its efforts at conducting a scientifically substantiated policy  of reforms and forming competent governing structures, including  the government. The party intends to announce right away their  `constructive opposition' to the present authorities of the  country."    The same newspaper runs an interview with Komi Republic  President Yuriy Spiridonov who regards struggle against  bureaucratic omnipotence as his main goal. "Small and big  bureaucrats are our main enemies as well as the enemy of all  Russia," he said.    "The most spectacular projects and initiatives are scrapped  at the level of a bureaucrat. Mr. or Mrs. Smiths often have  powers incomparable with the power of minister or president."    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper informs its readers that  7,948 people fell ill with diphtheria between last January and  April, or 3.5 times more than over the corresponding period last  year. The incidence of the infectious disease in Moscow is two  or four times higher than the country's average.    The same newspaper reports that the last terrorist out of  four who captured hostages at a prison in Yekaterinburg  surrendered to law enforcement officers. All hostages were  freed. One terrorist was killed during the operation, and  another escaped.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that law enforcement bodies  exposed  eight serious crimes over the past 24 hours. According to the  public relations centre of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service (FCS), the Moscow FCS department completed a multi-stage  operation to bust a gun-running mob which supplied the Moscow  region with firearms.    The same newspaper expresses an opinion by chairman of the  Russian Social Democratic Party Anatoliy Golov about former  Vice- President Aleksandr Rutskoy's party. "I'd like to remind  our new colleagues that social democrats are reformers in their  essence rather than revolutionaries," he notes.    "Regrettably, `popular' social democrats are closer, in  spirit, to Pamyat (eds: nationalist organisation). I'm afraid  that they will want to call themselves a national social  democratic party with time."    Despite a refutation from Presidential Press Secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov, the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper,  referring to reliable sources in the Russian Government,  continues to assert that "quarters close to President Boris  Yeltsin decided, in principle, the question of Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin's resignation for health reasons and the  appointment of Yuriy Skokov to this post".    The PRAVDA newspaper features an interview with Dmitriy  Olshanskiy, director of the Strategic Analysis and Forecast  Centre and co-chairman of the Russian Patriotic Movement  "People's Alliance", who says: "People got tired of politics and  stopped treating it seriously.    "The time of rallies has passed. It is time to come to  agreement inside the political elite. Zyuganov's communists  understand this. Indeed, neither Yeltsin, nor Yerin nor still  anybody else stand at the helm of the state but elite  forces--analysts, financiers and politicians--they rule the  roost."    Some 100 enterprises will be offered at voucher auctions in  St. Petersburg till the end of June, including two huge shopping  centres and munitions factories, reports the SANKT-PETERBURGSKIE  VEDOMOSTI newspaper.</p>

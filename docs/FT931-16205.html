			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Halifax says house prices fell by 0.6% last month HOUSE prices remained weak last month, Halifax, Britain's largest building society, said yesterday. Its house price index showed a fall of 0.6 per cent in December, reversing a brief hope of recovery in November when the index rose 0.1 per cent. The figure for December represents a slightly larger drop than the 0.2 per cent fall reported by Nationwide, the second-largest building society, on Wednesday. The Halifax index showed price falls in all months last year apart from June and November. 'The seasonally adjusted fall continues the pattern of house price weakness that has been apparent for much of 1992 and which will probably continue into 1993 before house prices stabilise as housing market activity recovers in the spring,' Halifax said. House prices ended the year 7.8 per cent below 1991 prices. The average cost of a house was Pounds 61,169 last month compared with Pounds 66,330 in December 1991. The fall in prices paid by first-time buyers was even greater. Last month first-time buyers paid an average of Pounds 44,297, a drop of 8.7 per cent on the previous year. Halifax said it expected prices to stabilise this spring with its estate agents reporting a significant increase in demand by prospective buyers to view houses. But it does not expect to see any price increases until the second half of the year, 'leading to a more sustained recovery in 1994'. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday warned against 'panic schemes' to revive the housing market after reports that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was considering cash help for first-time buyers. He said the priority for government funds should be for homes to rent for those 'forced on to the streets through repossession'.</p>

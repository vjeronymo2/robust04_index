			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU threatens to 'walk out' of TUC THE AEU engineering union could leave the Trades Union Congress, Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general secretary, warned yesterday as he revealed that his members and those of the EETPU electricians' union had voted overwhelmingly to merge. Speaking on BBC radio he said the AEU 'may walk out of the TUC front door' if other unions behaved 'stupidly' over terms to readmit the EETPU after a three-year absence. His comments marked the first skirmish in what is likely to be a year of heated negotiations between the TUC and the merged organisation, which will be Britain's second-largest union. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the Nalgo local government union, said the EETPU would have to give up members it had 'poached' from other unions before it could be readmitted to the TUC. Leaders of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union - as the new organisation will be called -  -have said they will not hand over members. In the merger ballots 86.5 per cent of AEU voters and 84.5 per cent of EETPU voters favoured merging. The turnout was 36 per cent among 595,000 engineers and 41 per cent among 349,000 electricians. The merger, to go ahead in May, will have significant implications for industrial relations in manufacturing. It is expected to ease demarcation disputes between craft workers and simplify bargaining. In the next few months the most likely visible effect of the merger will be on the TUC. Leaders of the AEEU have promised members a vote on affiliation within a year. Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary elect, who will take over Mr Laird's role as general secretary in the enlarged union in two years, said yesterday that the TUC would have to demonstrate that the Pounds 1.3m annual affiliation fees were worth it. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, welcomed the merger and said he hoped to conclude talks with the AEEU quickly. One national trade union centre was essential for exerting maximum influence. Outstanding issues include whether the EETPU should pay affiliation fees for its time out of the TUC and whether it should withdraw from the two single-union deals for which it was expelled.

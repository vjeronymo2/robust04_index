			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank Royal Bank of Scotland's interim results ought to be encouraging news for the banking industry as a whole. Bad debt provisions were lower than expected and sharply below the preceding six months. But the trend should not be exaggerated. Royal's provisions tend to be weighted towards the second half of its business year. Those for the six months to March are still 25 per cent ahead of the first half of 1990-91. If that suggests caution about the pace of Royal's recovery, so should its poor underlying profits. Operating income before provisions rose only 4.5 per cent. Admittedly this partly reflects more stringent treatment of non-performing loans, but management appears optimistic in its expectations for overheads and for financial services, which contributed only 16 per cent of first half profits. Last, but not least, is the ominous ring to its warning of a possible claim arising from transactions by a former customer now in liquidation. There are thus grounds for doubt about the real dividend growth which is Royal's traditional attraction. It has plenty of spare capital to pay a higher final this year from reserves if necessary. Indeed, selling Charterhouse would improve ratios further. But the risk might then be that low growth prospects in the UK would set it off on a spree in the US, where Citizens Bank is obviously itching to expand.</p>

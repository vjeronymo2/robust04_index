			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: CAT LANDS ON ITS FEET IN COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE  </P> <P> The eyes of American business are focused these days on Caterpillar Inc. as it  spends billions to automate its factories and tries to stay No. 1 in fiercely  competitive world markets.  </P> <P> Most investment people nod approvingly -- "They're doing the right things," say  analysts. But they also have reservations, recalling that another giant,  General Motors, spent $40 billion on automation in the early 1980s, with  unimpressive results so far.  </P> <P> Right now, Caterpillar's figures are not reassuring. Revenues are increasing  for the Peoria-based maker of construction equipment, but profits are down --  just as management told shareholders they would be -- due partly to costs of  the automation program. So the final verdict on how successful Cat's  reorganization will be must wait until next year, or even later in the '90s.  </P> <P> Why should you care? Because Cat is a very important company -- $11 billion in  sales, the second-largest U.S. exporter (after Boeing), an employer of 42,000  in the United States (and 18,000 overseas) with a ripple effect throughout the  economy.  </P> <P> And because Cat's $2-billion investment and reorganization could set a pattern,  affirming that U.S. companies can compete successfully and encouraging others  to do the same.  </P> <P> Also, in an often disturbing modern business world, Cat can teach you the real  meaning of 50-cent words and concepts such as long-term investment, global  trade and competitiveness.  </P> <P> In a recent speech, Cat Chairman George Schaefer explained succinctly how the  world has changed. Business was a breeze from the end of World War II to 1980,  he said, with something new always coming along to provide a market for Cat's  bulldozers and tractors -- from the rebuilding of Europe to U.S. interstate  highways to development in Asia.  </P> <P> Then it all ended. The recession of the early 1980s coupled with the high value  of the U.S. dollar hurt Cat competitively. Sales fell from $9 billion in 1981  to $5.4 billion in 1983 -- a 40% decline in two years.  </P> <P> The market didn't so much shrink as change. Big projects gave way to smaller,  more diverse operations, often run by small owner-builders. So Cat expanded its  product line. Today it has 300 models of construction machinery compared to 150  before, and a whole new line of light equipment for smaller jobs.  </P> <P> One thing leads to another. That variety in models and customers forced an end  to the way Cat manufactured things. A typical plant at Cat's complex in Peoria  used to go for a week or more making thousands of copies of a single part,  which would be set aside in inventory -- millions of dollars in parts sitting  around -- until the rest of the product could be made and shipped.  </P> <P> That sounds wasteful but in the days when it took a full eight-hour shift to  change machinery on a production line, it was more efficient to do things that  way than to shut down frequently to change tools or models.  </P> <P> Now computer-guided machines do things differently. "You tell the machine to  change tools and instantly it turns out a different model," says a Cat veteran.  So technology allows flexibility, and saves money on inventory. But it also  demands other changes.  </P> <P> If you're responding to diverse customers with instantly flexible  manufacturing, it makes no sense to have people in the field waiting for  decisions from headquarters on pricing or production. So Cat is reorganizing to  give more people more responsibility. "If they succeed, they'll have a very  powerful organization," says an industry expert.  </P> <P> The point is that corporate reorganization, rightly done, does not simply  displace people. It increases their responsibility and productivity. Cat  employs more people today than in 1983 -- and has increased wages and benefits  35% since then. At the same time, it has boosted total sales 105% and sales per  employee 48% to $185,000. Productivity has risen, in other words.  </P> <P> But Cat hasn't let up, hasn't harvested those productivity gains to buy up its  own stock or make acquisitions, as many companies did in the '80s. Instead, it  has used its financial strength to support dealers and increase sales overseas  -- from $2.5 billion in 1983 to $6 billion last year.  </P> <P> As a result, Cat has held its leading share of the world's markets against  stiff competition from Komatsu Ltd., a $6-billion (revenue) Japanese company  that has a joint venture in the United States with Dresser Industries. "Cat  holds 35% of the world market in construction equipment overall, and 50% or  more in larger machines," says analyst Steven Colbert of Prudential Bache  Securities. It even succeeds in Komatsu's home market through a joint venture  with Mitsubishi, called New Caterpillar Mitsubishi, which supplies 70% of the  construction machines for Japan's new Kansai Airport.  </P> <P> So what's left to decide about the reorganization? Whether Cat can make enough  profit to do something for its shareholders. Its stock price, at $66 a share  recently, is only a few dollars higher than it was 10 years ago. And that may  not improve in a hurry: U.S. construction markets are slow, and overseas  markets are weakening; Eastern Europe's great potential for new construction is  still only a promise. "Cat's earnings may fall to $4 a share this year," --  from $4.90 in 1989 -- says analyst Michael Braig of Cleveland's Prescott, Ball  &amp; Turben investment firm.  </P> <P> But Cat, just because it keeps investing to reduce costs, will be able to  operate profitably in bad times -- and benefit tremendously in good. Sometime  in the '90s, say analysts, Cat will earn $10 to $15 a share -- indicating a  stock price that could triple. "If you're managing a large diversified  portfolio, arguably Caterpillar should be at the top of the list," says analyst  Robert McCarthy of Chicago's Duff &amp; Phelps research firm.  </P> <P> Indeed, if American business is looking to Caterpillar for guidance, there's  reason to hope for us all.  </P></p>

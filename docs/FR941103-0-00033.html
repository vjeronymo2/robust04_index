			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two reasons for requiring transmission pricing to meet the traditional revenue requirement. First, it appears that transmission will remain a natural monopoly for the foreseeable future. It is unlikely that market-based prices for monopoly services, especially for firm transmission service, could be justified under the FPA at the present time, under the current industry structure. However, it is clear that there is no single appropriate ratemaking method under the FPA. The end result is the appropriate yardstick against which to measure the legality of a rate order, not the ratemaking method. Thus, although no single ratemaking method is necessarily favored by the FPA, this pricing principle will ensure that transmission users pay a just and reasonable price for transmission services and that transmission owners, while being appropriately and adequately compensated, <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  will not be able to exercise their market power to collect exorbitant rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Duquesne, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  488 U.S. at 316; Bluefield Water Works &amp; Improvement Co. v.

When upgrades are required, the transmission owner may incur significant expenses related to planning and siting new facilities. For example, a utility may be required to pay for environmental mitigation associated with the construction of new transmission facilities. Such costs will be recoverable by the transmission owner if they are prudently incurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under the traditional revenue requirement principle, transmission owners clearly may, with appropriate support, <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  recover the legitimate and verifiable costs of services they provide that are ancillary to transmission services, such as load following, reactive power compensation, and backup power services. However, transmission customers should also be permitted to provide these services themselves or to obtain them from someone else if this is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Northern States Power Company (Minnesota and Wisconsin) Opinion No. 383, 64 FERC &para;61,324 (1993),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> reh'g pending  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (reactive power). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, as discussed in Section IV below, we intend to allow significant latitude and a wide variety of non-traditional rate design proposals, within a cost cap based on the total company revenue requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

The Commission noted that ``[a]n open access tariff that is not unduly discriminatory or anticompetitive should offer third parties access on the same or comparable basis, and under the same or comparable terms and conditions, as the transmission provider's uses of its system.'' <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  This principle has been applied to all open access tariffs filed since  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AEP, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as well as to transmission services provided by RTGs. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 FERC at 61,490. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  PacifiCorp,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> .

In Florida Municipal Power Agency v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., 67 FERC &para;61,167 at 61,482 (1994) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FMPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Commission stated, ``[s]ince FMPA wants to be able to use the transmission system as freely as does Florida Power, it must pay a rate that reflects that equality.'' As a result of the relationship between quality of service and price discussed most recently in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FMPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the growing importance of service comparability, we will require that pricing be comparable. Comparability of service applies to price as well as to terms and conditions. Comparability of transmission pricing involves a ``golden rule of pricing''_a transmission owner should charge itself on the same or comparable basis that it charges others for the same service. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> There is a similar ``golden rule or access''_provide the same or comparable services to others as you provide yourself.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

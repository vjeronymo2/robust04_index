			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Yielding to second thoughts FT-SE Index: 2,510.4 (-14.9) The London market's confidence in recovery is apparently not quite so robust after all. Last week's star performers were high-yielding recovery stocks. This week the process was reversed, as a result of nothing more significant than a dividend cut from Lonrho, a medium-sized and notoriously eccentric conglomerate. Yesterday the FT-SE fell by just 0.6 per cent. The 10 highest yielders in the index, Lonrho excepted, fell by an average 2.4 per cent. And yet nothing much in the general background has changed. Sterling is out of immediate danger at some 9 pfennigs above its D-Mark floor. Wall Street and Tokyo have been plunging around aimlessly, but both ended only modestly down on the week. The outcome of the German wage round and the Bundesbank's reaction to it remain anybody's guess. The UK consumer remains in hiding, despite the fact that real income in aggregate - that is, allowing for unemployment - is probably up slightly on a year ago. The prospect of a March 10 budget is neither here or there. The best way for the government to stimulate the consumer would be to get the election out of the way. All the while, London's preoccupation with Wall Street looks ever more of an anachronism. As the chart shows, the correlation between the two markets breaks down in the face of broad economic change, as in the 1980s. The ERM represents the biggest change yet. To appreciate how big, it is only necessary to ask what the effect would be on the London market if base rates went to 3.5 per cent and sterling were sharply devalued. These are the conditions being enjoyed by US equities: and even so, it appears, Wall Street finds it hard to make further headway.</p>

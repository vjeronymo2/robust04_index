			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Major and Clarke head off rightwing tax revolt: Chancellor hints at VAT rise A THREATENED revolt on tax and spending by rightwing cabinet ministers was stopped in its tracks yesterday by a combined broadside from Mr John Major, prime minister, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Clarke also hinted strongly that an increase in the rate or scope of value added tax was likely in the November Budget. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Clarke insisted that all taxation options remained open, rejected speculation that the government deficit might be lower than the Treasury forecast of Pounds 50bn, and ruled out any further discussion of the cabinet's agreed public spending total of Pounds 254bn. Mr Major signalled his intention to end last year's Conservative drift and disunity by launching a scathing attack on rightwing dissidents and pledging tough long-term action to control public spending. In an article written for evening newspapers, Mr Major gave the clearest signal yet that spending on health and social security would be cut in the long term. 'We need to look at the long-term difficulties in funding social expenditure  -now outstripping inflation by some 3 per cent a year. That can't go on.' Mr Major's tough approach to long-term spending pressures, combined with the chancellor's uncompromising stand, cuts the ground from underneath the rightwing cabinet minority. The right, led by Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, claims tax rises this year could be avoided by more spending cuts and faster-than-expected economic growth, which would raise government revenues. A showdown was expected at the political cabinet - held without officials - to follow today's cabinet, the first for six weeks. But the right may choose to withdraw in the face of certain defeat. The prime minister's hopes of an autumn recovery in government popularity were boosted by an unexpectedly warm response from party activists during a tour of the West Country. Local officials said he blamed the Tory Eurosceptic wing for much of the disunity which has dogged the party since the 1992 general election. 'He was very vehement indeed on the 20 or so dissident MPs,' said one official. 'He said this effectively reduces his majority to five.' Mr Major's helicopter trip to the south-west was ridiculed by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who claimed it reflected Conservative 'panic' about the party's declining support in the area. But local Tory officials said Mr Major encountered little of the bitterness that has emerged in the region since July, when the Liberal Democrats overturned a Tory majority of more than 30,000 in a by-election victory. Mr Major held private meetings with several hundred constituency chairmen and officials at secret locations in Wiltshire, Somerset and Hampshire. Local Tories, worried by the party's loss of support to the Liberal Democrats over such issues as VAT on fuel and high water charges, were enthusiastic about his performance.

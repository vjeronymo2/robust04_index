			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Air NZ chief executive resigns MR JIM Scott, Air New Zealand's chief executive, has resigned, apparently over differences with the airline's controlling shareholder, Brierley Investments, which is believed to be strengthening its control. This follows the announcement that Mr Bob Matthew, former BIL New Zealand chief executive, has stepped down to concentrate his energies on the airline, the position widely seen as making him the airline's executive chairman. At the same time, several key Air New Zealand appointments have been filled by the former executives of another BIL subsidiary, Magnum Corporation, a company formerly run by Mr Matthew. There were also differences in style and personality between Mr Scott and BIL executives. Mr Scott wanted to concentrate on strategic long-term growth for the company and New Zealand tourism: BIL seemed more concerned with improving retail earnings. On several occasions statements from Mr Scott on such areas as manning and expansion, appeared to clash with those of Mr Matthew. Mr Scott's background was as a senior executive and specialist in forestry with Carter Holt. He is being replaced in an acting capacity by the deputy chief executive, Mr Jim McCrea, a long-serving employee who has considerable standing with BIL executives for his skill at negotiating the purchase of new aircraft at favourable rates. A statement from Mr Matthew said he accepted Mr Scott's resignation with regret, saying he had played a leading role in the changes since the airline was privatised.</p>

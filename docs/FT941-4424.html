			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / London Transport is snubbed over new head The government yesterday delivered an unexpected snub to London Transport when it apparently blocked the promotion of Mr Alan Watkins, LT's deputy chairman and chief executive, to the post of chairman. Mr Watkins, who joined LT 18 months ago after 30 years in the private sector, was widely expected to succeed Sir Wilfred Newton, who steps down tomorrow. But London Transport said that Sir Wilfred would stay on temporarily while Mr Watkins would resign. Sir Wilfred took the unusual step of announcing his deep regret that Mr Watkins would not be taking over has his successor. Neither side was prepared to confirm the reasons for the government's decision although it was believed to be the result of London Transport's sharply-worded criticisms in recent months of cuts in government spending. London Underground, of which Mr Watkins is chairman, has been particularly strong in its condemnation. The Department of Transport said that it had held talks with a successful candidate for the chairmanship but that this person had later decided not to take up the position. Mr Watkins subsequently decided that he would withdraw from the list of candidates. Mr Watkins said: 'Any chairman of London Transport needs the unequivocal support of all those in government with whom he has to do business. Because in my case this has not been forthcoming, I have reluctantly decided to withdraw as a possible candidate for chairmanship and am discussing with the Department of Transport the terms of my departure.' In his statement expressing regret that Mr Watkins was not to succeed him, Sir Wilfred said: 'I cannot pay a high enough tribute to the contribution that he has made as deputy chairman and I am personally sure that his tireless efforts would have been invaluable to London in the future.' Sir Wilfred, who became chairman five years ago, is to spend three days a week on London Transport business. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said that Mr Watkins was 'an intelligent man who says what he thinks rather than what the government wants to hear and consequently they don't want him'. Mr Watkins, who is 55, spent 26 years in different parts of the Lucas electrical and engineering group, finishing as managing director of its aerospace division. He then went to Hawker Siddeley Group before it was acquired by BTR.</p>

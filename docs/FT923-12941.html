			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: World International improves WORLD International, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong Pao's listed corporate empire, announced a 5 per cent increase in profits which totalled HKDollars 976.5m (USDollars 126.3m) after tax and minority interests for the year to March 1992. This included only a nine-month contribution from 44 per cent-owned associate Wharf Holdings, the largest group company, which changed its accounting year-end from March to December. With an annualised contribution from Wharf, the parent company would have registered a 24 per cent rise in profit. Group earnings were boosted by a strong performance from Hongkong Realty and Trust, the property development company, which announced its profits had increased by 104 per cent to HKDollars 586m. Retailing contributions remained weak, with luxury store operator Lane Crawford showing only marginal growth, due to the impact of the Gulf war and to increased competition from Japanese department stores and other luxury boutiques in Hong Kong. The outlook for World is positive for the current year. Growth is expected to come from the sale of its Parc Oasis property development and from an improving retail environment. Wharf also is expected to increase substantially its property portfolio, and it will make a full-year contribution to earnings. World has focused on the potential for growth of the Pearl River delta. Mr Peter Woo, chairman, said that the company had purchased a 99,000 sq ft site in central Guangzhou (Canton) for a joint venture residential and commercial development. The company is looking at a number of other property developments across the Chinese border. Earnings per share increased to 47.7 cents from 45.3 cents and the directors recommended a 17 per cent increase in the dividend pay-out to 24.5 cents per share, up from 21 cents.</p>

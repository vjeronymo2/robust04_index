			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (13): Long-term goals show commitment - Atlas Hydraulic Loaders / Thanks to its German parent, the Scottish subsidiary of Atlas is still able to invest on upgrading its plants IN THE corner of the Atlas Hydraulic Loaders factory in Blackwood, Lanarkshire is a group of elderly machine tools painted in the dull green that seemed to be obligatory for such production equipment in the 1960s and 1970s. The equipment is due to be replaced soon, says Mr James Hanshaw, managing director, as part of a remarkable Pounds 10m investment programme at AHL's two Scottish plants - the other is 10 minutes away at Hamilton. Remarkable because the UK construction industry has been going through its worst-ever recession over the past three years, and is only now showing signs of recovery. AHL has not escaped the effects of the recession - it lost money in 1989, 1990 and 1991 - but it is in the fortunate position of being a subsidiary of a family-owned German company, Atlas Weyhausen. 'The German objectives are different. So for us it is different from being part of a publicly-owned company,' says Mr Hanshaw. Profits are important, naturally, but long-term objectives are not hampered by short-term fluctuations in financial performance or by excessively restrictive targets for return on investment. The Scottish plants are the German company's only foreign manufacturing units and AHL is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. It began producing excavators, but from 1970 to 1990 concentrated on truck-mounted cranes - it is one of two companies that dominate the UK market. From 1990 it began producing all Atlas' mini-excavators as well. 'The parent company did not have to locate its mini-excavator production here,' says Mr Hanshaw. 'It was a sign of their commitment to us.' But there had been little significant investment at AHL's plants during the 1980s and production methods had slipped behind the standards in Atlas' German plants. With AHL's sales rising - from just Pounds 5m in 1980 to nearly Pounds 27m last year - and the company becoming an increasingly important part of its parent's manufacturing strategy, it was decided in 1991 that the two plants needed upgrading, and that top management needed to be revitalised. Mr Hanshaw joined the company in late 1991 and since then has developed the investment programme, the major parts of which will be completed by the middle of next year. 'It's not unusual for Atlas to use a recession as a breathing space to implement this kind of investment,' he says. Mr Hanshaw and Mr Mark Spielvogel, AHL's production manager, have turned things upside down at the two plants. AHL had been building truck-mounted cranes at both sites, but is now concentrating all the basic metal cutting and welding at Blackwood. Hamilton has become an assembly plant for the cranes and the mini-excavators and AHL has also purchased 25,000 sq ft of extra space adjoining the plant for potential expansion. Both factories are being refurbished and re-equipped. At Blackwood, there is a new paint shop for handling the water-based paints that are becoming increasingly important in Europe because of environmental legislation. New machine tools including a large Dutch-made machining centre have either been introduced or are on the way. Welding equipment has been modernised and robot welding may be introduced in a later part of the plan. Mr Hanshaw say the aim of the investment programme is not so much to increase efficiency as to improve quality - and hence raise sales and profits in an industry whose customers are increasingly quality-conscious. The investment programme, for example, includes a Pounds 160,000shot-blasting machine, which cleans and smoothes welded and pre-welded parts before painting. AHL, unlike many competitors, did not have a shot-blasting machine previously - although some parts were sent out for shotblasting - and the new equipment will help produce a much better paint finish and cut down on welding rework. The financial effects of the investment programme are hard to separate from AHL's overall performance because of the change in the company's circumstances over the past three years. The UK may have been in a recession, but the reunification of Germany has enabled the parent company to double in size to annual sales of DM820m, sucking in equipment from the Scottish plants. The Hamilton plant will be producing 1,000 mini-excavators this year, up from 400 last year, and AHL's overall pre-tax profit will exceed Pounds 1m this year on some Pounds 35m of sales, more than double the Pounds 500,000 profit for 1992, says Mr Hanshaw. But the investment programme is clearly very important in safeguarding AHL's future, and that of its 320 employees, as a real manufacturing company - 'this is no screwdriver operation,' says Mr Hanshaw - and in enabling it to handle new products such as an extra mini-excavator model later this year. In the current climate, very few similarly-sized British engineering companies could have financed such a programme virtually entirely out of their own resources. But AHL does not pay dividends to its German parent, so is able to plough money back into the company. The pay-back on the programme will average three years, a relatively relaxed timetable by UK standards. And Mr Hanshaw is keen to point out that not all the investment spending went on foreign equipment. AHL will buy British where it can, he says, - such as a new CNC tube-bending machine from Preston-based Addison Tube Forming - - but that is not always possible. 'We are looking for a big CNC shearing machine,' he says. 'But we can't find that here.'</p>

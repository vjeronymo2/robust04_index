			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DISMISSES STATE FROM LINCOLN SUIT  </P> <P> An Orange County judge has dismissed California from the $250-million lawsuit  filed by small investors in Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent firm, but he  gave investors time to file a new complaint against the state.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David G. Sills, in an order released Tuesday, decided that  the investors who filed the class-action suit after the S&amp;L's collapse in  April didn't have enough factual allegations to get around the state's claim  that it is immune from such suits.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the investors have until Jan. 26 to file an amended complaint.  </P> <P> "At the time the suit was filed, we didn't have the facts that we have  developed since," said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.  "We didn't know then the extent of knowledge that the Department of  Corporations had."  </P> <P> The suit claims the state agency abused its discretion by approving for sale  debt securities in Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix.  About $200 million in securities were sold at Lincoln's 29 Southern California  branches to nearly 22,000 small investors, many of them elderly customers who  mistakenly believed their investments were insured.  </P> <P> The new complaint to be filed, Rus said, will contain allegations that the  state agency had investigated American Continental's financial condition,  concluding that it could not repay the debt but approving the sale of the debt  issue anyway.  </P> <P> The agency has said previously that it relied on a clean bill of health that  independent auditors gave American Continental and that no state or federal  S&amp;L regulators had taken any action against Lincoln by the time the debt  issue was approved in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Leonard Pape, a deputy attorney general representing the Corporations  Department, said that once the amended suit is filed, he will probably ask the  court again to dismiss it without an opportunity for amending the complaint  further.  </P> <P> Other defendants in the suit include the former operators of Lincoln and the  lawyers and accountants who advised those operators.  </P> <P> Rus said the immunity issue is a difficult one primarily because there are few  state Supreme Court decisions that discuss it. The issue in the investors' suit  may well go to the state's high court, he said.  </P> <P> Lincoln's collapse is expected to become the nation's biggest bailout, costing  taxpayers an estimated $2 billion.  </P></p>

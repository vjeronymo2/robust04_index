			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN;  </P> <P> MURPHY RESTORES BASEBALL AT NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> The once moribund Notre Dame baseball program has been a regular member of the  Collegiate Baseball Top 30 poll this season under Pat Murphy, who is in his  second season as coach after spending two seasons at Claremont-Mudd.  </P> <P> "Everybody is jazzed up about baseball," said Murphy, whose team is ranked 27th  this week with a 24-6 record.  </P> <P> Murphy, 30, might not make anyone forget Knute Rockne, or Lou Holtz for that  matter, but he already has achieved several notable milestones -- including the  signing of pitcher Pat Leahy, the grandson of Notre Dame football coaching  legend Frank Leahy.  </P> <P> Murphy, who in 1986 led Claremont-Mudd to its first Southern California  Interscholastic Athletic Conference championship in 11 years, inherited a team  that was 15-29 in 1987 and engineered a 39-22 finish last season.  </P> <P> Last October, Murphy arranged for the Miami baseball team to accompany its  football team to South Bend for what Murphy promoted as, "The Battle before the  War."  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish swept a two-game exhibition series and then proved it was no  fluke by defeating the 14th-ranked Hurricanes, 4-2, in Miami last month.  Tentative plans have been made for the USC baseball team to accompany the  Trojan football team to South Bend in the fall.  </P> <P> Notre Dame also has a 12-9 road win over 10th-ranked Texas to its credit.  </P> <P> Murphy said the Notre Dame tradition will aid him in recruiting despite the  built-in handicaps of the school's rigorous academic entrance requirements and  funding for only four scholarships.  </P> <P> "We're recruiting 365 days a year in all 50 states," Murphy said. "Don't tell  me I can't come to Los Angeles and get a top kid because I'm going to do it.  You watch."  </P> <P> Sweet stuff: Pat Sweet said he elected to attend Texas A&amp;M over Cal State  Long Beach and Pepperdine because he wanted to "get away and try something  different."  </P> <P> Other than the weather in College Station, Tex., and his own musical tastes,  not much has changed for Sweet, a junior left-hander from South Gate who was  19-4 with a 3.39 earned-run average in two seasons at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Sweet is 7-1 with a 2.95 ERA for Texas A&amp;M (40-1), which is ranked No. 1 in  the nation for the seventh straight week.  </P> <P> "The humidity gets terrible sometimes down here," Sweet said. "The first time I  threw here it was like pitching in a steam room.  </P> <P> "I'm also into country music now. I used to like new wave bands like Depeche  Mode and Erasure. But the only thing my roommates play is George Strait and now  I'm hooked on it."  </P> <P> This weekend Texas A&amp;M plays host to Texas, which has won or shared 10  consecutive Southwest Conference titles.  </P> <P> Strikeout king: Rick Davis never really considered himself a full-time pitcher  until he struck out 11 batters in Cal State Dominguez Hills' season-opening win  over Arizona in Tucson.  </P> <P> "It kind of opened my eyes," said Davis, a senior right-hander who played  shortstop last season. "At that point I was still thinking about shortstop . .  . The next thing I know, I would never see the field again."  </P> <P> Good thing for Davis, who batted .220 and committed 27 errors last season. But  bad news for opposing hitters who have been unable to handle Davis' knuckle  curve.  </P> <P> Davis, who went to Upland High and transferred to Dominguez Hills from Mt. San  Antonio College, leads the nation in strikeouts with 126 in 104 innings. He is  5-4 with a 2.84 ERA and has allowed 74 hits and 47 walks.  </P> <P> Have a nice weekend: During Cal State Fullerton's three-game Big West  Conference series at UC Santa Barbara last weekend, Fullerton first baseman  David Staton got 10 consecutive hits, which tied the school record shared by  Brent Mayne and Tom Thomas. Staton's hit parade included five home runs, two  doubles and 14 runs batted in.  </P> <P> "I wasn't looking for any particular pitch," said Staton, a junior from Tustin  who is batting .364 with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs. "Anything that came up  there, I hit. It's that type of situation where it didn't matter what they  threw.  </P> <P> "Every time I came up in the box I knew I was going to do it. You can't explain  it while you're going through it."  </P> <P> College Baseball Notes  </P> <P> Wednesday was the first day high school and junior college players could sign  letters of intent.

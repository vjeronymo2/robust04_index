			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leslaw Farner, representative of the </F> Economic Information Agency (AIG) in Szczecin, by Pawel  Winiarski; place and date not given; from pages 1 and 5 of the  Business section]    [Text] [Winiarski] The legal situation of firms providing  services as so-called economic intelligence agencies is rather  unclear. Where does economic information end and spying begin?    [Farner] Indeed, the legal status of economic intelligence  agencies in Poland is not specified in definitive detail.  However, this is also the consequence of the fact that many  other things in our economy have not been properly legally  defined. Economic intelligence agencies are not particularly  loved anywhere in the world, but their role in the stabilization  of the economy is nonetheless appreciated. Their existence  minimizes the risk inherent in all economic initiatives that  require cooperation with one, several, or even more contractors  or subcontractors. Economic intelligence agencies make it their  business to gather generally accessible information about such  firms and to analyze their findings. Their conclusions can  provide a basis for deciding whether to enter into cooperation  or terminate negotiations.    [Winiarski] What does "generally accessible information"  mean?    [Farner] It means information that reports companies'  turnover, profitability, and credit rating, and supplies lists  of their contractors and subcontractors as well as regular  clients. The better these data look, the more attractive the  given firm's business image, which in turn helps to make  business contacts and secure new contracts. In Poland, that  sort of information is often deliberately withheld and made  "classified" by the firms themselves, which usually does more  harm than good. A business partner who has something to hide is  simply not very credible. Of course, I refer here to  information that should not be kept secret. Consequently, many  firms, both Polish and foreign, use the services of economic  intelligence agencies not in order to analyze the available  information but to obtain it in the first place. This secrecy  undermines the credibility of may Polish enterprises.    [Winiarski] So you believe that all information should be  for sale?    [Farner] Most emphatically not! Paradoxically, our  companies do not attach any importance to the protection of  information that is really essential to their interests. I am  thinking here mainly of technological processes and information  networks and data bases that can be penetrated very easily,  without even needing to enter company premises. There are firms  in our country that pursue such activity in the guise of  economic intelligence agencies. That is a most dangerous  phenomenon.    [Winiarski] Do Polish companies often turn to firms like the  AIG to secure their help in checking out foreign, or even  domestic, contacts?    [Farner] In my view, they do it far too seldom, and even  when they do turn to us, it is usually five minutes before they  are due to sign a contract. That is when the real trouble  starts. It is only large companies, with properly developed  marketing networks, that have come to appreciate the  "preventive" role of economic intelligence agencies and use  their help from the very start of the negotiating process. This  not only allows them to save time but also saves them a lot of  money. The truth is that, unless we begin to treat our own  money seriously, we are bound to lose it.    We still need some time before we can come to appreciate  that truth properly. Nevertheless, even now there are some  discernible changes for the better in our economic landscape.  The number of fraudulent operations actually carried out or  attempted in our business circles is decreasing, although it is  still difficult to check out and assess the credibility of  business partners with 100-percent certainty. We are still  waiting to see the creation of trade and industrial  organizations, membership of which would be tantamount to a  guarantee of a company's credibility and reliability. It is  also quite hard to put proper information dossiers together in  our circumstances and to build up adequate data bases for  economic analysis.    [Winiarski] So how do you solve this problem?    [Farner] During the three years our firm has been in  operation, we have collected information on nearly 800,000  economic entities throughout Poland. We have standing  cooperation agreements with 15,000 partners, and we have  accumulated a considerable pool of information on foreign firms  operating in our country. This gives us a significant overall  bank of information, which enables us to carry out many  commissions thoroughly and accurately. It also helps us in work  involving finalization of completed negotiation processes before  the signing of final contracts. This sometimes enables us to  save our client firms from getting into serious trouble.    [Winiarski] Have you handled such cases in our region?    [Farner] Yes, there were several such cases here. Not long  ago, a Szczecin manufacturing plant was virtually on the eve of  finalizing a rather large contract for the amount of $100,000  with a foreign partner. The name of the foreign company sounded  good, and its letterhead looked impressive, but the Polish firm  still turned to us--at the last moment--to check out its  potential partner's credibility. And what did we find? It was  a typical front company, intending to cheat the Polish partner.  Fortunately, we were able to ascertain this before the final  contract was signed.    [Winiarski] So what guidelines should our companies follow  before they move to finalize any business transactions?    [Farner] First of all, they should adopt the principle that  "a lack of confidence in a potential partner means that you take  your own interests seriously." They must not be impressed by  the way the partner's representatives look and dress, by their  cars, the equipment and interior design of their offices, or  their declarations of a splendid financial condition.  Everything should be checked and cross-checked several times  over, and expert assistance should be sought for that.    [Winiarski] But where are the trustworthy experts to be  found? After all, you admitted yourself that there are  occasional black sheep among economic intelligence agencies.    [Farner] There is no precise recipe here. One possible  successful method of choosing such a partner is through the  grapevine--that is, obtaining a report on the work of an  economic intelligence agency from people who have used its  services before. And it is definitely essential to make use of  their services, just as it is essential to treat one's money  seriously and not invest it in risky undertakings. It is not  enough to find a potential partner; you must still sign a  satisfactory contract with him, which will offer a good chance  of profitable business to both sides. Business dealings require  not only mutual respect but also mutual confidence. However,  you have to work hard to secure both.</p>

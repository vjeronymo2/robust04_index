			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of the final rule requires that the guarding on each machine be in place at all times the machine is in operation. This provision was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. This provision makes explicit OSHA's intent in the proposed rule that machines be equipped with guarding and that such guarding not be removed or otherwise disabled while the machine is in operation. If machine guarding is removed or disabled, employees still remain exposed to the danger of moving elements and flying objects when they are near or using the machine. OSHA believes the reasoning and explanation for requiring that chain-saw chain brakes be engaged when starting the machine and not be removed is also applicable to this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (g)&blank;Vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (g) of the final rule, OSHA has included various requirements regarding vehicles when used off public roads in logging operations. OSHA has decided to include a separate paragraph on vehicles in this final rule because of the confusion commenters said existed in the definition and requirements regarding ``mobile equipment'' verses ``motor vehicles'' in the proposed rule (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;22). Certain of the proposed provisions on vehicles were limited to personnel transport vehicles. In the final rule, OSHA has defined vehicles to include trucks and trailers used to transport logs and machines, as well as personnel transport vehicles. Therefore, the provisions covering vehicles apply to all vehicles used in any logging operation. OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation supporting the need for protection for those in personnel transport vehicles also apply to operators and passengers of other vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received some comment that employee-provided vehicles should be excepted from the standard's vehicle requirements (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39). OSHA has not distinguished between employer-provided and employee-provided equipment anywhere in this standard. OSHA believes that when any equipment is used in logging operations, the employer is responsible for assuring that it is in proper working condition. However, this final standard does not address the personal vehicle an employee drives on public roads. By contrast, when the employer allows employees to use their own vehicles to transport themselves and other employees off public roads to and from logging work sites rather than providing such transportation, those vehicles are exposed to the unique hazards of logging operations. Such vehicles must be adequately equipped and properly running, just as employer provided vehicles must be, in order to cross what may be difficult terrain and other hazardous conditions encountered enroute to and from the logging site. The OSH Act imposes on the employer the responsibility for compliance with standards and for assuring safe conditions in the workplace, even if the employee provides the vehicle for the logging operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

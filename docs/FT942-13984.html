			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / EU works council costs put at Pounds 1m: Large companies will be hit hard, EEF warns One of Britain's largest employer organisations yesterclaimed that European works councils would cost UK multinationals at least Pounds 1m each a year. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, further polarised the issue by accusing employers' bodies of 'betraying the long-term interests of British business' by backing the government on de-regulation and European social policy. According to Mr Graham Mackenzie, acting director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, there are no caps on works council costs which will cost 'in excess of Pounds 1m' a year. The federation calculates that at least 30 of its larger members will be hit by the legislation on works councils, which is expected to become law by 1997. Overall, about 100 UK multinationals will be affected. 'This is an enormous cost burden that companies in Europe will have to bear and that companies elsewhere will not have to bear,' said Mr Mackenzie. Companies will have to cover the cost of travel, accommodation and interpreters for at least one and perhaps several meetings a year. Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European employers' body, said disruption to business decision-making caused by works councils would be more important than their costs. 'Works councils will slow down decision-making by at least three months,' he told a meeting of the Involvement and Participation Association in London. He said European employers could not stop the legislation but were involved in a 'damage-limitation' exercise over the details. Meanwhile, Mr Monks suspended his campaign to establish a less overtly political trade unionism with a bitter attack on both the government and the Confederation of British Industry. He told the Scottish TUC he was 'disturbed' by recent comments from the CBI describing European employment initiatives as 'risible and irrelevant' and said that the CBI was not speaking for industry - 'only for the bosses'. 'A right to information and consultation would not have been irrelevant to the workers at Rover who found out about the BMW takeover after the event while representatives of the German workers were consulted beforehand,' he said.</p>

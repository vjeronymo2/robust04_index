			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Shortly before his meeting with French  President Francois Mitterrand and young people from both  countries in Heidelberg, Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphatically  stressed the close partnership between the two states. The youth  festival in the old university town, in which 6,000 people will  participate, should be a "festival of joy" two days after the  celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the landing of the  Allied forces in Normandy, Kohl told DPA.    The chancellor again reaffirmed that at no point he  expressed  the wish to participate in the ceremonies of the allies. "I do  not believe that the German chancellor should have been in  Normandy that day." However, on the occasion of the  anniversary, he and Mitterrand thought about what the French and  the Germans could do to make it clear that the French and the  German peoples have become friends "50 years afterward."    The deliberations led to the idea to organize a "festival of  joy and friendship" with young people from both countries in  Heidelberg. "We want to make it clear that we do not forget  history, but that we want to learn from history," Kohl stated.  Without the close partnership and friendship between France and  Germany, a peaceful future in Europe is inconceivable.</p>

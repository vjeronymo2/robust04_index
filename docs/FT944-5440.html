			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar's strength helps bourses move ahead Dollar strength in the aftermath of yesterday's US jobs data helped some European bourses and raised expectations that the US Fed would increase interest rates once again, which analysts said was generally good news. FRANKFURT found little enthusiasm to end the week, the Dax index falling just 8.08 to 2,038.51, for a week's decline of 0.6 per cent. Turnover was around DM4bn. In the Ibis the index closed at 2,040.24. Volkswagen remained in focus as analysts met the group. Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, admitted that there was no 'sustained recovery' in sight, but added that forecasts could be met 'even under difficult circumstances'. The stock lost DM4.70 to DM414.80, picking up to DM416.20 in the post, for an 8 per cent decline over the week. The VW story is in contrast to that of BMW, up 50 pfennigs at DM749. Hoare Govett is positive about the group, rating it a buy on the grounds of accelerating sales growth, boosted by new models. In the post-bourse financial stocks made advances, ahead of results from Deutsche and Dresdner next week. Dresdner, off 50 pfennigs at DM412.00 in usual hours, ended at DM413 in the Ibis. PARIS was given a push by Wall Street and the CAC-40 index rose 18.76 to 1,982.71, but in low turnover of less than FFr3bn. The market rose 2 per cent on the week. News of a rise in French car sales held motor stocks: Peugeot up FFr9 at FFr791 and Renault 90 centimes firmer at FFr181.80. Michelin improved 90 centimes to FFr204.90. Eurotunnel fell 95 centimes or 2.5 per cent to FFr20.90. The Eurotunnel shareholders association in Paris said yesterday that the government should inject FFr4bn to help the group through present difficulties. MILAN lacked direction, with this week's accord on pensions between the government and unions still providing some grounds for optimism but there were nerves about the outcome of the second round of local elections tomorrow. The Comit index finished 1.44 lower at 631.45, up 1.3 per cent on the week. Fiat finished L68 lower at L6,008. The shares had dipped to a low of L5,970 after a block trade of 20.1m shares, equal to 0.75 per cent of the company's capital, was traded at L6,070, raising immediate fears of a large divestment. However, an analyst said later that the trade was more likely to have been technical, perhaps related to warrants, and added that there would be no logic in making a divestment through one large block trade under existing market conditions. Among the banks, Credito Italiano eased L2 to L1,626 and Credito Romagnolo was L1207 lower at L17,162 as speculation grew that there could be further moves in Italiano's bid for control this weekend. STOCKHOLM followed the trend throughout the continent with the Affarsvarlden general index falling 10.60 to 1,488.90, slightly down on the week. Turnover was thin at SKr2.3bn. Astra eased SKr3.50 to SKr198 on profit-taking but Trelleborg was up SKr1.50 to SKr111. MADRID shook off early worries to close with small gains as late buyers entered the market. The general index picked up 1.39 to 301.92, and finished little changed over the week. Much of the day's interest centred on Central Hispano Bolsa's acquisition of Banesto shares. Dealers said Banco Central Hispano was believed to be calling in shares put up as guarantees by Mr Mario Conde, the former Banesto chairman. Banesto finished Pta9 lower at Pta938. ISTANBUL's rally continued, and the market closed at yet another new high for the year. The composite index added 717.87, or 2.5 per cent, to 29,145.1, a week's gain of 8 per cent. Turnover was TL4,870bn, down from Thursday's TL6,700bn, which was an all-time-high. Brokers said that activity switched from state-owned stocks to private-sector shares having good year-end expectations.

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): Wait for the tax changes - Drivers on business face a new regime IN his budget speech next month Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to indicate the extent to which the Inland Revenue's proposals for the reform of company car taxation, first outlined last summer, have been amended by criticism invited from the motor industry and other interested parties. The legislation to implement the revised tax regime will then be introduced in this year's Finance Act. But such are the complexities of change - to PAYE systems, car makers' production and marketing strategies, for example - that there will almost certainly be no attempt to introduce the changes before the start of the 1994-95 tax year. If the switch- over seems likely to cause more complications than expected, it could even be postponed until later. Despite, or perhaps because of, the wide range of responses to and criticisms of the Revenue's draft, there appear few signs that there will be significant departures from the scheme as originally proposed. The Revenue has declared four principal aims in restructuring the way personal taxation of the company car benefit is assessed: greater fairness, reduced distortion of the new car market caused by manufacturers producing 'tax break specials' within the current price and engine capacity 'banding' system, to promote fuel efficiency and to simplify the administration of company car taxation. Central to the Revenue's proposed new regime are a dozen new bands, based wholly on price and stretching up to Pounds 60,000. The current regime, which the Revenue itself has described as outdated and crude, has only two price thresholds, of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit to the user rises sharply. These, however, currently are assessed in combination with three engine capacity bands, of under 1.4 litres, 1.4-2 litres and over 2 litres. One of the long-standing criticism of these capacity bands is that they do not differentiate between petrol and much less powerful but more economical diesel engines, which require more cubic capacity for a given level of performance. The proposals favour using the manufacturer's list price as the basis for the bandings, but leave open actual cost to purchasers after discounts, and estimates of original market value for a particular category of car, as alternatives. The Revenue has done its own calculations about the expected effect on some 2m company car drivers and asserts that 1.2m drivers would benefit from the revised structure, with their tax bills falling by up to 25 per cent. However, it also acknowledges that there would be 700,000 losers. About 500,000 of these, with cars currently in the Pounds 13,000-Pounds 15,000 bracket, would be less than 10 per cent worse off. But about 200,000 drivers of high specification cars with prices just under the current two 'break' points face a 40 per cent tax rise. Launching the proposed scheme, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said that it was designed to end the unfair situation whereby, for example, the presumably low-paid driver of a basic 1.8 litre Ford Fiesta diesel, using mainly for business, paid the same tax as the driver of a Mercedes 190 for equivalent business mileages. What the new regime apparently does not seek to do is increase the total tax burden by more than the current scheme would impose in the normal course of annual adjustments. In a foreword to the proposals, Mr Lamont signalled that the swingeing annual increases in scale charges that have quadrupled tax payable by company car users in less than a decade are at an end: 'The government recognises that company cars are an important feature of modern business life and of the UK car industry, and make a significant contribution to the Exchequer.' While not spelling it out precisely, Mr Lamont indicated that, in the government's view, company cars are now just about tax neutral - neither encouraging nor discouraging their provision. Currently, the Exchequer's receipts from the tax are around Pounds 1.4bn. The proposed dozen price bands are: under Pounds 5,000, Pounds 5,000-Pounds 6,499, Pounds 6,500-Pounds 7,999, Pounds 8,000-Pounds 9,999, Pounds 10,000-Pounds 12,499, Pounds 12,500-Pounds 15,499, Pounds 15,500-Pounds 19,499, Pounds 19,500-Pounds 24,499, Pounds 24,500-Pounds 30,999, Pounds 31,000-Pounds 38,999, Pounds 39,000-Pounds 49,999, Pounds 50,000-Pounds 62,500, and over Pounds 62,500. The advantage seen in this successively wider banding is that it would be particularly sensitive in the Pounds 10,000-Pounds 19,500 region where company cars are concentrated. To generate the same revenue yield as the present system, the proposals suggest a scale representing two-ninths of a car's value for drivers covering 2,500-18,000 business miles a year, one third for low-mileage (below 2,500 miles) users and only one-ninth for those covering more than 18,000 business miles a year. The document proposes no changes to the business mileage bands, despite widespread criticism that essential car users are heavily penalised if they do not cover more than 18,000 business miles. Cars now costing between Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000 would be split into two bands. The 60,000 cars in the lower half of the current band would have the tax charge cut by 15 per cent on average. In the case of cars costing more than Pounds 24,500 - affecting about 20,000 - the drivers would be modest losers. For the most expensive cars, priced now at more than Pounds 29,000, those at the bottom of the range - up to Pounds 39,000 - would have a tax charge reduced by more than 30 per cent. This would benefit companies such as Jaguar. Above Pounds 39,000, the tax charge would rise by 35 per cent for cars costing between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000. By using the price mechanism more strongly, the scheme also aims to encourage the use of more economical cars. In that context, the regime, if adopted largely unchanged, should give a significant boost to diesel cars. The administrative argument in favour of the Revenue's proposals is widely seen as a strong one. Whereas, at budget time each year, car makers and fleet users alike have traditionally waited on tenterhooks for the revised scale charges in each Budget, to assess the likely impact on both car users and car sales, the Revenue's proposed new system would be broadly self-correcting. Each year, cars could be expected to drift up through the price bands, depending on prevailing rates of inflation.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   CAR BENEFIT SCALE CHARGES 1992-93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Original                                      High business      market                        Engine       mileage (18,000      value                      size (cc)        miles or  more)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Cars under four years old  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to Pounds 19,250                0-1400         Pounds 1,070 Up to Pounds 19,250             1401-2000         Pounds 1,385 Up to Pounds 19,250                 2001+         Pounds 2,220 Pounds 19,251 to Pounds 29,000      2,875         Pounds 5,750 Over Pounds  29,000                   All         Pounds 4,650  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Cars over four years old  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to Pounds 19,250                0-1400         Pounds   730 Up to Pounds 19,250             1401-2000         Pounds   940 Up to Pounds 19,250                 2001+         Pounds 1,490 Pounds 19,251 to Pounds 29,000        All         Pounds 1,935 Over Pounds 29,000                    All         Pounds 3,085  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Average business   Low business                                        mileage (2,501    mileage (2,500                                       to 17,999 miles)   miles or less)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  2,140     Pounds  3,210 Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  2,770     Pounds  4,155 Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  4,440     Pounds  6,660 Pounds 19,251 to Pounds 29,000         Pounds  5,750     Pounds  8,625 Over Pounds  29,000                    Pounds  9,300     Pounds 13,950  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Cars over four years old  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  1,460     Pounds 2,190 Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  1,880     Pounds 2,820 Up to Pounds 19,250                    Pounds  2,980     Pounds 4,470 Pounds 19,251 to Pounds 29,000         Pounds  3,870     Pounds 5,805 Over Pounds 29,000                     Pounds  6,170     Pounds 9,255  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Inland Revenue  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

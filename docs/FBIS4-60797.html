			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Pachegina report under the "Northern Caucasus" </F> rubric: "Federation Council Confirms President's Edict. Nazran  and Vladikavkaz Dissatisfied"]    [Text] The closed session of the Federation Council of the  Russian Federation, whose work schedule included the question of  confirming the Russian president's edict on extending the state  of emergency in the zone of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict, was  preceded by a meeting of Federation Council Chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko and the presidents of Ossetia and Ingushetia with Yuriy  Baturin, the Russian president's national security aide. The  fourth man, as is rumored, was Sergey Filatov, the president's  chief of staff. The interlocutors, as an informed source has  confirmed, agreed that the amendments to the well-known edict of  4 April made by the Russian Federation president should be  confirmed by the Federation Council. The edict excluded the  Republic of North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon population centers  of Oktyabrskoye, Kambileyevskoye, Sunzha, and Sputnik, which  geographically divide the state of emergency zone into two  parts, from the list of villages whose territories were affected  by the state of emergency rule. The "amendment" to President  Yeltsin's edict that followed in the wake of the Ingush citizens  convoy attacked in Vladikavkaz on 12 April introduced a measure  of logic in the operation of the state of emergency rule on the  territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon: all four villages have been  again "returned" to the state of emergency zone. This  Federation Council decision brought no satisfaction to the  presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the opinion of  Akhsarbek Galazov, the edict extending the state of emergency  rule brings about no serious change in the situation in the  conflict zone. He is echoed by Yuriy Biragov, North Ossetia's  Supreme Soviet chairman, who also thinks the Federation Council  should have taken into consideration the proposal of the  Provisional Administration, headed by Vladimir Lozovoy, that the  State of Emergency zone be extended by including in it the  Ingush territories. The Ingush villages of Galashki, Muzhichi,  and Ali-Yurt, contiguous on North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon,  would have created, Biragov thinks, a real security zone on the  borders of the two republics. Vladikavkaz representatives also  disagree with the opinion prevailing in Moscow and in the  Provisional Administration that the republican law and order  organs are unable to be on top of the situation on the territory  entrusted to them. Owing to this, Vladikavkaz cannot recognize  the primacy of the Provisional Administration's powers in the  State of Emergency zone over those of the regional  administration organs.    Neither is Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev quite  satisfied  with the extension of the State of Emergency zone. His final  objective -- the introduction of federal rule in the State of  Emergency zone -- remains, as before, unrealized. Ingushetia's  Nazran and Malgobek rayons, which are part of the State of  Emergency zone, have been once again thus wrongly included,  Aushev thinks, because their population poses no threat to  neighboring Ossetia. The Federation Council's confirmation of  the edict on the conflict zone, in the opinion of the president  from Nazran, merely corrects the mistake made in the 4 April  edict.    In the meantime, on 27 April Russian Government head Viktor  Chernomyrdin signed a Russian Government decree expanding the  powers of Provisional Administration head Vladimir Lozovoy on  the territory of Mozdok, Prigorodnyy (Republic of North  Ossetia), Malgobek, and Nazran rayons (Republic of Ingushetia).  Under the decree, orders and directives of the Provisional  Administration head are mandatory for federal organs of power of  the Russian Federation, as well as for the executive organs of  state power of federation components.</p>

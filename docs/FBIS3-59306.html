			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Yu-shuo (6774 1342 4311), director of the </F> Hong Kong Municipal Science and Technology College's Social  Sciences Institute: "No Big Deal Even If Sino-British Talks  Should Fail"]    [Excerpt] Britain and China want to maintain the channel  for bilateral diplomatic contacts because considerable mutual  benefits are involved -- in order to maintain Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity, there will be basic cooperation even  when the relationship edges toward collapse as happened with the  4 June Incident and the publication of the draft political  reform proposal. The reason China does not want to wreck Hong  Kong is because in recent years, Hong Kong's industrial and  commercial circles have firmly supported the position of the  Chinese Government, and the PRC would not wish to see their  benefits adversely affected.    Therefore, in my personal estimate, the possibility of the  Sino-British talks collapsing is not great; even if they did  collapse and agreement could not be reached, the resulting  impact would not be very great. On the one hand, this is because  Hong Kong residents have low expectations that the negotiations  would be successful, and the shock of not having any agreement  would therefore be correspondingly limited. On the other hand,  from a more serious perspective, any agreement that might be  reached between the two sides will likely be a tactical rather  than strategic agreement; as both sides can no longer cooperate  sincerely, any agreement reached will only involve cooperation  to the extent that it minimizes damages to both sides while  maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.    In point of fact, however, beginning in early April, the  points of view and observed tendencies among Hong Kong's pro-PRC  media have shown that China intends to separate politics from  economics, and even if no agreement is reached on the political  system, maximum effort will be made in the economic area to  maintain cooperation, for example, in approving the land-fill  engineering project for the Central District; Wang Qiren [3769  0796 0086], Hong Kong-Macao Affairs Office Deputy Director, has  also publicly stated that it is China's intention to continue to  support the development of Hong Kong's economy.    The above line of reasoning assumes a rosy scenario; that  is,  even if China and Britain really cannot reach any agreement on  the political system, the shock for Hong Kong will not be too  great. However, undeniably also is the fact that without an  agreement, there will be some side effects. To begin with,  Britain will face considerable difficulties in turning the Hong  Kong Government over to a Special Administrative Region [SAR]  government. The turnover, in and of itself, will involved myriad  details, but from the mid-1980s to the present, not a great deal  has been accomplished in terms of preparatory work. Now with  only a little over three years left before the 1997 turnover,  one must wonder whether it will be possible to complete all the  necessary preparatory work for the turnover. If the situation  should remain unchanged, the SAR government will certainly  encounter difficulties during its initial establishment phase in  1996 and 1997.    Furthermore, the lack of any agreement will impact on the  rank and file civil servants in Hong Kong. Under the  circumstances in which Britain and China cannot cooperate with  any degree of sincerity, how can these civil servants  concentrate on their work? Will the status of senior civil  servants be maintained? The highest-ranking civil servants have  various options, namely, to leave, to emigrate or to stay and  join the private sector in industries or commerce. It can thus  be anticipated that without any agreement the civil servants  will have no basis for making suitable plans.    Furthermore, as the Hong Kong Government becomes  increasingly  a "lame duck" government, it will have even greater difficulties  gaining majority support in the Legislative Council. At the same  time, as the Hong Kong Government must perforce concentrate on  managing the difficult Sino-British relationship, it will also  have to devote what energy it has left to solve the larger  issues of people's livelihood, and many problems such as housing  (particularly the problem of subdivided, multi-storied  buildings) will become even more difficult to handle. Another  example is medical services, where the whole set of concepts is  no longer applicable; with costs of medical care continuing  their upward climb, the per-bed intensive care cost is over a  thousand Hong Kong dollars but patients now pay only some 40  dollars; the government in fact will not be able to continue to  provide large scale subsidies to medical care, and without such  government support, the standard of medical services will  certainly decline. The government should encourage the younger  generations to purchase their own medical insurance before this  problem can fundamentally be solved. But if the government lacks  the political will, how can it proceed to institute such reform?  Confronted with [challenges of] the 1990s, the Hong Kong  government should have new policy measures to deal with such  issues, but the government has dragged its feet, not getting  adequate support from the Legislative Council to take any  action, and leaving many social problems of people's livelihood  begging for solutions. We can well imagine in the days to come,  the government will need to cope with the 1994 and 1995  elections on the one hand, and with the transition in 1996-97 on  the other; larger issues of people's livelihood may well have to  be put off to the next century before they can be dealt with.    Aside from the above, in a situation of Sino-British  contention, with two clearly defined camps facing each other,  both sides may well lack the ability to compromise. The closer  we get to 1997, the stronger the pro-China forces will become;  among them, some political parties may well decline to take part  in elections, and the democratic faction facing no opposition  will score another big win. This type of situation will make  things much more difficult, for while it is normal for any  political party to win big under normal competitive  circumstances, the situation would be much more complicated if  the victory was the result of elections boycotted by other  political parties.    Naturally, if the Sino-British relationship should really  deteriorate, some economic projects will of course face great  difficulties, such as the No. 9 container dock and the new  airport. But the major difficulties will be on the Chinese side,  because under the circumstance of mutual suspicion and extreme  non-cooperation, it will not be easy at all to reach agreement  on any individual economic projects; this is not so much a case  of the Chinese side refusing to grant permission, but when China  and Britain distrust each other, no Chinese official would dare  take on the responsibility to approve any individual economic  projects.    As for the stock and real estate markets, Hong Kong people  have gradually adapted themselves to the Sino-British disputes,  and will not attach great importance to the lack of an  agreement. For after all, any agreement will only be a tactical  move, and given the fact that 1997 is close at hand, the  importance of an agreement is declining daily. Major investors  pay even less attention to the question of Sino-British  cooperation or to 1997, since the factor they most emphasize is  still the future development potential of China. If China  continues to reform and open up, and remains a good place to  invest, then these investors would basically pay no attention to  the Sino-British dispute; were they to behave otherwise,  investment activities in Hong Kong in recent years would  certainly have been affected; yet on the contrary, the stock  market and real estate market have continued to score new highs.  Based on present development, unless Chinese economic  adjustments hit rock bottom, and that coming on top of the  Sino-British dispute, Hong Kong would not be affected to any  serious extent.</p>

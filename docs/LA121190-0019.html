			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION COMING, SUPERVISOR GOING  </P> <P> It's still theoretically possible that the U.S. Supreme Court will prolong the  redistricting case against the L. A. County Board of Supervisors with further  review and decision. But Monday's high court ruling allows the planned special  election to go forward next month in the newly aligned 1st District.  </P> <P> That means the board's membership will change no matter how the legalities are  finally resolved.  </P> <P> The high court has been the last hope of the conservative bloc that controls  county government. They have been fighting this case for almost two years and  the taxpayers' legal bills are at the $5-million mark. Both a federal judge in  Los Angeles and an appeals court in San Francisco had agreed that the board  discriminated when its five white, male members watered down potential Latino  voting strength in 1981 to keep themselves in power. Monday the Supreme Court  could have disagreed, but it didn't.  </P> <P> The high court rejected an emergency request by the county to postpone the Jan.  22 election to fill the 1st district seat currently held by retiring Supervisor  Pete Schabarum. So even if the justices later decide to hear more legal  arguments, it's curtains for Pete. And even if the high court ordered further  hearings, all that's likely to change is the new district lines. The fact that  county officials discriminated against the region's largest minority will  remain a disgraceful part of the record. So, it appears, will the fact that the  board majority stubbornly refused to give up when even the U.S. Supreme Court  signaled that they were losers.  </P></p>

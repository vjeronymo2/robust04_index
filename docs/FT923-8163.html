			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Trinity term Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim and others (FT, July 23) The Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) alleged that a former director general, Dr Hashim, had defrauded it of more than Dollars 50m and that he had been assisted by his wife and son. In the present proceedings, Mr Justice Hoffmann refused an application by the AMF for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants, Dr Hashim, and his wife and son Jafar, from prosecuting an action in California against Mr Salah al Hafidh, a former employee and accountant of the AMF who had found alleged irregularities involving Dr Hashim. The judge stated that it was well established in the UK, as in the US, that an injunction to restrain proceedings in a foreign jurisdiction (an 'anti-suit' injunction) should be granted only in very narrowly restricted circumstances. The question was whether the injunction was necessary to enable justice to be done here or to safeguard the general jurisdiction of the court. In the instant case, there had been no determination of the merits in the UK or the US and the court was not satisfied that the case fell within the exceptional class of cases in which an anti-suit injunction was needed to protect the jurisdiction of the English court. The Prinsengracht (FT, July 24) A writ in rem was addressed to the owners and/or demise charterers of Prinsengracht by the plaintiff cargo-owners but was not served because the vessel did not come within the jurisdiction. When it was anticipated that it would enter an English port, the solicitors for the cargo-owners wrote to the shipowners' solicitors requesting security for their claim so as to avoid detaining the vessel. A bail bond was provided by an Owners' Mutual Insurance Association, which submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. Without waiting for the writ to be served on the ship, the shipowners acknowledged issue so that they had taken the voluntary step of becoming party to the action which, from that moment became in personam as well as in rem. Their voluntary act in acknowledging issue of the writ, at a time when no action by them was called for, was the clearest submission to the jurisdiction, Mr Justice Sheen stated dismissing an application to set aside the arrest of the ship. Further, the rule that bail represented the ship and that she should be free from arrest on the same claim, was viewed in the light of whether it was oppressive and vexatious to effect the arrest. In the present case there had only been one arrest, which lasted less than a day and, in looking after the cargo-owners' interests, it was natural for their solicitors to make sure they did everything necessary to preserve jurisdiction. Regina v Lloyd's and others, ex parte Briggs and others (FT, July 25) In earlier proceeding by representatives of 800 Lloyd's Names against members' agents, the judge had refused applications for interlocutory injunctions to restrain the agents from drawing down on the applicants' deposits on the ground that there was no legal basis for restraint. Thereafter six Lloyd's Names obtained ex parte leave to apply for judicial review from another judge against Lloyd's, its committee, chairman, deputy chairman and a company called GW Run-Off Ltd. Granting application to set aside that leave, the Divisional Court stated that inter alia there had been duplication of identity of three plaintiffs in the earlier action and three Names in the present proceedings, as well as an overlap of the issues. Moreover, even though Lloyd's did perform public functions, the relation ship between the Names and their agents were governed by contract. Lloyd's powers were derived from a private Act which did not extend to any persons in the insurance business other than those who wished to operate in the section of the market and who committed themselves by contract. Neither the evidence nor the submissions suggested that there was such a public element about the relationship between Lloyd's and the Names as to place it within the public domain and render it susceptible to judicial review. Total Oil Marine plc and another v Amerada Hess Ltd and others (FT, July 30) The Sullom Voe terminal was supplied with oil and gas by two pipelines from the North Sea and significant capital expenditure had been incurred in the construction of the terminal, which qualified for a grant under the Industry Act 1972. The grant had been paid in four amounts over 1983-84 and the oil was collected from wells owned by a number of companies. Membership of the two groups which owned the pipelines and their shares varied from time to time. At first instance it had been declared (a) as between the two pipeline groups, the grant should be appropriated in proportion to their respective participation at the time it was received; and (b) grant should be taken as negative capital cost in the calculation of participation adjustment payments when received. It was argued on behalf of the appellants that grant should be allocated in the proportion prevailing when the capital expenditure had been incurred. Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal, by a majority, stated that the whole tenor of the provisions was that there should be a running account in each year and that expenditure and receipts were to be debited or credited in the proportion as prevailing that year. In agreement with the judge, therefore, it was held that the grant was to be allocated to pipeline groups in the proportions prevailing when received. Common sense suggested, moreover, that the grant was to be taken into account as a deduction or negative capital expenditure since the apparent aim of the provisions was to transfer the burden of past capital expenditure to new entrants or to those whose participation had increased. Clifford Chance v Silver (FT, July 31) Clifford Chance acted as solicitors in the sale of property in a transaction which involved inter alia a sale and lease. The deposit payable under the first agreement (ie the sale) was Pounds 100,000. The deposit cheque was sent to the solicitors to hold it until contracts were exchanged but after exchange of contracts, the cheque was dishonoured on presentation. Judgement was given for Clifford Chance at first instance but on appeal, it was argued inter alia that Clifford Chance were never 'holders in due course' of the cheque, ie that they had not taken the cheque for value with no notice of the defect in its title. Rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeal stated a cheque might be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only under section 21 of 1882 Bills of Exchange Act. In the present case, the delivery of the cheque had been conditional and the contract between endorser and endorsee had been incomplete. However, once the contracts for sale of the property were exchanged so that the conditions stipulated were fulfilled, the cheque was then negotiated to Clifford Chance who then became holders in due course. However, following the dishonour, a Pounds 50,000 banker's draft had been sent in part payment of the cheque to a firm acting for the lessors and the court gave unconditional leave to defend in relation as to the part payment.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Loyalist Gunman Kills Teenage Student"] </F>   [Text] A student died when a Loyalist gunman sprayed the  offices of a taxi firm in the centre of Armagh city. The man  pushed an elderly woman to one side and shot Gavin Patrick  McShane, 17, as he played a gaming machine. Two other people  were also hit, one seriously. A witness who found the three  victims said: "Apparently the gunman had pointed the weapon at  the girl despatcher, but the gun jammed."    The attack came as the Government continued to prepare its  response to Sinn Fein's demand for clarification of the Downing  Street peace declaration. But Seamus Mallon, the SDLP MP whose  constituency offices are directly opposite the taxi firm, urged  an early resumption of talks. He said: "If we have the courage  of our own political convictions we should take that declaration  and build upon it."</p>

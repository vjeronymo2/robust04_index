			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO ONE 'LOST KUWAIT';  </P> <P> SCAPEGOATING: CHARGES IN CONGRESS ABOUT STATE DEPARTMENT SIGNALS TO IRAQ SHOW  NOTHING BUT 20-20 HINDSIGHT.  </P> <P> At slamming barn doors behind escaped horses -- and imputing blame for the  escape to the wrong parties -- the Congress of the United States knows few  peers, now as in years long past.  </P> <P> Witness the emergence of the "Who lost Kuwait?" inquisition.  </P> <P> A week or so ago, the Iraqi government mischievously leaked a bugged transcript  of Saddam Hussein's parting interview of July 25 with April Glaspie, U.S.  ambassador to Baghdad. The obvious intent is to complain, perversely, that  Hussein was given no clear signal that his invasion of Kuwait some days later  would be resisted by an enormous deployment of U.S. forces. Hussein whines, by  implication, "Why didn't you stop me before I raped another country?"  </P> <P> Certainly the language of threat was there in what Hussein had to say on July  25, just before the American ambassador left for consultations in Washington.  Yet Ambassador Glaspie -- a highly respected Foreign Service professional --  was explicitly assured that no invasion was planned.  </P> <P> Reading the transcript today, with 20-20 hindsight, the congressional  detractors of Ambassador Glaspie and of her State Department superior, John  Kelly, make the easy and gratuitous point that the State Department should have  read the Iraqi dictator's mind more clearly, and should have left less doubt  that the United States would resist the rape of Kuwait. At some point during  the crucial period between July 25 and the Aug. 2 invasion, it is said that the  CIA reached a conclusion that Saddam Hussein planned to invade. That assessment  is invoked as further backing for the proposition that the State Department  should have been more lucid.  </P> <P> In a hearing Sept. 18, House foreign affairs subcommittee Chairman Lee Hamilton  (D-Ind.) berated Kelly for leaving "the impression that it was the policy of  the United States not to come to the defense of Kuwait." On a previous  occasion, Hamilton recalled, he had "asked (Kelly) if there was a U.S.  commitment to come to Kuwait's defense if it was attacked," and Kelly had  replied -- as truth and policy warranted at the time -- that "we have no  defense treaty relationship with any gulf country."  </P> <P> This innocent exchange, before the invasion of Kuwait, turned on simple matters  of fact -- the United States indeed had no "commitment" to or treaty with the  emirate. Congress would have been the first to howl if either had been  proclaimed. Now it is transformed in hindsight into a culpable act of omission.  This ex post facto judgment is no more than retrospective scapegoating of an  unfair and odious variety.  </P> <P> This is a familiar congressional habit with an infamous history. The most  extreme precedent was the vengeful treatment of an entire generation of  foreign-service professionals whose field of expertise was China. In the  McCarthy period of the late 1940s and early '50s, these professionals, whose  records were for the most part entirely honorable, were held accountable for  the "loss" of China to Mao Tse-tung. Their reputations were savaged by  congressional inquisitions amounting to treason trials.  </P> <P> No one this time is charging "treason," as the kingpin congressional  inquisitors did then. And "Who lost Kuwait?" is of a distinctly lower voltage  than "Who lost China?" But if you listen to what the Monday-morning  quarterbacks of Capitol Hill are saying, you can hear the first sounds of the  new inquisition.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, no allowance is made for the deviousness and bad faith of Saddam  Hussein. As President Bush has observed, the Iraqi dictator himself is the  unmistakable villain of the piece, and the true miscalculation his own. Blaming  American diplomatic professionals for Hussein's misdeeds is shameful. And it  is, of course, a recipe for a timid Foreign Service as well.  </P></p>

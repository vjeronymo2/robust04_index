Chief Magistrate Arturo Hoyos believes  that keeping him in jail is the right decision.    [Begin Hoyos recording] The habeas corpus we reviewed refers  to crimes (Mr. Lerner Zimmerman) is accused of committing in the  Republic of Panama. Regarding said accusations, the Supreme  Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to hold this  person in connection with these drug related crimes against the  public. [end recording]    It is noteworthy that (Jacobo Lerner Zimmerman), a Colombian  citizen involved in drug trafficking activities, is wanted by  the United States for the same crime. The Supreme Court,  however, has already denied an extradition request.    [Begin Hoyos recording] There is a ruling by the Criminal  Court that denies the extradition request, and that ruling must  be executed. [end recording]    In view of this Supreme Court decision, (Jacobo Lerner  Zimmerman) will have to spend a long time in jail unless he  escapes, which is not uncommon in the country's jails among  people connected with drug trafficking.</p>

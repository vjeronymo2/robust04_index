			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mexican finance sector opens up to foreign firms Mexico's finance ministry is expected to give approval soon to more than 100 applications from foreign financial institutions to open up subsidiaries this year. The institutions, which include banks, brokerages, 'non-banks', insurance, factoring and leasing firms, are permitted into Mexico under the terms of the North America Free Trade Agreement, which opens up gradually Mexico's financial sector. Non-US and Canadian banks have to apply through their North American subsidiaries. The finance ministry said it had received applications for 20 banks, 17 brokerages, 13 insurance companies, 17 non-banks, 12 leasing companies, and four factoring businesses, among others, before the July 31 deadline. Officials said barring unforeseen problems, all applications would be given authorisation, and should be operating by the end of the year. 'This is much better than we expected,' said Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy finance minister. 'This is an enormous sign of confidence just two weeks before the election in a period of unusual political instability.' The foreign groups will initially invest about 9.329bn pesos (Dollars 2.74bn), and lend in the first year 11.024bn pesos, according to the government. In the brokerage sector, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Citibank, Chemical Bank, Morgan Stanley, Bankers Trust, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, Continental Bank, ING Capital Holdings, Indosuez, Santander, Swiss Bank, James Capel and Baring Brothers have applied. Some, such as J. P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Santander, ING, and Chemical bank also applied for banks. Mr Ortiz said the 17 brokerages had applied for more than the initial limit of 10 per cent of the sector's capital, and some scaling back of offers was possible. In the non-bank sector, US organisations dominated, with Ford Credit, GE Capital, Chrysler, General Motors, Caterpillar, IBM Credit Corporation, Associates Corporation of North America among those submitting applications.</p>

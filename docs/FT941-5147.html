			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / SIB chief urges enhanced role for City regulators Changes to the law should be made to enable City regulators to play a much greater role in dealing with misconduct in the financial services, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said yesterday. Mr Large, who heads the chief financial watchdog, called for new approaches to co-operation between regulators and the criminal authorities to ensure more effective investor protection. In a speech to the Chancery Bar Association, he urged a change to the law to enable the SIB and the department of trade and industry to investigate allegations of insider dealing and market manipulation. He also called for the SIB and the stock exchange to be given statutory powers to fine members. One of his most radical suggestions was that defendants who have pleaded guilty to crimes coming within the remit of the financial regulators should be allowed to undertake plea bargaining in open court. Resisting the argument that plea bargaining would compromise the independence of the judiciary, Mr Large said it should be possible to devise a fair and open system for such negotiations. The overall message of his speech was that once regulators proved they could enforce the rules they would be in a better position to handle more matters relating to misconduct and to dispel fears that they might be 'soft on white collar crime'. Mr Large cited the agreement which the SIB has reached in principle with the Serious Fraud Office, about which cases should be dealt with by the regulators and which by the criminal courts. In general, the regulator would deal with more technical offences, where the victim was less obvious, and the element of fraud or theft harder to explain to a jury. There was a place, he said, for much greater reliance on regulators to deal with potentially criminal cases involving those they regulated. Mr Large's comments came in the wake of a new emphasis on enforcement by regulators. Last week the SIB exercised for the first time its powers to ban an individual indefinitely from investment business in the UK, and Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, said it would impose heavier penalties. His speech underlined his belief that effective investor protection rather than rules lay at the heart of financial regulation.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems press fuel VAT attack A TORY DEFEAT in the Christchurch by-election could force the government to reverse plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday. The Lib Dems tried to exploit Monday's backbench rebellion on the issue, which cut the government's Commons majority to eight votes, while Labour sought to turn the heat on Mr John Major in the Commons. Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate in this month's election, said people felt they had been cheated by a party that 'lambasted' its opponents for advocating higher taxes. She was supported by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said Christchurch voters had a chance to shape the next Budget. Their remarks came as Mr William Powell, the MP for Corby who was among Monday's rebels, predicted that imposing VAT on fuel would cost the Conservatives the by-election. At Westminster Mr John Smith launched a concerted attack on the issue, accusing the government of betraying election promises. The Labour leader urged Mr Major to apologise to voters for pressing ahead with the proposal to levy VAT on fuel in spite of past Conservative promises. He asked: 'Do you deny that you have cynically betrayed an election pledge?' Mr Major countered by saying Labour was 'looking at' VAT on fuel and had once excluded fuel from a list of items on which it thought VAT should not be imposed. Turning his fire on the Liberal Democrats, the prime minister said they had also advocated a tax on energy in a recent policy document. 'Perhaps you will go back to Christchurch and tell them that,' he said. The exchanges triggered a flurry of correspondence. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative chairman, wrote to Mr Ashdown and Mr Smith reiterating the comments made by Mr Major, while Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, wrote to the prime minister denying Labour had ever supported VAT on fuel. Challenged on her party's energy policy at the Dorset seaside town where one in three residents is a pensioner and the Conservatives are defending a majority of 23,000, Mrs Maddock said imposing VAT on fuel and introducing a carbon tax were 'quite different things'. She confirmed her party favoured a carbon tax. Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, said he supported the overall economic package of which broadening the VAT base was a part but stressed that the government had said it would provide help for those on low incomes.</p>

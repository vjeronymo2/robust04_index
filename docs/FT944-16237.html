			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Canteen cabinet plumps for BAe: Chris Tighe reports on which of the rival suitors the workers at VSEL would prefer to win As the autumn fog lifted over Barrow-in-Furness yesterday and the sun broke through, VSEL workers downing stew and chips considered the merits of the potential rival suitors for their employer. BAe, the canteen consensus went, offers greatly increased chances of winning much needed new orders and the prospect of a re-entry for Vickers - as its employees still know it - to export markets. Such a takeover, said welding inspector Mr Terry Barker, would strengthen VSEL's chance of winning prime-contractor status for the Pounds 2.5bn contract for the next generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines. He said: 'You have more clout with two or three companies going in together and you have more MPs behind you.' However, the prospect of a GEC takeover is viewed with some alarm by the workforce and their union leaders. Mr Mike Hubbold, chairman of VSEL's joint manual unions, representing 2,800 of its 6,000 employees, said: 'I would hate to be landed with GEC. GEC has never been a company which has made anybody comfortable.' Mr Hubbold and his fellow trade unionists met Mr Noel Davies, VSEL chief executive, yesterday and made plain their hostility to GEC. 'We have told VSEL management as far as we are concerned we just don't want GEC.' Mr Hubbold is favourably inclined to a BAe takeover. VSEL, he believes, cannot remain on its own. The workers in the canteen are the survivors, so far, of one of Britain's most dramatic redundancy programmes. Since 1990 VSEL's workforce has been cut from more than 14,000 to barely 6,000. The company this week told employees that numbers will fall to below 4,000 - 1,000 fewer than previous estimates - for two years once the Trident nuclear submarine building programme ends in 1998. Even that figure depends on winning contracts the company does not yet have. The scale of redundancies in what was an archetypal company town has undermined potential workforce enthusiasm for the company remaining on its own rather than being taken over. VSEL is no longer seen as a paternalistic employer offering job security. Quality engineer Mr Dave Henry said: 'Two years ago I would have said these are people from our town who have our interest to heart but after 9,000 redundancies it makes you wonder.' Barrow, a parochial town. VSEL management has itself reduced the feeling that it is part of the town's fabric by putting outsiders on the board. 'It's not the company it used to be.' Last year VSEL's management sank Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, by undercutting it by Pounds 70m for a helicopter carrier order. In spite of this move, bitterly attacked by Swan Hunter employees as a tactic to put them out of the market and give VSEL a monopoly of large shipbuilding, some VSEL employees complain that their management has failed to bring in orders since it took over in 1986. Mr Henry said: 'The general feeling is, what have they done for us? What have they won for us?' And VSEL concedes that its attempts to diversify into non-defence markets since 1990 have been less effective than anticipated. But VSEL is still by far Barrow's biggest employer, putting more than Pounds 1m a week into the local economy in wages alone, although its dominance is much reduced and many local businesses have felt the effect. Miss Helen Greenhalf, an assistant at Burrow's, an ironmongery and tool sales business which has been in Barrow for 90 years, said: 'You used not to be able to move for people in overalls down here. Now you only see one or two.' Since 1991 the Barrow area's male unemployment rate has risen from 4 per cent to 13.4 per cent. Furness Enterprise, the local regeneration body, has been spearheading attempts to diversify Barrow's economy. It estimates it has secured 1,138 new jobs in the past two years. The town now also has grant-attracting Intermediate Area development status and European aid. Mr Tom Campbell, acting borough chief executive, said: 'We see this as being the start of the renaissance period in Barrow.' In the canteen the mood is more sanguine. Mr Paul Williamson, project engineer, said a workmate had rechristened VSEL 'BAe Submersible'. He said: 'Do I prefer BAe or GEC? The one that pays most redundancy money.' Ultimately, said slinger Mr Mike Conroy, not even a big conglomerate like BAe held the cards. 'If the government gives you work you'll survive. If they don't, you won't'</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / N Korea quits atomic agency North Korea yesterday announced it was withdrawing from the International Atomic Energy Agency, but stopped short of taking the more serious step of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Pyongyang said it would no longer permit IAEA inspectors into the country, indicating that it would eject two agency inspectors who are now monitoring the storage of spent fuel rods at the North's nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. The North Korean action was taken in response to a decision by the agency on Friday to suspend technical aid to Pyongyang as a symbolic penalty for its refusal to allow full international inspections. 'Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed until it has been decided whether we return to the non-proliferation treaty or completely withdraw from it,' said a North Korean foreign ministry statement. Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president, is expected to go to Pyongyang tomorrow in an unofficial bid to keep dialogue open. North Korea may be seeking US diplomatic recognition and economic aid in return for allowing full inspections. But Mr Kim Deok, South Korea's intelligence chief, warned yesterday that North Korea's 'ultimate goal is to develop nuclear weapons and they are now employing delaying tactics to earn time'. South Korea is to stage one of its largest civil defence exercises in recent years to prepare the population for a possible conflict with the north. It will conduct an emergency mobilisation exercise for the nation's 6.6m reservists over the next two days to coincide with an air-raid drill tomorrow covering the whole country. Air raid drills, which occur every three months, are usually limited to the capital, Seoul. North Korea's IAEA withdrawal is expected to add momentum to efforts by the US, Japan and South Korea to get the UN Security Council to impose phased sanctions against North Korea. China has so far opposed sanctions. George Graham adds from Washington: Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads the US policy steering group on Korea, said he had no official confirmation of North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, but said that it would, if true, 'be a very, very serious development for the worse. 'I certainly think it unfortunately adds another important bit of evidence to the case that the North Koreans are not interested in a negotiated settlement,' he said.</p>

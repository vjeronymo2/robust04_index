			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Bill LaForge, new director of operations for the Tri-City Americans of the  Western Hockey League, has been reassigned by team owner Ron Dixon so he won't  come in contact with the players, who staged a one-game boycott a week ago in  protest of LaForge's forceful style. LaForge had been hired by the Kennewick  (Wash.) team Dec. 17.  </P> <P> Dixon said he was putting LaForge in charge of scouting and the players agreed  not to boycott any more games.  </P></p>

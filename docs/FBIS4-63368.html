			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, </F> Vladimir Novikov]    [Text] Murmansk, 22 May -- Russian and British foreign  ministers began talks here today at the suburban hotel Ogni  Murmanska. Welcoming the British visitor, Andrey Kozyrev noted  that the two countries' cooperation during the war was closely  linked with the port of Murmansk. "We remain allies after the  ideological blackout that drew our countries apart," he said.  "We are now returning to the natural state of partnership."    "You will be the first foreign minister from another country  to visit the strategic base of the Russian Navy in Severomorsk,"  Kozyrev went on. "It is very important that the deadly missiles  are no longer targeted at Britain, same as British Trident  missiles are no longer targeted at Russia. This too is an  example of new partnership."    The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry also noted that the  meeting of the two ministers was taking place in a private  hotel. In his view, this showed that despite all the  difficulties, the spirit of enterprise had opened itself a way  in this land of great opportunities.    "It is particularly interesting to me to visit Murmansk,"  Douglas Hurd said in his turn. "Older generation Britons, among  whom I have many friends, went with the convoys across the  dangerous Arctic waters, threatened by German submarines. This  was the brightest page in their lives. I am looking forward to  seeing the city that, among other things, is the administrative  center of the Russian foreign minister's constituency, and to  visiting the military base in Severomorsk. The reasons why this  is important to me lie both in the past and in the present."    D. Hurd said he was confident that Murmansk would attract  large foreign investments because of its vast mineral resources  and the kray's geographical location.</p>

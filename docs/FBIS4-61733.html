			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Semipalatinsk </F> test site by S. Polyayev]    [Text] Russia is prepared to extend the moratorium on  nuclear tests. In connection with this it is envisaged that all  Russian scientists will have left the nuclear test site in  Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July. Incidentally, right now  only 20 percent of the original number of servicing personnel  remain at the site. This is insufficient to maintain the site  properly and to ensure its security. At the insistence of the  Kazakhstani Air Force, helicopter flights over the nuclear  facilities without a special permit are banned. The last  authorized flight took place 13 February this year.    Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site,  the  facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local  authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock  farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that  abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a  radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded  nuclear charge that remains in one of the galleries also  presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no  specialists, and it cannot be detonated.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Reed to purchase airline guides REED Elsevier, the international publishing and information group, has finally managed to purchase Official Airline Guides for Dollars 417m (Pounds 275m) cash. 'It's third time lucky,' Mr Peter Davis, chief executive of Reed Elsevier, said yesterday. Reed International tried to purchase OAG, which provides subscription-based airline schedules and hotel information for the travel industry and business travellers, in 1987 but the then owners Dun &amp; Bradstreet decided not to sell. A year later the business was sold to Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corporation for Dollars 750m, with Reed the underbidder at less than Dollars 500m. OAG operates mainly in the US through publications such as OAG Desktop Flight Guide, OAG Pocket Flight Guides and Travel Age and Frequent Flyer magazines. Reed Elsevier already owns OAG's rival, the ABC World Airways Guide, which is strong outside the US. The deal represents the largest disposal so far of Maxwell's US interests by joint administrators Price Waterhouse. Reed has not bought OAG's central database. To save costs, the process of data collection for OAG and ABC, based in Bedfordshire, will be integrated. The OAG brand name will be retained as well as separate sales and marketing teams at the group's Chicago headquarters. The deal gives Reed Elsevier a near worldwide monopoly of printed airline guides, although they are increasingly available in electronic form. The company faces growing competition from the computerised reservation systems operated by groups of airlines, such as Sabre in the US and Amadeus in Europe. Mr Davis argued successfully before US monopoly authorities that bringing OAG and ABC under common ownership would extend the life of independent travel information. 'The task is to demonstrate to the airlines that the merger is in the interests of the business as a whole by becoming more efficient, more streamlined and not taking advantage in terms of pricing,' he said yesterday. OAG's 1992-93 turnover was Dollars 129.5m (Pounds 86m) with pre-tax profits of Dollars 44.8m. The sale will involve OAG Inc going into liquidation for Reed to buy assets. Trading will be unaffected.</p>

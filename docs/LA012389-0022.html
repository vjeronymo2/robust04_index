			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> FANE ON FEMALES: MAY HIS FAME, IF ANY, BE FLEETING  </P> <P> Cautionary Tales for Women by Julian Fane (Hamish Hamilton and St. George's  Press/David &amp; Charles Inc.: $19.95; 307 pages)  </P> <P> Speaking as a female, I can say unequivocally that reading "Cautionary Tales  for Women" in one sitting is a little like slugging down a tea cup full of warm  cod-liver oil in one gulp. The book is at once sickening in its own right in  this present time, and nauseatingly familiar -- a nightmare from childhood,  when, at the mercy of your well-meaning parents, you were stuffed with a  ghastly diet of old wives' tales, half-truths and downright lies about womens'  roles in the relationships of the sexes.  </P> <P> The tone here is uniquely revolting. Julian Fane adopts that all-too-familiar  voice of false cleverness, the form of the epigram. He is a professionally  clever man, the kind you avoid at parties as if he had the plague. Here Fane  is, addressing women, being clever: "Men are said to rule the world: Which is  less than perfect in the eyes of feminists in consequence. But you women were  closest to, and had the best chance to influence, us men in our formative  years. Blame for our private and public misbehavior is attributable in large  part to what you have done or omitted to do in our nurseries. And if we take  after our brutish fathers, whose fault is it that our fathers were brutes?  </P> <P> "Your disillusionment with the love that produced us, and your discontent that  turned you into a hateful mother and twisted the characters of your children,  are not extenuating factors: You chose or permitted yourself to be chosen by a  mate who disillusioned you, and disturbed the peace of any number of minds."  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Old Message  </P> <P> In other words, if you're raped, or marry a wife-beater, or a homosexual who  hates women, it's your fault. There's nothing new in this message. I learned it  at my own mother's knee, and Sister Dominic (who I sincerely hope has gone on  to a just reward in the after-life), teaching at an elementary school in Eagle  Rock, had the same message for all her third-grade female students. Your  misfortunes will be your own fault. So, shut up.  </P> <P> On the other hand, you can't argue with Fane when he mentions all this: He's  not being serious, he would tell you. He's being clever; to argue would simply  mark the female reviewer/reader as a humorless clod, which has been his point  all along. When Fane writes: "Not love of money but love of another is the root  of all evil, being the father and mother of evil people," he -- if I read  correctly -- is not looking for the response, "Julian, you're as wrong as a  three dollar bill." He does not want us to edge away, muttering, "Julian, I  can't discuss this anymore, I think I hear my mother calling." On the contrary,  he wants the reader to giggle and twitter and rap his knuckles with a  metaphorical fan: "Julian, you're so clever! However do you think of such  amazing tidbits?"  </P> <P> Those of us who remember J. .M. Barrie's 1918 play, "The Admirable Chrichton"  (in which a morally irreproachable butler in an English family of morally lax  noblemen becomes their natural leader on a desert island once they're  shipwrecked), will recall from that work a harmless, frivolous nitwit named  Ernest, who, in England, torments his companions with such remarks as: "Life,  Chrichton, is like a cup of tea. The more heartily we drink, the sooner we  reach the dregs." Within the hateful bonds of civilization, Chrichton must put  up with this cleverness, but once on the island, Chrichton opines: ". . .  Sayings which would be justly admired in England are not much use on an island.  I would therefore most respectfully propose that henceforth every time Mr.  Ernest favours us with an epigram his head should be immersed in a bucket of  cold spring water."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Product of Modern Times  </P> <P> Now, such treatment might be just a little harsh on Fane; and, after all, we  still live in civilization and probably have to put up with such stuff: It is  the by-product of how we live, like discarded rubber tires or used plastic  cups.  </P> <P> Still, we certainly must be entitled, at some point, as Fane drones on ("The  wounds of love she thinks she has received justify her instant remedies that  wound. You could say she is retarded: It is her perennial innocence which is  injured and injurious. She remains impressionable and malleable, or appears to,  although the men who have loved her would argue in their turn that she never  met them halfway. . . ."), I think the reader is justified in letting her own  mind slip a few gears to tote up her grocery list or plan her upcoming schedule  of good deeds.  </P> <P> And when Fane finishes his cautionary tales with this stern admonishment to  women: ". . . endure your despair " I think it's correct to ease away from the  writer with a civil nod, a neutral monosyllable or two, and only in the company  of sensible men and women, allow yourself a rude laugh or two at this silly  person's expense. Let him endure his own despair, for heaven's sake, and let  the rest of us enjoy life together and see if we can make it fair and fun for  everybody all around.  </P></p>

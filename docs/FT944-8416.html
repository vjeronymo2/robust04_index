			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Sport: The art of dealing yourself an ace - Golf A golfer in America scored his first hole in one last week at the age of 79. It all proved too much. He accepted the congratulations of his playing partners, drove off from the next tee, and then collapsed and died. This must sound a sad story to non-golfers but those readers who play the Royal and Ancient sport will sigh to themselves and say: 'What a splendid way to go.' A hole in one represents a momentous occasion in any golfer's life. It clearly signifies the completion of a perfect shot in a sport where perfection is, to an overwhelming degree, unattainable. But here is the paradox: whereas in every other sport the more accomplished a person is the closer to perfection they get, in golf it does not work that way. Harry Vardon, who won the Open Championship more times than anyone else, hit just a single hole-in-one: while recuperating in Norfolk from a long illness. Fred Couples has built a reputation for playing exciting golf and, when he is on form, no-one plays more aggressively or hits the ball closer to the hole. Couples achieved his first hole-in-one two weeks ago during the last round of the Lincoln Kapalua International in Hawaii. He went on to win the tournament by two strokes. This ace demonstrated the part that luck plays. A 30 mph wind was blowing across the course. Couples aimed for the left edge of the green and then watched the wind blow the ball back towards the hole. It pitched on the front of the green and rolled 20 yards before hitting the pin and falling below ground. 'It was almost as shocking as watching George Foreman win the previous night,' Couples said. That weekend Mancil Davis, the president of the National Hole-in-One Association, was preparing to set up shop at the European Golf Trade Exhibition in Birmingham. This 6ft 2in Texan has never had any trouble getting those 'lil' holes-in-one'. He has had 50 in competitions alone, although, curiously, none since taking over as president of the association two years ago. Davis once caddied for Tom Weiskopf and admits that is the closest he has ever got to top-class golf. 'My regular shots aren't great and I can hardly manage a putt,' he says cheerfully. Is it all luck? 'If you're right then I'm an exceptionally lucky guy. All that l can tell you is that as soon as I strike a ball I know whether it's going to be a hole in one. It's always been - that way since my first at the age of 12. I call it an ability to run a movie in my mind. I have this Red Indian ancestry and I don't know whether there might be such a thing as kinetic power. 'Scientists have studied me and sports psychologists have studied me. I've been wired up and I've been monitored and these guys have discovered that as I'm about to hit a hole-in-one, there is a distinctive change in my brain waves.' The Golfer's Handbook is full of weird and wonderful stories about holes-in-one at odds that make winning this evening's first UK National Lottery prize seem straightforward. After a lifetime of golf, Rev Harold Snider scored his first hole-in-one at 75 on the eighth hole of the Ironwood course near Phoenix. He then scored his second at the 13th and his third at the 14th. Tom Doty, assistant professional at a course near Chicago, once played four holes in 10 under par, with two holes-in-one sandwiched neatly by an eagle and an albatross. The inappropriately-named John Putt of Frilford Heath had six holes-in-one in 1970 and three more the following year. The golf writer, Henry Longhurst, achieved the highly unusual feat of holing two consecutive shots with a mashie (a rough equivalent of a five iron), without putting it back into his bag. It happened at Letchworth, where he holed his approach to the long sixth, and then his tee shot to the short seventh. Longhurst recalled: 'Taking the same club for my second to the eighth I actually believed that I was more likely to hole out than not - such was the effect of the shock - while another part of my mind was saying: 'Later on you will be amazed that you could have thought what you are thinking now.' Doing five holes in 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, I was out in 30 and then became so frightened that I took 39 to come home. This did not stop me celebrating in five different towns. Ah yes, the celebrations. These normally take the form of buying a round in the bar, which can be expensive, as Greg Norman discovered during the US Tour Championship at the Olympic Club in San Francisco last month. He holed in one at the eighth during the second round and bought drinks for everyone in the clubhouse. Back came the itemised bar tab for Dollars 18,413. It included Dollars 3 worth of soft drinks. Clearly, the Olympic members were keen to observe the spirit of one of golf's great occasions.</p>

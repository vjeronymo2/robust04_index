			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo has  emphasized that the conditions in his country are stable in  comparison with earlier conditions. He attributed this to the  recent introduction of political reforms, which have contributed  to easing the violence and calming the tension that prevailed in  the country during the apartheid era.    In an interview with AL-SAFIR on the sidelines of the  Nonaligned Conference last week, Nzo said that the political  situation in his country will improve once the five-year  transitional period is over. Then political and economic  institutions will be reformed and human rights will be  respected, he added. He pointed out that the South Africans are  thirsty for freedom and democracy and that everyone is serious  about proceeding toward democracy and eliminating apartheid.  [passage omitted]    Nzo stressed his country's support for Arab rights at  international and regional forums. He added: "We support steps  to restore all the Arab rights and occupied territories and back  the Arabs' endeavors in this area, particularly the  Palestinians, because the policy of occupation has been rejected  by us. Recently we have curtailed South Africa's relations with  Israel and have suspended all previous cooperation activities  with that country in the political, economic, and military  areas. This is in line with the instructions and clear policy  adopted by the current government of President Nelson Mandela,  who has voiced support for the Palestinian people and those  whose lands are usurped and who live under oppression and  dictatorship and strive to regain their full rights."    The South African minister disclosed that his country has  expelled dozens of Israeli experts and military personnel who  were working in Johannesburg and some other districts. They  were replaced by blacks, who had been banned from working in  those areas in the past, he added. He pointed out that when the  Israeli Government tried to sneak back into the country through  back doors, these doors were slammed shut in its face and it was  told that bilateral relations had to follow a certain course and  that they must not come at the expense of relations with  neighboring African or Arab states. He added: Thus, now there  is no military or nuclear cooperation with Israel, as in the  past. South Africa has become a state committed to  international legality and policies or relations that do not  enjoy international acceptance cannot be pursued. [passage  omitted]</p>

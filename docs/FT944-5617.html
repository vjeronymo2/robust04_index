			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Crabtree leaps to over Pounds 4m Crabtree Group, the metal decorating press manufacturer, saw pre-tax profits leap from Pounds 1.07m to Pounds 4.11m in the year to September 30, on a turnover of Pounds 28.8m, against Pounds 7.7m. The result was boosted by the first full contribution from the group's principal subsidiary, Crabtree of Gateshead, against only 10 weeks previously. Earnings per share came to 18.6p (10.7p) and the dividend has been lifted to 8p (2p) with a recommended final of 5p. Mr Richard Oury is replacing Mr Karl Watkin as chairman, who is stepping down to devote more time to his public and private interests.

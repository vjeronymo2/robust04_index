			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Manushkin report under "Alarm Signal" rubric: </F> "Trade Unions Prepare for Strike"]    [Text] The second (extraordinary) conference of the  All-Russia Defense Industry Workers Trade Union took place 21  June in Moscow. The conference participants described the  current situation in the defense sector as critical. Not only  has the slump in the production of both military and civilian  output not been halted but, on the contrary, it is snowballing.  While it was 34.3 percent in January 1994 compared with the  corresponding month last year at constant prices, it was 48.7  percent in April. In April the rate of decrease of production  in the civilian sector (49.1 percent) exceeded the fall in  military production (47.6 percent) for the first time.    The wave of stoppages at enterprises and production  facilities is swelling. Ten of the sector's 176 enterprises  have stopped work completely and 123 are working an incomplete  working day or week, and 284,000 people are on enforced leave.  The low level of wages (30,000-40,000 rubles at a number of  enterprises), delays in paying them, the massive nature of job  cuts, and the destruction of enterprises' social sphere are  causing dissatisfaction and an increase in tension in labor  collectives.    The conference demanded that legal action be taken against  officials of state administration organs for the long delays in  paying for products manufactured under state orders and  consequently for the late payment of wages to defense  enterprises' workers.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported on the sector trade  union's picketing of the Russian Government building and on  defense sector working people's rallies accompanied by a  10-15-minute stoppage of the production of civilian output,  which were held in April-June. The defense industry trade union  is now deciding the question of holding a one-day strike  accompanied by economic and political demands.</p>

Extremely rarely, a person will get polio from the first dose of vaccine and, even more rarely, from a later dose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children who recently got OPV have the vaccine virus in their throats for a week and in their stool for a month or sometimes longer. People who have close contact (for example, kissing or changing diapers) with someone who got OPV can get infected by the virus. Extremely rarely, if they have not already gotten the vaccine against polio, they can get polio disease. If you have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child getting OPV and you never got the polio vaccine, ask your doctor/nurse about getting IPV for yourself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> IPV. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Inactivated polio vaccine is not known to cause any problems other than a little soreness or redness where the shot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a serious or unusual problem occurs after getting any vaccine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> call a doctor or get the person to a doctor right away.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> What is the Injury Compensation Program? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a U.S. government program that gives compensation (payment) for some persons thought to be injured by vaccines. For facts about this program, call this toll-free number: 1&hyph;800&hyph;338&hyph;2382.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you believe that the person getting the vaccine had a serious problem because of the vaccine, tell the doctor/nurse or health department. Ask him or her to report the problem on a Vaccine Adverse Event Report form. If you want to report it yourself, you can get the form by calling this toll-free number:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1&hyph;800&hyph;822&hyph;7967.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Polio 00/00/94 (Proposed)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42 U.S.C. 300aa&hyph;26  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

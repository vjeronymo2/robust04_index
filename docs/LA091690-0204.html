			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: EVERYDAY PHILOSOPHY;  </P> <P> EVEN GREAT THINKERS HAVE TO YELL FOUL WHEN OVERCHARGED ON A WATER BILL  </P> <P> WILL DURANT, the philosopher-historian, lived for nearly 40 years with his  wife, Ariel, in a Spanish-style home on Briarcliff Road above Hollywood  Boulevard. He died in 1981 at 96, only two weeks after Ariel.  </P> <P> I visited the Durants once, after the publication of "The Age of Napoleon," the  final book in their 11-volume "Story of Civilization." Dr. Durant answered the  door himself, a short man with an unwrinkled pink face, a shock of white hair  and a white brush mustache. Even shorter, Ariel peered at me over his shoulder  like Tinkerbell.  </P> <P> "Dr. Durant?" I asked perfunctorily.  </P> <P> "Let's get one thing settled right now," he said. "Please call us Will and  Ariel."  </P> <P> Thus did the eminent Dr. Durant, a hero of mine since my college days, dispose  of the distance between us. One hardly expects to call eminent philosophers by  their first names. Nor does one think of eminent philosophers as having  ordinary household problems like the rest of us. Dr. Durant, one would suppose,  would hardly worry about his plumbing or his water and power bill.  </P> <P> However, I have received a letter from R. W. Bernhard of Whittier, who enclosed  a copy of a letter Dr. Durant wrote to the Department of Water and Power in  November, 1977, complaining about his bill. Bernhard worked for the department  for 35 years and recognized the historical value of the letter; he tried to get  the original, but someone beat him to it.  </P> <P> The letter read as follows:  </P> <P>  Your bill for service of water and power to property at 5608 Briarcliff Road .  . . is surprisingly high in the water charge. Your bill for the period June  23-Aug. 23 was, for water, $32.05; for Aug. 23-Oct. 23 it is $71.92, a rise of  $39.87, or over 100% increase. I have inquired as to possible leaks on our  property; I am assured that there is no sign of a leak. We have had no  exceptional use of water in the last two months.  </P> <P>  Will you please send a man to check our meter and see if it is working  normally? And will you check your records to see if you can certify this  unusual charge?  </P> <P>  Thank you,  </P> <P>  Will Durant  </P> <P>  Bernhard notes that "the inspection made by the department's representative  revealed that the water meter had been over-read, and since the bill had  already been paid, Will Durant's account was credited with the amount  overcharged."  </P> <P> It may be interesting to compare this letter, showing the practical side of Dr.  Durant, with one he wrote me in 1979. Someone had asked me to name "the sage of  Los Angeles," and after considering many candidates, I selected Dr. Durant and  Ariel, as a pair, since one could hardly think of one without the other.  </P> <P> Dr. Durant wrote as follows:  </P> <P> Dear Jack:  </P> <P>  That was a pleasant game you played with us recently, nominating us as the  Solon and Theodora of our time and neighborhood. In our saner moments, we know,  of course, that wisdom is a repeatedly appearing and disappearing mirage on the  road of learning and that the child knows as much of cosmic truth as Einstein  did in the ecstasy of his final formula. So the best we can do is to seek  perspective and modesty (which are almost definitive of wisdom) and to see the  part or the moment in the light of the whole -- which the part can't ever see.  I am alarmed to note how few of the dogmas dear to my youth have kept their  charm through my plentiful but inadequate years. So I beg you to take me down  from that statue, and receive me as a friend and reader, another babe playing  games with the world.  </P> <P>  Yours to the end,  </P> <P>  Will Durant  </P> <P>  P.S. Will in his usual modesty has refused to accept your high estimate of  him. Nor can I accept your kindness in including me. I am just a contented  follower and hope to continue as such.  </P> <P>  Regards from  </P> <P>  Ariel  </P> <P>  Gentle as they were, Will and Ariel Durant were not the kind of people you'd  want to overcharge.  </P> <P> When I interviewed them, I asked if they were contemplating a 12th volume in  their series.  </P> <P> "He's always a little bit pregnant," Ariel said.  </P> <P> "Volume XII," Will said dreamily, as if to himself. "The 19th Century. We might  call it 'The Age of Darwin.' That was the most important event of the century.  . . ."  </P> <P> He came back to the moment; the self-mocking smile returned. "The body is a  machine in which every organ has a computerized date for its collapse. Now,  take the heart -- if you can guarantee me five more years of health . . . ."  </P> <P> "Go to it, man," Ariel said.  </P> <P> ". . . I'll do the 19th Century."  </P> <P> "Go to it."  </P> <P> "At least," Will said, "it would give a meaning to every day. It's a great  blessing to wake up in the morning and know what you have to do."  </P></p>

McCaskey said in Chicago  that the league should take a long, hard look at adding new franchises.  </P> <P> "I'm probably not one of the pro-expansion owners, but if there are some good  reasons, Buffalo will vote for them," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has said he would like two more teams by 1993 and  two more in 1995.  </P> <P> Mike Lynn, the president of a proposed world football league, said play will  begin in March even though no cities, coaches or players have been announced.  He added that he hoped that Canton, Ohio, where the NFL was founded, would seek  to join the world league.  </P> <P> The Phoenix Cardinals traded injury-prone defensive end David Galloway, who has  played only 24 regular-season games the last four seasons, to the Denver  Broncos for an undisclosed draft pick. . . . Cardinal guard Lance Smith was  arrested in connection with a domestic dispute but is expected to play Sunday  against the New York Giants.  </P></p>

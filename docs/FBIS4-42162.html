			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed PLS/JMK: "Conference on Stability in Europe </F> Opened"]    [Text] Paris, 26 May (BELGA) -- According to [Belgian  Foreign Minister] Claes, "the Balladur Pact meets the  requirements first because it is preventative, and second  because the European Union (EU) cannot be enlarged without  satisfactory guarantees regarding stability." That was how the  minister explained his viewpoint to the Belgian press.    However, Claes questioned the future of this introductory  conference.    Thus, the 39 foreign ministers will undoubtedly reach an  agreement by Friday [27 May] on a (probably rather noncommittal)  declaration with a view to initiating consultations regarding  minorities and borders in Central and East Europe and the Baltic  countries. "However, supplements on working methods are still  open to ratification."    Consequently, the approach initially aimed at, namely  bilateral talks, has been dropped, meaning that the planning  partially escapes the inspection of those taking the initiative.    Moreover, according to Claes, "there are still problems with  the two round tables. Russia has still not promised that it  will take part in the round tables on the Baltics. Russia feels  that the Balladur Pact somewhat thwarts the CSCE activities and  wants to give Max van der Stoel, the CSCE special envoy for  human rights, free rein. On this, Moscow could be swayed by the  United States with the argument that international politics is  already developed enough. As for the other roundtable, there is  still disagreement between Hungary and Romania on whether or not  to allow the Hungarian minorities to take part in the talks."    "The most important thing is yet to come," Claes said. The  upcoming EU presidents, France and Germany, namely, will have to  work very hard at this.</p>

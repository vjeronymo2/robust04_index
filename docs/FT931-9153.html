			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Improvement seen in retail sales figures RETAIL SALES in January recorded their first year-on-year growth since September and their strongest annual increase since May last year, according to a Confederation of British Industry survey released today. The survey, carried out between January 18 and February 3, will revive hopes of growing consumer demand after last month's disappointing official retail sales data, which showed a drop in retail sales volumes between November and December. Although the CBI figures showed that sales were still below normal expectations for the time of year, motor traders, wholesalers, grocers, chemists and clothing retailers all reported rising sales volumes, according to the CBI's monthly survey of distributive trades. The survey, covering 277 retail organisations, found that 43 per cent reported an increase in sales compared with a year ago. A decline was disclosed by 32 per cent and 25 per cent said sales were unchanged. The balance, which the CBI said indicated the trend, was a positive 11 percentage points, compared with a negative balance of 4 percentage points in December and plus 21 points in January last year. Retailers expect sales to be slightly higher in February, with a positive balance of 5 per cent expecting an increase compared with the same month last year. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, was cautiously optimistic: 'Over the coming months, the interest-rate reductions seen since September will be filtering through to homeowners' pockets and this should help lift consumer confidence,' he said. Mr Whittaker warned that recovery remained fragile, however. He said: 'Given the levels of consumer debt and the continuing rise in unemployment, it is too early to be sure we are seeing a sustainable recovery in consumer spending. The survey indicated that sales volumes still remain below what retailers would consider normal. The pattern of sales was mixed across the retail sector. Although chemists, grocers and clothing retailers saw rising sale volumes - partly because of consumers putting off their purchases until the post-Christmas sales - off-licences, furniture and carpet retailers, confectionery, tobacco and newspaper outlets saw sale falls. The most buoyant sector in the distributive trades was the motor trade, where the number of companies reporting higher sales exceeded those reporting declines by 20 percentage points, the highest positive balance since January 1989. Motor traders are also more optimistic about trading conditions this month with a positive balance of 31 per cent predicting higher sales. Sales of both vehicles and parts grew strongly in January and are expected to be higher this month than a year ago. In the wholesale sector, traders reported moderately increased sales in January and expectations of improved trading this month. Indicative of overall caution, the volume of orders placed with suppliers by companies in all three sectors of the distributive trades was lower last month than in January last year. Both the retail and wholesale sectors reported continued high stock levels last month but motor traders said their stocks were now less than adequate to meet expected demand. The CBI said, however, that motor traders intended to cut orders.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        CBI SURVEY OF RETAIL TRADES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual growth in sales volumes (reported)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Jan    Feb    Mar    Apr    May    Jun  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales Total          +21    +24     -5    +20    +14     -3 Grocers                     +46    +30    +38    +60    +48    +10 Specialist food             -38    -52    +16    -30    -15    -62 Off licences                -59      0    -12    -13     -8    +10 Clothing                    +56    +54    -24     -2    +21     +8 Footware and leather        +77    +48    -93     -4    +33     +1 Durable household goods     +10     -6    -26    +26    -33    -50 Furniture and carpets        -7    +53     +4    +70    -33     -2 Hardware, china and DIY      -7     +6    -22     -5    +36    -10 Confectionery               -15    +58     +9    +82     +4    +39 Booksellers &amp; stationers     +6    +19    -27    -28    -28    -61 Chemists                     +4    +28    +18    +72    +66    +62 Other retail                +38    +23    -45    -44    +12    +30 Motor Trades                -42    -48    -43     -1     -8    -17  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Jul    Aug    Sep    Oct    Nov    Dec    Jan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales Total        -15    -24     +4     -4     -9     -4    +11 Grocers                    +3      0     +1    +19     +2    +34    +44 Specialist food           -54    -65    -50    -28    -24    -67    -11 Off licences               -3    -88   -100    -56    -47    -40    -49 Clothing                  -25    -27    +42     -6    -18     +2    +19 Footware and leather      -30    +68    +39    -49    +11    -11    +28 Durable household goods   -10     -2    -11     -1    -10    -18     -4 Furniture and carpets     -43    +33    +46    -12    +15     -3    -35 Hardware, china and DIY   -28    -22    -52    +11    -38    -33     +6 Confectionery             +26    -57    +37     +4      0    +21    -31 Booksellers &amp; stationers   -9    -18     -1    -39    -53    -33    -18 Chemists                  +36    +20    +28    +58    +79     +6    +66 Other retail              +13     -5     +5    -23    -44    +20     +5 Motor Trades              -44    +15    -33    -30    -31     +3    +20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance - Percent reporting an increase minus the percent reporting a decrease in sales compared to a year ago  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

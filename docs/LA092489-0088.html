			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE:: FLOTOW: "MARTHA." LUCIA POPP, DORIS SOFFEL, SIEGFRIED JERUSALEM,  SIGMUND NIMSGERN, KARL RIDDERBUSCH; CHORUS OF THE BAVARIAN RADIO; MUNICH RADIO  ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY HEINZ WALLBERG. EURODISC 7789-2-RG (TWO COMPACT DISCS).  </P> <P> Flotow's 1847 comedy about life among England's pampered rich receives a  performance that infuses new blood into its faded charms. The cast and Wallberg  strike an appealing balance between theatrical vivacity and stylistic  refinement. In 1977, when the recording sessions were held, the microphones  caught Popp and Jerusalem in pristine estate. Her delectable Lady Harriet and  his Mickleford abound in sweetness and finesse. The digital remastering gives  no cause for complaint. At mid-price, this is a "Martha" worth savoring. ALLAN  ULRICH  </P></p>

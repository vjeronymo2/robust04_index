			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIVALS SAY YAROSLAVSKY DUCKING DEBATES IN 5TH DISTRICT ELECTION  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's opponents in the April 11 primary  accused him of ducking debates at a news conference outside his City Hall  office Wednesday.  </P> <P> Environmental activist Laura M. Lake, transportation consultant Ryan Snyder and  political consultant Jack McGrath said Yaroslavsky owes 5th District voters an  explanation of his record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> List of Forums  </P> <P> "Zev has said he was ready to campaign, but we want to know when he's going to  show up for some debates," Lake said. "He's afraid to face his own  constituents."  </P> <P> At the news conference, Lake released a list of five scheduled forums and said  Yaroslavsky has not committed to any of them. A Yaroslavsky spokeswoman said  the councilman is still considering how to budget his time, but his opponents  charged that he is stalling.  </P> <P> Snyder said Yaroslavsky is giving voters the impression that he has something  to hide. "If he is not coming out and talking to the voters, we have to wonder  if he is concerned about his record," said Snyder, who also released a detailed  political position booklet Wednesday.  </P> <P> McGrath, a former Yaroslavsky campaign manager and aide who is running as a  write-in candidate, said the councilman is alienating the people who put him in  office. "If you don't come out and meet your makers, we will not put up any of  your lawn signs," McGrath said.  </P> <P> Mark Slade, vice president of the Roscomare Valley Homeowners Assn., joined the  three at the news conference. Slade said Yaroslavsky has failed to return  numerous telephone calls concerning a candidates forum the organization is  sponsoring on March 16.  </P> <P> Roscomare Valley homeowners have tangled with Yaroslavsky over development of  the Hoag Canyon area. Slade, who acknowledged that he is supporting Lake, said  Yaroslavsky has a responsibility to participate in campaign-related activities.  </P> <P> "This shows a tremendous lack of respect," Slade said. "And it's a sad  commentary on the 5th District. He (Yaroslavsky) has absolutely ignored us."  </P> <P> Michelle Krotinger Wolf, Yaroslavsky's spokeswoman, called Wednesday's City  Hall press conference a "publicity stunt." She denied that the councilman is  ignoring anyone.  </P> <P> "We will participate in debates as his schedule permits," Wolf said. "He has  been speaking to community groups before January, after January, and will  continue to do so."  </P> <P> Since Yaroslavsky often schedules his appearances on short notice, Wolf said it  is still possible he will participate in one or more of the forums cited by  Lake. Despite his critics' charges, Yaroslavsky enjoys the support of most  community leaders, Wolf said.  </P> <P> Political observers agree that Yaroslavsky probably has little to fear in the  election, but over the past several days he has called press attention to two  high-profile events within the district to counter the charges being leveled by  his opponents.  </P> <P> On Monday he attended the dedication ceremony for a federally subsidized  50-unit housing project for senior citizens at 1450 S. Wooster St. Maxwell  Kaufer, president of the Menorah Housing Foundation, credited Yaroslavsky with  helping to make the project a reality.  </P> <P> On Feb. 9, Yaroslavsky joined homeowners in the Carthay Circle area at a press  conference in which he announced that a developer had agreed to rehabilitate a  run-down home in the area and rebuild another that was illegally demolished.  John Baldoni, president of the Carthay Circle Homeowners Assn., said  Yaroslavsky helped protect the area from commercial encroachment.  </P> <P> Wolf said Yaroslavsky is constantly working on similar constituent problems,  but his opponents contend that the councilman has lost touch with the voters  and is more responsive to the developers behind the area's massive commercial  growth.  </P> <P> Lake and McGrath have aligned themselves with 5th District residents who blame  Yaroslavsky for traffic congestion, commercial encroachment on neighborhoods  and other growth problems. Snyder went a step further on Wednesday by releasing  a 20-page booklet that details the city's numerous problems and his solutions.  Snyder said the booklet is the product of a yearlong study by a dozen urban  planners who donated their time to him.  </P> <P> "I can't fault Zev for everything," Snyder said. "Many forces have shaped our  destiny. But I have to say that things are not going well."  </P> <P> In his booklet, "Solutions for a Bright L.A.," Snyder says his first priority  as councilman would be the creation of Traffic Management Organizations,  associations of employers and building owners who would meet to discuss  ride-sharing and other transportation ideas.  </P> <P> Snyder opposes Metro Rail and other rail lines on the grounds that they are too  costly and are unlikely to attract enough users, but says he would support  car-pool lanes on freeways, better bus service, better transportation plans for  bicyclists, and other measures.  </P> <P> On housing, Snyder called for new laws making it tough to demolish low-cost  units, strengthening rent-control laws to prevent automatic increases on  vacated units and transferring slum properties to nonprofit housing  organizations, among other things.  </P> <P> Snyder favors better police protection and says he would allocate some funds  for citizen patrols. He also supports environmental efforts to protect Santa  Monica Bay and would downzone mountain areas to prevent housing development. He  would also establish a merit-demerit system to grade the performance of city  management personnel.  </P> <P> Snyder said he hopes to distribute about 25,000 copies of the booklet.  </P></p>

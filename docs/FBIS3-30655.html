Borkovec conveyed Baudys's view on military intervention,  lifting the embargo on arms exports to Bosnia and the possible  breaking of Sarajevo blockade: These are seemingly simple  questions but "in fact, these are the most complicated  situations, one can meet in the world."    According to Baudys, the fighting parties should first of  all  bear in mind that the solution depends on their good will.  External intervention is the last and most extreme solution,  Borkovec quoted him as saying.</p>

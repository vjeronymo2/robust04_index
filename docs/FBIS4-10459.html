			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a survey by the Sao Paulo State  Federation of Industries, 82 percent of industrial companies  already have converted their prices into Real Value Units,  URV's. The survey was delivered today to Finance Ministry  special adviser Milton Dallari. The survey also shows that  nearly 40 percent of commercial stores already have set their  prices in URV's.    Dallari, who today met with nearly 200 businessmen in Sao  Paulo, said the government will institute the real only when all  prices have been converted into URV's. Commenting on the  conversion of utility rates, Dallari said that only the  conversion of electricity and telephone rates will require an  implementation decree, which will not be issued until June.  Other utility rates will be converted into URV's by May.</p>

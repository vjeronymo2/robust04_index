			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] Senior sources in the Israeli peace delegation  yesterday sharply criticized the Palestinians for delaying the  arrival of their representatives in the territories. These  representatives are supposed to prepare the arrival of the  Palestinian police and the transfer of civilian powers from the  Civil Administration to the Palestinian autonomy authorities.    The Israeli sources said that "the fact that the  Palestinians  are not sending their people to Gaza and Jericho prior to the  signing of the agreement could harm their ability to assume  responsibility for these areas after it is signed." The sources  claim that this issue has been raised many times during the  talks, but to date the Palestinians did nothing about it.    According to Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian  delegation, some 6,000 Palestinian policemen will arrive in the  autonomous areas 12 hours after the agreement is signed.    Sources in the Palestinian delegation yesterday confirmed  that the issue was raised many times. They expressed  understanding for the Israeli concern, but added that it has  still not been decided who will serve in what post and therefore  they have difficulties in starting operations on the ground.    The Palestinian sources added, however, that in the last few  meetings it has been agreed that the Palestinian policemen will  arrive in the autonomy a short time after the signing of the  agreement. They will arrive with their arms and other military  equipment and enter the Palestinian police bases. It was also  decided that as long as the IDF does not transfer the  responsibility to the Palestinian police, the policemen will  travel unarmed in the autonomous areas in order to avoid mishaps.</p>

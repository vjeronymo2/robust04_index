			<p>BFN     [Text] Changsha, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A symposium on  scientific and technological cooperation between China and Latin  America was held recently in Changsha, capital of central  China's Hunan Province.    People from Chinese research institutes and provincial and  municipal committees of science and technology attended the  symposium.    China has diplomatic relations with 17 countries in Latin  America and has trade relations with 33 Latin American countries  and 13 regions.    The total trade volume between China and Latin American  countries amounted to nearly three billion U.S. dollars last  year.    Since 1988, the two sides have been undertaking nearly 100  cooperation programs every year.    The scientific and technological cooperation not only  deepens  the mutual understanding of the scientists from the two sides  but also benefits their economic construction.</p>

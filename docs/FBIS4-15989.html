			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- There are seven or eight  strong mafia groups in Estonia, Sergei Kozlov, deputy chief of  the Tallinn police force, claimed at a press conference today.  Most of their members are non-Estonians, he said.    Kozlov said the so-called Riga, Perm, Novosibirsk,  Krasnodar,  Azerbaijan and Chechen groups are all great powers in Estonia.  The only Estonian group of note in the underworld is the  Saha-Loo or the so-called "poultry complex" gang, he said.    The police chief claimed the groups concentrate round people  most of whom live since long in Estonia and carry permanent  residence permits.    Igor Kalinin, one of the leaders of the Riga group that had  of late gathered strength in Estonia was recently killed in  Tallinn.    Kozlov told reporters Kalinin's slaying was an unpleasant  surprise to Tallinn's criminal police, since the police had been  able through him to keep the activity of the group in check to a  degree.    "Now a new man will take over and we haven't the slightest  idea who he is or which way organized crime will turn," Kozlov  stated.</p>

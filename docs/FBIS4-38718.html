			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Vegetation" rubric: </F> "`People's Patriotic Union' Needs a Great Russia and Socialism.  Only `Genuine Patriots' Will Be Admitted to The Newest Political  Organization"]    [Text] Today's Russia, "robbed and divided by  multinational companies," will become revived "as a Great  Power... on the road of socialism" only through the efforts of  patriots whose unity is supposed to lend them strength. The  founders of a "People's Patriotic Union" (PPU) see no other road  for their country, as they stated at the debut of the new  (three-week-old) political organization of patriotic orientation.    That the patriotic spectrum of the Russian political reality  is saturated does not deter members of the PPU coordination  council, who include Boris Isayev, Yuriy Voronin, and Boris  Tarasov among others. According to PPU Coordination Council  Chairman Aleksandr Sarychev, "The more parties, the better;  natural selection will take over and the unnecessary ones will  die out." Besides, Mr. Sarychev explained, the new "Union"  called upon to unite "only genuine patriots of Russia," without  engaging in a standoff with the patriotic camp, will at the same  time become an alternative to it owing to the fact that the PPU  "is not going to thrust any philosophical dogmas on anyone."    The "Union" is open for individual and collective  membership,  and for the sake of the revival of Russia it is prepared to  cooperate with everybody save "extremists, nationalists, and  fascists." Mr. Sarychev declined to specify whom precisely the  PPU regards as fascists and nationalists, voicing the hope that  "these organizations may change their mind yet and give up their  current ideas."    An economic program that the PPU has already managed to  start  formulating was described by one of its developers, Yuriy  Voronin, doctor of economic sciences. Recognizing that  "Gaydar's course of reforms" has "the right to exist," and  denying this right to "today's resultant changes made by  pseudo-democrats," Mr. Voronin maintained that bringing the  country out of "the structural crisis is possible only through  increasing in every way the state's influence on the economy."  As for prosperity, the chief economist of the PPU is convinced,  Russia can achieve it "only if it embarks on the road of a  socially just system -- socialism." The compilers of the  program allow for free market and private ownership elements,  however, but only "in proportions acceptable for Russia."    In their day-to-day activities members of the PPU will be,  "without endless meetings,... constructively criticizing the  government" and preparing in their own midst competent  politicians for all the power branches. "People's Patriots,"  according to the assurances of their leaders, do not share the  calls by some opposition parties for early presidential  elections since they are confident that a disunited opposition  will be defeated. In this connection, the "People's Patriotic  Union," which so far has 562 members, is planning, without  hastening events or limiting their activities to Moscow, to  create their structures all over Russia. In a single, organized  bloc, Borisov is confident, the "patriots will come to power  beyond any doubt."</p>

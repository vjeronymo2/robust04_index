			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] In a recent exclusive interview with INTERFAX  President Islam Karimov described as the biggest problem of his  country the forced transition to a local currency. He claimed  that Uzbekistan resisted the withdrawal from the ruble zone for  a long time. He said the worst consequence of the change was  the spiritual separation of two million ethnic Russians from  their native land. He favored a discussion by interested members  of the CIS of the formation of a common monetary system with  Russia.    Meanwhile, observers say the president is taking additional  steps to stabilize the local currency. Karimov signed a  government resolution stopping all transactions with Russian  banknotes as of 15 April.    The purpose of the decision is to strengthen the circulation  of sum coupons and increase their purchasing power. The  document permitted all legal entities (public and private) as  well as individuals to sell goods and offer services for hard  currency on condition that all transactions are registered.    In keeping with the decision after 15 April the exchange  rates of the sum will be determined through regular trading at  the Uzbek Currency Exchange. So far exchange rates have been  set by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan on the basis of the data  supplied by the Central Bank of Russia.    The document provides for the formation of a network of  exchange outlets for the public and allows private individuals  to exchange currencies provided they have a licence from the  Central Bank.    Under the decision after 15 April all companies must sell to  the Central Bank 30 percent of their foreign currency returns  out of which 10 percent will be purchased by the Ministry of  Finance for the Uzbek currency reserve and 5 percent by the  government of Karakalpakia (an autonomous republic of  Uzbekistan) and regional administrations for the formation of  local currency reserves.    After 1 May in keeping with the decision settlements with  companies in other former Soviet republics will be conducted  only on clearing basis or in hard currency.    IF Note: At the moment in Tashkent the Russian ruble sells  for 10-11 sums and $1 for 20,000-22,000 sums.</p>

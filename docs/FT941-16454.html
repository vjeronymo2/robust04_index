			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / International Company News: Italy's yen bond open to Japanese investors The Republic of Italy's Y300bn global bond offering, due to be launched today, will be the first yen deal available to all investors in Japan, as well as Europe and the US, following the liberalisation of Japanese financial regulations last month. It will be the largest yen offering outside the domestic market. Previously, international bonds could only be sold in Japan after a 90-day lock-up period, and then only to large institutions. Because the Italian deal has a Securities Registration Statement, it can be placed with both institutional and retail investors in Japan. The process is similar to registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US market, and allows underwriters to sell bonds to a much broader investor base. Daiwa Securities, one of the arrangers of the transaction, said that 'the whole transaction could be absorbed in the domestic market, but that's not the purpose of the deal'. If it were placed solely in the domestic market, it would be likely to become illiquid. The seven-year issue is expected to be priced to yield 40-45 basis more than the No. 140 Japanese government bond due June 2001. Following a further rally in the Japanese government bond market last week, this would give a yield of about 3 1/2 per cent. According to Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian Treasury's international borrowing programme, the pricing reflects an improvement in Italy's performance in the bond market in the last year. However, with elections due later this year, Italian bonds could again become volatile in the face of political uncertainty. Foreign borrowing for 1994 has not been set, but Mr Giovannini said that it would remain around 4 per cent to 5 per cent of total debt. Last year, Italy borrowed Dollars 12.5bn in international markets.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SOVIETS FINALLY TO SEE 'GWTW'  </P> <P> The movie may not sound romantic as "Unesennye Vetrom."  </P> <P> But in Russian it's "Gone With the Wind," and it's making its premiere in the  Soviet Union next week.  </P> <P> That's 51 years after the U.S. debut of David O. Selznick's film classic about  the Civil War that starred Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.  </P> <P> The film's newest venue will include a fund-raiser in Moscow for fighting AIDS,  said media tycoon Ted Turner, whose Turner Entertainment Corp. owns the film.  </P> <P> "It's a pleasure to share this crown jewel in the TEC library with the citizens  of the Soviet Union," Turner said in a statement Monday.  </P> <P> The film's first Soviet screening will be Oct. 19 at Moscow's October Cinema.  The following night it will be seen in Tbilisi.  </P> <P> The current versions for Soviet consumption are in English with Russian  subtitles and there are plans to dub a version in Russian for release in  January.  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / People: Salaryman for West Midlands The West Midlands Development Agency has a new representative in Japan - a former salaryman from Mitsubishi - who had, until this week, never been to the West Midlands. Yasuhide Shigematsu, 54, says he knew the region 'by reputation' and feels that 'there is more due to happen in Europe than in North America as far as Japanese companies are concerned. I wanted to be part of that,' he adds. He is currently spending two weeks finding his way around the place. To date, the West Midlands has attracted around 60 Japanese companies employing over 8,000 people, as well as seven of the country's banks that have recently set up representative offices. The agency contends that today's inward investment decisions are affected less by recession in the UK than by Japanese companies' own domestic problems, however, which means the Japanese are significantly delaying all decisions about overseas expansion. One of Shigematsu's tasks while he is in Britain is to make recommendations as to whether his future marketing strategy should adapt to this change by concentrating more heavily on specific sectors - in contrast to the more generalised approach that has been applied until now. Shigematsu comes from the machinery division of Mitsubishi; outside Japan he worked on the sales and marketing side in both the US and South Africa. He also points out that he has been involved in setting up two joint ventures, one in China and one in Taiwan. He takes over from Ichiro Fujita, a banker with fluent English who had been promoting the region to the Japanese for the past four years. ***** DURACELL International, the US alkaline battery maker which has thrived since being taken private in a leveraged buy-out four years ago, has appointed a new head of its substantial European operations. He is Christophe Ripert, who was previously responsible for Duracell's operational activities in France, Spain, Portugal, the Benelux countries and Switzerland. He will move from Paris to the company's European headquarters in Crawley in the UK. Ripert's predecessor, Peter Schatz, has assumed responsibility for managing Duracell's business alliance with Toshiba Battery of Japan and Varta Batterien of Germany to develop a new generation of nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries. Ripert will inherit a sensitive post at Crawley. The company announced in January that it would progressively wind down its components manufacturing plant in the town by August shedding 320 jobs. ***** John Hignett, currently md finance of GLAXO HOLDINGS, is appointed md corporate funds, and John Coombe is appointed md finance, also on the board. ***** Michael Hammond, md of Victoria Wine, has been appointed to the board of ALLIED-LYONS RETAILING. ***** Wolfgang Nitschke (above right) has been appointed general manager of the London Wilshire Hotel. Since 1990, he has been vice-president Europe, for Regent International Hotels, which will manage the new hotel. John Waring (above left), former head of personnel at The Dorchester, has been appointed director of personnel. ***** Ralph Stevens, md of Greenhill Chemical Products, is also appointed md of Anteco, both subsidiaries of YULE CATTO. ***** Don Sloan, marketing director, has been appointed to WOOLWORTHS main board. ***** David Harding, deputy finance director of TI, has been appointed finance director; Reg Moore has resigned from the board of Dowty and will act as a consultant to TI. ***** Steven Glick has been appointed group legal adviser and company secretary of GRASEBY on the retirement of Donald Lester. ***** Les Tench, formerly md of Steetley Building Products, has been appointed md  -Britain for CRH. ***** JEFFERSON SMURFIT Group, the Irish paper, packaging and financial services company, has announced another management reshuffle involving the ubiquitous Smurfit clan. Dermot Smurfit, joint deputy chairman, and younger brother of group chairman Michael Smurfit, is to become chairman and chief executive of Smurfit Continental Europe. He will have responsibility over France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. He replaces Ray Miezelis who retired earlier this year for personal reasons. The continental businesses had a turnover last year of IPounds 400m, generated operating profits of IPounds 39.8m and employ about 3,850 people. Dermot Smurfit is replaced as chairman and chief executive of Smurfit UK by Patrick (Paddy) Wright (above). He is a past president of the Confederation of Irish Industry. Michael Smurfit's son Anthony who is chief executive of the UK print and packaging division will report to him. The UK operations had a turnover last year of about IPounds 193m and made profits of IPounds 13.6m. ***** Michael Latham, the former Tory MP for Rutland and Melton who retired at the last election, is returning to his old stable, the Building Employers Confederation (BEC), as public affairs consultant to it and its private house-building subsidiary the House-Builders Federation. He comes at the invitation of Ian Deslandes, acting director general of the BEC. The two have known each other since the mid-1960s when they were working at the Conservative research department. Latham became the director of the HBF between 1971 and 1973, and, before winning Melton in February 1974, brought in Deslandes as his successor. Deslandes is now pleased to be employing the services - and political contacts - of 49-year-old Latham about three days a week. Since recession in the construction industry is BEC's main preoccupation at present, one of his first tasks will be to help persuade the government to prolong the stamp duty 'holiday' on house purchases beyond August. Latham, who says his other main interest apart from the construction industry is 'reconciling Christian and Jewish interests' is now also the director of the Council of Christians &amp; Jews. While he felt that 18 years in the Commons was enough, he mentions that he is considering standing for the European parliament in two years' time.</p>

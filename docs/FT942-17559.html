			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Russia agrees to private ownership of farmland The Russian cabinet has agreed a plan allowing state and collective farms to auction off land to their workers as private property - the first time Russians will be able to acquire title to land in the country's history. This potentially massive shift in property rights in the agricultural sector was agreed by ministers on Thursday. The decree law, which does not have to be approved by parliament, will be signed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, when he returns from a trip to Hungary next week. The decision follows a year-long pilot project developed between the International Finance Corporation - an arm of the World Bank - and the administration of the Nizhny Novgorod region north east of Moscow. Mr Chernomyrdin surprised both radicals and conservatives last month when he praised the Nizhny project. The decree instructs local authorities to introduce the system pioneered in Nizhny throughout their areas, though state and collective farms will be able to choose whether or not to take it up. Under the system, farm workers and pensioners each receive a voucher entitling them to a part of the land and machinery. They are encouraged to form companies with other workers to bid for, and create, viable farm units. The Nizhny experiment shows that most workers do form co-operative enterprises. Nizhny will remain central to the wider scheme, receiving a large slice of the initial Rbs18bn (about Pounds 6.6m) set aside for the programme to develop a centre for the training of managers and workers of privatised farms. The programme is particularly significant because of the conservative leadership of the agricultural sector, represented in the cabinet by Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, the deputy prime minister, and Mr Victor Khlystun, the agricultural minister. These ministers have already signed the decree with Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical deputy premier for privatisation, who is likely to take charge of the programme. Although parliamentary approval is not needed for the decree itself, it will probably be required for the detailed legislation. Opposition among the deputies may make its passage uncertain, but support from conservative ministers will help, as will signs of its popularity with farm workers. Before the Communist revolution, legal title to all land was vested in the Tsar. The seizure of land from peasants for collectivisation during the late 1920s and early 1930s caused widespread starvation which killed millions. Hungary wary of deal, Page 2</p>

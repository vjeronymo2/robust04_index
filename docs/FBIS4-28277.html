			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 8 Jun (MENA)--North Korean Foreign Minister  Kim Yong-nam has accused the United States of abandoning the  commitments it made during the first and second rounds of joint  talks with North Korea last summer in Geneva on the nuclear  issue in the Korean peninsula.    In an interview with AL-JUMHURIYAH that will be published on  Thursday, the foreign minister explained that the most important  of these commitments was to continue the dialogue and the  negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang to reach a  peaceful solution to the problem, respect the sovereignty of  North Korea, stop the military maneuvers that the United States  conducts with South Korea, and replace the lead-operated nuclear  reactor in North Korea with one operated by light water [wa  istibdal al-mufa'il al-nawawi lada kuriya al-shamaliyah wa  al-ladhi ya'malu bi al-rasas bi mufa'il jadid ya'malu bi al-ma'  al-khafif].    The Korean official affirmed that his country has offered  all  facilities to the inspection committees sent by the  International Atomic Energy Commission. The commission made  unacceptable requests to Pyongyang to open the military bases  for inspection, based on information and photographs taken by  U.S. spy satellites. This led the Pyongyang government to  reject the request and to propose a four-point initiative to  solve the crisis. These are: resumption of the bilateral talks  between Washington and Pyongyang; U.S. withdrawal of its nuclear  weapons from South Korea; North Korean submission of the  necessary guarantees to accept periodic and non-periodic  inspection of its nuclear installations; and North Korean return  to the treaty banning the dissemination of nuclear weapons as a  full member with all obligations.    Answering a question about North Korea's position if the UN  Security Council adopts a resolution to impose sanctions against  it, the North Korean foreign minister said that in such a case  his country will withdraw from the treaty banning the  dissemination of nuclear weapons and will view such a resolution  as a declaration of war. It will not sit idle in the face of  the plots being prepared against it.</p>

			<p>Antidrug   Efforts   <F P=102> PA2705144294 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1639 GMT 24 May  94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2705144294 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City NOTIMEX </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Foreign  Ministry today favorably reacted to an official U.S. report  acknowledging the struggle the Havana Government has been waging  against drug trafficking. Miguel Alfonso, a Cuban Foreign  Ministry spokesman, referring to the U.S. State Department  report issued last week, told the media: "It is belated, but we  welcome it."    The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministry does not yet  have any official analysis of the document, which is being  analyzed by the Directorate of Multilateral Affairs. Alfonso  announced, though, that this "recognition" of Cuba's official  policy for the control of drug trafficking "is somewhat belated."    The U.S. State Department report pointed out "efforts the  Cuban Government has made to prevent drug trafficking in its  territorial waters and air space." The document also praised  the steps the Caribbean nation has taken in this direction and  noted that the Cuban authorities have reinforced their  antidrug-trafficking struggle. The Cuban spokesman stated: "Our  government's policy on the struggle against drug trafficking is  long-lived."</p>

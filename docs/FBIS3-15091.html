			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 1 March carries the "Details" program,  hosted by Sergey Dorenko, who discusses the balance of political  forces in Russia after the release of the coup plotters from  Lefortovo Prison over the weekend.    Dorenko introduces Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma,  as an intelligent and diplomatic politician who was largely  responsible for pacifying passions after the release. Rybkin  had a meeting with President Yeltsin today, described by Dorenko  as "scandalous because it did not produce any scandal." Dorenko  continues: "Rybkin was surprised at the haste with which the  Lefortovo inmates were released, said he did not know anything  about the presidential staff pressurizing Kazannik, and declared  that any fresh disturbances with old protagonists taking part  will be suppressed by the president, whose actions will be  supported by the Duma." Rybkin is then briefly shown comparing  the coup plotters with some spoiled children who "screamed and  cried, stamped their feet, or maybe dropped on the floor in the  kitchen and kicked and got all covered with jam -- well, such  things happen, you know."    Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov then says in a short  interview: "During the conversation when presidential staff  tried to stop the procurator signing the amnesty order, Kazannik  several times suggested disbanding the Duma -- he returned to  this option about three times. It was Kazannik, the knight of  righteousness who is guarding the law, who proposed this."    On the other hand, Dorenko says, "Rybkin could have made a  good snake-charmer. He speaks in the quiet voice of a  self-assured person. I entered his study today fully convinced  that the authorities were going through another relationship  crisis, and reemerged fully convinced that I had been  hallucinating." "After the Duma won the main point, Ivan Rybkin  is ready to make concessions about secondary points," he adds.    Rybkin then says in an interview clip: "God forbid that  those  who are being released today thanks to the magnanimity of their  country, the president, and the State Duma should spurn it or  forget about it and start again, in the Moscow streets or  elsewhere, the political thuggery which led to the tragic events  of 4 October. The president, together with the State Duma and  the Federation Council, will take most severe measures to stop  such behavior. My personal opinion is that they [putschists]  will have enough goodwill, intelligence, and human decency to  behave differently."    Dorenko then comments on the chances of a state of emergency  being introduced. He says this is unlikely because neither the  Duma nor Yeltsin's closest entourage are interested in it. He  continues: "I understood from my conversation with Rybkin today  that he would not play the card of miners' discontent, so that  the idea of introducing the state of emergency would not as much  as enter the president's mind." "The main compromise of the day  is that the Duma has exchanged the release of Lefortovo  prisoners for their arrest in case of even the slightest future  misbehavior. Rybkin has managed to persuade Yeltsin that this  is exactly what he, Yeltsin, has always wanted. As for the  Kazannik episode, which looks so vexatiously embarrassing  against this idyllic background, the authorities say it was just  a misunderstanding," Dorenko concludes.</p>

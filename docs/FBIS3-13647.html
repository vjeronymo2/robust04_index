			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev and military correspondent Arye </F> Kiesel]    [Excerpts] For the first time in the Gaza Strip -- and for  the first time since the signing of the Israeli-PLO Declaration  of Principles -- the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] yesterday  evacuated a whole military base from Gaza's Rimal neighborhood.  The vacated area went back to the residents of the  neighborhood. Confirming the report, official military sources  noted that the evacuation came as part of the redeployment of  troops in the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted]    Military correspondent Arye Kiesel adds: The evacuation of  the base yesterday came after Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin gave  his consent to begin a real evacuation from the Gaza Strip. A  senior military source in the Southern Command said yesterday:  "We are done with `thinning out the fat' from the Gaza Strip.  The work was done in accordance with the operational order  concerning a redeployment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and  regardless of the massacre in Hebron."    Defense establishment sources voiced their assessment  yesterday that the prime minister had given his consent for two  reasons: First, as a public gesture to the inhabitants of the  Gaza Strip and Fatah members there; second, to enable the IDF to  carry out a rapid evacuation in the event that the peace talks  resume and an agreement is reached on the beginning of the  evacuation.

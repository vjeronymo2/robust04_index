			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): City switched on for illuminating results - RECs The regional electricity companies' (recs) interim results season gets into full swing this week with the City expecting high dividend increases following the 21 per cent rise announced on Thursday by Seeboard, the first of them to report. Midlands tomorrow, Swalec (Wednesday) and Norweb (Friday) are all expected to raise payments to shareholders by at least 15 per cent and possibly considerably more. Profit growth will also be healthy, although this will be of less interest to the City as so much of electricity companies' profits are made in the second half of the year including winter. The City will also be looking for the companies' views of the forthcoming flotation of the National Grid which the recs own. Seeboard surprised investors by announcing that it would demerge its holding in the Grid by transfering shares to shareholders if a flotation takes place. This puts pressure on others to follow suit, although some will want to wait until the conclusion of talks with the government before making an announcement. Northern Ireland Electricity is expected to raise dividends by about 15 per cent when it reports today. Scottish Hydro-Electric, which announces results on Thursday, is expected to lift payments by 8 to 12 per cent</p>

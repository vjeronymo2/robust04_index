			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement read by Uladzimir Pyatrovich Zametalin, press </F> secretary of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, from the  "Panorama" feature; place and date not given; live or recorded]    [Text] Good evening, viewers! In connection with the fact  that some mass media -- first and foremost Ostankino Television  -- are making tendentious comments on the recent developments in  Belarus, I consider it my duty to comment on a statement that  was issued on this occasion and distributed via all mass media  channels today. The Belarusian nation, which lost one quarter  of all its people during World War II, values stability and its  joint historic roots with the fraternal Russian people more than  anything else. The attempts to wreck the natural integration  processes of the two sovereign states -- Belarus and Russia --  have no future because they lack common sense. Belarusian  national extremists are pursuing this policy contrary to the  desire of the absolute majority of Belarusian people to restore  historical logic to the further development of the two fraternal  states. This is why the public did not back the so-called  all-Belarusian political strike on 15 February. The working  people of Belarus proved themselves to be at a higher level and  wiser than the nationalist adventurers, and they gave preference  to the constitutional path of socially oriented reforms. The  calls of the strike organizers had the opposite effect and  brought people out into the squares of many Belarusian towns to  demand firm social guarantees and rigid control over the  economy, including the restoration of the USSR.    The strike, in which between 100,000 and 3,000 [as heard]  people participated in various regions, allows us to state  definitely that Belarus remains a democratic, constitutional,  and stable state. The planned political action aimed at  torpedoing the economic union that is being created between  Belarus and Russia was a failure. In this situation, we greatly  regret to report that Ostankino Television newscasts gave  tendentious coverage to the developments in Belarus. Not only  was the comment on the political strike in the newscasts  extremely exaggerated, and not only was an absurd, preposterous  conclusion made about instability in Belarus, but the right to  speak on behalf of the Belarusian people was kindly given to  Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Belarusian Popular Front, who is  known in the Republic for his extreme views rejecting everything  that is Slavic and Russian. Ostankino Television did not see  fit to consider that, according to opinion polls, the so-called  Belarusian national democrats are supported by only 7 or 8  percent of the population.    At sharp turning points in history, politics cannot and must  not be out of step with public opinion [passage indistinct] in  strict accordance with the international agreement on human  political rights, by which I mean clauses 19 and 20 of that  document. Thank you. I wish you all the best.</p>

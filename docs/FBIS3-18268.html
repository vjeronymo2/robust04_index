			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "enn": "Trust Agency Companies Lay Off 34,000"] </F>   [Text] Berlin, 23 Feb -- This year the Trust Agency  companies will lay off about 34,000 of their 149,000 employees  for operational reasons. This is the result of a Trust Agency  poll. However, part of this personnel reduction has already been  implemented, the Trust Agency announced in Berlin on Wednesday  [23 February]. The Trust Agency thus refuted reports that in  Saxony-Anhalt alone 22,000 lay-offs are imminent and in  Thuringia 10,000. Even the 29,000 employees of Trust Agency  companies that are in the process of being liquidated are not  all affected by lay-offs, it is said, because so far one-third  of the jobs in liquidated companies have been preserved. In  addition, the Trust Agency points out that not all of those  laid-off will be released into the labor market. More than half  of those who have been dismissed so far have been included in  labor market policy measures. Before the beginning of  privatization in 1990, about 4 million people had worked in  Trust Agency companies. Today the proportion of Trust Agency  employees in the overall number of people employed in eastern  Germany is only 2.9 percent. Two-thirds of the remaining  149,000 employees work in companies still to be privatized,  including 22,000 in management companies. A total of 19,000  people work in companies that have already been sold. In  addition, 15,000 people are employed in brown coal improvement  companies, which will probably be financed until 1997 via  Article 249h of the Labor Promotion Law.</p>

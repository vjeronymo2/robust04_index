			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish at 0200 GMT on 2 February broadcasts its regularly  scheduled 60-minute weekly "Democracy 94" program which this  week consists of a live interview with Ernesto Perez Balladares,  presidential candidate for the Revolutionary Democratic Party,  PRD, by "Democracy 94" host Hugo Enrique Famania.    Famania begins by giving the following resume: "Dr. Ernesto  Perez Balladares has a Ph.D. in Economics and Business  Administration from a U.S. university. He was born in Panama  City on 28 June 1946 and spent most of his youth in Chiriqui  Province. He was Citibank's corporate credit manager for Panama  and Central America in 1971. He entered public life as a member  of the Legislative Commission in 1975. Perez Balladares was  minister of finance and treasury and of planning and economic  policy during President Basilio Lakas' administration; President  Aristides Royo kept him as minister of planning and economic  policy; and President Ricardo de la Espriella appointed him  general manager of IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and  Electrification]. He also stands out as member of the  negotiating team for the 1977 canal treaties. His political  life began when the PRD was founded in 1979. He rose in this  organization, which was the political arm of the military  regime, and went from grass-roots group president -- the lowest  echelon in the party's organizational chart -- to PRD general  secretary in 1982. His estrangement and reserve with the  party's line goes back to when Manuel Antonio Noriega was made  commander of the then National Guard in 1983. His coolness  increased after the 1984 elections. This attitude, however,  contrasts with his decision to accept the appointment to be the  campaign manager for Colina [National Liberation Coalition]  presidential candidate Carlos Duque Jaen in 1989. After the 20  December 1989 U.S. military action, he assumed a more critical  and active position in the PRD. He actively participated in the  party's internal reorganization and won the PRD internal  election to again occupy the post of general secretary in 1992.  He was elected presidential candidate for the May 1994  elections at the PRD convention held on 31 July 1993, and thus  became the first elected citizen to run for this position.  Since then, the polls indicate that his popularity ratings have  increasingly expanded and currently place him as the front  runner."    After this profile, Famania asks Perez Balladares why he  distanced himself from the PRD in 1983 to return later as  Duque's campaign manager. He replies that the party had  requested that he be Duque's campaign manager in an electoral  process that was very difficult and was practically lost. He  adds: "I could have refused but this would have been disloyal  to my party. I assumed my responsibility at the time and  absolutely do not regret anything I did." Famania asks the  candidate what his position was when the military tried to cheat  in the 1989 elections. Perez Balladares replies that his  management of the Duque campaign ended on election day and that  Duque and himself had recommended that the government "and those  who gave orders at the time" accept Guillermo Endara's victory  and that "Mr. Noriega try to find an honorable solution to his  situation."    Famania mentions that the PRD lost the 1989 elections  overwhelmingly and has now appeared, with him as a candidate,  for the 1994 elections and is leading all the polls. The  candidate explains that the PRD is a totally new party, which  has been reorganized democratically and thus become much  stronger. Famania notes that analysts have stated that the PRD  has received positive poll ratings because it started  campaigning before the rest of the parties. Perez Balladares  laughs and says: "I believe that is wishful thinking by our  opponents."    Famania recounted that the Arnulfist Party candidate has  called "all the political parties to unite in a large civil  alliance against the PRD" and asks Perez Balladares if he thinks  such an alliance is possible. The PRD candidate says he does  not know if it is possible but notes that this alliance is based  on vested economic interests and "not based on programs to solve  the country's problems." The candidate adds that the PRD will  contend with the candidates its opponents present and that they  will continue with their campaign "to explain our programs,  proposals, solutions, and the opportunities we hope to offer.  The Panamanians will be the ones to decide on election day."    Famania asks him if the PRD will form alliances to control  the Legislative Branch and Perez Balladares answers that the  word alliance has been used in an attempt to unite forces to  parcel out the country and that "what we really need is for all  sectors in the country to reach a national agreement" to lead  the country through the especially delicate period of the turn  of the century.    Famania asks: "Don't you think the PRD's ties with the  last period of the military regime could negatively impact your  popularity rating?" He replies: "I believe it is evident that  a return to the past, in addition to being stupid, is absurd.  The immense majority of Panamanians understand this is totally  impossible, even if someone, who would not be us, wanted to  return to the past. We do not propose a return to any past  system, but there are people who seem to be anchored to such an  idea. They can only see the country as it existed in 1989. Let  me tell you something: The people and country demand that we  solve the problems of today, 1994, not the ones of 1989."    Famania asks Perez Balladares if he would be willing to  bring  Noriega back to Panama to have him complete his prison sentence  here; the candidate dismisses emphatically this possibility,  adding: "We have many problems to solve in the future. We have  a big national challenge and cannot distract ourselves with  subterfuges, such as bringing people back to the country,  persecuting people, carrying out retaliations, or digging up  past issues. We have much to do ahead of us. We do not have  time for this."    The program host mentions that Balladares has promised to  build an expressway to Colon and other works if he wins the  elections and asks how he plans to finance them. The candidate  answers: "They are not promises. I have presented proposals to  the country. My proposals are based on the need to find quick  alternatives to promptly solve our serious unemployment problem,  which will be my government's number one priority." He adds:  "How will they be financed? The works will be financed in the  same way they have been financed by all the developing  countries; the private sector and the government join efforts to  carry them out. All our proposed works can be carried out  effectively. I have already received concrete offers from three  firms to build the Panama-Colon expressway."    Famania says it has been noted that the firm that builds the  expressway will not recover its investment within the 20-year  term established by the law. He asks if the PRD plans to change  the laws, to which Balladares replies: "We will have to give  the firm that builds the road the necessary time for it to  recover its investment and make a reasonable profit." The  program host asks if his government would invest in such works,  and Balladares answers: "There has to be a participation. I  believe the government--in the extent that we generate internal  savings--will have to participate together with the private  firms." Famania then asks how will the government "generate  internal savings," and Perez Balladares says: "Savings are  obtained with an austere government program."    Famania broaches the issue of privatization, saying the PRD  maintains that public services should not be privatized. He  asks: "Isn't this a bit like swimming upstream, because all the  countries are privatizing their public services to make them  more efficient?" Balladares says: "We say there are basic  services that have to be government monopolies. One of them is  the Idaan [National Water and Sanitation Institute]. I believe  water is a priority item in any country and that it must be  managed by the government. Another item is the distribution of  electricity. There is no incentive for any private firm to  implement a rural electrification program, because it is not  profitable. For the government such a program is fundamental to  integrate the marginal population, mostly in the interior of the  Republic, to the country's development." He adds: "To talk about  an out-an-out privatization process or to oppose such actions  based on an ideological premise is a mistake. As a government,  we have to do the things that will provide more social benefits,  be it with private, public, or mixed firms."    Famania questions the benefits of having the government  manage basic services, which are not offering quality service.  The candidate says: "I believe some of those services can be  privatized, because the government does not have the needed cash  flow to increase or improve the services rendered by those  institutions. Somehow, those services--especially the ones I  mentioned--must continue to further national development and,  thus, must be controlled by government." He adds: "Let me tell  you something else: Those services are not efficient, because  we made the last investments to produce water, for example. We  built the Chilibre water-processing plant a long time ago.  Nothing else has been done in this field. What was the last  major thoroughfare built to alleviate the serious traffic  problem in Panama City? It was the Tumba Muerto Avenue, which  we built in 1971 or 1972, more than 20 years ago. Nothing more  has been done since then."    Famania says the current economic order is different to the  one that existed in the 1970's, and he asks if a PRD government  will be able to build such works now. The PRD candidate  emphatically answers affirmatively. "We can do so because we  are creative and will involve the private sector, unions, and  all public and private organizations interested in solving the  country's problems," he added.    Famania asks Perez about the PRD candidates filling the  ballot as presidential and vice presidential candidates --  instead of "splitting the cake" -- in spite of the alliance with  the Labor Party, PALA, and the Liberal Party. Perez responds  that the cake belongs to the Panamanian people and adds: "The  fact that we have achieved an alliance or a concerted effort to  be able to carry out a work program by broadening the  participation to other political parties while maintaining our  original proposal, clearly means that we are definitely not  willing to distribute political spaces but, instead, to carry  out a program for national solutions with those persons in our  political group, our friends who now share with us this  concerted effort, and other sectors -- independent or from other  parties -- who have the capacity for the job. The best men for  the public offices."    Famania goes on to ask about the plans for fighting  unemployment and Perez answers that the way to fight  unemployment is to attack the root of the problem which, in his  opinion, is the lack of proper education. Perez claims  education is not currently directed at the available job market.  He says they propose an integration of private enterprise with  the different universities and training centers so that, and  together with the Government, they can guide education toward  the jobs that will be available at the beginning of the 21st  century and in accordance with the demands from investors.    Then Famania says that the continuous teachers strikes will  be an to that goal and Perez contends that the last teachers  strike was one of the many wars caused by former Comptroller  General Ruben Dario Carles, of which he won none.    Perez criticizes the way the Current Government lost the  golden opportunity it had for buying the foreign debt and claims  his government would deal with the commercial foreign debt.    Later the two discuss the security in Panama and Perez says  that for the citizens' safety there must be a professional  police force and that a civilian must be kept at the head of the  police force. He adds: "What happens is that, according to the  very persons who have been dealing with the topic over the last  four years, there has been a policy of not backing, economically  -- and mainly from Mr. Carles' Comptroller's Office -- the  professionalization programs for that police force." Famania  then claims that young men do not want to be policemen due to  the low salaries and Perez responds that professionalizing the  police also means increasing their salaries.    Regarding the borders, Perez says the border with Colombia  must be watched by a professional force to control the illegal  aliens and drug trafficking.    On the subject of the defense needs of the Panama Canal in  accordance with the Canal Treaties, Perez says that an army is  not necessary for the defense of the Panama Canal, that such a  claim "was a subterfuge used to justify the [Panama] Defense  Forces [PDF] that were created. That absurd mistake cannot be  committed again. We do not need that; for the protection of the  Panama Canal areas we need the same type of protection used for  industrial installations anywhere in the world."    Famania then asks whether he would use former officers of  the  PDF as advisers, and Perez says that he has said many times  before that that stage is over and there is no going back. He  adds: "Those officers -- former officers of the Armed Forces --  have every right to participate as civilians in Panama's  civilian life, but they will never be reintegrated [into the  armed forces]."    Famania asks about the proposal to lower the retirement age  and Perez says they will study the topic and that he does not  believe that it is fair that different workers have the same  retirement age, particularly those whose bodies suffer greater  physical wear. About political persecution Perez says he is  already working on what he believes is the clue to good  administration of justice: a good attorney general.    Asked about the possibility of massive layoffs, Perez says  he  knows the vast majority of the public workers will vote for him  and that there will be no layoffs.    Finally, with regard to a political amnesty, Perez says that  topic has passed to a third plane, that those who were unfairly  in jail for political crimes have already been released, and  that those who have been sentenced will have to serve their  sentences.    Asked about his alleged renovation in spite of maintaining  his ties to the same persons involved in the past regime, Perez  responds that that is a false insinuation and his government  would use the most capable Panamanians regardless of their  political affiliation.</p>

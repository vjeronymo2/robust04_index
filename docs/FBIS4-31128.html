			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [B.I.M. report: "Revision of Osimo Agreement"] </F>   [Excerpt] Podgorica -- At yesterday's news conference Dr.  Novak Kilibarda, president of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro,  upheld the demands of individual political parties in Italy for  the revision of the Osimo Agreement. Kilibarda said that "one  needs to compensate the Italian citizens who used to live in  Dalmatia and had their possessions there" especially "because  they did not work on the side of the occupier but were loyal to  the Yugoslav authorities."    The president of the most numerous Montenegrin opposition  party emphasized that the sympathizers and members of his party  "will not defend Dalmatia from the Italians," and that they  would rather see "the Italians living in Split and Dubrovnik  than the Croats."

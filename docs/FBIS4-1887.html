			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Pakistan today again  asked the Afghan Government to help seek the safe and  unconditional release of two abducted Chinese and several  Pakistanis held by Mullah Salam in the Afghan territory.    The Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan Sardar Mohammad Roshan was  summoned to the foreign office here this morning and handed over  a diplomatic note urging the Afghan Government to intercede  urgently for arranging the safe release of these people, said a  Foreign Office press release issued here today.    Mullah Salam, an Afghan warrior belonging to  Ittehad-i-Islami  of Sayyaf, the coalition partner of President Rabbani, kidnapped  two Chinese engineers, Wang Qinbin and Zheng Gongbao in Bostan  area, some 40 kilometers from Quetta, capital of Baluchistan  Province on June 21, 1993.    He has been demanding ransom, return of Stinger missiles  allegedly captured by Pakistani troops and release of his  relatives jailed in Pakistan for the release of these two  persons which Pakistan refused.    His men also abducted eight Pakistanis in March and April  1993 separately as well as the deputy commissioner of  Baluchistan's Ziarat along with his driver and bodyguard in  March this year.    Besides kidnappings, Mullah Salam attacked Pakistan several  times by firing from across the border with multi-barreled  rocket launchers, mortars and automatic weapons resulting in a  number of casualties and heavy damage to property, the press  release said.    The Government of Pakistan has been trying its best to  secure  the safe and unconditional release of the abductees and resolve  the matter but unfortunately these efforts have not yielded a  positive outcome, said the release.    Pakistan called upon the Afghan Government to take urgent  and  meaningful measures not only to ensure the safe and  unconditional release of the abductees but also to prevent the  recurrence of such incidents, it added.</p>

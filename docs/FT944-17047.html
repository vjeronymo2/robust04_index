			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Policy fears push rouble to new low The rouble fell a further 6 per cent against the dollar yesterday, crashing through the 3,000 barrier on fears of rising inflation and deteriorating government finances. The government reacted calmly to the fall to 3,081 from Friday's close of 2,896, and traders said there was no intervention by the central bank. Markets are awaiting the outcome of ministerial negotiations on the Russian budget, expected to be presented to parliament during the present session. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, said there were still sufficient reserves to control the currency's fluctuations, even though the bank had spent Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the past few months to support the rouble. But a bank spokesman yesterday blamed the rouble's fall, which has been accelerating over the year, on speculative trading, and said reserves would not be wasted on fruitless intervention. 'We do not want to help market speculators,' he said. Russia's acting finance minister, Mr Sergei Dubinin, attempting to calm markets, said the drop was not justified by economic conditions. 'There will be no sharp rise in inflation because objectively all money supply indicators rule this out. There will soon be equilibrium, the market will stabilise, inflation and the dollar rate will move in parallel,' he said. The turmoil in the currency market will make it more difficult and expensive for the government to raise money in the Russian Treasury bill market, which will be much on the government's mind as it finalises the 1995 budget. Over the weekend, ministers flew to the holiday home of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, at the Black Sea resort of Sochi to try to settle the outstanding issues. The details of the budget will be critical for the confidence of the currency market when they are presented to the parliament next week. Currency traders said the inaction of the bank and the lack of a government policy statement were exacerbating the situation. 'We expect the devaluation to continue - possibly to 3,300 to the dollar this week - unless some drastic measures are taken by the government,' one trader said. The rouble's fall is damaging the government's domestic economic credibility as the queues lengthen outside currency exchange points and the rising price of imported goods hurts Russian consumers. The relative stability of the currency throughout the summer had led to a marked increase in savings and a growing belief in a more stable economy. Trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, with only thin liquidity, has proved highly volatile, with even small trades having a big impact on the rouble's value. But the rouble's fall has been on an accelerating trend. In July it had fallen 3.1 per cent against the dollar; in August, 4.5 per cent; in September, 17.8 per cent; and in the first few days of October 16.5 per cent. Since the start of the year the rouble has fallen from 1,247 to 3,081 against the dollar. Some correction to the rouble exchange rate was perhaps inevitable this autumn, given the recent rise in the inflation rate. The lower rouble may provide temporary relief to Russian industry and should particularly help the energy sector, which has been badly hit by the accumulation of inter-enterprise debts. The hard currency earnings of oil and gas companies will now be worth considerably more when translated back into roubles, helping to ease the sector's cash flow problems.</p>

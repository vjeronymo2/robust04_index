Lyukin, who will leave the post and return home to serve as  chairman of the parliament's international affairs committee,  said the Russian people were very disappointed with U.S. efforts  to help their country, the ASSOCIATED PRESS reported.    "I am not so insistent and urgent on advice from my foreign  friends on how to behave either toward my country or their  country," Lyukin said.    His comments on personnel affairs stemmed from the rising  U.S. concern over the departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fyodorov, both pro-Western, from the new Russian cabinet.    Lyukin said Washington should care less about "which  gentleman in our country should become minister of trade,  minister of finance, minister of something else."    He criticized the apparent U.S. position that "three or four  charismatic personalities will personify all this democracy."    "If it is the American understanding of what democracy is,  it  is strange for me," Lyukin said.    At the U.S. State Department, spokesman Mike McCurry said  "it  is less the personalities at issue and more the policy that is  reformers who is of utmost concern to the United States."    Acknowledging that "those reforms who most associated with  the policies of reform...might have been in the best position to  carry out those policies," McCurry said Washington will "wait to  see" if the new Russian administration would continue to fight  inflations and ease pains for the ordinary Russians.    During today's interview, Lyukin also criticized  Washington's  trying to dictate "where to deliver, whom to deliver" the  assistance.    He insisted that economic aid should be  government-to-government rather than to specific ministries that  the west "consider progressive and not to those they consider  less progressive."    Lyukin has been ambassador to the U.S. for about two years.</p>

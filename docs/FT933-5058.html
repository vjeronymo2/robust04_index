			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Investment body increases activity THE WOULD-BE investment regulatory body the Personal Investment Authority is to launch a campaign to capitalise on the growing support it is receiving. Although the plan for the PIA got off to a faltering start last September and it has slipped nearly 12 months behind its original timetable, it has now received the strong backing of the top investor protection body, the Securities and Investments Board. The PIA is expected to release this week further details of how it will absorb all the members of two existing regulators, the life industry's Lautro and financial advisers' Fimbra - and also certain investment firms regulated by Imro, another investment regulator, and others regulated by SIB. The objective is to bring all the regulation of retail investment products and services under the control of a single body. Members will range from the biggest banks and life assurance companies to the smallest independent financial advisers. The plans of the PIA include: Issuing a formal prospectus by the end of this year, leading in a few months to recognition by SIB. Selecting an 18-member board - a reduction on the 30-strong body originally proposed, but more than the board of 'perhaps 15' recommended by Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman. Authorising several thousand prospective member firms during the early months of 1994, with the aim of starting operations before the middle of the year. Recruiting a chief executive, following a search by headhunters Spencer Stuart.</p>

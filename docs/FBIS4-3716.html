			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the  External Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress  [NPC] issued a statement today in connection with a report on  Sino-British relations issued by the British Parliament's House  of Commons External Affairs Committee. The statement severely  denounces the British side for crudely interfering in China's  internal affairs. The following is the full text of the  spokesman's statement:    Since the beginning of last year, the British Parliament's  House of Commons External Affairs Committee has held several  hearings on the so-called China issue. On 13 April the  committee published a report: "British-Sino Relations Before and  After 1997." The report openly advocated [gu chui 7849 0706]  the adoption of a policy of further confrontation against China  on the Hong Kong issue and preposterously commented on China's  domestic affairs, thus crudely interfering in China's internal  affairs. In this regard we express our strong indignation and  regret.    On the Hong Kong issue, the report actually admitted that  the  British side, proceeding from its erroneous appraisal of the  prospects for the development of the situation in China, indeed  changed its policy toward Hong Kong, supported Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten's erroneous way of doing things on the  Hong Kong issue, continued to pursue confrontation against  China, and even agitated for [gu dong 7849 0520] "international  support" on the Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by the British  Parliament's House of Commons External Affairs Committee's  actually issuing such a document and adopting such a position on  the Hong Kong issue at a time when the truth of the controversy  between China and Britain over the question of the political  system in Hong Kong is being understood by more and more people  and when the British side indicated time and again its desire to  cooperate with China in other spheres.    The report preposterously claimed that by 1997 China may not  necessarily change the framework for the three-level political  system established according to the Hong Kong governor's "three  violations" program. The Chinese Government has stated many  times that in order to safeguard the dignity of the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Legislative Council and  regional organizations established according to the Hong Kong  governor's program can exist only until 30 June 1997. After  that, the first government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR], its Legislative Council, and  regional organizations must be established according to the  Basic Law. We resolutely support this solemn position of the  Chinese Government.    The report went so far as to attack Article 18 and Article  158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's  Republic of China, claiming that these articles are "a serious  potential threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR and to the  implementation of the joint declaration."    In accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the  Basic Law, the NPC Standing Committee has the power to decide,  when necessary, to place Hong Kong SAR in a state of emergency.  Article 158 of the Basic Law stipulates that the power of  interpretation of this law shall be vested in the NPC Standing  Committee. These provisions are concrete expressions that the  Chinese Government resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong beginning on 1 July 1997. The report's attack on these  provisions is utterly unjustifiable; it only reveals British  true motive to attempt to extend its control over and influence  on Hong Kong.    The report takes great pains to advocate promotion of  democracy and safeguard of human rights in Hong Kong. This only  makes people see through more clearly British hypocrisy and  ulterior motives on the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese Government  has pointed out on numerous occasions that the essence of  controversy over Hong Kong's political structure is not a  question of, indeed, whether to develop democracy or not; rather  it is a question of whether to observe international commitment  and whether to bring about the convergence with the Basic Law  and achieve Hong Kong's stable transition. Facts speak louder  than words. It was the Chinese Government which, in accordance  with the policy of "one country, two systems," at the earliest  proposed practicing "a high degree of autonomy" in Hong Kong and  "Hong Kong be governed by the Hong Kong people themselves." The  Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR also has adequate, specific  provisions on the development of democracy and the rights and  freedom to be enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong's  return to the embrace of the motherland. Under the British rule  of more than 100 years, when did Hong Kong enjoy democracy and  human rights? Even today, Britain still uses "Letters Patent,"  "Royal Instructions," and similar statutes of colonial rule to  govern Hong Kong. What qualifications does it have to talk  glibly about Hong Kong's democracy and human rights? Now that  only a few years before its withdrawal from Hong Kong, Britain  hypocritically and hurriedly talks volubly about what it calls  democracy and human rights. Its true motives are like "Sima  Zhao's ill intent known to all" [the villain's design is  obvious]. It merely tries to divide Hong Kong people and create  chaos there.    The British House of Commons External Affairs Committee's  report proposes the establishment of so-called human rights  commission and human rights monitoring organization in Hong  Kong. The goal is nothing other than to place new obstacles to  Hong Kong's smooth transition. The British should understand  that as in the case of the political framework, any decision  unilaterally made by the British side during the transitional  period on major matters spanning beyond 1997 will not be  recognized by the Chinese side.    The report also brazenly attempted to meddle and interfere  in  China's internal affairs by openly advocating Tibet's self-  determination. As is known to all, Tibet has been an  inalienable part of the Chinese territory since ancient times.  Before 1959, a feudal serf system was practiced there, which  went even further than the system practiced in the Middle Ages  in Europe in terms of darkness and cruelty. It is safe to say  that old Tibet was one of the regions in the world where human  rights were infringed upon most seriously. After abolishing the  feudal serf system, Tibet has taken the broad road of national  unity and economic development, with people living and working  in peace and contentment. This is a change of epoch-making  significance in safeguarding human rights and promoting social  progress.    The writer of the report dislikes such change but extols  those serf owners who trampled on human rights as "defenders of  human rights." This greatly ridicules human rights. In fact,  they did that in order to sabotage the unification and national  unity of China. May we offer a piece of advice to the writer of  the report -- that it would be better to take a prudent attitude  on the issue of Tibet because of Britain's historical role in  the past. We want to sternly point out that all attempts to  interfere in China's internal affairs by using the so-called  Tibet issue will be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese  people, including the compatriots of Tibetan nationality, and  that their attempts can never succeed.    The External Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons has also suggested that the British parliament should  make contacts with Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan" and has asked the  British Government to relax its restrictions toward Taiwan. It  should be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the People's Republic  of China is the sole legitimate government representing the  whole China. This has long been publicly recognized by the  international society. The absurd remarks made by the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons related to the  Taiwan issue runs counter to the principle for the establishment  of diplomatic relations between China and the United Kingdom.  The real intention of the committee is to create "two Chinas"  or "one China, one Taiwan." This will be resolutely opposed by  the entire Chinese people, including people in Taiwan.    The report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British  House of Commons also publicized "the Chinese threat" with an  ulterior motive in order to sow dissension between China and her  neighboring countries. All people know that China has always  followed an independent, peaceful foreign policy. China is a  positive factor in safeguarding peace and stability in the  world. Those who fabricate "the Chinese threat" are totally  groundless and their efforts will be futile.    The External Affairs Committee of the Chinese NPC has  attached great importance to maintaining and developing friendly  relations and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of  the British parliament. The Chinese side has never done  anything which would harm the United Kingdom, the British  parliament, or relations between the two countries. However,  recently some people of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  British House of Commons have repeatedly done things which will  harm relations between the two countries, while they have also  stressed the need to maintain and develop Sino-British  relations. People cannot but ask: What is their intention?  Where do they want to lead relations between the two countries?  We can say with certainty that the viewpoints and suggestions  which are hostile to China put forward in the report are not  only extremely harmful to Sino-British relations but will also  bring harm to the long-term interests of the United Kingdom. We  believe that those things will be disliked [bu yuan kan dao di  0008 1959 4170 0451 4104] by those who truly show concern for  and protect the traditional friendly relations between China and  the United Kingdom.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bass pubs sale to Mercury Leisure allows building programme to go ahead BASS, the brewery group, is selling 111 pubs to Mercury Leisure, a privately-owned restaurants and night-club company, for an undisclosed sum. The disposal of 73 managed and 38 tenanted pubs will enable Bass to proceed with plans to build 150 new pubs over the coming year without breaching the Department of Trade and Industry's ceiling of 2,000 outlets, which was imposed on Britain's leading brewers following an inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The transaction will double the size of Mercury Leisure's existing property portfolio, to be operated in future as Mercury Taverns. Mr Tony Sanders, joint managing director of the Tamworth-based company, said the acquisition would be financed through a mixture of new equity, funded by NatWest Ventures and borrowing from Barclays. The pubs, which are situated mainly in the Midlands, South Wales and the north-west of England, will transform Mercury into a 'major new pub group', according to Mr Sanders. Although unwilling to reveal the price, Bass said the cash consideration represented less than 1 per cent of the group's net assets.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMGEN ADOPTS PLAN TO HAMPER HOSTILE TAKEOVERS  </P> <P> Amgen, the Thousand Oaks biotechnology company, last week adopted a so-called  "poison pill" provision that would make it more difficult for someone to  acquire the company. Among other things, if someone acquires 20% or more of  Amgen's stock, it would allow Amgen's other shareholders to buy additional  Amgen stock at a 50% discount.  </P> <P> Amgen has several biotechnology drugs under development and is awaiting U.S.  Food and Drug Administration approval to sell its anti-anemia drug.  </P></p>

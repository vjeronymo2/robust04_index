A decree of the DPRK Central People's Committee on awarding  order of national flag first class to the Chongnyon film studio  was read out and then congratulatory messages from organizations  in the homeland conveyed.    In his congratulatory speech Ho Chong-man, chief  vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee, said  the 20-year history of the Chongnyon film studio is unthinkable  apart from the loving care and solicitude of the great leader  Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim  Chong-il. He recalled their wise guidance to the manufacture  and dissemination of film and video recordings of Chongnyon.    The Chongnyon film studio could develop into a reliable film  and video recordings producer and disseminator of Chongnyon and  register proud successes under the loving care of the great  leader and the dear leader, he stressed.    He said the workers of the studio should honorably discharge  their duty and role as a worthwhile propagandist and educator of  the chuche era, as a recorder of history.    A letter to Marshal Kim Chong-il was adopted at the meeting.</p>

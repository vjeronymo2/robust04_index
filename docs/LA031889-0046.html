			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGUA FREES 1,894 SOMOZA GUARD VETERANS  </P> <P> Nearly 10 years after their army collapsed in defeat in the Sandinista  revolution, 1,645 former national guardsmen walked out of a prison Friday in a  mass pardon aimed at ending the U.S.-backed rebellion against Sandinista rule.  </P> <P> In a ceremony resembling a high school commencement, the prisoners stood in  formation on a hot, wind-swept basketball court at the Modelo Prison as their  names were called. One by one, they stepped forward to collect certificates  attesting to their freedom with full rights of citizens.  </P> <P> Then, while loudspeakers blared recorded folk music, ropes separating the  guardsmen from their families dropped, setting off a scramble of tearful  reunions. Some of those freed dropped to their knees in prayer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shout With Joy'  </P> <P> "Finally, this nightmare is over," said Hazel Maraz Soto, 26, one of the  youngest prisoners, embracing his mother. She exclaimed, "I want to shout with  joy that my son has returned!"  </P> <P> Counting 249 prisoners under house arrest or home on furlough, the pardons  covered 1,894 people imprisoned for service in the army of the Somoza family  that ruled Nicaragua for 43 years until the Sandinista takeover of July, 1979.  </P> <P> Thirty-nine guardsmen remained behind bars, judged by the Sandinistas to be  guilty of serious war crimes or defiant prison behavior. The pardon did not  touch any of the 1,400 or more jailed Contra suspects, whose freedom has been  promised when the Contras lay down their weapons.  </P> <P> The prisoner release, the largest in Nicaragua in two wars spanning more than a  decade, was the first step taken to comply with President Daniel Ortega's  commitment under a month-old Central American peace accord, which also promises  elections in Nicaragua by next Feb. 25.  </P> <P> In return, the region's four other presidents agreed to help draft by mid-May a  plan for closing the Contra military camps in Honduras, a step that would  further cripple the idled rebel army.  </P> <P> Ortega has said the Bush Administration is "acting against" the regional accord  by saying it will seek as much as $50 million in non-military aid from Congress  to hold the rebels together in Honduras for one more year as a potential threat  to force Sandinistas to live up to the accord.  </P> <P> To demonstrate his compliance, Ortega brought the secretary general of the  Organization of American States, Joao Baena Soares, and foreign diplomats to  the prison ceremony 14 miles east of Managua.  </P> <P> In a later gathering in the capital, Ortega told diplomats and opposition party  leaders that he will soon send the National Assembly a series of proposed  changes in the electoral law and the law governing the news media, with the aim  of assuring open and fair elections.  </P> <P> He said the changes will be based on suggestions offered by 14 opposition  parties in talks with him in recent weeks, but he gave no details.  </P> <P> Calling the prisoner release "a transcendental act" that shows "the generosity  of the revolution," Ortega appealed to Washington to limit any new Contra aid  to the advancement of the regional peace pact -- the rebels' disarmament and  repatriation to Nicaragua or relocation in third countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rescheduled Date  </P> <P> The prisoner release had been scheduled for Sunday but was moved forward on two  days' notice when Sandinista officials realized that international attention  would be distracted by Sunday's elections in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders and some former guardsmen said the government seemed more  concerned about the public relations impact outside Nicaragua than the needs of  those freed to feel accepted as useful members of society.  </P> <P> Indeed, debate over the pardons did little to heal the wounds of the Sandinista  uprising that left an estimated 10,000 people dead in 1978 and 1979.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trepidation Voiced  </P> <P> One guardsman on the pardon list, Ramon Valle Arancibia, was the object of a  last-ditch citizens' campaign to keep him locked up. A mothers group accused  the ailing, 59-year-old prisoner of having taking part in a June, 1979,  massacre in a Managua neighborhood and driving the police bulldozer that  scooped the bodies into a mass grave.  </P> <P> "If I see that man on the street, I'll stone him, I assure you," declared  Angela Hernandez de Lorio, 55, whose son died in the incident. Valle was freed  anyway.  </P> <P> As they left prison Friday, most guardsmen claimed to be victims of unjust  prosecution for guilt by association. Some expressed varying degrees of  trepidation over returning to a society still tightly ruled by the one-time  guerrillas who defeated them.  </P> <P> Less than an hour after his release, Gustavo Mendoza, 32, looked nervously over  his shoulder and said he was afraid that Sandinista agents were following him.  "There is no security for us," he said.  </P> <P> A more typical outlook was expressed by Rodolfo Salmeron, 28, a former National  Guard officer from the mining town of Siuna, who said he was glad to be alive.  </P> <P> "This is historic," he said. "I think it's hard to find this kind of pardon in  other countries. I never thought I would get out because first they told us  that all the guards were going to die. But God never abandoned us, and now  we're free. Since I never did nothing to anybody, I don't feel the slightest  fear of going home."  </P> <P> In random interviews with 20 freed guardsmen, eight said they might leave  Nicaragua because they feel uncomfortable under Sandinista rule or want better  job opportunities. All but one said they were interested in moving to the  United States. The U.S. Embassy said there is no special consideration for  freed guardsmen in its strict immigration rules, although many guardsmen who  escaped before the Sandinista take-over or were freed later now live in the  United States.  </P> <P> The latest batch of guardsmen is being thrown onto a shrinking job market amid  a severe economic crisis and sharp cutbacks in public spending. Many said they  were worried more about finding work than about avoiding reprisals.  </P> <P> "I think about leaving, but if they give me a chance to work, I would rather  stay," said Juan de Dios Herrera, 33, who was trained in prison as a carpenter.  "I would feel much better with a place in the new society."  </P> <P> The newly freed prisoners will have several sources of assistance.  </P> <P> Mario Arevalo, an official at the Modelo Prison, said 220 of them will continue  working there, as they did as prisoners, in such jobs as making boots for the  Sandinista army, repairing government vehicles and building public housing.  </P> <P> The International Red Cross gave every freed prisoner a modest wardrobe to go  home in -- the first civilian clothes many had worn in a decade. It also  arranged their bus transport home, temporary lodging for about 40 guardsmen  with no known relatives in Nicaragua and food deliveries for four months.  </P> <P> The Church of God, a Pentecostal sect active inside the prison, will offer  former guardsmen job placement in rural cooperatives, according to the Rev.  Pedro Pablo Castillo, a former National Guard lieutenant colonel who left the  jail in a 1985 pardon. Seven inmates who left Friday will work for the church  as pastors, he said.  </P></p>

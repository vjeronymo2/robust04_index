			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JOHN LYNCH;  </P> <P> PERILS OF GYMNASTICS OBVIOUS TO ADAMEK  </P> <P> Watching them prance around barefoot and clad in white tights, gymnasts rank  low on the macho meter, but after serious examination of the sport, it is  difficult to challenge their courage.  </P> <P> Danger and injury are part and parcel of the day-to-day life of a dedicated  practitioner, which accounts for much of the sport's appeal, according to Shawn  Adamek, one of the top gymnasts in City Section history.  </P> <P> "When you master a skill by overcoming the danger and putting your fears behind  you, you feel like a man," the 18-year-old Monroe senior said. "It takes a long  time to get used to the danger. You try not think about it but you can't help  being scared. You've got to be an idiot not to realize how dangerous the sport  is."  </P> <P> Even those at the opposite end of the intelligence spectrum, however, fall prey  to the sport's dangers. Adamek (5-foot-11, 140 pounds) carries a 3.5  grade-point average, is editor of the school newspaper and will attend Stanford  next fall on a gymnastics scholarship. But academic achievement buys little  insurance against bad luck.  </P> <P> Adamek suffered a broken bone in his left forearm during a routine warm-up  drill before a match against University on March 30. While limbering up on the  high bar, his left hand became entangled and locked up while he swung around  the bar. He attributed the injury to a new pair of leather hand grips but said  that the accident could have happened to anybody.  </P> <P> "You can always lock up on the high bar. It's just part of the sport," he said.  </P> <P> Still, it led to a gruesome afternoon for Adamek. He hung for nearly a minute  with his arm wrapped around the bar and it took seven teammates to get him  down.  </P> <P> "I don't exactly remember how many times I went over but I could feel that my  hand wasn't moving," he said. "Some people say you go into shock but I never  did. I felt the whole thing."  </P> <P> Adamek was taken to the hospital where the worst part of the ordeal ensued.  After the bone broke in half, the pieces overlapped each other because the  surrounding muscles had cramped and contracted. Traction in the form of a small  weight attached to his arm was prescribed in order to separate the bones.  </P> <P> "That was probably the worst pain," he said. "For about 15 to 20 minutes I sat  there. They didn't give me any drugs. It was torturous."  </P> <P> Two days later, he underwent surgery that left two metal plates and 10 screws  in his arm. He missed two weeks of school and had the cast removed this week.  The pain has long since subsided, but he was reminded of the anguish when the  new City Section champion, Frank Baca of Huntington Park, was crowned this  week.  </P> <P> As a junior, Adamek led Monroe to the school's 10th City title and swept all  seven events in the individual championship, a feat accomplished only by  Monroe's David Moriel, who won an NCAA title at UCLA in 1987. Not only was  Adamek sidelined for Thursday's meet at University, he did not attend. Because  of his injury, he is unable to drive.  </P> <P> He faces a lengthy rehabilitation process and it seems likely that he will miss  this summer's junior national competition in Wisconsin. Perhaps the lone bright  spot for Adamek is his own history. He has learned the hard way that he is a  fast healer.  </P> <P> His gymnastics career started when he was 7, and, by the time he was 12, he  ranked among the top five in the country in the his age group. But as a  seventh-grader, he underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left  shoulder. He returned to competition after an 18-month absence and placed a  disappointing 60th in the junior nationals in the 15- to 18-year-old division.  </P> <P> "I was losing to guys I used to beat regularly and that was pretty hard to  take," he said.  </P> <P> A year later as a sophomore at Monroe, he competed in just one full meet.  First, he broke the top plate of his right foot during a floor-exercise  routine. Then, he broke his left foot in his first meet after the right foot  had healed.  </P> <P> Adamek's attitude after each injury has remained consistent: He wants to get  back on the pommel horse.  </P> <P> "I replay the injury all the time and try to make myself remember," he said.  "If I don't think about it, it could become my worst fear. I want to get back  to the gym, even if it's just to breathe the chalk."  </P> <P> Les Sasvary, who has coached at Monroe since 1963, calls Adamek his most  talented gymnast. He has seen his protege compete since he was 7 and is a close  friend of the Adamek family. Both he and Adamek's father Joseph escaped from  Hungary during the 1956 anti-government uprising that was eventually quashed by  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "This is very, very sad for Shawn," Sasvary said. "He's intelligent,  tremendously motivated and is lean and very flexible. Within a short time he  will emerge as one of the top collegiate gymnasts. One day he may be in the  Olympics."  </P> <P> Adamek says that he dreams of Olympic gold, but other goals are more immediate.  After a wasted senior season, he wants to start anew in college.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of luck involved with the Olympics," he said. "If you reach your  height in the wrong year, you're out of luck. I feel like I'm just starting my  career now. I haven't been in the thick of the nationals yet. This feels like  the start of the big time."  </P></p>

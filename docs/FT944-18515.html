			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / FT Guide to the Week 3 MONDAY Awful lot of voting in Brazil Brazil holds its biggest set of elections since the 1950s with 1,654 jobs, including that of president, being contested by more than 12,000 candidates. Attention will focus on the race for the presidency and whether the front-runner, former finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, can win outright in the first round by polling more votes than all his competitors combined. His chief rival will be Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers Party. Voting also takes place for two-thirds of the senate and all the lower house of Congress, as well as for state governors and parliaments. Counting is expected to take between 10 and 15 days. IMF meetings: As part of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, being held in Madrid, the development committee will consider the effectiveness of aid programmes to the developing world and examine how the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation measures will affect developing nations. Nelson Mandela, President of South Africa, on a trip to the US, addresses the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Rubber: Negotiations resume in Geneva (to Oct 14) on a rubber commodity pact to replace the accord that expires in December. It is the only remaining international commodity pact with buffer stock arrangements to stabilise prices. But consumer and producer countries differ sharply on the intervention price levels and range for the new agreement. Labour Party conference: Britain's main opposition party opens its first annual conference since the election of Tony Blair as leader at the seaside resort of Blackpool in north-west England (to Oct 7). Mr Blair is guaranteed a standing ovation when he addresses delegates on Tuesday, and is certain to win endorsement for a policy shift towards support for the market economy. But he will have to fight off leftwing demands for a commitment to a specified minimum wage. Eurotunnel starts a limited passenger car shuttle service though the Channel tunnel for invited shareholders and VIPs including its bankers, MPs, MEPs and representatives of the travel trade. The car shuttle operation is starting nearly 18 months later than planned and foreshadows the launch of a full turn-up-and-go service expected to begin in mid-November. Eurostar passenger trains are not expected to start service before late October. FT Survey: Building Services. Holidays: Australia (Labour Day), Germany (Unity Day), South Korea (National Foundation Day). 4 TUESDAY Yeltsin marks uprising President Boris Yeltsin of Russia is due to hold a press conference to mark the first anniversary of the failed uprising of hardline parliamentarians and the storming of the White House in which 140 people were killed. Mr Yeltsin is expected to spell out his political agenda as the new parliament begins its autumn session this week. Madrid Meetings: The formal annual meetings of the two Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, start with keynote addresses from Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, and Lewis Preston, president of the World Bank group. The meetings continue until Thursday. European Union foreign ministers, holding their monthly gathering in Luxembourg, will look at plans to help east and central European countries prepare their economies and legislation for membership of the Union. The ministers will also review relations with former Soviet republics, in particular Ukraine, whose foreign minister they have invited for dinner. Lloyd's of London: Judgment in the Gooda Walker case, the biggest legal action by loss-making Lloyd's Names, is expected today. A group of 3,095 Names, the individuals whose assets support the markets, are suing 71 Lloyd's agencies for Pounds 629m in losses sustained by syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency. During a case which was heard during the summer, Names alleged negligent underwriting was responsible for their losses. Council of Europe: President Ion Iliescu of Romania begins a two-day visit to Strasbourg, where he will meet senior representatives of the Council of Europe, including secretary-general Daniel Tarschys. Because of its controversial human rights record, Romania was the last of central Europe's former communist states to join the Council a year ago. It continues to raise concerns over Romania's treatment of its ethnic, religious and sexual minorities, and its judicial system. Saleroom: Christie's in London is auctioning more than 230 original watercolours painted by various artists in the 1860s for John Gould's volumes The Birds of Great Britain (1860-73), carrying estimates of between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 15,000. Gould is considered as important to English ornithology as John James Audubon is to North American. The collection was assembled by the naturalist and traveller Frederick du Cane Godman. It is rare for such desirable drawings to appear on the market and the appearance of so large a hoard has sent Gould collectors into a frenzy. The estimates should be much exceeded.

Robert Gallucci, US ambassador-at-large, said last Thursday after a week of talks that little progress had been made but neither side wants the talks to collapse. Negotiations centre on the terms on which the US will organise the supply of light-water atomic reactors to replace North Korea's graphite-moderated ones, which produce more of the plutonium used in nuclear bombs. Chris Patten, governor of Hong Kong, gives his third annual policy speech, outlining his plans for the colony. He is expected to give a progress report on pledges made last year and announce a fresh round of spending. The real focus of interest, however, will be on any proposals for improving relations with Beijing. This could prompt Mr Patten to revise his views on working with Beijing-appointed bodies such as the Preparatory Committee. European Union environment ministers, on the second day of a two-day session in Luxembourg, discuss with their counterparts from six east European states how their environment laws and policies can be brought into line with the EU's. The EU ministers will also be attempting yet again to agree on a strategy to combat global warming. Plans for a mixed carbon and energy tax of up to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent have been blocked for nearly three years by UK opposition to the principle of an EU-wide tax, and the misgivings of southern member states and France about its effects. Efforts are now focused on jointly agreed national measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions. US congressman Dan Rostenkowski, once powerful chairman of the House ways and means committee, goes to court to seek dismissal of the 17-count corruption indictment against him on constitutional grounds. Frankfurt book fair, the leading annual event for publishers, begins (to Oct 10). In this, the 46th year, the theme is Brazil. Nashville, Tennessee, plays host to the 28th Annual Country Music Association Awards. FT Survey: FT Exporter (Europe only). Holidays: Portugal (Republic Day). 6 THURSDAY Paris Motor show opens The main world show of the autumn opens as new car sales in Europe recover hesitantly from the deep recession of 1993. The show, which runs to October 16, is dominated by Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen. Last week, Peugeot announced a return to profit after last year's loss. As carmakers look at trends for cars in the 21st century, Citroen is to show its Xanae concept car. The company says it represents a new approach to automotive design, half-way between a conventional saloon car and a people carrier. British-based Rover Group is to unveil its latest Range Rover 4-wheel drive luxury 'off-road' vehicle. UK economy: The output figures for August will be watched closely by the markets in the light of the recent surge in industrial production. Most analysts expect the monthly rate of manufacturing growth to have slowed slightly in the month, even before September's controversial UK base rate rise. However, the underlying trend remains strong, with a 4.6 per cent year-on-year rate forecast. European Union commissioner on trade competition Sir Leon Brittan begins a trip to South Africa (to Oct 10). FT Survey: Liechtenstein. Holidays: Australia, Egypt (Armed Forces Day), Kazakhstan (Republic Day), Syria (Liberation Day). 7 FRIDAY US employment data due Today's US employment data for September provide the first real indicator of whether the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in August has done anything to slow economic expansion. The median forecast in MMS International's survey predicts growth of 250,000 in non-farm payroll employment, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.1 per cent. US congress is scheduled to recess for the mid-term election campaigns. With so many close contests expected, the deadline might actually be met. The Senate is scheduled to return on November 30 for two days of debate on the Uruguay Round Gatt legislation. The House is scheduled to vote on the Round on Wednesday, but its leaders are being urged to postpone the vote until after the elections. Bernard Tapie, the French politician and soccer boss, is due to make a court appeal against seizure of his art works and furniture by his creditor bank, Credit Lyonnais. London fashion week, highlighting the spring and summer collections for 1995, starts with a reception attended by the Princess of Wales (to Oct 9). Day of Courtesy: Britain's Polite Society hopes the event will counteract the alienating effects of technology. It says such gadgets as automatic doors, which people no longer have to hold for each other, reduce human contacts. 8-9 WEEKEND Austria goes to the polls The Socialist-Conservative coalition that has ruled Austria for most of the postwar period looks set to win another mandate in national elections on Sunday, but with its 76 per cent majority reduced. Rightwing populist Jorg Haider has bounced back after a disastrous referendum campaign in June opposing Austrian membership of the European Union. He could take seats from both traditional parties. Saleroom: On Saturday, Sotheby's holds its first wine sale in New York, in co-operation with Sherry-Lehmann, owner of a well respected liquor store on Madison Avenue. Sotheby's expects to raise more than Dollars 1m from almost 1,000 lots. Until this year, wine auctions were forbidden in the city. Kurile islands: A group of Japanese is due to visit the Russian-held island of Etorofu on Saturday. The island is one of three in the Kurile chain off northern Japan seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war. The travellers are descendants of island dwellers and wish to visit their ancestors' graves. Russia occasionally allows Japanese to land without visas as a good will gesture, designed to defuse a row over ownership of the three islands. Compiled by Patrick Stiles.

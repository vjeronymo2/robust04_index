			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Team Lotus seeks help over debts Administrators were called in yesterday by Team Lotus, one of the most famous British names in motor racing. The team has run into financial difficulties as the result of a long period of indifferent on-track performances leaving it with inadequate sponsorship. A two-car grand prix team requires an operating budget of at least Pounds 10m a year, with front-running teams such as Williams-Renault spending at least double that. No details of the extent of the team's indebtedness were being given last night by the joint administrators, Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Nigel Ruddock of accountants Robson Rhodes. There are no connections between Team Lotus and Group Lotus, the sports-car concern also founded by the late Colin Chapman but now owned by Bugatti of Italy. While the administrators have about three months to respond to the team's creditors, refinancing or the team's sale is expected in the next few weeks.</p>

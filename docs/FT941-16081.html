			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Setback predicted for many funds - Unapproved pensions The finance bill appears to have dealt a blow to all unapproved pension schemes known as Furbs (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), which seek to invest funds tax-efficiently, either offshore or in tax exempt assets, according to Mr John Mackay, senior tax partner of accountants Ernst &amp; Young. The November Budget aimed to tax benefit received from a Furbs not previously taxed in the UK. The Inland Revenue said it would stop such schemes where income and capital gains were wholly or partly taxed - providing employees with a larger tax-free lump sum on retirement.</p>

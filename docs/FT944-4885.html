			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (1): A mood of muted optimism prevails - Japanese industry is cautiously celebrating a gentle economic recovery, which has brought the first profits upturn for five years Now is the time of year when Japan's top industrial companies hold their annual bonenkai parties, at which executives gather to chat about business over beer and a tray of sushi. The tone of these august gatherings is a little lighter this year than last, when industry was wallowing in the trough of its deepest recession since the second world war. Now Japanese industry is cautiously celebrating a gentle economic recovery, which has brought the first profits upturn for five years. Those in the fastest recovering sectors such as semiconductors are throwing parties with a flamboyance not seen since the heady late 1980s. But overall, the mood of this bonenkai season is one of only muted optimism. Until the recession hit, in 1990, Japanese industry was imbued with 'great arrogance,' believes Mr Hideo Ishihara, chairman of Goldman Sachs (Japan). Today, 'that arrogance has crumbled,' he told a recent seminar in Tokyo. The chutzpah of the 1980s is being replaced by a period of 'soul-searching. . . a loss of confidence' among Japanese managers, says Mr Ishihara. The managers are starting to get to grips with a number of fundamental changes. Abroad, uncomfortable reminders of fallibility have cropped up over the past year, such as the way in which Germany's BMW seized Rover, the British car maker, from under the nose of Honda, its long-time partner; and the problems Sony and Matsushita have experienced with their investments in the US film business. At home, companies face adjustment to the shift over the next decade or so from a fast-expanding, export-driven economy - on which all their strategies up till now have been based - to a slow-growing, consumer-driven economy. Services will take on increasing importance, thanks to the fact that Japan has the world's fastest-ageing population profile. An increasing amount of basic manufacturing will be undertaken in cheaper locations offshore because of the yen's strength and the growing competitiveness of Japan's Asian neighbours. Many companies believe this so-called 'hollowing out' is a mark of declining competitiveness. Yet it is an inevitable, maybe even healthy trend. It reflects a new division of labour in Asia between high technology industries and basic industrial manufacturing, argue seasoned observers such as Mr Yasushi Mieno, outgoing governor of the Bank of Japan. Already, Japanese companies are becoming accustomed to the main consequence of all these changes; that they will not in the 1990s repeat the growth rates of the 1980s. The recovery which has just started is a sign of things to come - weaker and shallower than previous upturns. At best, industry can expect 3 per cent annual rates of increase in gross domestic product this decade, well below the 5 per cent growth rates of the late 1980s, agree economists in Tokyo. Industry faces, in consequence, a harder task to increase profitability than it did before the recession hit. The top 600 quoted companies managed a mere 4.36 per cent rise in current profits - before tax and extraordinary items - in the first six months of this year, estimates the Wako Research Institute of Economics. For the full year to next March, they are expecting a 7 per cent profits rise, which looks on the surface like a good turnround from the 16.4 per cent profits decline in the previous year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Yet even at that level, operating profits margins are in poor shape; well below the average for the previous two decades and even below levels seen after the 1973 oil price shock. And the scope for manufacturers to improve margins by raising prices is limited by continuing surplus capacity in fundamental sectors such as steel, cars and consumer electronics. Some, like the big integrated electronics companies and precision instrument makers, have nevertheless managed to make startling increases in profits in the first half of this year, thanks to their skill in squeezing costs - an indication that they are responding to the structural changes ahead. One consequence of this painfully slow recovery is to continue to lay bare the weaknesses in Japan's industrial structure exposed by the recession. This might prove to be a blessing, if it ensures that industry remains under pressure to restructure. Japanese industry has, for good reasons to do with avoiding high unemployment, been slow to address its problems. With a few exceptions, Japan's top companies have so far managed to struggle through the recession without reducing their three main excesses, capacity, stocks and workers, on anything like the scale of their US or European competitors. Investment in new plant and equipment is set to fall by nearly 6 per cent this year, estimates Nomura Research Institute; making a record four years of decline. Yet even after this, average capacity utilisation is barely abovethelevels 20 years ago in the immediate aftermath of the Opec oil price rises. The rate of growth in wage costs has meanwhile been trimmed. This is partly due to reductions in overtime and bonuses, which account for a third of average remuneration, so giving Japanese industry more scope than most of its competitors to cut labour costs without firing people. Unit labour costs are forecast to rise, as a result, by just 2.1 per cent this year. Jobs have been cut as well, mainly through early retirement and cuts or freezes on graduate recruitment. Graduates who fail to get jobs do not show up in unemployment figures, but reductions in older members of the workforce have been enough to nudge Japan's jobless rate from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent over the past year. That is still a long way below US and European levels, a mark of the success with which Japan's chronically overmanned service industries mop up surplus jobs. It is also a sign of how Japan's much-envied tradition of lifetime employment, a luxury confined to the top 300 or 400 companies, has survived the recession. A growing number of companies would like to scrap the system. Some, such as Sony and Toyota, have started to experiment by setting up new streams of staff on short-term contracts. But most companies accept that the present generation of life-timers will have to retire before the system itself can retire - and by then, ageing Japan is likely to be facing a labour shortage. The sharpest cost reductions have come from the shift of capacity overseas. Offshore production has roughly doubled to 6.4 per cent of Japanese industry's total output over the past decade, but is still tiny by comparison with the 27.5 per cent of production which US companies now have overseas. There will be more to come. Another traditional feature of Japanese industry to be put up for reassessment is the network of ties, through cross-shareholdings and exchanges of managers, between manufacturers, bankers, suppliers and customers. The pressure to reduce costs has forced industrial companies to terminate old alliances that have outlived their usefulness. This is especially true in the keiretsu diversified corporate families such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, or Sumitomo, which dominate heavy manufacturing, trading and banking. It is also taking place among groups such as Matsushita or Toyota, which exist outside the traditional keiretsu groups but nevertheless have similar links with subcontractors and distributors. Sales of mutual cross-shareholdings rose sharply last year, to a record Y2,148bn, and continue to rise this year. Capital locked up in equity stakes in partners which have become less useful over the years is being freed for better use, and loyal but over-expensive contractors are being asked to take their business elsewhere. Gradually, Japan's industrial structure is readjusting itself to cope with a rise in international competition, and to make the best of a maturing economy. Arrogance may have crumbled, yet Japanese industry's ability to adapt should not be underestimated.</p>

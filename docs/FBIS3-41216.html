Fifty people working at Rio de Janeiro's  international airport are being checked.    Otto Gomes de Miranda is the man police have charged with  leading the gang that sells arms to Rio de Janeiro drug  traffickers. Otto might be the chief of detective (Luiz Eduardo  Satto) and informer (Luiz Etienne), who last week was arrested  carrying ammunition and 22 kg of cocaine, which was to have been  delivered in Rio de Janeiro's hills.    Otto, who is now calmly resting at the Tijuca resort in  western Rio de Janeiro, served a 14-month prison term in the  United States. He denies the arms smuggling charges:    [Begin recording] That's a lie because everyone knows and it  is public and noticeable that I was arrested in the United  States with some arms. Those arms were all legal. [end recording]    There is something police are sure of. The arms used by the  traffickers in the hills come from Miami and Panama, and they  enter Brazil through the Rio de Janeiro international airport.    Rio de Janeiro Federal Police Superintendent Edson de  Oliveira knows the arms are unloaded directly from the planes  and then escorted by the gangs to ships hidden at Governador  Island, where the airport is located.    According to Federal Revenue Department officials,  supervision is precarious because of a personnel shortage. In  days with many flights, one supervisor has to check 124  passengers.    For 18 months now, Federal Police have investigated the  people who work at Rio de Janeiro international airport. Police  arrived at a conclusion: There are several gangs engaged in  arms smuggling at the airport. Some of them have members from  the Federal Police.    [Begin Edson de Oliveira recording] We are investigating  approximately 50 people who probably are engaged in arms  smuggling in that airport. [end recording]</p>

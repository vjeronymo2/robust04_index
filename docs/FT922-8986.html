			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Initial agreement for WPP refinancing THE PROPOSALS for WPP's anticipated financial reconstruction, which could cut its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 550m) bank debt by as much as 25 per cent, have been agreed with the co-ordinating committee of its 28-bank syndicate. They will now be presented to the international marketing services group's syndicate of banks for full approval. WPP had been facing serious cash-flow problems which threatened to come to a head in June. The co-ordinating committee - Bankers' Trust, Barclays, Citibank and JP Morgan - are backing a plan whereby the syndicate would subscribe for a rights issue of 230m low yielding convertible preference shares. The proceeds would be used to reduce bank borrowings. Each new preference share would be subscribed for at between 60p and 75p, depending on market conditions, and would be convertible into one ordinary share. The banks would subscribe in proportion to their holding of debt. Existing shareholders - there are 213m preference shares and 60m ordinary shares in issue - would be offered clawback arrangements. Holders of existing preference shares would be able to convert into ordinary shares at a ratio of 0.588, equivalent to some four times the existing conversion terms. During the last four months the market prices of the two shares has resulted in an average conversion ratio of 0.46. Bankers close to the negotiations said yesterday they regarded the proposals as offering a better deal to existing shareholders than a straight equity-for-debt exchange. The dilution of WPP shares by the rights issue, combined with the clawback arrangements, means that the syndicate banks could end up holding a little more than 50 per cent of WPP capital stock. That would give the banks a much closer identification with WPP. The proposals are being seen by some involved in the negotiations as marking the co-ordinating committee's determination to stay with WPP in the hope of long-term growth in the advertising sector. If approved by the syndicate, the proposals will be put to shareholders for their agreement. No timetable has been fixed, but if all goes smoothly the new financing plan could be in place by the end of June. The proposals announcement made no mention of the future position of Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive. There had been speculation that some banks had been seeking his removal prior to any financial reconstruction. But yesterday one banker described the suggestions as scurrilous gossip, adding that there was total support for Mr Sorrell in his current role.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Nissan's UK subsidiary advances 66% to Pounds 30m NISSAN MOTOR Manufacturing (UK), the Japanese car maker's British car production subsidiary which is based in Sunderland Tyne and Wear, increased its 1992 pre-tax profit by 66 per cent from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 29.6m. Nissan Motor (GB), the group's British sales and marketing subsidiary, suffered a loss of close to Pounds 17m in its first year of operation. NMGB took control of the British importing/distribution activities from Nissan UK, the privately owned group controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, at the beginning of 1992. By the end of the year NMGB had established a 270-strong dealer network, which is expected to grow to about 300 by the end of 1993. NMUK's profit was its second successive annual surplus since it began car production in the UK in 1986 and followed a Pounds 44.6m loss in the nine months to the end of 1990. The losses accumulated since 1985, which totalled Pounds 129m at the end of 1990, were reduced to Pounds 111m by the end of 1991 and were cut further to Pounds 88m by the end of last year. The remuneration of Mr Ian Gibson, NMUK chief executive, rose by 11.9 per cent from Pounds 192,797 to Pounds 215,800. Average employment in Sunderland by the NMUK group, which includes Nissan Yamato Engineering, its 80 per cent-owned heavy pressings subsidiary, rose to 4,974 in 1992 from 3,368 a year earlier. NMUK alone has a workforce of about 4,600 with some 600 employed by Nissan Yamato. The financial performance of the British manufacturing operation provided a bright spot in a difficult year for Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, which last week announced a group pre-tax loss of Y108bn (Pounds 645m) in the 12 months to the end of March. NMUK's turnover jumped last year to Pounds 1.05bn against Pounds 779m in 1991 and Pounds 383m in the final nine months of 1990. The higher turnover and profits at its Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland in north-east England was derived from a big jump in output as Nissan began production of a second car range, the Micra small car, in August last year. Nissan's car production in the UK rose by 44 per cent last year to 179,000 against 124,500 in 1991. Exports rose from 112,700 to 154,234. Nissan is planning to raise car production in the UK further, by 51 per cent this year to 270,000.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS;  </P> <P> CASSAVETES SURVEY OPENS WITH 'SHADOWS,' HIS FIRST FEATURE  </P> <P> "The Films of John Cassavetes," which the UCLA Film Archive presents today  through March 18, will provide the all-too-rare opportunity to see all 11  features that Cassavetes made over a 25-year-period. Cassavetes, who died a  year ago at 59, was the quintessential independent film maker, determined to  get at the truth of human experience at all costs. His films were rough around  the edges, but he got a raw honesty up there on the screen in an era when few  others did.  </P> <P> It would be hard for young people today to imagine what it was like seeing  Cassavetes' first feature "Shadows" (1958-59), which launches the retrospective  tonight at 7:30 in Melnitz Theater, when it was brand-new. Those of us raised  on Hollywood make-believe but captivated by foreign films in our college years  were not prepared for the impact of the honesty and unvarnished realism of  "Shadows" in an American film.  </P> <P> It is a bittersweet story of black youths of varying hues of skin color that  evoked the tempo and quality of life for young people in New York at the time.  It requires no effort to summon the memory of the pain and anguish of this film  nor its gritty evocation of Manhattan streets, harshly lit restaurants and  nondescript apartments. Playing with "Shadows" is the first and better of  Cassavetes' two uneven studio productions, "Too Late Blues" (1961), in which  Bobby Darin plays a jazz musician tempted to sell out in order to survive.  </P> <P> Just as successfully as he captured the cool life style of young people adrift  in the neon and steel jungle of New York in "Shadows," Cassavetes zeroes in on  the bored existence of the affluent middle-aged in Los Angeles suburbia in the  equally remarkable "Faces" (1968), which screens Sunday at 7:30.  </P> <P> He focuses on one couple (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), whom he follows through  a harrowing 48 hours, climaxing in a veritable Walpurgisnacht in which their  14-year marriage comes apart at the seams. The pivotal character, played by  Cassavetes' wife and frequent star, Gena Rowlands, is a high-class prostitute  of extraordinary beauty and sensitivity. Other unforgettables in the cast are  Seymour Cassel as a goofy yet compassionate peroxided hustler and Dorothy  Gulliver as a dumpy, frowzy housewife nakedly direct in her craving for  affection.  </P> <P> Playing with it is "A Child Is Waiting" (1963), an unhappy but not wholly  ineffective collaboration between Cassavetes and producer Stanley Kramer and  starring Burt Lancaster and Judy Garland, who clash over the treatment of the  retarded children in their care. For full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.  </P></p>

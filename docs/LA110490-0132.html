			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A' IS FOR AWFUL  </P> <P> I took time to read this "awful" attack against the public school system and  its teachers before I spent:  </P> <P> 1.  </P> <P> Two hours grading papers and working on report cards.  </P> <P> 2. Three hours preparing weekly lesson plans.  </P> <P> 3. Two hours filling in referrals for psychological screening of potentially  gifted and learning disabled children.  </P> <P> 4. One hour writing communiques to parents.  </P> <P> During my "vacation" I will attend the California Reading Assn. Conference, put  in time at my region office and take a couple of in-service classes.  </P> <P> I'm not one of two teachers in my school who are "good"; I'm one of at least  30.  </P> <P> CAROLYN RORMAN  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

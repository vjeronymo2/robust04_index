			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Chirieac: "The Price of Partnership?"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels,  Romania, represented by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, was  the first of all the East European countries to sign the  much-discussed Partnership for Peace. Thus began the competition  whose prize is admission to the Atlantic Alliance. Officially,  it was stated that all six East European countries had equal  chances in the starting line. In reality, judging only on the  basis of the agenda of the meetings of President Clinton during  his recent visit to Europe, this is not the case. Indisputably,  the Czech Republic starts out a big favorite. It is a small  country in the heart of Europe, a champion of reform, without  any disputes with its neighbors and a favorite of Western  investors. Close by, there is Poland, which, despite its leftist  government and and economic difficulties, continues to have a  strong and, especially, a "faithful" diaspora, both literally  and figuratively. Paradoxically, Hungary, the country with the  best image in the Western media, starts off with a big handicap.  The strong point of the Budapest government, the exacerbation of  the issue of the respecting of the rights of the Hungarian  minorities dispersed in Romania or Slovakia, has given some  trouble to the Western offices. In the competition for admission  to NATO, the "minority issue" has proven to be a two-edged  sword. Probably believing that one Yugoslavia is enough for  Europe at the end of the century, the West seems to have closed  the door to Hungarian diplomacy. Budapest's control over the  ethnic parties on the territory of other states and the  temptation to advocate autonomy, including territorial autonomy,  of the zones controlled by these states have been viewed with  alarm by Western politicians. Without being obliged to use  diplomatic language any more, former U.S. Secretary of State  James Baker recently stated, in plain and clear language, that  "Hungary cannot be admitted to NATO since it supports separatist  manifestations in Romania and Slovakia." As they say, he who  sows the wind....    At any rate, favorites or outsiders, the competition remains  open for any result. The winner will be the one who will be  ready to make the most sacrifices. Human sacrifices.  Participation in the peacekeeping forces as stipulated for the  partnership can mean loss of human life, in addition to training  and review. In Bosnia, the Americans do not want to send ground  troops, and the French, frightened by the losses suffered, will  soon be withdrawing their soldiers. What East European state  will agree to put its troops into the battle of elite Serbian,  Croatian, or Muslim marksmen? Material sacrifices. The alignment  of Eastern weapons with NATO military standards is also  envisioned in the partnership. In order to reach the Western  military high tech level, the East European countries would have  to invest billions of dollars each year. And this is in a  situation in which Romania, for example, which, prior to 1989,  had an arms industry which covered 60 percent of the foreign  debt, found, in 1994 [as published] only enough resources to  satisfy 2 percent of the technical conditions for arms orders.    To ensure that the signature of Mr. Melescanu in Brussels  does not remain a dead letter, the key issue is the pragmatic  treatment in Bucharest of the demands of the Partnership for  Peace. Because, even if the genuine desire of Bucharest to win  the competition cannot be disputed, one might discover that the  price which must be paid is not small.</p>

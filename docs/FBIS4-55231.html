			<p>BFN     [Text] Sali Berisha, president of the Republic of Albania,  arrived on an official visit at about 2120 today at Otopeni  Airport. This visit, which is the first ever by a head of the  Albanian state, is an extremely important event in the relations  between the two countries, relations that, in an interview  granted to us before he had left his country, President Berisha  termed as friendly. During the visit the Friendship and  Cooperation Treaty between Romania and Albania will be signed,  as well as other conventions intended to establish, as President  Berisha said, the legal basis for our close cooperation.    The Albanian president is accompanied by Finance Minister  Piro Dishnica, Maksim Konomi, chairman of the Science and  Technology Committee, and other officials.    Upon his arrival, the president of Albania was met by a  honor  mission headed by Dan Mircea Popescu, state minister and labor  and social protection minister. The official reception of  President Berisha by Romanian President Ion Iliescu will take  place tomorrow morning at Cotroceni Palace.</p>

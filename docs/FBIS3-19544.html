This is  simply because the EU has a military arm called the WEU [Western  European Union]. If we become a member of this organization,  then there will be military changes only."    This statement was made by Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, future  commander in chief of the Finnish Armed Forces. He was promoted  to the post of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces by  President of the Republic Martti Ahtisaari during Friday's  presidential presentation. His mandate will run from 1  November, when Admiral Jan Klenberg, the current commander in  chief, is due to retire. Haegglund will be promoted to the rank  of general on the same day.    In Haegglund's view, however, membership in the EU does have  a political significance, as we will then be committed to the  EU's common foreign and security policy. This can also be  expanded to encompass defense policy, even a common defense  system: "But that we do not yet know; that issue will be  decided in 1996. And, as members of the EU, we will then  participate in the decisionmaking and political process. But  actual defense matters and their implementation are in the hands  of the WEU. If we become members of the EU, we shall also be  invited to become members of the WEU.    ``After that, things depend on the decisions we make, on  whether we join as observers or members. If we go in as  observers, there will no changes in defense policy. But if we  become members, we will have obligations and guarantees:  guarantees if we are attacked and obligations to help member  countries if they are attacked.''    If Finland becomes a member of the EU, it will be the first  time any EU member state shares a border with Russia. Gustav  Haegglund does not see this as a problem. Because the EU surely  has no reason to start a war with Russia, Haegglund added with a  broad smile.  <H5>  They Have To Be Stationed Somewhere </H5>   Russia is deploying an increasing number of troops close to  the Finnish border. According to Lt. Gen. Haegglund it is  important to note that they are not being deployed near Finland  because of Finland itself, or in order to attack Finland, or  even to fend off an attack from this country: "The reason is  that hundreds of thousands of troops are being withdrawn from  Europe, Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states. They have to be  stationed somewhere. And there are barracks in the areas around  St. Petersburg with the infrastructure for additional troops,  barracks that can support them.    ``That is one of the reasons. The other is that, as they  pull back from the Baltic area, they must also be able to defend  that sector. I get the impressiion -- and I have some  information from the Russians themselves -- that the major part  of these troops is being stationed south of St. Petersburg. But  some are also stationed north of the city.''    Haegglund thinks it is important to make this statement  while  relations between the countries are as good and cordial as they  are now and as long as the troops are controlled by the central  administration in Moscow: "As long as order and control prevail  among them, this can be a stabilizing factor in the face of  rising crime. But if the situation changes, they are a  potential threat. So we must hope that the situation stays as it  is."  <H5>  Military Background </H5>   Edvin Birger Gustav Haegglund's background is truly  military:  His father, Johan Woldemar, was a lieutenant general, although  he wanted Gustav to become a businessman. After graduating from  Norsen [Swedish Normal Lyceum of Helsinki] in 1957, he joined  the Army as a conscript at the age of 18 and, after summer  service as second lieutenant at Dragsvik, he decided to follow  in his father's footsteps. He graduated from the Military  College in 1960 and completed his studies at the Military  Academy in 1969-71. He also obtained a master's degree in  political science in 1969 and studied in the United States from  1972 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1982.    His career so far includes responsibilities as platoon  leader  and company commander in the Nyland Brigade; teacher at the  Military College and the Military Academy; chief secretary of  the Second and Third Parliamentary Defense Committees; commander  on UN missions in the Middle East, Syria, and Lebanon; commander  of the Nyland Brigade; commander of the Military District of  South East Finland; and chief of the general staff since 1990.  He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1988. Gustav  Haegglund has been at the center of many a storm, but he has  always pulled through honorably. In 1986 he was criticized by  the then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac for being on leave  in his home country when a French UN soldier was killed in  Lebanon. Haegglund interrupted his leave and the dispute was  settled. He has been criticized for his views by both Defense  Minister Elisabeth Rehn and Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio.  Here too, he has managed to weather the storm. In Gustav  Haegglund's view, the military also has the right to have an  opinion.</p>

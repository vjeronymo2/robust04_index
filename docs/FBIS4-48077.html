			<p>BFN     [Text] Carlos Reis, chairman of the Mozambican National  Union, Unamo, has said his political organization will boycott  the first multiparty elections in Mozambique, scheduled for  October. Reis said his movement's decision is due to the fact  that the Mozambique Liberation Front, the international  community, and the UN Operations in Mozambique have not  allocated the money for the political parties' trust fund.  Carlos Reis was speaking at a banquet held in the South African  Embassy in Maputo marking the inauguration of Nelson Mandela.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK brewing The Whitbread empire has finally admitted defeat in its efforts to come up with an ingenious solution to the dilemma posed by the government's Beer Orders. Hence the Whitbread Investment Company's decision to try stimulating an auction for Morland by selling part of its 43 per cent stake to Greene King. Presumably the other stakes held under the Whitbread umbrella will soon be sold off, except where they are small enough to be easily reduced below the 15 per cent threshold permitted by the government. Marston Thompson and Brakspear are thus also available to the highest bidder. As for the bid by Greene King, the commercial logic is so plain that an auction is unlikely to develop. Greene King will shut the Morland brewery and use the site as a distribution centre for its own Abbot and IPA brands. Morland can scarcely be blamed for opposing the likely demise of its own beer, nor for objecting that it is a well-managed company. But it is hard to see how it can defeat the bid. If nothing else, that would mean flying in the face of an uncomfortable truth: at every turn, the government's efforts to promote competition in the UK brewing industry are having just the opposite effect.</p>

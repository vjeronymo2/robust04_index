			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Coalition condemns the new U.S.  position on the Haitian crisis. The organization led by Carl  Denis and Gerard Bissainthe denounces the presence of a U.S.  warship in Haitian waters on 2 May. Let us listen to Carl Denis:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Reporter Francois] Carl Denis,  you are a leader of an organization that stands for the defense  of Haiti's national sovereignty. We noticed a statement by the  White House today: that no option is excluded in the case of  Haiti, not even the military option. How do you interpret such a  statement?    [Denis] We interpret it as the United States having decided  that in the case of a small country, particularly a small black  country, it can afford to make mistakes it cannot make in other  countries. No matter how strong it wishes to be, it cannot go  into Bosnia-Herzegovina because it knows that it will be  defeated. It also knows that it cannot go into Rwanda because  they would not [word indistinct] because there, the armies are  stronger. We think that President Clinton and the White House  are acting thoughtlessly toward Haiti. We are indignant that  following those statements, a U.S. warship is at less than 2,000  miles [as heard] from our shores. The ship was there at 1000  this morning. What did it come to do? It came to bring a message  to our legislators so they do not apply articles of the  Constitution that the legislators would like to adopt. Thus,  instead of -- as the U.S. Government says -- it being the  [Haitian] military who are putting pressure on our parliament, I  see instead that it is the U.S. military putting pressure on our  parliament so that [the legislators] do not work the way they  should. We are very indignant about that.    [Francois] You therefore condemn all these actions?    [Denis] We strongly condemn the fact that Washington has  stuck its nose into Haiti's affairs. We wish it would respect  other countries, which are not its equal, but which have their  own sovereignty, their own tradition. There was no reason for  the crisis to have lasted so long had it not been for the  harmful action of the international community. Finally, when you  look carefully, the United States gives us two options: either  we die under the commercial and economic sanctions that they  impose on us, or they force us to accept a government that will  kill us itself. You get to realize that the United States cannot  be a friend to Haiti. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] By a vote of 23 to 8, the Constitution and Justice  Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to shelve the  prosecution proceedings on former Deputies Joao Alves, Genebaldo  Correia, Cid Carvalho, and Manoel Moreira, who were charged with  having been members of the budget gang. They resigned their  posts early in the week to prevent being dismissed. With the  exception of Joao Alves, who has no party, they can run for a  seat in the Chamber in the next elections.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Cabinet faces row on 4.7% rise planned for ministers: Trade union leaders attack pay increase above level of inflation The government was yesterday facing a fresh controversy after stating that it would propose a 4.7 per cent increase in salaries for ministers next year. Amid clear indications that public sector workers face another squeeze on pay in the financial year 1995-6, the government said it would propose the increase in ministerial salaries to parliament next week to make up for an earlier freeze. The pay increase for ministers, which is 2.3 percentage points above the current level of inflation, was immediately denounced as unfair by trade union leaders, coming at a time of public sector restraint. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public sector union, accused the government of 'sheer hypocrisy', adding: 'It is unfair that the government should penalise 5m public sector workers with a permanent pay freeze and not lead by example with their pay awards.' Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, also said that the pay increase would make the government's public sector pay bill freeze 'even more unsustainable'. However, the government defended the increase for ministers, saying that it would help their salaries to catch up. It also claimed that ministers and MPs would still be about Pounds 2,000 worse off than they would have been if old links with the civil service pay scale had been maintained. The pay rise should mean that, effective from January 1, 1995, a Cabinet minister's salary will rise from Pounds 64,749 to Pounds 67,819  - an increase of Pounds 3,070. Mr John Major's salary as prime minister should rise from Pounds 78,292 to Pounds 82,003, an increase of Pounds 3,711. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, will submit an order to parliament on Thursday about raising the pay levels, which also increases the income of the Opposition leader and Opposition whips in the Commons and Lords. However, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said he would be rejecting the pay rise in a free Commons vote next week. A spokeswoman for his office said: 'Tony Blair will not accept the increase. He feels it is wrong to take up the increase at a time when millions of others are having no increase at all.' The Opposition could decide to exploit the issue, which comes in the wake of allegations of political sleaze and cash-for-questions, and a resignation following failure to disclose financial interests.</p>

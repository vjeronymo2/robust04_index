			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AGREEMENT STILL ELUDES GM, AUTO WORKERS  </P> <P> Pressure increased Sunday on the United Auto Workers to strike General Motors  as around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce agreement on a new contract  two days after a strike deadline passed.  </P> <P> Bargaining continued into the night, extending a marathon session that started  Saturday at 9 a.m. as the two sides haggled over ways to protect the jobs of  some 300,000 GM workers.  </P> <P> The decision by UAW leaders to ignore the midnight Friday strike deadline had  little meaning until today, when the workweek begins at about 240 GM sites in  33 states.  </P> <P> The union leadership is scheduled to meet today with about 30 local union  leaders, some of whom are calling for a walkout.  </P> <P> The UAW's caution contrasts with its 12,800 Canadian counterparts whose  separate auto workers union struck Ford of Canada after failing to reach a new  agreement Friday night.  </P></p>

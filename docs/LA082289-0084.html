			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHONE WORKERS TRICKLING BACK AMID SOME GROUSING OVER PACT  </P> <P> Pacific Bell's work force trickled back Monday in the wake of the settlement of  a 15-day strike by the company's 41,800 California workers.  </P> <P> The slow trek to normalcy -- with from 10% of workers returning at some offices  to more than half at others -- was not surprising. Under terms of a tentative  agreement reached Sunday between phone company negotiators and representatives  of the Communications Workers of America, employees have until Wednesday to  check in by phone with their supervisors and until Friday to go back to their  jobs.  </P> <P> While many workers expressed relief at being able to return, there was some  initial sentiment against ratification, based primarily on the health benefits  called for in the new three-year contract, which is aimed at reducing Pacific  Bell's medical costs.  </P> <P> To keep operations running smoothly as the striking workers returned, many of  the 17,000 managers who were assigned to temporary 12-hour-a-day duty as  operators and technical workers during the strike remained on the job. But  customers calling directory assistance in some areas still experienced delays;  a tape-recorded message informed them that "although our strike has ended, we  are still arranging for the return of our operators."  </P> <P> Neither Pacific Bell nor CWA was able to make a systemwide estimate of the  number of workers who showed up Monday. But Vira Milirides, a CWA spokeswoman  in San Francisco, said she believed the majority of workers would return  quickly because "people need that paycheck."  </P> <P> The CWA paid no strike benefits during the walkout. The union's San Fernando  Valley local spent more than $20,000 for groceries for needy members' families  during the strike, according to the local's president, Ellen Edwards.  </P> <P> In some offices, the working environment during the next few days figures to be  strained as strikers mix with fill-in managers and an estimated 3,000 Pacific  Bell workers who crossed picket lines.  </P> <P> The tentative contract must still be ratified by the CWA membership, with  mailed ballots to be returned to union headquarters by Sept. 22.  </P> <P> Many details of the settlement remained unknown Monday. Presidents of CWA  locals will be briefed by the union's negotiating team within a week and will  then make recommendations to members of their local.  </P> <P> The new health plan, which would take effect in 1991, would create a network of  doctors whose fees would be paid primarily by Pacific Bell. Employees who used  the network would pay no more than 5% to 10% of the cost of treatment and  nothing at all in some cases.  </P> <P> Employees who went outside the network, however, would have to pay the first  $1,000 of medical expenses per year out of their own pocket, up from the  current deductible of $150. Workers subsequently would be reimbursed for 70% of  the cost of treatment.  </P> <P> The company's idea -- common among corporations -- is to persuade workers to  restrict themselves to a network of physicians who offer the company a discount  in exchange for a high volume of business.  </P> <P> But the presidents of two CWA locals said Monday they are upset that  deductibles had been raised and that even those employees who used the new  network would have to pay a small share of the cost. Under the old contract,  Pacific Bell paid 100% of the cost for workers who used an approved health  maintenance organization.  </P> <P> "It's premature to make a prediction about ratification," said Valley CWA  leader Edwards, "but I feel like the bargaining committee let me down."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Close Vote Predicted  </P> <P> Alice Alvarez, president of a CWA local covering Pasadena and East Los Angeles,  said there was not enough information yet to make a judgment on the contract,  but predicted that the membership's vote on ratification "will be close, either  way."  </P> <P> "I've heard an awful lot of grumbling this morning," said Al Anderson, a  communications technician who returned Monday to his job at a phone company  switching control center in Beverly Hills. "I rather doubt" that the new  contract will be ratified. "A lot of people have been saying that (after the  ratification vote) we may have to go out again."  </P> <P> The new contract gives workers increases in wages, bonuses and other payments  that will raise salaries overall by 11% over three years. Pay currently ranges  from about $228 a week for some operators to $650 for some skilled technicians.  </P> <P> In addition to the unhappiness over health benefits, some union members also  were concerned that the new contract contains no "amnesty" clause prohibiting  Pacific Bell from disciplining strikers accused of illegal acts.  </P> <P> There were 450 "serious acts of sabotage or vandalism" during the walkout,  according to the company, which said Sunday that rewards of $10,000 to $25,000  for information leading to an arrest and conviction remain in effect.  </P> <P> Alvarez on Monday said that a member of her union, who was arrested during the  strike for allegedly spraying a can of foul-smelling nontoxic liquid at a  strikebreaker, had been suspended by phone company officials hours after she  returned to work.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell was the fourth of seven "Baby Bells" -- the regional holding  companies set up in 1984 to take over the local phone business of American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph in the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit -- to reach  a new contract with employees.  </P> <P> Strikes continued Monday at Washington-based Bell Atlantic; NYNEX, which serves  the Northeast; and Chicago-based Ameritech. Those three companies employ  147,000 workers and serve 35 million customers.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Myrna Oliver contributed to this story.  </P></p>

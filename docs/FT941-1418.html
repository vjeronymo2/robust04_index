			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Motor traders' margins whittled down Some carmakers are cutting or eliminating dealer margins on selected models to reduce list prices and intensify competition. Volvo, Renault and Ford have already made such moves and carmakers and dealers believe the new pricing initiatives could have a far-reaching impact on the relationship between manufacturers and the retail motor trade. They could also affect tax revenue take, as the new company car tax scheme to be introduced next month is based on the list price rather than the transaction price, which would normally include a significant discount. Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, has eliminated the previous 10 per cent dealer margin on the 1.6 litre Volvo 440/460, the cheapest in its range. Before the move these models had an on-the-road price - including delivery charge - of Pounds 10,865. This has been cut to Pounds 9,970, allowing dealers to advertise a new Volvo at under Pounds 10,000. Instead of the margin, Volvo dealers are now being given a handling charge of Pounds 130 per car for these models, which still count in a dealer's total sales and qualify for the monthly volume bonuses given if the dealer reaches sales targets set by the manufacturer. Renault, the French carmaker, has taken similar action on some of its cheapest models, but is offering a higher handling charge to dealers. Ford, the market leader, has used similar tactics for the launch of its new Ford Probe coupe. The cheapest model is priced at Pounds 15,995 and dealers are being given a handling charge of about Pounds 1,000. Ford insisted last night it had no plans to spread this practice across its range, but said: 'This allows us to decrease the list price, which makes the car more competitive in the market place.' In the Ford case the high handling charge still gives the dealer some room for manoeuvre, but the effective margin has still been cut to just over 6 per cent from 10 per cent across the rest of the range. Vauxhall, which led the move two-and-a-half years ago to reduce dealer margins from the traditional 17 per cent to the current industry average of 10 per cent, said last night: 'We are not planning any initiative in this area, but we are watching what is going on.' Volvo accepted that the actual transaction price paid by the customer on its cheapest models had not changed but said the elimination of the dealer margin had removed any discount and haggling, and the list price now represented the transaction price.</p>

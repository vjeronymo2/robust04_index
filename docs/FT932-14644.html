			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Gambro rights issue aims to fund expansion GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, has announced plans for a SKr424m (Dollars 57m) rights issue to strengthen its capital base and fund further expansion. The company is to issue 1.84m new shares at SKr230 a share, which is 33 per cent below the current stock market level of SKr345. The move will boost its share capital by SKr36m from SKr547m. Mr Jan Gustavsson, chief financial officer, said the group had no specific acquisition target in mind, but was looking to ensure it had adequate strength to continue the expansion that has seen it buy a number of companies in the US and Europe over the last five years. The group's current equity-assets ratio is just above 30 per cent. For 1992, Gambro disclosed a 27 per cent increase in profits to SKr753m and raised its dividend 20 per cent to SKr4.50 per share. The company's two largest shareholders in terms of voting power - Cardo, which holds 58.4 per cent of Gambro's votes, and the Crafoord Foundation, which has 11.3 per cent - have both said they would fully take up their preferential rights under the issue. The company's A-shares, which have 10 times the voting power of the B-shares, are being offered on a one-for-five basis, and the B-shares at a one-for-15 ratio.</p>

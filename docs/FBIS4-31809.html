			<p>BFN     [Text] Budva, Yugoslavia, June 15 (TANJUG) -- The Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia has not given up the market-oriented  model of economy despite the current regime of sanctions,  although there have been many reasons to do so with regard to  the circumstances, Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said on  Wednesday. At the beginning of three-day consultations of  Yugoslav economists in the Adriatic resort of Budva, Kontic said  that the lifting of the international blockade against  Yugoslavia was the utmost priority because it deeply affected  the country's overall economy and plans.    The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive and  binding sanctions against Yugoslavia because of its alleged  involvement in the civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Participating in a debate at the meeting, headlined  "Programme of Reconstruction and Recovery of Yugoslav Economy,"  Kontic pointed out significant results in the budget policy,  which have been achieved since the launching of the economic  programme in late January.    The government is currently examining possibilities for  reducing budget spending and solving the problem of budget  deficit, which should be eliminated in the second six-month  period. With regard to the fact that budget deficit was  originally planned to be as much as 15 percent of the national  product in 1994, the subsequent decision on a balanced budget in  the second half of the year will be a significant additional  factor of stabilization of economic trends.    The fiscal policy is the most vulnarable area, said Kontic  and added that the state had to make some resolute and positive  steps concerning the entirety of the tax and tariff system and  policy, he said. Plans have been made for improving the  collection of taxes and customs dues without waiting for a  deeper systematic adjustment, he said.    Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia Bozidar  Gazivoda said that the primary task of the Central Bank was  stable national currency. The maintaining of stable dinar and  prices as well as the economic growth entail that the Central  Bank be free from various influences, he said. Nebojsa Savic, a  member of the team which had created the programme of economic  recovery, believes that the greatest achievement of the  programme is the restoration of the country's sovereignty  through the new dinar and stable prices.    The success of the programme depends on abandoning in July  the practice of financing budget deficit, on stable prices and  wages, most of which are free (with the exception of  monopolistic and public enterprises), and on re-activation of  social programme, said Savic. He proposed an early start of the  project of new economic system, the development of new market  institutions, privatization and financial rehabilitation of  banks.    Belgrade university professor Ljubomir Madzar said that the  programme had been improved since the beginning of its  implementation and that, for example, public spending had been  reduced from 52 to 42 percent. Participants agreed on the first  day of consultations that there should be more critical views of  the prospects of the programme and that restoration of economic  ties with the world was of vital importance for safe and final  surmounting of the crisis.</p>

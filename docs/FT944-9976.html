			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Verbal, but is it binding? - Briefcase Three years ago, I bought shares in the private company for which I was then working. At the time, I was told I could not sell them without board approval. Later, I was informed that, if I found a buyer, I would have to offer them first at the same price to other shareholders. But since I did not sign any document/s, am I bound to do any of this? Verbal agreements are enforceable, so the fact that you did not actually sign any document/s may not necessarily be relied upon. In any case, other shareholders may well give you a better price for your shares. (Murray Johnstone).

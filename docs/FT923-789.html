			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Texan marauder keeps everyone guessing THE Monday night television football game has become an American institution. This will not be the case next Monday because the Los Angeles Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs simply cannot compete with the ultimate Texas Marauder who is going to be on another channel. Mr Ross Perot - for it is he - will, yet again, be on Larry King Live. This is the talk show programme on which he declared his prospective independent candidacy back in February and on which he has ruminated endlessly since about what is wrong with the country. The little billionaire from Texas could say absolutely anything. Yesterday the Los Angeles Times solemnly reported he would announce that he would formally enter the race, and it may well be right. He has already this week issued the shocking confession that he 'made a mistake' in terminating his non-candidacy back in July. He will certainly report that his 'volunteers,' whom he meets in Dallas this weekend, have told him that only he, and not President George Bush nor Governor Bill Clinton, can take on the awesome task of cutting the federal budget deficit. It has emerged, however, that most of the leading volunteers have been pretty much handpicked by Mr Perot himself. He will definitely brandish his new book, modestly entitled United We Stand, America, which is also the humble name of his movement. This contains his programme, which he somehow was never able to produce while he was a non-candidate, probably because some of its ideas - big increases in petrol taxes, cuts in social security and so on - are not calculated to win friends or votes. The official body politic is, reluctantly, preparing itself for the return of the nativist. James Baker, who runs Mr Bush's campaign, has talked to him twice in the last week. Senator Al Gore, Mr Clinton's running mate, muttered through clenched teeth yesterday morning that Mr Perot had the sort of record and experience that might make him a qualified cabinet member. Those running for nothing, however, are more blunt. A M Rosenthal's New York Times column yesterday concluded that 'listening to Mr Perot now stirs the same stomach quease as listening to a lecture on moral principles from a defrocked clergyman.' The newspaper Mr Rosenthal used to edit was just as polite. The Perot effort was just 'tease, tantalise, talk'. Having dumped his supporters once, 'why should they now, with the cake nearly baked, invite him back into the kitchen when they know he can't stand the heat?' The trouble with this sort of language from the establishment is that it is a red rag to the Perot bull. He might be about to charge.</p>

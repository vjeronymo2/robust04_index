He said Russian future will much depend on whether the  country will continue to create a genuine market economy,  whether Russian citizens will remain adherent to democracy and  prevent any limits on it and whether Russia will keep to its  previous role on the international scene or change it.    The President expressed his admiration with Russian  achievements in literature, art, on the battle field and in  space. He said the Communist system suppressed people and led  to the cold war. Nevertheless, greatness of the Russian people  has been always evident and it has a prospect to become powerful  and prospering on the eve of the 21st century.    Despite the fact old human vices -- hatred and racial  intolerance -- remain, the greatness of peoples in the 21st  century will be determined not by their ability to impose their  will on others but by the ability to enable everyone to use all  possibilities of modern and future world regardless one's race  and sex, said Clinton.    As for Russia and the United States they are bound to make  their contribution to the consolidation of the spirit of  cooperation and partnership throughout the world and improvement  of everyday life of each person, including Russian citizens.  Clinton stressed Russians themselves are to make their own  future.    In their turn, the U.S. people and President want to be  partners and sincere friends of Russia, he added. Clinton said  he ran for U.S. President to make sure changes for the better  come true.    Dwelling on the development of Russian economy, the U.S.  President agreed transition to market economy was painful and  difficult, it even disoriented Russian citizens. However, in  his opinion, Russia would have to pay more for being idle or  trying to turn back. State-controlled economy does not work in  the modern world, said Clinton. The old system was doomed to  failure, and if Russians try to re-introduce it it will fail  again, assured the President.    Speaking of Russian economic problems, Clinton noted high  inflation rates. In his words, the inflation must be curbed  down, but it will also claim some price. Another problem is the  need to create a system of social guarantees for people affected  by swift economic development. Clinton said the Americans will  do their best to make the difficulties easier as Russians  progress on their path.    Clinton said a major task of the Russian people is  consolidation of democracy, since it gives the most reliable  guarantees of observation and protection of ethnic minorities'  rights. In order to ensure democracy, everyone should denounce  intolerance, hatred and antisemitism, said Clinton.    The U.S. President focused on human rights and said America  warns other states against disrespect for rights of ethnic  Russians.    Clinton said he is concerned with some irresponsible  statements recently made on the Russian political scene and,  without mentioning Zhirinovskiy's name, added with a smile he is  not going to return Alaska to Russia.    The President expressed the assurance the future measurement  of Russian greatness will be its ability to be a peace-loving  neighbour.    Speaking of common European problems, Clinton noted this is  the first time ever Europe is not divided, it is united with  adherence to democracy, free market economy and the availability  of common borders.    The U.S. state head said he is satisfied with the Russian  president's decision to participate in the Partnership for Peace  initiative and work for integration of Europe. He especially  praised the historic Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on  elimination of nuclear arms signed in Moscow.    In his opinion, it is sign the future will be considerably  different from the past. The Russian fate may also influence  that of America and the United States wants Russia to make  decisions that will be good for itself.    Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the  U.S.  President. The studio was also connected with some Russian  cities whose residents were welcome to ask questions.    Part of the audience, mainly philology students, asked  questions in good English, which made Clinton wonder whether  everyone in the studio is from Moscow State University and  speaks without an accent.    Asked what is the difference between the United States and  Russia, the President said Americans have created their  democracy for 200 years, and Russia has the world's youngest  democracy. Still, he said there is plenty of similarities in  characters of the two peoples.    A representative of Stavropol Cossacks asked Clinton in what  form the United States may participate in settlement of  conflicts in Russia. The President gave an evasive answer and  spoke of Yugoslavia where the U.N. peace-makers are trying to  help avoid victims.    The President was asked two questions about the Baltic  Republics. The first question wondered why America does not want  to render assistance to states striving for democracy, including  the Baltic Republics. The other wondered why America helps the  Baltic states despite their infringement on rights of the  Russian-speaking minority.    Clinton said he wants to render assistance to the Baltic  states and invite them to the Partnership for Peace together  with Russia. They will participate in outlining joint military  plans, military operations and so on. If they decide to join  NATO, they will have to take certain obligations, safety  guarantees, said the President.    In the opinion of the U.S. President, the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Lithuania testifies to the Russian  Government's satisfaction with the state of bilateral relations.    Problems with Estonia and Latvia remain unsettled, added the  President and said an international group representing CSCE is  studying the human rights situation in these states. In the  words of Clinton, he has warned heads of the Baltic states that  if violations of rights of the Russian-speaking population are  revealed, this will tell on the U.S. policy towards those states.    Asked about prospects for U.S. economic assistance to  Russian  businessmen, the President said he thinks there should be much  more U.S. investments in Russia. In his words, the U.S.  secretary of commerce will come to Russia in March with a large  group of U.S. businessmen to persuade them to invest in Russia.    The question of a 13-year-old boy "When did you decide to  become U.S. President?" came somewhat unexpectedly. Clinton  said he was sixteen years old when he shook Kennedy's hand and  approximately at the same time he understood he wants to serve  for the state.    He shook the boy's hand and said maybe one day he will  become  Russian president.    Speaking to the audience in Nizhnyy Novgorod, the President  said it would be good for U.S. college and school students to  come to Russia for studies. If Boris Yeltsin addresses a U.S.  audience, few U.S. students would be able to talk to him in  Russian, admitted the U.S. President and again praised language  abilities of his young Russian interlocutors.    A youngster asked the President whether he would play  saxophone for them, but Clinton answered he had played saxophone  at Thursday's dinner for President Yeltsin and added he has a  one-time saxophone play quota for each country.</p>

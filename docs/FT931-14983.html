			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / DTI reluctant to split nuclear levy THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is playing down the idea of diverting part of the nuclear levy paid on electricity bills to other purposes such as subsidising cleaner coal technology. Such a switch is believed to be among the measures under consideration by MPs on the Commons trade and industry committee, which will announce proposals to boost the coal sector later this month. In a confidential memo to the committee, the DTI says: 'It would not be possible under the Electricity Act 1989 to divert the levy to other purposes such as the funding of the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to existing coal-fired stations. 'However . . . the coal review is considering methods and costs of reducing the price of British coal by providing support to the coal industry, for example by subsidy or levy arrangements.' In the six months to last September, Nuclear Electric - the state-owned nuclear power generator - received income of Pounds 632m from the levy to help it finance the heavy decommissioning costs of its nuclear plant. That helped it to report a half-yearly operating profit of Pounds 255m. Ministers have also cast doubt on the practicality of abandoning arrangements enabling France to supply up to 6 per cent of the electricity that is sold in England and Wales. That has been suggested by some observers as another possible means of helping the domestic coal industry.</p>

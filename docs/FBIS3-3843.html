Since construction started in 1985 the Yangzhou Port has  acquired a passenger dock, a floating pier able to handle ships  of 10,000 dwt and two wharves for 3,000-dwt ships.    The Gaogang Port is already open to the outside world.    Located at the confluence of the Chang Jiang River, China's  longest, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, Yangzhou has long  been a commercial port.    The area is also a key production base for grain, cotton,  edible oil and non-staple foodstuffs.    Local officials believe that the development of Yangzhou,  which abounds in oil and natural gas resources, will surely help  boost the economy in north Jiangsu.    At present, the Yangzhou city government is working on a  series of preferential policies to encourage foreign investment  in the port construction.</p>

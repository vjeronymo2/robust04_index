			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Government Bonds: German cut in repo rate fails to lift the gloom European government bonds lost further ground yesterday, falling between half a point and a full point as markets remained in a jittery mood following this week's rise in US short-term interest rates, and in spite of a bigger than expected cut in the German repo rate. The Bundesbank announced that its securities repurchase rate had fallen to 5.58 per cent this week, from 5.70 per cent last week. The 12 basis point cut in the rate exceeded market expectations, but while the German government bond market had traded higher ahead of the announcement on hopes of a substantial reduction, the actual announcement prompted heavy selling of bunds and profit-taking by traders. Market analysts were astonished by the bund market's response. The Liffe bund futures contact, which had opened at 95.15 and had reached high of 95.19 ahead of the repo, sold off and fell to a low of 94.16 on the repo news. Bund prices rallied in the afternoon, but then slipped back and the Liffe futures contract was trading at around 94.25 by late afternoon. Traders said that sentiment was not helped by the combination of poor demand for new supply from the Bundespost, and comments by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, who said that German gross domestic product would grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994 - a figure at the top end of the government forecast range. French government bonds fell by nearly a point on the day as the weakness of the French franc continued to upset the bond market. With the French currency trading outside its former ERM bands, some bond analysts believe the Bank of France may be less likely to cut its intervention rate at today's Monetary Policy Council meeting, despite the Bundesbank's repo rate cut yesterday and cuts in the discount and Lombard rates last week. The notional bond futures contract traded on the Matif futures exchange fell from its opening of 121.14 to a low of 119.90 before settling at 120.10. The French-German 10-year yield spread widened further to 31 basis points yesterday from 25 basis points the previous day. UK government bonds took fright following the release of new economic data which pointed to a continuation of the economic recovery. The figures were interpreted as reducing the chances of a base rate cut in the immediate future. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the UK fell by 30,300 in March to 2.72m, a bigger decline than the 25,000 fall which had been expected, and this was seen as reducing the need for a cut in interest rates. More worrying for the gilt market, however, was data on growth in earnings for the year to February, which fuelled fears that inflation could tick up again. Underlying earnings in the whole economy rose by 3.5 per cent, while the rise for the year to January was revised upwards to 3.5 per cent from 3.25 per cent. Economists pointed out that in such thin trading, the initial decline in gilt prices was exaggerated, and that the market was determined to focus on the worst possible interpretation. 'I don't think there is anything to worry about in the average earnings figures and there is no sign of wage settlements taking off, which is a more important sign,' said one analyst. US Treasury bonds moved moderately higher yesterday as traders shrugged off strong economic news and focused on a slump in commodity prices. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/8 better at 87 7/32 , with the yield easing to 7.307 per cent. At the short end of the maturity spectrum, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 1/32 , to yield 5.662 per cent. The morning brought bad news to a market wary of developments which may bring forward the next increase in the interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Since February, the central bank has been tightening monetary policy in an effort to slow the economy's rate of growth. The Commerce Department said housing starts in March had jumped 12.1 per cent, after an 8 per cent fall in the previous month. The data was evidence that the economy made a strong recovery from February's weather-related cooling. Bonds immediately dipped on the announcement but soon steadied amid 'short-covering' by traders who had to replace securities they had borrowed and resold on a bet that prices would slide. Activity was light, but the market continued to improve during the afternoon. Sentiment was lifted by a drop in a closely watched barometer of inflationary trends. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 products fell below 220 for the first time since December.</p>

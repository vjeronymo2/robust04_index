			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA GOP WON'T CENSURE DUKE  </P> <P> The state's Republican Committee on Saturday declined to censure state Rep.  David Duke for his past as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan.  </P> <P> The committee has no authority to kick Duke out of the party, but two committee  members who worked on the censure said they had done so because of Duke's past  of "promoting racial violence, his anti-Semitism and his neo-Nazi  philosophies."  </P> <P> Neil Curran and Elizabeth Rickey, both of New Orleans, tried to introduce the  resolution at the party's quarterly meeting. The resolution was tabled without  debate.  </P> <P> Curran and Rickey worked for Duke's opponent, John Treen, during the campaign,  Duke said.  </P> <P> "Basically, they can't accuse me of doing anything wrong. They can't question  my stated platforms. They have to go back in my past," Duke said.  </P> <P> Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, censured Duke after  he won his legislative seat in February. But the state Republican Party has  shied away from any move to censure Duke.  </P> <P> Duke, from Metairie, joined the klan in 1968 and left in 1980 after six years  as grand wizard, a national post. Duke later founded a group called the  National Assn. for the Advancement of White People, which he still heads.  </P></p>

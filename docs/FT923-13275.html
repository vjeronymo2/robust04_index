			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC acts to protect its fine foods BRITAIN yesterday rallied to the defence of the European Community's gourmet fare, when Mr John Gummer steered through a meeting of his fellow farm ministers a plan to protect specialist foods against imitation, Reuter reports from Brussels. Any Dutch or Danish farmer with ambitions to copy Brie de Meaux, Crottin de Chavignol or Bleu d'Auvergne cheeses can forget them. But big cheese businesses will be able to go on making as much Greek-style feta or English-style Cheddar as they like. The decision, the first ministers have made under Mr Gummer's chairmanship, means pungent French cheeses and other specialities strongly associated with a particular region can be labelled as authentic and cannot be imitated. The scheme, on the lines of France's appelation controlee system for fine wines, is intended to boost sales of high-class traditional foods after years of EC farm policy that encouraged quantity at the expense of quality. The plan was dogged for months by difficulties over what to do about products such as feta and Spanish-style chorizo sausage, which are made all over the EC. Now a list of foods whose recipes have already travelled well beyond their motherlands will be drawn up to prevent makers laying claim to them as extra-special. And any product that was legally on sale in the EC at the end of June can go on being sold as before. The scheme divided ministers on north-south lines. It was supported enthusiastically by countries such as Italy and France, while the Netherlands and Denmark, which specialise in the mass production of everyday cheese, voted against. Belgium joined them.</p>

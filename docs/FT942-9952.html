			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Egypt under fire for prison death Human Rights Watch, the Washington-based organisation, has written a strong letter of condemnation to Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, following the death during police detention of a 32-year-old lawyer, Mr Adbel Harith Madani, who was a member of the Egyptian Organisation of Human Rights (EOHR). The US organisation called on Mr Mubarak to take 'immediate action to discover the circumstances and reasons for Mr Madani's death' and prosecute those responsible. Mr Hassan al-Alfie, Egypt's interior minister, said Mr Madani 'died of an attack of asthma' and it had 'nothing to do with torture'. The Egyptian bar association has accused the police of killing Mr Madani, saying police subjected him to electric shocks and whipping and set fire to his body. The EOHR said Mr Madani was arrested on April 26 and held incommunicado. They say his family was later informed on May 6 of his death, and that his body had been prepared for burial three days before they were told. Mr Madani was apparently detained for his contacts with Islamic militants, some of whom he had defended in court. Thousands of fellow lawyers met at the bar association's offices earlier this week to protest at his death. In its letter, Human Rights Watch says government denials of the use of torture 'ring increasingly hollow' in the face of 'the accumulated weight of evidence, including scores of forensic medical reports prepared by government-employed physicians who have examined torture victims'. The EOHR says it believes 16 people have died from torture in Egyptian prisons since the start of 1993. It claims that up to 14,000 people at any time are in detention for alleged contact with or membership of militant groups and that torture of such detainees is 'methodical'.</p>

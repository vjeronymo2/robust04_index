			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Observer: Flood tide How does a small island community of 22,000 people cope with not one but two waves of pollution - the second being the deluge of journalists and other carpet-baggers who've descended on Shetland since the good ship Braer hit the rocks on Tuesday? Surprisingly well, it seems. Although the supply of hire cars was soon exhausted, and Radio Shetland had to appeal for spare beds, demand has not massively exceeded the 1,880 rooms available on the main island. Meanwhile, taxis have done a roaring trade ferrying hacks, at Pounds 19 a trip, 25 miles back and forth between Lerwick and the Sumburgh rescue centre.</p>

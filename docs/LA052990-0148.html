			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NOLAN RYAN'S RETURN DELAYED; HE'LL MISS START AGAINST ANGELS  </P> <P> The eagerly awaited return of Nolan Ryan to the pitching mound for the  struggling Texas Rangers will be delayed an additional six days, team officials  say.  </P> <P> Ryan had been placed on the 15-day disabled list and the team originally  planned to bring him off the list in time to start next Saturday night against  the Angels.  </P> <P> But Ryan had more problems with his back spasms Monday while pitching during a  15-minute session at Arlington Stadium.  </P> <P> "When Nolan pitches again, I want him to feel confident this has been taken  care of," Manager Bobby Valentine said. "I don't want him to try to pitch  through it and have it be a continuing situation."  </P> <P> A back injury is something he has not endured before, Ryan said. He added that  he is frustrated at not being able to help.  </P> <P> The Rangers said Ryan will be transferred to the 21-day disabled list, making  him eligible to return on June 8.  </P></p>

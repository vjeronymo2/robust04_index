			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: Holloway's Fantasies - Summer festival time has arrived in earnest Two anniversaries, of Grieg at 150 and Robin Holloway at 50, provide the focal points for this year's Bath Festival, which opened on Friday. The Grieg celebration ranges widely across the piano works, chamber music and songs, as well as generating its own secondary theme in the music of Schumann, such a potent influence on the young Norwegian and vitally important to Holloway's creative make-up too. Holloway's fiftieth year has already provided the opportunity to revive two of his most fascinating scores of the 1970s - the BBC Philharmonic included movements from the deliciously extravagant Domination of Black in its Cambridge invitation concert earlier this year, and last month at the Festival Hall the BBC Symphony Orchestra played again Holloway's Second Concerto for Orchestra, perhaps his finest work to date. Though there is one brand-new piece, a Partita for solo horn, in the Bath celebration it ranges back nicely across two decades of Holloway's output, inevitably concentrating on the smaller-scale pieces but nevertheless promising a nicely rounded portrait of one of Britain's most intriguing and often frustrating composers. The Nash Ensemble's programme on Saturday evening included two Holloway works. The Concertino No. 5, Summer Music, from 1991 still seems to me a peripheral piece, but the 1971 Fantasy Pieces Op 16 again emerged as powerful and disconcerting, one of the scores (together with the orchestral Scenes from Schumann and the instrumental Evenings with Angels) that first established the distinctive tone of Holloway's voice. The Fantasy Pieces take Schumann's Op 24 Liederkreis as their starting point. As Holloway suggests they were delivered here with a performance of the Schumann song cycle (by an urgent, slightly over-insistent Neil Mackie) placed between the Praeludium and the remaining movements. The result is sometimes remarkable, sometimes misjudged; the coarse-grained scoring gives a lurid cast to some of the material as Holloway takes up Schumann's material, layers and cross-cuts it, refracts it through his transformational prisms. Given an almost Wagnerian opulence the themes acquire extraordinary new resonances, the harmony unexpected implications; the expressive world seems immeasurably broader. Twenty years on some of Holloway's ideas have become commonplace. But in the context of the late 1960s his boldness in recognising what he wanted to do in his music and the source of his creative strength now seems extremely brave. His subsequent development has not always sustained that early enterprise, but works like the Fantasy Pieces demonstrate how potent and invigorating his imagination can be. The Nash performances directed by Martyn Brabbins were spry and incisive. They also included Oliver Knussen's Songs without Voices, four portions of lyrical concentrate first heard in New York and Aldeburgh last year, and the premiere of a horn trio by Mark-Anthony Turnage, commissioned by the Bath Festival; At Close of Day is dedicated by Turnage to the memory of Charles Groves. It is a lucid, uncomplicated piece: an expressive dialogue between violin and horn is joined by a halting, out-of-kilter piano line, worked to a weighty climax and allowed to trickle away again. The effect is direct and impressive. Bath Festival continues until June 5</p>

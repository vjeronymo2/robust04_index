			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- The Natural Resources and  Energy Agency will pursue a policy aimed at limiting the annual  growth of energy consumption at around 1 percent by 2010, a  senior agency official said Thursday [19 May].    The policy is designed to promote energy conservation in the  context of preserving the global environment, the official said  on condition of anonymity. The agency is part of the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry.    The official said the policy will be clarified in an interim  report forecasting Japan's long-term energy supply and demand.  It will be released by the advisory committee for energy in May  or June. The panel advises the trade minister.    Energy conservation in the new policy will focus on  consumption by households and transportation sectors, the  official said.    New sources of energy also should be used to improve energy  saving, including solar power, recycled use of waste materials  and cogeneration systems. The official said the "summer time"  daylight saving system should be introduced in Japan.    He said Japan's energy consumption would grow at an annual  rate of around 1.5 percent toward 2010 if the current energy  policy is maintained.    On the bargain sale of gasoline by an unlicensed gas station  near Nagoya, the agency official said it is "timely" to discuss  the validity of a law governing the operation of gas stations.    The gas station was not granted a business license by MITI  because it did not clarify the wholesale sources of its  products, a requirement for running a gas station in Japan.    The station, however, began selling gasoline in defiance of  MITI's instructions.    Under the existing system, to get a license a retailer must  adhere to the requirement, introduced as a way of securing a  stable supply of products, the official said.    The official said he understands the regulation is intended  to prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas  stations.    But he added there appears to be room to discuss the  validity  of maintaining the regulation.</p>

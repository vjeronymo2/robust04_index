			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING SET ON PRIVATE STREET PLAN  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council on Tuesday agreed to hold a public hearing  on a request to convert several public streets to private ways by residents who  live in a neighborhood at the city's highest point.  </P> <P> The residents, who say the views and vacant lots in their tract of expensive  luxury homes are an "attractive nuisance," have asked for private streets many  times in the last decade.  </P> <P> There has been a lot of litter and reports of vandalism in the neighborhood on  San Pedro Hill, city officials said. The council set the hearing for July 17,  but indicated that while it might limit vehicle traffic through the  development, it would not cut off other public access to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The development is off of Crest Road and includes Paseo de Pino and Paseo de  Castana.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YET IT'S STILL THE KIROV  </P> <P> Oleg Vinogradov wasn't happy. An official representative warned us.  </P> <P> The all-powerful chief choreographer and boldly independent artistic director  of the Kirov Ballet, which opens an exclusive nine-performance stand at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday, apparently wasn't having much  fun in Fun City. Something was getting lost in exportation.  </P> <P> He had brought one of the most prestigious ensembles in the world -- some still  call it the greatest of its kind -- from its cloistered home in Leningrad to  the glamorous stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. Although his vaunted and  revered company had toured other American cities -- including Los Angeles -- as  recently as 1986, this was the first New York engagement ventured by the Kirov  in a quarter century.  </P> <P> It was an important, symbolic return. Some things, alas, weren't going well.  </P> <P> Tickets, to be sure, were gratifyingly scarce, even with a good orchestra seat  costing $75. Audiences were enthusiastic -- as they invariably are when snob  appeal runs high, when the repertory is accessible and the object of instant  affection happens to hail from a mysterious locale behind the perestroika  curtain.  </P> <P> Still, recurring problems ruffled crucial composures. The reception by the New  York press had been mixed at best, disenchanted at worst. Aficionados in and  out of print were complaining that the repertory was stale, the tradition  tarnished, the pervasive interpretive attitude old-fashioned and the dancing  uneven. The women, for the most part, were garnering far more approval than the  men.  </P> <P> Glasnost or not, the would-be festive mood in the house was dampened by  stringent security precautions. All patrons were frisked -- albeit  half-heartedly -- upon entering. If anyone chose to exit during intermission,  there could be no return. The standing-room area downstairs, normally haven for  the most sophisticated balletomanes, was closed. Plain-clothed guardians of  social order and political virtue sat glumly at the front of each aisle, back  to the stage and face to the crowd, throughout every performance.  </P> <P> There had been no defections from the Kirov ranks, although, as fate would have  it, a single member of the auxiliary corps would seek asylum a few days later.  Nevertheless, one sensed unrest in depth.  </P> <P> It was no secret that some of the dancers were suffering injuries. They were  unaccustomed, we were told, to our unraked stages. Members of the company, on  various levels, were also complaining indiscreetly of a classic Western malady  that results from the insulting combination of overwork and underpay.  </P> <P> At least one comrade, a flamboyant would-be superstar named Farukh Ruzimatov,  sent word that he would grant interviews only if properly remunerated for his  extra-terpsichorean efforts. The evil capitalist system apparently corrupts  quickly, and in surprising ways.  </P> <P> Regardless of advance announcements, Vinogradov had been altering repertory  details and shuffling his roster right up to curtain time. Customers who had  expected to see a specific senior ballerina in a central role often ended up,  for better or worse, seeing a talented but obscure novice instead. One couldn't  invariably tell the players even with a program.  </P> <P> Then there was the vexing matter of a scratchy American orchestra in the pit.  Urged onward if not upward by an indulgent pair of Kirov maestros, the local  pick-up band often seemed to be sight-reading the complex scores at hand, and  not very accurately at that.  </P> <P> Making diplomatic relations even more precarious, New York mustered no children  for the lavish new production of "Sleeping Beauty." A highly placed spokeswoman  at the Met explained that Kirov authorities had simply forgotten to request the  hippety-hopping kids. Vinogradov claimed that the host organization had refused  to recruit them.  </P> <P> And so it went.  </P> <P> A model of cooperative bonhomie both in Vancouver and Los Angeles two years  ago, Vinogradov was now dodging interviews. Igor Stupnikov, his trusty  aide-de-camp and official (often superfluous) translator, cited no  recrimination on the director's part, just conflicting professional exigencies.  </P> <P> Backstage observers speculated, however, that he found the opportunity of doing  some fancy shopping or taking in a Manhattan boat tour more appealing than the  prospect of dealing with inquisitive American reporters. In a way, at least one  inquisitive reporter couldn't blame him.  </P> <P> Appointments, in any case, were habitually scheduled, postponed, canceled,  forgotten, remembered and rescheduled. At one last-ditch encounter, the  beleaguered boss found himself confronted by two rival interrogators at the  same potentially awkward time.  </P> <P> He avoided what might have become an awkward contretemps by promising -- really  promising -- to talk to one journalist immediately and inviting the second, now  understandably skeptical, to return for a private conversation the next night,  same time, same place. All, for the moment, was well.  </P> <P> Well, almost all.  </P> <P> The Official Version  </P> <P> Vinogradov sits behind a makeshift desk in a large dressing room backstage at  the Met. Dark, thin and chronically intense, he looks weary but younger than  his 51 years. He also looks forbidding -- at least for a while.  </P> <P> Glowering, just a little, he motions his intrepid visitor to a chair. The  visitor obeys. The ubiquitous translator follows suit.  </P> <P> The table top is covered with cans of spray paint, bits of colored paper,  assorted crayons and sticks of chalk. Vinogradov, who fidgets with his tools as  he talks, likes to dabble in art. To these eyes, he dabbles deftly if a bit  kitschily.  </P> <P> He has designed the decors for some of the items in the current repertory. His  pretty drawings and sketches -- usually of balletic subjects -- have been  exhibited, and sometimes sold, in theaters where the Kirov has appeared. A  well-informed rumor monger speculates that relations with the Met sponsors  began to become tense when the New Yorkers resisted an invitation to display  Vinogradov's illustrations.  </P> <P> When asked about the somber atmosphere surrounding the Lincoln Center  engagement, Vinogradov denies the existence, even the possibility, of any  trouble.  </P> <P> "Problems?" he repeats rhetorically. "We have absolutely no problems." He has  introduced his favorite adverb.  </P> <P> He pauses for qualification. "Of course, life with a company like ours cannot  always be ideal. We are a big family. It is normal that some things  occasionally go wrong. But there are no problems. Absolutely none."  </P> <P> One suspects the gentleman protests too much. He squints into a distant  invisible horizon.  </P> <P> "The public response," he volunteers, "has been good. The press has been very  good, very objective. Most of the remarks have been quite correct and to the  point."  </P> <P> He admits with a sigh that some Canadian interviewers had annoyed him. "They  asked who Mr. Kirov was, and when he formed the company. Can you imagine? I had  to explain to these newspaper people that they should read some books. But New  York isn't like that."  </P> <P> So he isn't unhappy about anything?  </P> <P> The frown turns into a soulful scowl. "Unhappy?" He repeats the word in  staccato English. Then he reverts to mellifluous Russian. "Why should I be  unhappy about anything?"  </P> <P> The subject is closed.  </P> <P> 'So Much Has Changed'  </P> <P> Vinogradov thaws. The dour facade fades as he talks about his charges. The  proud paterfamilias emerges.  </P> <P> "So much has changed," he says, "since we were last in America.  </P> <P> "We have danced Balanchine at last. We have had a dancer from American Ballet  Theatre, your Susan Jaffe, as a guest in 'Don Quixote.' We have sent three  dancers to American Ballet Theatre. (Two of them, Altynai Assylmuratova and her  husband Konstantin Zaklinsky, appeared in "Swan Lake" at the Shrine earlier  this season.)  </P> <P> "(Natalia) Makarova has been able to return to our stage. Baryshnikov has been  invited. We always have been adventurous, I think, but we can be more openly  adventurous now.  </P> <P> "We have a new generation of dancers. The younger ones dominate now. You will  see some wonderful girls from the class of (Ninella) Kurgapkina."  </P> <P> And what about the boys?  </P> <P> "What about the boys?"  </P> <P> Some experts, the interviewer nervously responds, have complained that the  Kirov women, whether in the corps de ballet or in central roles, outdance their  male counterparts.  </P> <P> "Absolutely," Vinogradov agrees. "The men are weaker." His frankness startles.  </P> <P> Then it is diluted as he paraphrases Balanchine. "The foundation of ballet is  the woman. This is not a football team. The position is the same in all  companies of the world."  </P> <P> Ironically, perhaps, Vinogradov has brought to New York only one ballet of his  own devising: "Battleship Potemkin." It utilizes an ultra-athletic, virtually  all-male cast.  </P> <P> It also turns out to be a quaintly dated demonstration of socialist-realism  melodrama ornamented with grand group-grope gestures. After a series of  cartoonish exercises alternating with sticky pas de deux involving the grim  reaper and various victims, a horde of beef-caky sailors rip off their uniform  tops, emit a lusty unison yell, and, at last savoring the exhilaration of  mutiny, dash into the audience and up the aisle to the foyer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a swarm of toy sea gulls on strings descends from the lurid sky on a  blood-red stage. The curtain falls to the thumps of a mock-romantic score by  Alexander Tchaikovsky (no relation to you-know-who) that would dishonor 1930s  movie-music.  </P> <P> None of this is exactly subtle. But it may tell us what revolutionary modernism  looks and sounds like in contemporary Leningrad.  </P> <P> Why, one wonders, was "Potemkin" seen only in New York?  </P> <P> "It is too cumbersome," Vinogradov explains, with obvious regret. "The set is  rather complex, and the navy on the stage enlists 30 extra sailors who are not  normally in our corps."  </P> <P> This brings up the perennial double standard for touring companies in America.  What is good enough for New York is often better than what the rest of the  country gets.  </P> <P> Southern Californians were disappointed when it was learned that the Costa Mesa  season would not include the epochal Balanchine ballets recently performed at  the Kirov Theater and at the Met. Balanchine, it will be remembered, began his  career in Leningrad and became an anathema at home while he achieved balletic  sainthood in the United States.  </P> <P> At first Vinogradov seems surprised to be told that "Theme and Variations" and  "Scotch Symphony" are not planned for the West Coast. He dutifully checks his  own records, then nods gravely.  </P> <P> "We thought you were sick and tired of Balanchine," he jests. "Anyhow, Orange  County asked for the bigger productions."  </P> <P> Who makes the final decisions regarding what goes on the road?  </P> <P> Vinogradov waves aside the stupid question before it can be translated. "I  decide," he says, pointing dramatically to his chest.  </P> <P> Then comes an enigmatic afterthought. "Perhaps I will surprise you."  </P> <P> As we go to press, it appears that at least half a Balanchine surprise may come  true. One performance of "Theme and Variations" will be added to the local  schedule.  </P> <P> Playing to Americans  </P> <P> Vinogradov likes surprises, whether they involve repertory or casting. He also  savors flexibility.  </P> <P> "When I decide who will perform," he says, "I take into consideration the  situation of the moment. We have five or six dancers for each role. We try to  rotate opportunities."  </P> <P> In the past, many of the most prominent opportunities fell to Galina  Mezentseva, a rather brittle ballerina obviously more popular in the Soviet  Union than here. Americans have been far more responsive to the lyrical  expansion of Altynai Assylmuratova and the bravura grandeur of Tatiana  Terekhova (who appeared fleetingly in Orange County last season with the Moscow  Classical Ballet).  </P> <P> "C'est la vie," says Vinogradov. "It is a matter of taste. Mezentseva is a very  talented dancer. She may have some technical problems, but she can exert a  great influence over the audience."  </P> <P> At the final Kirov performance in Los Angeles two years ago, Vinogradov came  before the Shrine Auditorium curtain to introduce a lavish series of unexpected  encores. Mezentseva expired twice as the Dying Swan.  </P> <P> "The public liked all of this," he recalls. "I could feel it in the air.  Sometimes it is absolutely necessary to improvise."  </P> <P> Since the added numbers required music on the stands in the pit, not to mention  dancers in premeditated costumes, one had to wonder just how spontaneous  Vinogradov's last-minute decisions can be.  </P> <P> He grins mischievously as he recalls the occasion, and speaks in English.  </P> <P> "I say, 'One more?' They clap and say 'yes.' I say, 'What you want?' They say  'modern.' "  </P> <P> He even harbors happy memories of the cavernous Shrine.  </P> <P> "I will never forget it," he says. "It was one of the strongest impressions of  my life. Six thousand people told us that they loved us. The big stage was  nice. Our corps needs space. I don't like small stages. The atmosphere was OK,  and the audience was wonderful."  </P> <P> And what about Segerstrom Hall, the incipient home away from home for the  Kirov?  </P> <P> "It is splendid. Absolutely. I visited it some months ago, and was impressed. I  only wish you used raked stages here. That would be better for everyone, the  dancers and the public too."  </P> <P> Several names that drew popular attention here in 1986 are missing from the  current prospectus. It is explained that Olga Chenchikova, remembered as a  marvelously heroic Odette/Odile, is on maternity leave. Evgeny Kolobov, the  fiery conductor, has moved on to a new post in Moscow.  </P> <P> Vinogradov becomes pensive and evasive at the mention of young Alexander Lunev,  who had seemed a likely successor to the tragically lamented Yuri Soloviev.  </P> <P> "Lunev is ailing. He has a serious disease. His career may be in jeopardy. We  miss him."  </P> <P> Requests for more specific information are rejected. "It is not appropriate to  talk of this," says Vinogradov. Backstage sources suggest, however, that Lunev  may suffer from alcoholism.  </P> <P> Perestroika and Dance  </P> <P> Vinogradov emphatically welcomes the recent changes in the Soviet perspective.  </P> <P> "The tours are easier now because of the change. It has become easier to live  and breathe within the company. We managed to present contemporary ballets, by  Bejart and Roland Petit and many young Russians, long before it was  fashionable. You might say that perestroika came to the Kirov before it came to  the Kremlin.  </P> <P> "Nevertheless, we still have to deal with officialdom. The bureaucracy still  can be difficult."  </P> <P> The bureaucracy has not precluded open visits, even negotiations, with some  illustrious Kirov defectors.  </P> <P> "Makarova's return to us was very emotional for everyone. The tension was  absolutely incredible. She spent all the time with us here in New York, until  she left today for London. She was at all the performances. We hope she will  come to Leningrad again.  </P> <P> "Nureyev came and watched for a whole day. It made us all happy. These things  would have been unthinkable before."  </P> <P> If all goes as is hoped, Mikhail Baryshnikov will bring his American Ballet  Theatre to Leningrad in the fall.  </P> <P> "I have something to offer him," Vinogradov says. "But he seems evasive.  </P> <P> "It would be a good joint venture. The company remembers him, likes him. There  are good feelings. An exchange of some sort would be very useful.  </P> <P> "I hope we can meet. We have not discussed our plans in detail. I have the  feeling Baryshnikov does not want very much to talk.  </P> <P> "There are no reasons for this. Perhaps this is a difficult time for him. He  just had a child. He has resigned from his post. I am told that there were  difficulties with his 'Swan Lake.'  </P> <P> "He lives his life as he must. He would be welcome in Leningrad at any moment.  I have also invited him to dance at a gala celebrating the 100th birthday of  Nijinsky on Dec. 20, 1989. So far no answer."  </P> <P> Baryshnikov is moody, a visitor volunteers.  </P> <P> "He is Russian," confirms Vinogradov. He grins knowingly.  </P> <P> 'Our Door Is Open'  </P> <P> Vinogradov, like the moody Baryshnikov, is no stranger to criticism.  </P> <P> "In Russia, the critics form cliques," he laments. "Very often, a critic  expresses the ideas of a specific camp. There is one camp in Leningrad that  likes me, another that thinks I am ruining the Kirov. For them I can do nothing  right.  </P> <P> "Perhaps they do not like me because I do my own business my own way. I am  subservient to no one. I pay no attention, and go on doing what I think is  right. (Yuri) Grigorovich faces similar problems at the Bolshoi.  </P> <P> "Some of the critics in Leningrad are former dancers or, worst of all, dancers  whom I have protested and fired. They write out of revenge. Others are merely  dilettantes."  </P> <P> Vinogradov recently caused a small stir at home when he censored the annotation  prepared for Balanchine's "Scotch Symphony."  </P> <P> "The article was shown to me too late. I could ask for no changes, so I decided  that having no program would be better than having this program. The critic who  wrote the article was expressing his own thoughts as if they came from  Balanchine. They were dubious thoughts, and this was a young critic. That made  it worse."  </P> <P> The Leningrad audience, he finds, is often more open to novelty than is the  press. "Some critics want nothing to change, ever. I want many things to  change, and I think much of the public is on my side."  </P> <P> He is eager to have more of what he regards as experimental dance in Leningrad,  even though there seem to be some gaps in his knowledge of the avant garde. He  professes no knowledge of Mark Morris, but great interest in Martha Graham and  Jerome Robbins.  </P> <P> "I don't want the Kirov to be separated from the rest of the world any more,"  he exclaims. "Our door is open. It is open to choreographers and to dancers. I  am not sure, however, if the United States really wants to send them."  </P> <P> The historic but hasty guest appearance by Susan Jaffe apparently did not run  as smoothly as one might have wished.  </P> <P> "She had a success, even though there were difficult moments. She was a bit  capricious. There were problems in her adapting to our production. She danced  only one performance. Still, I want to try this sort of exchange regularly."  </P> <P> By a similar token, he wouldn't mind seeing more of his own work on foreign  stages. His most recent effort was a daring and distinctly individual version  of "Petrushka" staged for the Scottish Ballet in Glasgow.  </P> <P> "I used an all-new libretto, different personages. I departed from tradition in  every way, although of course I retained the Stravinsky score. There was no  trace of Fokine. I made it a ballet about glasnost and perestroika."  </P> <P> This revisionist "Petrushka" may lack a straw-clown hero, but the choreographer  insists that it retains its theatricality.  </P> <P> "Everything I do," says Oleg Vinogradov, is very theatrical. Absolutely."  </P> <P> FO Altynai Assylmuratova (Aurora), Andrei Bosov as a suitor in "Sleeping  Beauty."JACK VARTOOGIAN  </P></p>

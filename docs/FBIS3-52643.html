			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has  said that Pakistan attaches the highest importance to peace and  security in the Indian Ocean, as the country depends heavily on  the sea for trade, commerce, and other economic benefits. He  was addressing the 60th midshipmen commissioning parade at the  Pakistan Naval Academy [PNA], PNS Rahbar, in Karachi today. On  arrival at the naval academy, the president was accorded the  general salute. He reviewed the parade. The president gave  prizes to the outstanding midshipmen. He gave the chairman,  joint chiefs of staff committee, gold medal to Cadet Mohammad  Amin Sharif, PNA dirk for runner-up to Midshipman Mohammad  Waheed, and the sword of honor to Midshipman Rahim Akbar.  Champion division and winner of proficiency banner was Fox-1  Division.    Speaking on the occasion, the president said the Indian  Ocean  constitutes the lifeline of the world economy, as about  one-fourth of international trade passes through it. He said  Pakistan being a littoral state, its concern is perfectly  legitimate; and inexplicably large naval buildup by any country  in the region naturally and understandably heightens our worries  about the security of our shores and the safety of our sea  lanes. He said this concern can be allayed if the Indian Ocean  is declared a zone of peace.    Congratulating the passing-out midshipmen, the president  emphasized the need for a high spirit of patriotism. The  commanding officer of the academy said that the highest  professional training has been given to the passing-out  midshipmen. March past and salute to the president by the  midshipmen.

Later talking to newsmen informally at PNS Rahbar in Karachi  today, the president said that Pakistan had agreed to  participate in the Indo-Pak secretary-level talks, as it  sincerely desired the solution of the Kashmir dispute. The  president said, moreover, it was a welcome move for Pakistan, as  during the last three decades, it was for the first time that  India had agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue. It was  heartening to note that at least Kashmir was recognized as a  legitimate dispute, the president added. The president said  from Pakistan's view, it was a victory as at last India finally  recognized that Kashmir is a disputed territory which needs  ultimate solution. He said the resumption of Indo-Pak talks was  actually a support from Pakistan to the liberation struggle of  the Kashmiris, as it greatly values their just struggle. Mr.  Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that Kashmir issue is a most  intricate issue and one should not expect immediate results.</p>

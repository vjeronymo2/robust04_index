			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pep confusion PERSONAL equity plan investors, thinking of reducing their exposure to equities by diversifying into bonds, could be forgiven if they ended the week a little confused. On the one hand Save &amp; Prosper began the embarrassing task of writing to between 800 and 1,000 planholders informing them they would have to move out of bonds if their Peps are to remain valid after April 6, while M &amp; G and Fidelity are planning the launch of bond-led schemes. The two apparently contradictory initiatives stem from an Inland Revenue rule drafting error in July and its unprecedented decision to rewrite the Pep rules retrospectively. The result: Save &amp; Prosper, which launched its plan in September, has been caught between rule and counter rule and its combined bond and equity pep judged offside. M &amp; G and Fidelity have sidestepped the thrust of the new regulations and are planning to launch virtually identical hybrid schemes. The new rules, effective from April 6, will render any monies held in bond or gilt-based unit and subject to full taxation. Plan-holders can invest up to Pounds 1,500 in these so-called 'non-qualifying' funds. Most of the affected investors hold units in Save &amp; Prosper's Pep Portfolio. This controversial product, launched in September last year, exploited the loophole and combined Pep investments in equity and bond-based unit trusts for the first time. Previously bond funds were not actively marketed by Pep managers because investors who bought them had either to stop investing once the Pounds 1,500 limit had been reached or place the maximum Pounds 4,500 balance in single shares which entail a relatively high risk. The decision to rewrite the rules was taken by Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, who said the use of bond and gilt-based funds by Peps violated the spirit of the original legislation. 'Peps were introduced to encourage people to invest in shares and I have therefore decided that the regulations should be amended to correct the position,' he said. But Ken Emery, Save &amp; Prosper's technical director who is faced with moving up to Pounds 2m of investors money into new funds, called the Inland Revenue's action 'vindictive' and warned that many unitholders could end up with invalid plans. He was backed by the Unit Trust Association which said it would be writing to the Treasury this week attacking the retrospective nature of the change which it regards as 'objectionable in principle and unnecessary in practice.' Emery added: 'The Inland Revenue has admitted that it was its mistake but has nevertheless introduced this change retrospectively. 'It is ridiculous that we could now offer - as others are - a 49 per cent exposure to bonds, while the recommendation on the original product was that investors hold only 25 per cent in bonds. The new plan to be launched by M &amp; G will escape the new regulations because, instead of investing directly in a bond-based unit trusts, investors' money will initially be channeled into a qualifying fund of funds which in turn will invest in bond and other fixed interest funds. Fidelity's plan is also intended to meet the new rules, which stipulate that Pep subscriptions to unit or investment trusts will only be valid if the fund holds at least half its assets in equities.</p>

[KEPC], and other power companies will  decrease the "tokumei hatchu" [special designation ordering]  system and increase opportunities for adopting a competitive  bidding system. Under the "tokumei hatchu" system, an electric  company asks only one company to make an estimate for procuring  materials or ordering works. Various electric companies intend  to increase the ratio of using competitive bidding to 50 percent  from the current 30-40 percent. They have decided to do so to  deal with growing demands from foreign countries that  transparency be promoted in biddings for public works and  government procurement of materials. By promoting competition  in ordering works, electric power companies also intend to try  to reduce costs and control electric charges. Most of plant and  equipment investment by the electric power industry -- which  accounts for nearly 10 percent of the private sector's plant and  equipment investment, or 5 trillion yen annually -- will be a  subject for the current review of the ordering system. For this  reason, it is likely that this will widely affect such  industries as the electric equipment and construction industries.    Electric power companies have adopted two methods of  procuring materials: the "tokumei hatchu" and the designated  competitive bidding systems. Under the latter system, several  companies, which attain a certain level of technology and  quality control abilities, compete in the electric power  industry's procurement of materials. Since the ratio of  competitive biddings is small, people both inside and outside  the electric power industry have begun to express the following  critical views: "Companies which employ those who once worked  at electric power companies are being favorably treated" and  "the ground for selecting designated companies lacks  transparency."    TEPC intends to begin reviewing the ordering system and  increase the ratio of adopting competitive bidding to 50 percent  during fiscal year 1994. KEPC also intends to attain the  50-percent target by the end of the next fiscal year. The  Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Inc. will try to increase the  competitive bidding ratio to 50 percent from the current 30  percent as soon as possible. Chubu Electric Power Co. [CEPC] is  expected to attain the 50-percent target by the end of fiscal  year 1993.    Because some materials related to electric power plants are  jointly developed by electric power companies and makers and  highly advanced technology is necessary to develop such  materials, "it is difficult to drastically increase the  percentage of the designated competitive bidding system to  largely exceed 50 percent (as stated by CEPC). However,  electric power companies have judged that it is possible to  adopt the designated competitive bidding system in procuring  power-transmission wires, pylons, general power transformers and  distributors, communications equipment for business contacts,  and other materials.    Meanwhile, with regard to ordering works, KEPC has begun  studying an idea of introducing the general designated  competitive bidding system, which does not limit companies from  bidding. As far as KEPC is concerned, the designated  competitive bidding presently accounts for 60 percent of its  orders for works and the "tokumei hatchu" system accounts for 40  percent. Because strict qualifications are necessary for  receiving electric power-related works, the company, at first,  intends to introduce the general competitive bidding system to  ordinary engineering and construction works.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADERS spoke of a dull session in stock index futures, with business once again carried out in a tight range and turnover poor, writes Joel Kibazo. Sporadic selling characterised the early activity in the June contract on the FT-SE, which opened at 2,745. It slipped back to 2,740 by mid-morning, although the downward direction was briefly halted around midday when a few independent traders were caught short. Having filled their positions, June once again drifted lower, and further falls were recorded with the weak openning of Wall Street. June traded between the 2,740 to 2,750 area for most of the session. It closed at 2,740, around 15 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover was a low 5,121 contracts. In the traded options market, dealers said 'selling premium' was the main feature of the day. Turnover at 31,759 was an improvement on Tuesday's poor figure. The FT-SE option had a total of 8,043 contracts traded. Asda was the busiest stock option on 2,958 lots, with the October 40 puts particularly active. This was followed by British Gas, in which 1,820 contracts were transacted.</p>

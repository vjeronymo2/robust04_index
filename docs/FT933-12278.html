			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Cookery: The fruity thrills of summer berries - A party piece NOW THAT the first scarlet flush of summer fruits is over, the thrill of eating berries pure and simple is not quite what it was. Pudding menus progress naturally from the unadorned to the more elaborate. The first raspberries and strawberries call for nothing more than a sifting of sugar and a squeeze of lemon. Later, perfect fruit are served on a bed of coeur a la creme or junket or almond milk blancmange. Any that are lightly bruised or too full blown are crushed for fools, brulees and ice-creams or packed into bread-lined basins for summer pudding. If the weather turns goose-pimple cool, cherries, currants and berries can be tucked under a blanket of almond crumble and baked, or they can be warmed and spooned over buttery fried slices of brioche. Another favourite of mine is red fruit jelly. This is, in effect, a summer fruit salad softly set in its own juices. Strawberries, raspberries, red, white and blackcurrants, cherries, tay and loganberries, apricots, peaches, nectarines, blueberries, blackberries and mulberries can all be included, but redcurrants are the best basis for the jelly, jewel bright and agreeably sharp. The simplest, and I think the best, way to make it, is in a large glass bowl from which it can be spooned for serving. The bowl shows off the stained glass colours. It spares the cook the unnerving job of unmoulding and it means that little setting agent is needed so the taste of the fruits shines through. Served with creme fraiche and home-made sponge fingers maybe, it makes a good choice for Sunday lunch or a supper party. Sophisticates may consider it too nurseryish and may want to smarten it up. By all means use a long loaf tin to make it, unmould it, slice it for serving and call it 'terrine of summer fruits' if you will. More gelatine will be needed, however, or your creation may split and collapse ignominiously when turned out. The following party piece might be safer. SUMMER SAVARIN (serves 6-8) This is as easy as pie using a food processor and easy-blend yeast. Harvest Gold is the brand of yeast I like best as it contains no unnecessary additives. It is not widely sold but is always stocked by Safeways. Fill the savarin just before serving with 1lb-1 1/2 lb summer fruits (say  1/2 lb each raspberries, sliced peaches and stoned cherries) gently tossed in 2 teaspoons each sugar and lemon juice. For the cake: 6oz unbleached white bread flour; 1 tablespoon sugar; a large pinch of salt; 1 teaspoon or 3 grams (half a sachet) of Harvest Gold easy-blend yeast; 3 eggs, broken up with a fork; 5 tablespoons hot milk; 3oz butter. For the syrup:  1/2 lb sugar; 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Sift the flour, sugar and salt into a food processor. Stir in the yeast and process briefly to mix. Pour the eggs through the spout while the machine is running, then add the hot milk gradually, and continue processing until you have a smooth rich batter. Cover it and set it aside until doubled in volume. Dice the butter, melt it and beat it throughly into the risen dough. Turn the mixture into a well buttered and lightly floured savarin tin or ring mould measuring about 9in in diameter. Cover and leave to prove in a warm place until the mixture three-quarters or more fills the tin. Bake the cake at 200'C (400'F) gas mark 6 for 25-30 minutes until golden and springy to the touch. While it cooks, make the syrup: melt the sugar in  3/4 pt water and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice. Let the cooked savarin rest in its tin for a few minutes then unmould it carefully on to a shallow dish. Baste it immediately with the lemon syrup, pouring it on spoonful by spoonful. The cake should drink it up thirstily, gradually absorbing almost every drop, so the crumb ends up sated and slightly soggy. Shortly before serving, when the savarin is quite cold, spoon the fruits and their juices into the well of the cake. Serve alone or, preferably, with creme fraiche. Sainsbury has just introduced a low-fat version for the calorie conscious. It is not at all bad but only a ghost of Sainsbury's marvellous original own label creme fraiche. I would opt for half quantities of the full-fat version every time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Mannheim (DDP/ADN) -- The three-day Mannheim  election campaign congress of the Alliance 90/Greens ended today  with a call for peace and for guaranteed human rights for the  Kurds. The national congress also ended by recognizing the  Green-Alternative Youth Alliance as the party's new youth  organization. The Alliance 90/Greens are embarking on the  national election campaign with ecological and welfare policies  to counteract the economic crisis, and a radical policy on  disarmament. The national assembly adopted a program to that  effect, including a call for a new policy on foreigners,  refugees, and immigration. [passage omitted]</p>

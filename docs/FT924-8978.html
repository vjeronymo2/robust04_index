			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Merchant updated, Seagull transported / Review of Shakespeare and Chekhov in Manchester DISRAELI was right: 'The age of Classical ruins is past. Have you seen Manchester?' Dizzy might not have enjoyed the anti-semitism in The Merchant of Venice at Manchester's Library Theatre, but he would have approved the cultural diversity which the production witnesses in the city as a whole. To walk south on Oxford Road past The Green Room, The Palace Theatre and The Corner House towards the University is to see a mix of theatres, clubs, exhibitions, film, and jazz venues. Off Albert Square sits The Library Theatre, built as a lecture hall in 1934 under the magnificent Central Library (modeled on the British Museum reading room); the lecture-room became a small theatre in 1947. Chris Honer's steady production places The Merchant in 1920s Venice, according to Michael Taylor's deft design, connecting with market speculation and cultural attitudes then current. Anti-semitism excepted, perhaps 1990s Milan would have suited better, particularly since the ratio of public to private debt in Italy and England are inversely proportional. Back in the 1590s, the public world of Shylock's Rialto and the private world of Antonio's indebtedness meet in court, Jew with knife, Christian with bared breast, the Law looking on. But the production style misses the mark by going for the lira. It lacks the gathered intensity which makes Lorenzo and Jessica one of the most enthralling mixed marriages in Shakespeare. The flash double-breasted suits, panama hats and ticker tape tend to distract from the action; while the Belmont scenes, all flapper-dresses and gramophones, feel semi-detached. After all, this is a play about anti-semitism. The fine performances of Peter Whitman as Shylock and Kate Paul as Portia hold the action together. Whitman delivers Shakespeare's careful repetitions with the studied attention of a man doing business while pretending not to, firming the deal by repeating the details: 'Three thousand ducats, well.' - 'Ay, sir, for three months.' - 'For three months, well.' Then later in the scene: 'I had forgot, three months, you told me so.' Whitman manages to move from that quiet, steely beginning to his state of cold implacability in court. Opposite him, Paul's Portia handles her affairs with confident dispatch. Her 'mercy' speech in court, a special pleading unfamiliar to her, is a rehearsed-spontaneous moment, the indulgence of someone who knows her opponent's inferior hand. Other highlights include David Kelsey's Antonio and Chris Wright's Bassanio, both men about town. David Solomon, doubling as Shylock's friend and Lancelot Gobbo turns in a fine, versatile performance. Eventually the production settles in court, presenting anti- semitism in its rawest form, with Shylock humiliated, his possessions forfeited, his daughter converted. Perhaps Disraeli should have the last word, addressing the Commons: 'Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right honourable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island mine were in the temple of Solomon.' Chekhov described The Seagull as 'A comedy - three f, six m, four acts, rural scenery; much talk of literature, little action, five bushels of love.' Now The Manchester Contact Theatre Company has cast a gentle Celtic twilight over the play with an adaptation by Thomas Kilroy which transplants Chekhov to Ireland. He does not travel well. The journey west can be made, as Brian Friel's fine Dublin adaptation of Turgenev's A Month in The Country proves. The Moscow-Dublin connection looks plausible, until one compares the claustrophobia of feudal Ireland with the expansiveness of Czarist Russia: distance means yearning, the province a kind of personal isolation. Kilroy's adaptation rewrites the names, throws in a few jokes, and glimmers in the Celtic past. But whatever the news on Abbey St, Chekhov was not a Dubliner, even if he does however resemble Sean O'Casey. They knew how to make happenings on stage both as complex and as simple as in life. Everything turns on a gesture, a look, a promise: 'Perhaps we'll be back next year. Perhaps not.' None of the characters in this Seagull feels natural. Each lacks the mess and mystery which Chekhov distills from the vapour of everyday life. In the troubling worlds of The Cherry Orchard and The Three Sisters, a piece of social banter can also be the cry of torment: insight and knowledge loiter somewhere offstage, but rarely arrive. This Seagull has nothing in the wings, as it were. The production also lacks soul; in the anxiety to make each scene a polished delight, Brigid Larmour's direction disrupts the gentler pace of Chekhov's understanding. The play runs as if she has been reading too many of De Maupassant's volte-face tales and not enough of Chekhov's own clever insinuations. The patchy acting leaves the stronger performances (Maggie Shevlin as Arkadina, Paul Brightwell as Trigorin, and Kate Lonergan as Nina) stranded. The ordinariness of the doctor, the schoolteacher and the local farmers is essential to the play. As Chekhov said, 'theatricality is unnecessary. They are all simple, ordinary people.' Appearing to act too much mars the atmosphere. The advice which made Clint Eastwood also holds here: 'don't just do something, stand there.' The Mercant of Venice is at the Contact Theatre (061 274 4747) and The Seagull at the Library Theatre, Manchester (061 236 7110), both until November 21</p>

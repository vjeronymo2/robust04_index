			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Property deal by ex-Rosehaugh chief blocked British Rail and BICC, the construction group, have blocked an ambitious attempt by Mr Godfrey Bradman, former chairman of collapsed developer Rosehaugh, to re-enter the property development market. Mr Bradman, in partnership with Lord Young, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman and former trade secretary, leads a consortium which planned to build a Pounds 300m retail and residential development on a derelict 35-acre site at White City in west London. Mr Bradman, one of the most aggressive developers of the 1980s, whose company Rosehaugh went into receivership in 1992, persuaded London Regional Transport to sell him half the site, but the development was conditional on the purchase of the rest, owned by BICC and BR. They have decided to accept an offer from J. Sainsbury, the supermarket group, and Bride Hall, a property developer. Mr Peter Zinkin, a BICC director, said Mr Bradman had been 'extraordinarily difficult' during the negotiations. Mr Bradman agreed that his relationship with Mr Zinkin had become strained. Mr David Hunter, property director of Scottish Amicable, which was providing Pounds 100m for Mr Bradman's scheme, said Mr Bradman 'has alienated too many executives'. Mr Hunter added, however, that BR and BICC were passing up a great opportunity. Correspondence from Mr William Myers, director of the Environment Department at Hammersmith council, indicates that Mr Bradman's scheme would have been more likely to gain planning permission than is Sainsbury's. Mr Bradman said LRT would be between Pounds 50m and Pounds 70m better off under his proposal. He has written to Mr Steven Norris, the transport minister, and Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor-general, urging them to intervene to maximise proceeds for the public sector. Mr Malcolm Vince, of the British Rail Property Board, said BR's property adviser, Hillier Parker, concluded that the 'public purse in aggregate (funds to be received both by BR and LRT) would not lose out'. BR and BICC are hopeful that when LRT's agreement with Mr Bradman expires, LRT will join their scheme. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, said: 'Doing a deal with Sainsbury is far better for shareholders'. Mr Zinkin agreed that Hammersmith was likely to pass a preliminary resolution in favour of Mr Bradman's proposal in the coming few months, but he was less confident about the timing and terms of the grant of formal planning permission for Mr Bradman's scheme. He also pointed out that Mr Bradman still needed to raise an estimated Pounds 200m from banks, which might prove difficult. Mr Hunter said he had no doubt that any additional capital could be raised.</p>

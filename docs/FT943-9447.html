			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Accountancy: Nostalgia is a poor bottom line for auditing - David Maister argues that survival means moving from the traditional base to a wider range of services The biggest problem with the accounting profession today is that there are too many auditors and not enough accountants. What auditors are increasingly coming to realise is that an audit is a product, not a career. Saying you are an auditor is akin to stating that you know how to make - or supervise the making of - one thing and one thing alone: an audit. You are effectively betting your career on a single product, a risky move at best. This wasn't a bad bet back in the good old days when demand for that one product was great, when the market placed a high price on it, and clients did not shop for your product predominantly based on price. All this has changed. Now the question is: what else can you do for me to justify the high income I've been paying you auditors for all these years? Someone who is a pure auditor rather than an accountant has a serious career problem. Every year, all of the accounting firms are working furiously to train vast numbers of younger people to know how to do what the auditor knows how to do: supervise an audit. So, each year, the poor auditor's existing knowledge and skill is becoming less scarce and less valuable. His or her asset is rapidly depreciating in value. Of course, this sad situation is true of all professionals. They must continue to build new skills to stay ahead of the pack. But how does the poor auditor who wants to remain an auditor do this? The great business virtue of auditing - that it is annually recurring work - is also the greatest career trap for the auditor. He or she is not going to learn new things rapidly by auditing the same companies year after year. Keeping up with the latest changes in accounting regulations helps, but could hardly be called rapid skill building. The best and most obvious way to continue to build skills is to stop auditing the same clients and trade up to doing the audit of larger, more complex client organisations which pose stretching, challenging audit issues. It is not a bad solution, but unfortunately one that is available only to a tiny percentage of those trying to earn a living as auditors. Not every partner can audit British Telecom or its equivalent. In fact, it is fairly safe to say that the vast majority of auditors, if they are to keep their skills and knowledge valuable, will have to start doing something besides auditing. They will have to become accountants] They will have to start providing accounting and finance-related services that clients view as worthy of high fees. While it is true that accounting has long provided these services, that is not the point. The auditors themselves will have to be involved in providing these services. It may be nice for the client and your firm if one of your other partners provides these services, but where does that leave you? With a depreciating asset and a declining career. Firms keep telling their auditor to cross-sell the services of other partners, but that is not really the individual's need. What the auditor needs to do is sell additional services that he or she can perform, and thereby learn something new. Accounting firms have long talked about turning their audit partners into 'business advisers' - for so long in fact that the mere use of the phrase inside most firms elicits automatic grins and groans. But action has been limited. As a simple test, I often ask groups of audit partners: 'How many of you regularly read the trade magazines of your top one or two clients?' The answers around the world (I have tried this in Europe, North America and Australia) are always less than 10 per cent. So much for being business advisers. Some changes are observable. Firms and individuals are beginning to get serious about industry specialisation, finally responding to explicit client pleas that 'If you want to be more valuable to me, get to know my business and give me business ideas'. Firms are also beginning to put pressure on their partners to keep up their learning and not just 'cruise' on existing skills. If there is an 'up-or-out' system for those trying to become partners, there is now increasingly a 'grow-or-go' system for those who have made it. More and more, firms are looking at ways to re-engineer their audits, not only to reduce cost but to generate the kind of business-diagnostic information that will allow auditors to spot the need for additional value-added services. They are making use of executive education training for their partners to try to give them 'mini MBAs'. All of these actions are sensible, but they still leave open the most important question of all: is there a future in auditing? The more firms push to create the 'full-blown value-added audit', the more they raise concerns about the question that strikes at the heart of their existence: independence. If there are already regulatory and legislative questions being raised in the EU and the US Congress about auditing firms providing advisory services, how will it look if the actual auditors start rendering these services? Any way you look at it, auditing cannot continue much longer as it is. It is a business full of paradoxes. To begin with the obvious, the providers think they are offering one thing (an attestation that financial accounts are in accordance with generally accepted principles). Meanwhile, the users of the service (despite the profession's best efforts to tell them otherwise) continue to believe that the service is something else: guaranteeing against fraud, affirming the financial health of the enterprise being audited, and so on. Years of debates and lawsuits have failed to bring these mismatched perceptions closer together. The paradoxes go deeper than that. Viewed from a business portfolio perspective, the auditing product line appears to be a very unattractive component of the portfolio. It is a low-growth, declining profit business with a high exposure to litigation. Why would a firm that had options want to nurture this product line? The firms reply that it is a good regular, dependable cash flow, year after year, an annuity. This reminds me of the old joke of losing money on each item you sell, but making it up on the volume. They say that the value of the audit is that it is a base from which they can cross-sell other services. I would believe this more if the firms had a better track record of cross-selling additional services, and if the regulators were not after the firms to stop them doing it. Most firms' consulting and tax departments tell me firstly that they bring in most of their business themselves and do not rely on audit clients; and secondly that their most troublesome clients are the audit clients, because they expect the same low fee levels the auditors charge. Is there a future for audit? There will always be a need for audits, and someone will have to do them. However, I think the profession has a long way to go in completing the transformation it has only just begun. Most accounting firms today still think of themselves (or did until recently) as audit firms which happen to provide a range of other services. If they are to survive, they must drop their nostalgia and realise that they have become accounting-and-finance-advisory firms for which the audit is just one of their products, and a diminishing, ever-less attractive one at that.

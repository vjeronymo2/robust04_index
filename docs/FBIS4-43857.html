			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 16 (A.A.) -- The Constitutional Court  on Wednesday [15 June] rejected a demand by a number of deputies  against the government's law on authorizing privatization.    The court rejection took place by a narrow margin of one  vote  (six votes rejected the request and five accepted it).    The law in question gives broad powers to the government to  issue decrees in the force of law to privatize state enterprises.    Junior coalition partner Social Democratic Populist Party  (SHP) Deputy Mumtaz Soysal and his 90 colleagues from various  political parties had applied a while ago to the Constitutional  Court to abolish the law, asking for the `stoppage of the  implementation of the law.'    Privatization is one of the main objectives of the coalition  government led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and was included  in the government's economic package on April 5.</p>

The entire world shuddered in February of 1988 as  it witnessed the genocide of fanatical savagery. The name  Sumgait became the symbol of atrocity, death, and horror. It  also became a shameful testimony to the unhealthy and inhuman  nature of illusive prosperity and society. Because this crime  committed against humanity and civilization failed to obtain a  deserving assessment, it became an ill-omened precedent and  evolved into a shortsighted state policy. The same plan, crime,  inhuman and unnatural logic was put to work in Sumgait,  Kirtovabad [Ganja], Baku, Getashen, and Shaumyan. That  notorious neocolonialist doctrine of using force to drown the  national self-determination issue in blood became the main cause  of the misfortunes and sufferings of hundreds of thousands of  Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the last six years. The  sharpened iron bars and knives used by the brutish mob of  Sumgait were eventually replaced by firearms, then by Grads and  grenades, and by powerful tanks and supersonic bombers. Not  only tens of thousands of young men and innocent people were  thrown into the melee of war, but also thousands of mercenaries  and soldiers of fortune.    It is long overdue that the Sumgait syndrome be shaken off,  and the condemnable behavior of solving human rights issues and  interethnic problems by resorting to the use of force be  abandoned.    Remaining true to the international norms of behavior,  guided  by the principles adopted by the UN, CSCE and other  international and regional organizations for the peaceful  resolution of contentious issues through political talks,  proceeding from the state policy of establishing good-neighborly  relations with all the neighbors, the Armenian Republic's  authorities hereby express their determination to find a  peaceful resolution to the Karabakh problem. They call upon the  Azerbaijani leadership to refrain from the further escalation  and internationalization of the conflict and instead welcome the  establishment of a stable cease-fire and the peace- making  initiatives for the political settlement of Karabakh problem.  They call upon the leadership to refrain from undermining them  yet again and from causing new privations and suffering to the  two neighboring peoples so as not leave new black Sumgaitian  pages to history.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Share shops role in BT sale promoted THE GOVERNMENT is encouraging share shops to target BT shareholders and employees in a move to deflect criticism of its handling of the BT sale. Some of the 150 share shops have complained that the government has marketed its own share information office number at their expense in the run-up to the sale of the government's remaining 21.9 per cent BT shareholding. Of the 1.8m potential investors only 700,000 have chosen to register through a share shop. Mr James Sassoon, director of SG Warburg, the government's global co-ordinator, said: 'Share shops may want to focus on converting the 2.4m pre-registered shareholders from the share information office into share shops so that they do not miss out on top level preferences in allocation.' The government's advisers are suggesting that share shops could target their advertising towards BT shareholders and employees. Two of the share shops yesterday questioned how they could get a list of the BT shareholders without the help of the company or the government. However, Mr David Jones, chief executive of ShareLink, whose shareholders include Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures and Eagle Star, said: 'No one should expect the government to facilitate contact between BT employees, shareholders and share shops.' Big shareholders yesterday said they did not expect to pay more than 10p a share above the price for retail investors on the first instalment. The government will announce the price of the first instalment for the international offer on June 29. The first payment for the retail investor has been set at 150p. The second instalment, set at 140p, and the third, to be determined by the demand from big shareholders, will be the same for all investors.</p>

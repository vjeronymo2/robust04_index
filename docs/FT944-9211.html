			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Accidents add to coal market supply tightness World steam coal supplies have been hit by a series of severe and largely unconnected accidents over the last few weeks that has added an extreme constraint to what had already become a very tight market. Two derailments on the coal line to the South African export terminal at Richards Bay at the beginning of October, which looks likely to cut exports by 2m tonnes this year, have been followed by heavy rainfall in Colombia's Guajira region. In South Africa the derailments, linked to a break-up of the wheels on some of the rail cars, led to declarations of force majeure by three exporters, Trans-Natal, RandCoal and Amcoal. The Guajira downpour in Colombia led to a sharp slowing in production at the El Cerrejon mines and long delays at the Puerto Bolivar loading port. While the operators of Cerrejon North - Carbocol and Intercor - are expecting throughput to be down 500,000 tonnes this year, Prodeco, operating the neighbouring Cerrejon Central, has declared force majeure on all shipments. Then last week it became clear that one of the loaders operated by Colombia's other major exporter, Carbones del Caribe, had tilted at Barranquilla, forcing the company to switch to other port facilities. A couple of years ago the coal market, such was its overcapacity, could have taken all this in its stride. But this year poor performance by the Polish exporters and very robust demand levels in Asia have created severe shortages in both coking and steam coals. These events have coincided with the start of negotiations for annual pricing on contracts into Europe and Asia. Already there have been some extremely large rises reported - up to Dollars 9 a tonne, cif, for one Australian supplier into Europe and Dollars 9, fob, for Carbones del Caribe for two of its customers. While it is too early to see a trend emerging in the market - not least because one US exporter, Ashland, has agreed an extremely low - Dollars 2 - rise with the Netherlands' utility GKE - it is clear that the Australians and the Colombians have very high ambitions for the 1995 market. The South Africans, too, have set out their stall and are seeking prices in excess of Dollars 30 a tonne, fob Richards Bay, and have already signed agreements at around Dollars 30.50 fob with Belgium's Electrabel. These prices compare with some as low as Dollars 19.50 for sales into the Danish market for this year's contracts. Into this already stressed market are about to come two major tenders - one for 4m tonnes from the Italian power company Enel and one for unlimited tonnage for 1995 delivery for National Power in the UK. This latter is expected to be broken into three sections: for imports; for UK-produced coal; and for coal falling outside the specifications that National Power normally demands of its suppliers. Many will see this surprise tender from National Power (which could net up to 2m tonnes) as the company's first response to the proposed sale of British Coal's three regions to only one coal producer, RJB Mining. National Power is known to be extremely irritated at having to swap one monopoly supplier (British Coal) for another and is anxious to hedge against being too dependent on one source.</p>

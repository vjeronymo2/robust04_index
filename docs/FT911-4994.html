			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Russian republic may win US food credit guarantees PRESIDENT George Bush, under pressure to grant new food credit guarantees to the Soviet Union, may try to target the sales to the Russian republic. The president has received a personal request from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for Dollars 500m (Pounds 279.3m) in credit guarantees for purchases of maize and other commodities. The Dollars 1bn in guarantees granted so far this year has been virtually exhausted. Although the administration has been careful not to undercut Mr Gorbachev, the president last weekend, in a speech on the 'new world order', said he would in future meet representatives of the Soviet republics. Targeting the additional food credits to Russia would tie in with Mr Bush's evolving Soviet policy. Mr Robert Dole, Senate Republican leader, was influential in getting the last grant of guarantees. However, he and other congressmen were outraged when shortly after the credit package was announced, the Soviets launched a crackdown in Lithuania and Latvia. They also complained that the grain was not getting to the republics. Now, Senator Dole is said to be considering a Russian option; the credit could be granted through the central government but for the republic. He is to meet a Russian delegation, including Mr Ivan Silayev, the prime minister, this week. Also in the group will be Mr Oleg Klimov, chairman of Exportkhleb, the Soviet grain buying agency. Mr Kent Van Amberg, an official with the US Feed Grains Council, said the decision on future guarantees would be a political one. But, he stressed, it is the Russians who most want the food credits and who own most of the resources which generate foreign currency. In his appeal to Mr Bush, Mr Gorbachev directly addressed US concerns about Soviet creditworthiness. He said the central government's purchasing agencies were up to date on payments, and he promised they would continue to make their payments on time. The farm lobby badly wants new credit allocations. Sales are lagging behind last year's. The Dollars 563m in guarantees for maize provided the financing for the only maize the Soviets have bought this year. The farm groups have meetings arranged next week with the White House and the US Agriculture Department. They also will seek a renewal of Mr Bush's six-month waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which cleared the way for export financing. The amendment ties favourable trade treatment and credits to emigration policy. Because the Soviets have yet to codify an emigration law, the waiver will not become permanent. The waiver also cleared the way for credits from the US Export-Import Bank. Thus far, Eximbank has approved seven offers of credit.</p>

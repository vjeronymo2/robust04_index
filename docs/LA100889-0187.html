			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> FUTURE OF SENIOR TOUR BRIGHT, SAYS CASPER  </P> <P> The way Billy Casper looks at it, when Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino join the  senior tour in a few months and others such as Raymond Floyd, Dave Stockton and  Tom Weiskopf when they turn 50 in a couple of years, the regular PGA Tour may  become a steppingstone to the seniors.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to call (the regular tour) the minor leagues," Casper said,  jokingly, "but it'll be where we get our new talent, sort of the way pro  football does from the colleges."  </P> <P> And, asks the two-time United States Open and one-time U.S. Senior Open  champion, who would the public rather see: Nicklaus, Trevino, Arnold Palmer,  Gary Player and Chi Chi Rodriguez, or Payne Stewart, Tom Kite, Mark  Calcavecchia, Steve Jones and Paul Azinger, the top five U.S. money winners  this season?  </P> <P> Casper, 58, has been on the senior tour since its second season and has seen it  grow from two tournaments with a $250,000 payout to 41 tournaments with $19  million.  </P> <P> "With Jack and Lee coming in, it can't help but get better, and better and  better," he said. "We've already seen some results. Cadillac has signed up as  sponsor of 14 of our tournaments next year.  </P> <P> "Lee says he expects to play in about 30 tournaments a year, and we feel if  Jack plays in 10, it will be a tremendous asset to all of us."  </P> <P> Nicklaus, who will be 50 on Jan. 21, will make his debut Jan. 27-28 in the  Senior Skins Game at Mauna Lani Resort in Hawaii. He will play with Trevino,  Palmer and Player.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised to see Nicklaus play even more, once he gets with us  and sees how much fun we have," Casper said. "It's a totally different  atmosphere from the regular tour, which is so businesslike. I'm having the time  of my life. Everywhere we go, we're treated like royalty, like we're kings of  the hill."  </P> <P> Casper is in town to participate in his 15th annual charity tournament Monday  at Anaheim Hills Golf Club for the Brigham Young University athletic fund and  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints missionary fund.  </P> <P> "Most of the golf pros who do charity events are paid a gratuity, but Billy has  never taken a dime in the 15 years," said Lupi Saldana, the tournament founder  and co-chairman this year with Dean Alger. "And he's come back every year, no  matter what he's been doing on the tour."  </P> <P> The tournament will be a best-ball scrambles for $125, which includes a clinic  by Casper and an awards dinner.  </P> <P> "I may enter my own team this year," Casper said. "It'll be four of my sons,  Billy, 33; Bobby, 29; Byron, 21, and Charles, 19."  </P> <P> Casper also does a similar event in Silver City, N.M.  </P> <P> "Silver City is where I learned to play golf, on my grandfather's farm, so I go  back there for Billy Casper Day and give a clinic and take part in a charity  for the local hospitals," he said.  </P> <P> Casper, who still has seven children living at home with him and his wife  Shirley, recently moved to his old neighborhood in Bonita, in San Diego County,  after spending more than 20 years in Utah.  </P> <P> "I felt that if I continue to play while growing older, I needed to be in the  sunlight more," he said. "In Utah, there are a lot of months where you don't  get to play. But the way the senior tour is going, I need to keep warm all year  long so I'll be ready."  </P> <P> Casper won the U.S. Open in 1959, when he was 28, and again in 1966. He won the  Senior Open in 1983.  </P> <P> "I'm often asked how I compare them and I'm not kidding when I say it was just  as satisfying to win the Senior Open as it was the U.S. Open, maybe more so,"  he said. "Each tournament I win, now that I'm approaching 60, I realize I don't  have that many more wins in me.  </P> <P> "When you're in your 20s and you win, you think you'll keep on winning forever,  so I think you appreciate winning more when you're in your 50s."  </P> <P> Casper didn't waste time jumping into the senior pool.  </P> <P> "I turned 50 on a Wednesday (June 24, 1981) and played in the pro-am Thursday  and teed it up as a card-carrying senior on Friday. I think most of the fellows  have that same attitude, especially now that the tour has grown beyond anyone's  expectations."  </P> <P> Trevino will turn 50 on Dec. 1, which means he will miss playing in the GTE  tournament at Ojai Valley by one day. That tournament starts Nov. 30. Trevino  is expected to shoot for his first senior paycheck Dec. 5-9 in Hawaii.  </P> <P> Casper says that most of the sponsors and pro-am partners are about the same  age as the senior players, so it is easier to closely associate with them than  with the mass of younger, lesser known performers. And that, he adds, is  largely responsible for the success of the senior tour.  </P> <P> "When the seniors started, many people were skeptical of the playing ability of  men 50 years old and older, but I think in the nine years we've been playing  that we have shown we can still play very good golf," he said. "That is not  true in most sports where the age factor is easily apparent.  </P> <P> "Now we have the super seniors for fellows 60 and older, like Sam (Snead) and  Charlie Sifford and Jerry Barber. In two years I'll be eligible for the supers  and I'm already looking forward to it.  </P> <P> "I'm playing more tournaments than I did when I was in my 20s and 30s, and I'm  having the time of my life. What more can I ask?"  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Arnold Palmer, Peter Jacobsen and Patty Sheehan will join Annandale GC  professional Pat Rielly for an 18-hole exhibition for charity Monday, Oct. 16,  on the Annandale course in Pasadena. It will be Palmer's 13th appearance to  help raise funds for Methodist Hospital in Arcadia and the California Medical  Center of Los Angeles. He and Sheehan will face Jacobsen and Rielly, who is  also president of the Professional Golfers Assn. of America, in a team match  after a clinic featuring Palmer. Tickets are $25, but the gallery will be  limited to 2,500.  </P> <P> Another LPGA tournament has been discontinued.

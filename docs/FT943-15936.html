			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / China bans child labour China yesterday published a labour law aimed at protecting workers' rights, including the outlawing of the employment of children under 16. The law, which comes into effect next January 1, appeared to be aimed partly at answering international criticism of China's employment practices, which have been attacked by human rights groups. Chinese workers were also promised an eight-hour working day and a minimum wage, but these conditions are certain to be difficult to enforce given widely differing work practices across the country. The new law, which lays down penalties for the mistreatment of workers, follows criticism of exploitation of workers by foreign employers. China's press has highlighted recently a number of workers' complaints about harsh conditions imposed by foreign businessmen. The labour law, which was published in the People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reinforced regulations passed earlier this year specifying an eight-hour day and a maximum 44-hour week. Workers are also guaranteed one day off a week under the new law. Women are not required to work beyond their seventh month of pregnancy and are entitled to a 90-day maternity leave. They are also relieved from working in hardship locations such as mines. Employers are required to negotiate contracts with employees that lay down conditions of work, including pay and the nature of work to be done. Termination arrangements should also be specified. The law also calls for establishment of disputes committees in work places to include employers and workers. In China, trade unionists are invariably members of the Communist party and do not have a record of militancy in defence of workers' rights. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The Clinton administration was expected yesterday to greet the reforms with some enthusiasm. With France, it has linked labour rights to trade, only to be stigmatised for their efforts as protectionists. The reforms will help garner US support for China's candidacy in the World Trade Organisation, although there will still be concerns about enforcement of the new legislation.</p>

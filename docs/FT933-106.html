			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom stable at FFr3bn ALCATEL Alsthom, the French telecommunications and engineering group, resisted the impact of recession in some of its principal markets to announce stable first-half net profits of FFr3.01bn (Dollars 519m). The results for the first half of the year released yesterday compared with net profits of FFr3.12bn in the first six months of 1992, but did not include any exceptional gains. In the first half of last year, Alcatel Alsthom received a capital gain of FFr440m resulting from the sale of shares in the group. The results follow confirmation that the company is to take a 2 per cent stake in Fiat as part of the Italian group's plan to raise L5,000bn (Dollars 3.2bn) in new capital. Alcatel Alsthom will represent part of a stable core of shareholders in the Italian company, which will hold a reciprocal 2 per cent stake in the French group. The company said the trends in the first half are expected to continue for the rest of the year and full-year profits should be equivalent to the FFr7.05bn achieved in 1992. Mr Andre Wettstein, executive vice-president in charge of finance, said the first-half performance had been constrained by the economic downturn in Germany and Italy. But he added that the group was well placed to benefit from an upturn. In Germany, the group's single biggest market for telecommunications and cables, orders remained strong. Sales, which fell to FFr73.63bn in the first six months from FFr79.48bn in the first half of 1992, were expected to decline by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent for the full year. In Asia, the company said important contracts had been won in all its core business areas, including a Dollars 1.25bn deal for a power plant in Hong Kong and an order from China for digital telephone lines.</p>

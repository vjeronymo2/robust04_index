			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Building incurs Pounds 1.2m loss British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances, the building products group which is 75 per cent owned by BM Group, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m for the 15 months to June 30. For the year to April 4 1991 the loss was Pounds 575,000. Mr Graham Brealey, who became chairman in March, said the period had been 'the most exciting in the group's 55-year history.' During the 15 months the group 'radically changed its shape' following the acquisition of 12 businesses, including the main businesses of the building products and services division of BM Group. He was confident that with a full year's contribution from the acquired companies, the group would return to profitability in the current year. Turnover for the period totalled Pounds 7.79m (Pounds 4.45m). The pre-tax loss was after administrative expenses of Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 1.97m). Losses per share amounted to 53.8p (30.9p). There is no dividend for the period (0.5p) but the group intends paying both an interim and final for the current year.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Trinkaus operating profits climb 30% PARTIAL operating profits at Trinkaus &amp; Burckhardt, the Dusseldorf-based bank controlled by Midland Bank of the UK, rose 7.9 per cent last year to DM80.8m (Dollars 45.6m), with a weak domestic stock market and low turnover taking the edge off growth in fee generating business writes Katharine Campbell in Dusseldorf. Total operating profits, which include gains from the bank's account trading, rose by more than 30 per cent. However, a large proportion of this rise is due to profits from business transacted in the two previous years, Mr Herbert Jacobi, senior managing partner, said. Following German accounting conventions, profits arising from interest rate and equity warrant transactions are not booked when the bank takes in its fees, but rather when the warrants mature, typically between one and two years after they are issued. This occurs although Trinkaus hedges its positions and runs only a minimal credit risk. As the results show, the bank continues to consolidate its position as a leading provider of innovative capital market instruments, often packaged with derivatives components. With a fifth of its earnings coming from clients not with the bank five years ago, the bank says its ability to provide the range of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives has been a selling point.</p>

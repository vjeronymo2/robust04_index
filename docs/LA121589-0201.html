			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FRESH LARSON BACK ON 'FAR SIDE'  </P> <P> Having traveled to Africa and the Amazon jungle during a 14-month sabbatical,  cartoonist Gary Larson should have even more loopy animals with which to draw  his popular cartoon "The Far Side."  </P> <P> The Universal Press Syndicate, which carries Larson's strip, kept busy during  his absence, adding newspapers for a total of more than 900 that run the  cartoon.  </P> <P> Under his new schedule, Larson will produce five original panels a week, with  reissues of old cartoons for the other two days.  </P> <P> He said he had mixed feelings about being back at work; the first new cartoons  will be published Jan. 1.  </P> <P> "I currently feel fresh and recharged, and a reduced workload I'm sure will  play a big role in maintaining that feeling," Larson said. "But, as I'm sure  anyone who has had an opportunity to take a full year off will agree, that  first Monday morning back to work is quite a sobering experience."  </P> <P> Larson -- whose offbeat, bizarre humor features animated puns, animals that act  like humans and vice versa -- took a break starting in October, 1988. Larson  and his wife traveled extensively and spent four months in New York, where he  studied jazz guitar. Their home is in Seattle.  </P></p>

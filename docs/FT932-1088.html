			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Contemporary art sale brings in Pounds 5m SOTHEBY'S yesterday held its most successful sale of contemporary art in London for three years, bringing in almost Pounds 5m from 117 lots with just 11 per cent unsold by value, Antony Thorncroft writes. A 1953 painting by Francis Bacon, a study for a portrait, which had been lost from view for 40 years, was the star lot, selling for Pounds 562,500 to a private Continental collector. Its estimate had been Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000. The German artist Gerhard Richter retains his popularity. 'Neger', depicting a group of Africans and based on a press photograph, did well at Pounds 320,500, while a work by Anselm Kiefer, another German artist, which involves straw in its construction, sold for Pounds 309,500. Top price at Christie's contemporary art sale was Pounds 485,500, well over double the estimate, for a mobile by Alexander Calder.</p>

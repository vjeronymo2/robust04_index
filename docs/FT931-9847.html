			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kraft-RJR Nabisco deal faces anti-trust challenge NEW YORK'S attorney-general, Mr Robert Abrams, yesterday filed an anti-trust lawsuit to challenge Kraft General Food's Dollars 450m acquisition of RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business, a month after the deal was completed. Mr Abrams alleged that the acquisition decreased competition in an already non-competitive industry and eliminated the possibility of a new competitor. Kraft General Foods, the core US food division of Philip Morris, said it was confident that the deal complied with anti-trust laws and was in the best interests of competition and consumers. Kraft added that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had carried out a thorough investigation of the acquisition and had not objected to it. Wall Street's reaction was muted. Shares in RJR Nabisco added Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 and Philip Morris firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 73 7/8 . Observers were surprised that a state official had decided to act after the FTC had decided not to block the deal. An earlier attempt by RJR to sell the cold cereal business to General Mills was aborted after it became clear that federal anti-trust authorities were likely to conduct a 'lengthy and prolonged review'. Mr Abrams claimed that the price of ready-to-eat cereals had climbed 71 per cent in the past eight years. 'These soaring price increases, far out of line with other food products, are a clear result of an over-concentrated industry. The General Foods-Nabisco deal will just make the problem worse,' he said.</p>

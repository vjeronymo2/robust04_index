			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / People: Down from Oxford, again Colin Leach, who made himself highly unpopular in the City with the Ariel project, is poking his head above the parapet again after 14 years at Oxford. Between 1972-1978, Leach masterminded the automated share dealing system designed as a way for institutional investors to circumvent high minimum commissions. Highly controversial at the time, Leach recalls 'not being on speakers' with Sir Nicholas Goodison, the then chairman of the Stock Exchange, and generally 'never so unpopular in my life'. So he retreated to Oxford, where he had been an undergraduate, as fellow and bursar of Pembroke College, and classics tutor at University College. Now obviously deeming it safe to return, he becomes a consultant to Matheson Securities, the agency private client stockbroking arm of Jardine Matheson's UK financial services subsidiary. His brother Rodney is a director of Hong Kong Land, a Jardine Matheson-controlled company. And what of the timing of his return, just as the Stock Exchange is in deep trouble with the failure of its paperless share settlement system, Taurus, and with its whole structure indeed open to debate? Leach, who was also working on a paperless system 20 years ago says: 'I haven't written a word to the papers about Taurus. I leave it to those younger, fitter and more foolish.'</p>

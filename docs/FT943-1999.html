			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Strong demand for new German funds German money market funds could attract investment of as much as DM50bn by the end of this year, far more than previously forecast, said Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chief executive of Commerzbank. The funds, which invest exclusively in short-term instruments such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and short-dated bonds, were first allowed in Germany from August under the latest financial markets law. To date, around 10 banks and investment companies have announced money market funds for German investors. Other countries, such as France and the US, have had such funds for some time. Mr Kohlhaussen said Commerzbank's own funds - based in Luxembourg until it receives regulatory approval to operate them in Germany - had already attracted more than DM7.5bn. Some of this money had simply been transferred from fixed-term deposit accounts but more than 10,000 new clients had also invested in the funds; Commerzbank said between a quarter and a third of the inflows to its two funds could be classed as new money. The attractions of money market funds are immediate access and higher interest rates. One-month deposits in Germany currently pay around 3.5 per cent against yields of more than 4 per cent on money market funds. The forecast made by Mr Kohlhaussen includes funds based in Luxembourg and Germany. Mr Kohlhaussen said the variety of money market funds available in Germany would increase in coming months. They would be sold by both German and foreign institutions, be aimed at private and corporate investors, and be in different currencies. Officials of Commerzbank said its money market funds could total up to DM15bn by the year-end, with Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank likely to attract similar sums.</p>

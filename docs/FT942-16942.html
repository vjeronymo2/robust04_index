			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Learning to live with low prices  -Changes are in store for the US oil industry, as Amoco chairman Larry Fuller explains to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles The US oil industry is only now getting to grips with the prospect of a prolonged period of relatively low oil prices, according to Mr Larry Fuller, chairman and chief executive of Amoco, the fifth-largest US oil company. He said that until recently US oil companies did not have to contend with the same competitive pressures that forced other sectors, such as consumer electronics and telecommunications, to undergo radical structural changes. Mr Fuller, who announced a restructuring of Amoco last month, said the sector had grown accustomed to rising oil prices and had been slow to react to recent falls. His restructuring aims to eliminate unnecessary levels of management. 'I want to put less distance between the chairman and the shop floor,' he said. The new structure will make its three operating companies - production, refining and chemicals - leaner business units. A small corporate centre will be created and some services now provided by Amoco staff may be transferred to outside contractors. Amoco looked outside the oil industry for a model, and is creating a structure similar to that of Xerox. Mr Fuller, who was in London to brief UK employees on the plan, declined to say how many jobs would be affected, although there will be 'fewer people on the payroll a year from now than there are today'. He described low oil prices as 'self-correcting' and said there were signs of strengthening gasoline demand in the US. Low prices are not only causing companies to restructure, he said, but are also likely to trigger a broader realignment in the industry. Amoco's criteria in assessing any merger or takeover target include 'opportunities for rationalisation, complementary geographic coverage, people skills and the state of the balance sheet when you've finished'. But Mr Fuller noted that 'driving out duplication' as a result of mergers or takeovers can 'take years'. He said additional government incentives would be needed if companies were to develop the smaller North Sea fields which are likely to be discovered. Amoco is one of the larger gas producers in the UK sector of the North Sea, which he said is 'somewhat less attractive' as a result of the government removing tax breaks on exploration. Gas also figures highly in Amoco's plans worldwide. In the US, high demand has kept gas prices firm despite downward pressure on oil; the same is happening in the UK. Mr Fuller said Amoco will focus more on selling gas directly to users and consumers. It is also keen to expand into power generation, and willing to build and operate power stations in rapidly growing markets in Asia and Mexico. Unlike many other integrated oil companies, Amoco's chemical operations have remained profitable - partly because of its lack of exposure to Europe, where chronic over-capacity, exacerbated by recession, has led to widespread losses. Even so, Amoco made only Dollars 300m on chemicals last year, compared with more normal levels of around Dollars 600m. But capital spending this year of about Dollars 250m on chemicals will focus on fast-growing markets in Asia, a move which analysts say should help boost the division's profits. The company's upstream international strategy includes participation in a consortium of western companies negotiating with the Azerbaijan government to develop offshore reserves in the Caspian Sea. Those talks have been partly held up by the government's indecision over whether it or the national oil company should hold the Azeri stake in the project, according to Mr Fuller. The project is also waiting a decision on an export route for the oil. Mr Fuller believes two pipelines will be built, one through to a Russian port on the Black Sea and one to the south, possibly to Turkey. 'That would make a lot of economic sense,' he said, as one of the main markets for Azeri oil is likely to develop in Turkey and neighbouring countries.' Amoco is also involved in Russia, where unresolved legal and tax issues continue to hamper Western companies.</p>

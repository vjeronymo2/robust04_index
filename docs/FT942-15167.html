			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: CBoT votes to opt out of revamped Globex The board of directors of the Chicago Board of Trade have voted not to participate in a restructured Globex. The move effectively ends a fractious five-year partnership between the exchange, Reuters, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and creates a potential competitor for the system. The exit by the world's largest futures exchange further clouds plans for the ambitious Dollars 200m project, created by Reuters as a vehicle for round-the-clock, round-the-world futures trading. In the two years since its launch, Globex has not met its volume or globalisation targets, and only France's Matif has made significant use of the system. The CBoT says it plans to pull its contracts from Globex on April 30. After then, only Matif and CME contracts will remain on the system. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuter's managing director for transaction products, said: 'We're obviously disappointed by the CBoT's decision. We believe the new Globex agreement goes a long way to provide an equitable arrangement for new exchanges to join.' Participation by London's Liffe is thought to be critical to Globex's future. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive, said: 'I certainly think Globex would have more credibility if it included CBOT.' Meanwhile, the CBoT plans to list its financial futures contracts for after-hours trade on its own local computer network, and may extend that trading using Bloomberg Financial Services terminals, in competition with Globex.</p>

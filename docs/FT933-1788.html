			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Tesco to fight rivals on price: 'Aspirations of customers in the 1990s are very different from the affluent 1980s' TESCO, the UK's second-biggest superstore chain, yesterday broke ranks with its main competitors by saying it was repositioning itself on price, and admitting the growing threat posed by discount food retailers. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, claimed Tesco had opened a price gap of 4 to 5 per cent on basic products between it and competitors such as J Sainsbury and Argyll, owner of Safeway. His comments prompted speculation about a price war. He admitted Tesco had been slow to react to the recession, but hoped to outpace its competitors in a grocery sector where 'the ball-game has changed'. 'Quite clearly the aspirations of customers in the 1990s are very different from the affluent 1980s,' Sir Ian said. He added that the spread of discounters such as Aldi, of Germany, and Netto, of Denmark, selling a limited range of goods at low prices, had put pressure on superstores to ensure their prices were competitive. 'Whoever you are, you now have the Aldis, Nettos and Eds sitting on your car park. We have got to be as cheap as anybody on the basics, but offer additional lines and services.' His comments came as Tesco disclosed a smaller-than-expected increase of 3.4 per cent in interim profits to Pounds 261.5m on turnover up 9.5 per cent to Pounds 4bn. It said its gross margin was down 0.2 percentage points as a result of its price initiatives - the first decline for about eight years. Sir Ian did not go as far as Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, who has warned the 'halcyon days' of food retailing are over, with a saturated food market unable to support the planned number of store openings. He did, however, warn there would be an inevitable 'sort-out'. Analysts said Tesco's new approach, which follows similar moves by superstore operators such as Asda, Gateway, and Wm Morrison, would put pressure on Sainsbury and Safeway. 'If you go down this path you must be prepared to go all the way,' said Mr Bill Currie, analyst at BZW. 'And I don't really see how Sainsbury and Safeway can sit back and not respond.' Sir Ian said the change in thinking at Tesco resulted from a review of customer attitudes. The survey led to a new store design, including new services and departments. It also led to the decision to sharpen prices and introduce the cut-price Tesco Value brand to compete directly with the discounters. Mr David Reid, finance director, denied that discounters had eroded Tesco's sales, but admitted they were 'changing the price benchmarks'. Results, Page 28; Lex, Page 26</p>

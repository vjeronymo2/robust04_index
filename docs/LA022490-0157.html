			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FULLERTON FACULTY QUESTIONS STATUS OF FOOTBALL PROGRAM  </P> <P> A Cal State Fullerton faculty group has sent a set of questions to university  President Jewel Plummer Cobb about whether the school should continue its  Division I football program, according to a source at the university.  </P> <P> The Academic Senate, an advisory group, has asked Cobb to respond within two  weeks to 19 questions, ranging from the program's financial feasibility to the  possibility of moving it to Division II or III to the impact of not having a  football team to play in the planned $10.2-million stadium and sports complex  scheduled to open in 1992.  </P> <P> Cobb in November pledged an additional 20 scholarships to the program in a plea  for Coach Gene Murphy to turn down offers from other schools, saying then that  Division I football was an important part of the athletic program's future.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Ed Carroll responded to the faculty group's move, saying  Division I football is central to the athletic program.  </P> <P> "My reaction is that the Cal State Fullerton football program has finished  first or second in the Big West (Conference) for six of the past seven years.  We have a stadium coming on board. We have a financial plan that has funded the  program in the past. It is certainly in the best interests of the entire  athletic program and institution to maintain the commitment that we have shown.  That is certainly what we are going to do."  </P> <P> Attempts to reach Murphy, who has been the Fullerton coach for the past 10  seasons, were unsuccessful, as were attempts to reach Cobb and members of the  faculty group.

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: Gleeful BA faces risks with USAir deal - The Bottom Line 'ALBUQERQUE to Omaha? Certainly, madam. Here's your British Airways ticket.' The year is 1997 and Lord Marshall of Hatton Cross runs the world's biggest airline network. It is five years since BA invested Dollars 750m - at a Mickey Mouse exchange rate - in USAir, a huge domestic US carrier. Dollars 750m? The combined airline makes that much money every three months now . . . IT IS this kind of fantasy that on Tuesday drove Lord King of Wartnaby and Sir Colin Marshall, the men who run BA in 1992, to make their biggest corporate move since their company was privatised five years ago. The Dollars 750m is buying 21 per cent of the voting rights and at least 32 per cent of the equity rights of USAir, the heavily loss-making US domestic airline. For King, in particular, the deal is a dream come true. He has nursed his vision of a global airline for 11 years. Twice, that dream was shattered: in 1989, when talks with United Airlines, the US number two, collapsed; and earlier this year when a merger with KLM, the Dutch carrier with a stake in Northwest Airlines of the US, fell through. King, less than a year away from retirement as chairman to become BA's honorary life president, has cause to be pleased. In some ways, USAir is an even better partner than United or KLM would have been. BA gets almost unparalleled access to the vast US domestic market with almost no overlap on its international routes. USAir's strength is on the eastern seaboard where two-thirds of Europe-bound transatlantic passengers live. USAir's president should be even happier. His airline is flat on its back, having lost Dollars 837m over the past two years. BA's cash will cut its debt from a ghastly 367 per cent gearing to a soothing 50 per cent. Even their aircraft look similar: spot a blue, red and silver Boeing and it will probably belong to USAir or BA. Already, the two companies have established an 'integration committee' to determine what can be done to merge their marketing, finance and maintenance. Linking frequent flyer programmes is a top priority to compete with United and American, the big two US carriers. The cost savings that could result bring with them the hope that BA's profits and share price might maintain their extraordinary recession-bucking trends. BA is now the only large airline in the western hemisphere that is making serious money. But, despite King's protestations to the contrary, the deal has risks. BA is not buying ordinary shares in USAir, but convertibles. These pay BA interest at 7 per cent a year until conversion, after which BA takes its cut of USAir's profits or losses. That conversion is likely to happen in five years' time, so BA's bet is that USAir's profits will have returned to rude health by then. That, however, depends as much on the fortunes of the US airline industry as on management skills. And it is an industry on which US investors themselves have been unwilling to take a bet in recent months. A share sale by GPA, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was cancelled last month when US investors got cold feet. They were worried that US airlines were losing so much money in their bitter price wars that they would not be able to pay the lease fees. Only this week, USAir itself revealed it had lost Dollars 85m in its second quarter, and the larger Delta Air Lines lost Dollars 180m in the three months to the end of June. Even King's crystal ball cannot see five years ahead, and BA shares suffered on Wednesday as investor recognised the deal's uncertainties. At this month's annual meeting, BA's shareholders rushed to congratulate King and Marshall on their profits record. They may have the great American airline passenger to thank if they still feel good in 1997.</p>

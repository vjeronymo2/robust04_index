			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: NY Times improves to Dollars 15.2m THE New York Times nearly trebled second-quarter net earnings to Dollars 15.2m, on increased advertising revenues and lower newsprint costs, writes Alan Friedman. Earnings per share were 19 cents, against 6 cents in the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 448m, against Dollars 440.4m in the same period of 1991. For the first six months of 1992 the newspaper group's net income was Dollars 29.2m, against Dollars 10.5m in the first half of last year. Revenues for the six-month period were Dollars 888.5m against Dollars 857.3m in the first half of 1991. The second-quarter results were affected by an Dollars 11m pre-tax charge relating to labour disruptions. But the second quarter of last year was affected by a Dollars 20m pre-tax charge from a voluntary early retirement programme. With the special charges stripped out of the 1991 and 1992 second quarters the earnings per share would be 27 cents in the period ended last month, against 21 cents a year ago.</p>

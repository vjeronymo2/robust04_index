			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Papandreou pledges creation of stable climate for investment MR Andreas Papandreou, Greece's newly elected Socialist prime minister, has outlined a set of moderate economic policies, pledging to reduce inflation and the rapidly rising public-sector deficit and 'create a stable climate for investment'. In his policy statement to parliament at the weekend, Mr Papandreou diluted his opposition to privatisation, saying that minority shareholdings in state enterprises would be floated on the Athens stock exchange. 'Privatisation is not incompatible with our policies, provided that it doesn't lead to private monopolies,' he said. Mr Papandreou singled out OTE, the state telecoms company, as a candidate for a partial flotation, to raise funds for investment. However, he repeated that the Socialist government would repeal a law passed earlier this year providing for the sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to an international telecoms operator. Mr Papandreou also underlined that the Socialist government was still committed to major infrastructure projects launched by its conservative predecessor. He said a project to build a new airport for Athens, awarded to a international consortium led by Hochtief of Germany, would go ahead 'with special attention being given to transparency'. Despite trying to dispel fears that fiscal prudence would be abandoned, Mr Papandreou did not propose any new revenue-raising measures to offset the loss of an estimated Dr330bn (Pounds 922m) in privatisation income this year. He said the Finance Ministry would intensify efforts to speed tax collection to make up a projected revenue shortfall of at least Dr500bn, the result of worsening tax evasion as recession deepens. Domestic borrowing will be increased to cover the widening deficit, which may exceed the budget forecast of 10.8 per cent of gross domestic product by almost three percentage points, according to independent analysts. On foreign policy, Mr Papandreou stressed Greece's commitment to European economic union. He said Greece would try to build good-neighbourly relations with Turkey, its traditional enemy, and would work to re-establish multilateral co-operation in the Balkans. However, Mr Papandreou did not clarify how Greece could play a constructive role in the Balkans while refusing to recognise Macedonia under that name. He accused the Macedonian leadership of 'showing intransigence' over the name dispute.</p>

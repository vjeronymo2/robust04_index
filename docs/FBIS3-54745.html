			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary" dated 27 December: </F> "Greedy Alogrithm"]    [Excerpt] What Is There To Be Ashamed of?    This could happen only in Russia: The new constitution, a  bombastic panegyric in its honor, and two edicts which totally  contradict it and cancel out the contents of several articles of  the constitution at once are published on one and the same page  in the government newspaper.    One of the edicts is entitled "On Guarantees of Local  Self-Management in the Russian Federation," but it would be more  accurate to call it "On the Elimination of Local Self-Management  in the Russian Federation," for it virtually eliminates the  rights of local self-management.    Elections to organs of local self-management are scheduled  at  the suggestion of the superior administration head, who also  decides on the election procedure. Local administration  officials are permitted to combine their post with work on the  representative organ, and the administration head is also  permitted to chair its sessions. If such a perfectly "tame"  representative organ turns obstinate for some reason, this does  not matter -- the administration head himself has the right to  put the statute on local self-management to a referendum. Here  is a very eloquent detail, albeit, of course, not the most  important one: It is not the soviet but the self-same local  administration head who now gives his consent to a people's  deputy's discharge from work, to his exclusion from a collective  farm, cooperative, or educational institution, and also to his  transfer to lower-paid work. Know, deputy, who is master of the  house!    How familiar all this is: the same ploys, the same tricks.  Only they have been switched from the all-Russia level to the  local level. And there is the same total disrespect for the law  and the constitution.    Please forgive my juridical tediousness, but I will indicate  specific articles: This edict violates Article 10 (separation  of powers), Articles 15 and 76 (supremacy of the constitution  and laws), Articles 85 and 90 (president's competence), and also  Chapter 8 (local self-management) of the new constitution which  has just been announced. Since the edict came into force the  moment it was signed, not the moment it was published, it also  violates universally recognized human and civil rights enshrined  both in the Constitution (Article 15) and in international  treaties.    The second edict, which exempts from value-added tax the  turnover from sales of precious metals and precious stones, is  also equally unconstitutional. According to Yeltsin's  constitution (Articles 71, 76, and 104), such decisions have to  be drawn up in law and can be adopted only after a government  conclusion. Under the constitution the approval "retroactively"  of presidential edicts is permitted in just two cases: on the  introduction of martial law and a state of emergency. Does this  mean that a state of emergency has been secretly introduced in  the country?    I have touched on just two edicts, remarkable for being  published simultaneously with the new constitution. But the  same can also be said of many other documents from the  president's desk: on accelerating agrarian reform, on approving  the program for the privatization of the mass media, on  approving the new coat of arms, on eliminating the Ministry of  Security.... The authority to adopt them was exceeded in every  case, and they do not conform with either the former or the new  constitution.    If anyone had any illusions that law and order would  finally be established in the country with the adoption of the  new constitution, he will, alas, have to abandon them. The  fresh-baked constitution has been violated by its very creators  from the very first day. To fanfares and toasts in its honor  the country is continuing to sink into a quagmire of arbitrary  rule and lawlessness.  <H5>  Figures Do Not Balance Again </H5>   I have before me three newspapers from Stavropol Kray:  STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA for 17 December, the same newspaper for 22  December, and STAVROPOLSKIYE GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI for 18  December. All three publish the results of the elections and  the referendum in Stavropol Kray, and they are different in all  three! The list of voters is different, and the number of voting  papers handed out does not coincide. How could this happen, if  the same voters voted and all four voting papers were issued  simultaneously?    This is called a "pitchfork." By tying the vote on the  constitution in with the elections, the organizers of the  referendum did, of course, secure a considerable number of  additional votes. But they underestimated the fact that in such  complex voting it is very difficult to "tidy up the loose ends."  Whereas the referendum was held practically without control, the  candidates' results were closely observed by their numerous  agents. This was why it took so long for the voting results to  reach Moscow in dribs and drabs.    Of course, the question of the results of the voting in the  deputies' elections and the referendum on the new constitution  will be raised both in the press and at sessions of the State  Duma. It would also be not at all out of place for the Russian  Federation Prosecutor's Office, which stands guard over the law,  to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the aforesaid  facts. On the threshold of an unpleasant discussion on this  subject the presidential press unobtrusively hints that if the  results of the referendum on the new constitution are canceled,  the president in turn will cancel the results of the elections  to the Federal Assembly. Either the Constitution imposed by  means of a deception or presidential rule not limited by any  laws -- this is the poor choice offered Russians today by the  "Russia's Choice" limited partnership.  <H5>  There Will Be a Black Obelisk </H5>   But what about the international observers? Why did several  hundred very experienced politicians, gathered from all over the  world, assure the country and the whole world that the elections  in Russia were held according to the highest standards of  democracy?    This was despite the fact that the elections were preceded  by  the shooting up of parliament and the introduction of a state of  emergency (during which it is forbidden by law to hold  elections). The elections were held not according to the law but  according to a statute which was adopted personally by the  president and was changed repeatedly in the course of the  elections. A number of public organizations were banned  illegally, by presidential edict, on the eve of the elections.  An entire section of the political spectrum -- movements of a  national-patriotic orientation -- was criminally cut off. The  opposition press was blocked for practically the whole duration  of the election campaign. The government made attempts to exert  crude pressure on electoral associations and individual  candidates (a ban on campaigning against the constitution, the  institution of criminal proceedings). Despite the fact that  foreign observers responded to the question "Would you like such  elections to be held in your country?" by opening their eyes  wide and starting to wave their hands in horror. Despite all  this, the elections and the referendum in Russia were  acknowledged a model of democracy. Congratulations poured in  from all over the world....    There can only be one rational explanation for all this. To  all appearances, the West has decided firmly to categorize  Russia among the countries to which panhuman notions of legality  and a rule-of-law state cannot apply: "What can you expect from  them -- they are savages!"    Thank you. We have probably deserved this. But do not take  it amiss if a tablet is set up in the Russian parliament at some  time inscribed with the names of those foreign statesmen who  approved of the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and applauded  the shameful machinations over the new Russian Constitution. To  remind your descendants and ours. [passage omitted]</p>

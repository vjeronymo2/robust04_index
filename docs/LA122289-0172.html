			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GE WINS KOREAN FIGHTER PROJECT  </P> <P> General Electric Co. says it has won a $500-million contract to build fighter  plane engines for the government of South Korea.  </P> <P> The Koreans plan to buy about 250 F404-GE-402 engines to power 120 FA-18  fighters, a plane built by McDonnell Douglas, GE announced. The governments of  Kuwait and Switzerland have purchased smaller numbers of the engine.  </P> <P> "These foreign sales are important because they help offset potential  reductions in the U.S. defense budget," said Robert Turnbull, GE's vice  president of military engines.  </P> <P> Turnbull estimated that the plant in Lynn, which will handle the South Korean  order, will be building 200 F404 engines a year for the next 10 years. He said  it was likely the U.S. Navy would scale back its purchases in the early 1990s.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 12 KYODO -- The issue of an exchange  of special envoys between North and South Korea should be  separated from the nuclear issue in North Korea's talks with the  United States, a Pyongyang official said Tuesday.    North Korea is "strongly opposed" to making the exchange of  envoys a topic in talks with the U.S., he said.    The question of separation of the two issues of inspections  of Pyongyang's nuclear facilities and the exchange of envoys is  likely to be a main topic during visits to South Korea, China  and Japan by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political and  Military Affairs Robert Gallucci from Tuesday.    The official described as "incorrect" reports that North  Korea notified the U.S. at the end of March that it would permit  further inspections of its nuclear facilities if the issue of  the special envoys is treated separately.    He denied that separating the issues is enough to guarantee  that North Korea will permit continued inspections.    The official said Gallucci's three-nation visit is an  attempt  to involve Japan and South Korea in what should be a matter for  negotiation only between North Korea and the U.S.    The U.S. and South Korea have set the exchange of envoys  aimed at laying the basis for a North-South summit, and the  international inspections, as preconditions for North Korea-U.S.  high level talks.    But North Korea maintains that the U.S. insisted on the  conditions under pressure from South Korea.    Washington has spearheaded an international campaign to  persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure that its  nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic  weapons arsenal.    Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking to build an  atomic bomb, but it refused to permit IAEA inspectors in March  to carry out certain tests at a radio chemical laboratory.    Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and  Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for the inspections  that were held last month.    The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the  inspections and referred the matter to the UN Security Council,  which issued a presidential statement on March 31 urging  Pyongyang to permit completion of the checks.</p>

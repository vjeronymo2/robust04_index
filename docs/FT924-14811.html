			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / No regrets over launch of VW dealership: New cars MR HARALD PETERS and his two fellow directors have chosen the middle of the steepest post-war recession in the UK's new car market to open a car dealership on which they have spent 'several million' pounds. The franchise for the dealership, in Stockwell, south-west London, is Volkswagen/Audi. Mr Peters and his colleagues are now anxious to see just what Germany's largest carmaker intends to do about a sterling devaluation which could make Volkswagen and Audi cars substantially more expensive in the UK. Mr Peters, however, says he has not the slightest regrets about opening the dealership - the group's second - and expresses confidence that the manufacturer will not pass on any heavy rises in cars or parts. 'I believe it is possible that Volkswagen will introduce the level of increase we normally see at the start of each year, of 2 per cent to 3 per cent. But, if they made an increase of 10 per cent, we would have no chance whatsoever to compete with British or even other continental manufacturers.' Mr Peters' relative confidence about the size of any increases - in spite of warnings from BMW that UK prices might have to rise substantially in the New Year - is based on his belief that Volkswagen/Audi is intent on gaining a larger market share in the UK and that it will not take any action which might undermine this as a long-term strategy.</p>

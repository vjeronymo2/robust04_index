			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II. Fiscal Year 1994 Proposed Priority Areas for Projects of National Significance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ADD is interested in all comments and recommendations which address areas of existing or evolving national significance related to the field of developmental disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also solicit recommendations for project activities which will advocate for public policy change and community acceptance of all people with developmental disabilities and families so that such persons receive the services, supports, and other assistance and opportunities necessary to enable them to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence, productivity, and integration into the community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADD is also interested in activities which promote the inclusion of all people with developmental disabilities including persons with the most severe disabilities, in community life; which promote the interdependency of all people with developmental disabilities with all others; and which recognize the contributions of these individuals, as such individuals share their talents at home, school, and work, and in recreation and leisure time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No proposals, concept papers or other forms of applications should be submitted at this time. Any such submission will be discarded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADD will not respond to individual comment letters. However, all comments will be considered in preparing the final funding solicitation announcement and will be acknowledged and addressed in that announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments should be addressed to: Bob Williams, Commissioner, Administration on Developmental Disabilities, Administration for Children and Families, Department of Health and Human Services, room 329&hyph;D HHH Building, 200 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20201.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 1: Leadership Education and Development of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families From Culturally Diverse Backgrounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent years, individuals with developmental and other disabilities have benefitted from new approaches to providing services that dramatically changed the lives of many of those who were previously unserved or underserved. However, many individuals and families, particularly those of culturally diverse backgrounds, remain on the outside looking in. Many such individuals may seem to have been invisible in the developmental disabilities community. Due to a long history of cultural stereotyping of such individuals, open discussions about disabilities remain a very sensitive and emotionally charged topic in some communities. Although minority individuals and families are affected by developmental and other disabilities (as the population at large), many often cannot gain access to the service system let alone fully participate in or benefit from it. In many instances, these individuals and families may be poor, may live in isolated areas; may be homeless or lack general knowledge about the services available to them or how the system works.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, ADD is proposing to fund Projects of National Significance (PNS) that target individuals with developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds in an effort to enable them to impact service delivery and fully access the services they need. These projects would strengthen the ability of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds to serve as leaders and advocates on critical issues in the developmental disabilities field, particularly in their own communities. These projects would assist individuals with developmental disabilities from culturally diverse backgrounds and their families in the development and implementation of effective methods of communication and systems change to increase public awareness, inform individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds with disabilities of issues and services, and to develop and to implement networking strategies that improve access to community resources. Furthermore, these projects would institutionalize action strategies that promote policies and practices which are family-centered and community-based.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ADD is particularly interested in grassroots organizations with a record of planning and implementing programs with individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds, such as major civil rights organizations, minority coalitions, and other private non-profits that would be able to establish ongoing working relationships with State Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils, University Affiliated Programs, Protection and Advocacy Systems and other relevant community resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is essential to identify local linkages to establish collaborative agreements/arrangements on critical issues in the developmental disabilities field that would strengthen the capacity of individuals to serve as leaders/ advocates on behalf of themselves and their families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

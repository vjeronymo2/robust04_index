			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ibos payment network set to link with US banks UP TO five US banks are this year expected to join the Ibos cross-border payments network, operated jointly by a group of European banks. Their decision is likely to start bringing the network into competition with the Swift system that dominates European Community cross-border payments. Ibos, started by Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander, will also launch in autumn services aimed at small and medium-sized businesses, allowing companies remote computer access to their overseas accounts. The Ibos network links 2,500 branches in Europe owned by the two founding partners, Credit Commercial de France, and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal. However, the group is negotiating with several US banks to link it to branch networks there. Such a link would boost traffic through the network considerably. There are expected to be 23,000 transactions totalling Dollars 150m this year through Ibos. The Ibos system allows transfers among accounts within seven seconds, but the network is capable of handling up to 40,000 a day. The Ibos partners are considering how to extend the network to the US, and are likely to admit several banks to cover the country. One possibility is that one bank will be licensed to offer Ibos services in each state, with each participating bank holding several licences. The Ibos network is loss-making, in contrast to the Swift network to which all European banks have access and which had revenue of Dollars 350m in 1991. However, its partners expect it to enter profitability in about 18 months, and then achieve rapid growth. The partners in Ibos - which stands for Inter Bank Online System - are also negotiating with banks in Belgium, Austria, Holland and Germany to establish partners in those countries. They expect to build a larger share of the Dollars 12bn market when this is done. Mr Norman McCluskie, managing director of Royal Bank of Scotland's operations division, said the Ibos partners had so far concentrated on ensuring the system worked reliably, Now, however, they expected strong growth. 'We see ourselves in a very dramatic position,' he said. Ibos is being marketed as being cheaper and faster than Express Swift transfer via a central computer in Brussels. Customers who hold accounts at the banks in the network are estimated to be able to transfer Pounds 3,000 (Dollars 4,620) for a fee of Pounds 6 through Ibos compared to Pounds 15 for Express Swift.</p>

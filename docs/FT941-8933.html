			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / People: Kinnaird drives off to Santiago Ripples from management shuffles in Inchcape's motors business late last year are carrying the youthful and energetic Peter Kinnaird all the way to Santiago. Kinnaird, 41, is to take over responsibility for Inchcape's South American and Caribbean vehicle distribution businesses, with a brief to expand in rapid growth areas like his new Chile base, Mexico and Brazil. This move gives a first taste of the globe-spanning flavour of Inchcape Motors' activities to Kinnaird, whose career to date has been spent with UK-based vehicle importers. He will move to Chile on April 5 from his current job as managing director of Daihatsu UK, responsible for importing and distributing the small Japanese leisure four-wheel-drive machines and cars. Daihatsu UK is a direct subsidiary of Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn (TKM), the motor distributor which Inchcape bought for Pounds 376m at the end of 1991. Kinnaird has been running it for nearly three years, and was also MD of Alfa Romeo (GB) until the Italian manufacturer took the franchise back from TKM two years ago. Kinnaird's successor at Daihatsu, a fairly small-scale business selling around 6,000 units a year, is Tony Darwall-Smith (left), 51, who is moving after 20 years at Rover Group from his current post as regional director for the south of England. With Maurice Rourke, another TKM veteran, Kinnaird has thus emerged well from the Inchcape shake-up last November which resulted in the departure of Reg Heath, chief executive of TKM who was credited by Inchcape with having done a 'terrific' job in integrating TKM into Inchcape. Rourke was appointed Heath's successor.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Financial services sees jobs upturn Employment in financial services rose slightly for the first time in almost four years during the three months to the end of June, according to a survey published today. The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey shows business in the sector rose over the three-month period, with overall business at its best level since June 1990. While business growth is expected to be stronger over the next quarter, expectations are not as positive as those reported in the last two surveys. The results also point to a less positive mood generally within retail financial services compared with other parts of the sector, particularly those concerned with corporate business. Both building societies and general insurers, for example, expect employment to drop over the coming months. Securities traders and ven-ture capitalists expect marked rises. Across the sector, business with private individuals increased more slowly than in the first three months of the year, even though a faster pace had been expected. Business with all categories of customer apart from overseas customers is expected to grow much more quickly in the third quarter. Mr Angus Hislop, financial services partner at Coopers, said that the general optimism of the survey was tempered by the tougher environment faced by building societies and life insurance companies in particular, for example through the lack of a significant recovery in the housing market. With most of the easier cost reductions having been made already, he expected there to be greater interest in acquisitions than had been seen for a long time as organisations looked for improvements in growth. Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI economics associate director, said that although the increase in business had been less than expected once again, the survey showed that the upturn in financial services remained firmly established.

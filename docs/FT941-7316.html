			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Gains via R&amp;D, market share and cost-cuts - Three leading European manufacturers employ very different strategies against their international competitors / Philips Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is a classic case of a once-great European company caught between the Japanese hammer and the American anvil. On the one hand, its battles with Japan in consumer electronics have led to huge losses. On the other, it has been obliged to abandon high-tech areas in computers and semiconductors. Philips's basic problem can be illustrated by comparison with one of its chief competitors, the Japanese electronics company Matsushita. A decade ago, Matsushita's sales in dollar terms were smaller than Philips's. They are now twice as large. The growth of the Japanese company in the 1980s owed much to the strength of its domestic market, from which Philips was largely excluded by a combination of protectionism and the peculiarities of the Japanese retail system. But the Japanese advantage, whether fair or foul, was a fact of life. Philips' determination to tackle the competition head-on has been impressive, but also smacks of arrogance and inflexibility. Despite the company's recent enormous losses, the struggle continues. In the field of consumer audio, Philips is confronting Sony's mini-compact disc with its new digital compact cassette. It has also just opened a factory in Holland to make flat screen panels, a vitally important technology in which even the Americans have conceded Japan a virtual monopoly. Philips could be past the worst. Its cost-cutting and rationalisation in the past couple of years have been on a scale to suggest that even the notorious Philips bureaucracy has become genuinely alarmed. And the Japanese electronics industry is facing problems which may prove structural rather than cyclical. Certainly, the investment community is inclined to optimism. In the past year, Philips's shares have outperformed the Dutch market by two thirds. However, the company has seen false dawns before. For the pessimists, it may be more relevant to reflect that the shares have halved relative to the Dutch market in the past decade.</p>

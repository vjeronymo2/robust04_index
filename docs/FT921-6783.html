			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (2): Investment squeeze likely to continue - Peter Marsh discusses economic prospects ECONOMIC prospects for Europe this year look far from rosy. Many individual countries across the continent face a slowdown in domestic activity, while there is little hope of strong demand pressures from the US and Japan to help in any upturn. With the German Bundesbank looking likely to maintain its high interest-rate policy until well into 1992, the opportunities may be limited for other countries linked by the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) to reduce borrowing costs. That increases the possibility of a further squeeze on investment and demand in several European countries, particularly Britain, France and Italy, whose economies are in or near recession. But the outlook is not totally gloomy. With President George Bush in the US anxious to put the domestic economy in good shape prior to his effort to gain a second term in the elections at the end of this year, the US administration has been exerting pressure on other leading economies to loosen policy. America's message has, it appears, found a sympathetic response in Japan, which like the US has cut official short-term interest rates in recent months. As for the Bundesbank - which has statutory authority over borrowing costs in Germany and sets the tone for monetary policy across Europe - its hard-line view on interest rates is thought likely to soften during 1992. That would be the case particularly if signs emerge of reduced inflationary pressures and growth prospects in Germany itself. Further ahead, Europe has to worry about two pressing issues. The efforts to integrate into the continent's trading system the fledgling democracies of what was the east European communist bloc will be an important theme over the next few years. Another big subject is the pace of the move towards European economic and monetary union (Emu), and what this may mean for the individual nations concerned. A framework for a single European currency, administered by an all-powerful European central bank and coming into force around the end of the century, was established by the European Community nations at the Maastricht summit in December. But doubts exist about how many EC countries will be able to meet the tough targets covering government borrowing and inflation which the summit decided must govern the eligibility of individual countries wishing to enter Emu. The strong possibility exists that many nations may find the qualification procedures for Emu too onerous. For example, long periods of high unemployment might be required in several countries if they are to meet the rigorous targets requiring a drop in public sector debt levels and lower inflation matching the German standards of the 1980s. There is a big question mark over whether public opinion in some countries could stomach such unpleasant side effects - whatever the supposed longer term benefits - in which case the general appetite for Emu could fade away. As for the near term, the half-percentage point increase in German interest rates at the end of last year sent tremors through the European economy. The higher German rates attracted more international funds into the D-Mark, the core ERM currency, forcing all the other ERM nations except Britain to put up their own borrowing costs to keep their currencies within permitted fluctuation bands. There has been little sign recently that the Bundesbank might feel inclined to cut rates soon. A 6.35 per cent pay rise agreed by German steelworkers early in February is widely believed to have been above the limit the German central bank thought appropriate, given its determination to damp down the inflationary pressures sparked by reunification. The wage increase for the 130,000-strong workforce may give the green light to other key groups of German workers to seek similar rises. That, in turn, will probably strengthen the determination of the Bundesbank to keep rates high, at least over the next few months, in a bid to force down the pace of wage increases. But given Germany's traditions as the bastion of low inflation across Europe, the probability of the central bank's brinkmanship tactics paying off must be reasonably high, leaving the way open for a reduction in German rates later in the year. If nothing else, such a turn of events might stop the German economy plunging into the kind of sharp slowdown which would be most out of keeping with what has become one of the main engines of world growth. Many economists are pencilling in growth in Germany this year of about 2 per cent, following an expansion of some 3.2 per cent in 1991 and 4.5 per cent the year before. If the Bundesbank keeps up its high rate policy for too long, the expansion this year could be still more muted. Any reduction in German rates would be greeted with a sigh of relief by many business people and politicians across Europe, as it would enable some monetary relaxation in several other countries. In Britain, a Conservative government facing an election later this year badly needs to stimulate an economy that has shown little sign of recovering from the deep recession of the past 18 months. Many believe UK output will rise by only about 1.5 per cent this year, after a fall of 2.5 per cent in 1991. It appears that to help kick-start growth the government may be considering a more expansionary fiscal policy, for instance a cut in income tax, which may be announced in the UK Budget. Like Britain, France would dearly like the opportunity to cut interest rates. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects French gross domestic product to rise by a sluggish 2.1 per cent in 1992, after an increase of just 1.4 per cent in 1991. There is a similar pattern in Italy which faces muted growth of about 2 per cent this year. It also - like Belgium and Ireland - faces the giant task over the next few years of cutting down on its mountain of government borrowing if it is to meet the criteria on public sector debt set for Emu. As for western Europe as a whole, Oxford Economic Forecasting, a UK economics consultancy, is moderately hopeful about 1992, projecting overall growth of 1.9 per cent across the EC nations as against 1.3 per cent in 1991. It is also reasonably bullish about world trade growth this year, projecting a 5 per cent increase in export volumes by the 24 industrialised nations in the OECD bloc. If such an increase takes place, it would be a significant advance in the relatively meagre exports growth by the OECD last year of just 1.4 per cent. One good sign for the economy of the industrialised world as a whole is that inflationary pressures during 1992 are likely to be modest. Many believe price rises at the consumer level across the bloc will be restricted to just over 3 per cent in 1992 compared with 1991, roughly 1 percentage point lower than the change between last year and 1990. That, in turn, could provide a good basis for sustained growth later in the decade.</p>

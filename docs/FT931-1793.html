			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Asarco renews Polish copper overtures ASARCO, THE North American integrated copper producer, has renewed efforts to establish links with KGHM, the state-owned producer from Lubin, in South Western Poland. Yesterday Asarco together with Mitsui and Bechtel met with representatives of KGHM in nearby Wroclaw to discuss proposals 'for the development of the environment protection industry' in Poland, a cryptic communique stated. KGHM last year paid 395bn zloty (USDollars 23.8m) in pollution fines and would have paid a further Z344bn if the government had not reduced the charges last autumn. Last year Asarco proposed a management agreement to KGHM after exploring the prospects for capital investment. However feeling against foreign investment within KGHM continues to run high and Asarco have now withdrawn their proposal. Western Mining of Australia has also shown interest in investing in KGHM. Last year the combine produced 387,000 tonnes of copper, 2.3 per cent more than in 1991 despite a 32-day strike last summer. KGHM also produced 914 tonnes of silver last year. Net profits reached Z1,160bn of which Z606bn was spent on capital investment.</p>

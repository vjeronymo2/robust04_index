			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Quattro - a spreadsheet with class - Computing IT IS April 1991 and What Micro? magazine is handing out its awards for the year's top software packages. In the Professional Spreadsheet category we read that 'Borland's Quattro Pro 2 is steadily eroding Lotus 1-2-3's market share on character-based DOS machines  .. For those with low-end PCs and text-only displays, Quattro Pro 2 is now the one to buy and a worthy runner-up to the more flashy graphics-based leaders.' What Micro?'s award comes as no surprise. Since its introduction in 1989, Quattro Pro 2 has sold more than 1m and gained 40 industry awards world-wide. In 1990, Infoworld magazine made it Spreadsheet Product of the Year; in 1991, it was the Readers' Choice in Byte magazine. Naturally, with that sort of pedigree Quattro Pro 2 does not come cheap: Pounds 395 plus VAT. It is now September 1991 and Borland is pleased to announce the release of Quattro Pro Special Edition, for the home and small business, at Pounds 49.95. Obviously, you might think, at one-eighth the price of its big brother it can offer only a fraction of the features. In the computer world, though, things are not always as they seem. In fact, Quattro Pro 2 and Quattro Pro SE are one and the same product. With the quiet drop in price of Quattro Pro, there is now an embarrassment of riches in the world of cheap spreadsheets. The market leader has always been Lotus 1-2-3, but its price of Pounds 295 surely looks unsustainable when set against Pounds 49 for Quattro Pro and Pounds 79 for another award-winning spreadsheet, Supercalc 5 (itself drastically reduced from Pounds 395 late in 1990). Nor should you forget As Easy As, a 'shareware' spreadsheet also awarded a prize by What Micro? and costing only Pounds 45. All three of these packages offer splendid value - but which one should you buy? All are 'Lotus-compatible' in that they can read and write 1-2-3 files, but Quattro Pro and As Easy As (hence its name) go further and operate in virtually the same way as 1-2-3. Anyone who learns his spreadsheets on Quattro Pro or As Easy As will easily master 1-2-3, and vice-versa. Of the three, however, there is a decisive argument in favour of choosing Quattro Pro SE - its 'pull-down' menu structure. Based on a 'menu bar' which runs across the top of the screen, this structure rapidly is becoming industry standard. It conforms to CUA, the Common User Access style developed by IBM and adopted by Microsoft in its 'Windows' operating system. Virtually all new packages now conform to CUA. If, after buying Quattro Pro SE, you get a word-processing package, the chances are that it will look very similar and, consequently, will be easy to learn. By contrast, Supercalc and As Easy As are idiosyncratic in structure; in a sense, anyone who chooses them is leaving the mainstream of present day standards. The clincher for Quattro Pro is its documentation. In a very sensible move, Borland has taken a third-party self-teach book from Sybex and re-badged it as its own manual. It is too long, but it contains plenty of tutorial material and is far more helpful than the documentation usually produced by the software companies. So, not only is Quattro Pro SE a bargain at Pounds 49 but, within the price, it also throws in a self-teach book that would normally cost you Pounds 20. By the way, people invariably talk about spreadsheets as number crunchers. They are not. They are information managers and, with database features, can be equally valuable for handling text as well as numbers. After you have got your bearings, make a point of going to chapter 14 of the manual, 'Building a Spreadsheet Database,' which shows you how to set up a database of names and addresses, and how to sort and extract records. Conclusion: Quattro Pro 2 is a beautifully-crafted piece of software, state of the art in design but very easy to use. It fully deserved its 40 industry awards when it was a top-of-the-range product costing Pounds 395. At this Special Edition price of Pounds 49.95, it is an irresistible bargain. (Quattro Pro Spreadsheet Special Edition is available from retailers such as Dixons and Wildings, or ring Borland on 0734-321 150).</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Big names fail to find buyers: Saleroom THE GREAT names of British art are having a difficult time in the auction rooms this week. On Wednesday Constable's 'Harnham Bridge', estimated at Pounds 1m plus, failed to sell at Sotheby's. Yesterday an important Turner watercolour of Venice was unsold in the same saleroom when the bidding stopped at Pounds 400,000. It set a record in 1988 for an English watercolour of Pounds 440,000. Its European owner wanted Pounds 500,000 this time. The sale of British drawings and water colours totalled Pounds 706,596 and was 55.2 per cent unsold. Another important Turner, 'The Wreck', was a casualty, but Agnews paid Pounds 187,000 for a view of Lichfield Cathedral that Turner executed about 1835. A wooded landscape by Gainsborough sold, below estimate, at Pounds 88,000. Christie's sale of contemporary art in New York on Wednesday was dented by the failure of two top lots, paintings by de Kooning and Rauschenberg, to find buyers. That accounted for much of the 30 per cent unsold out of a total of Dollars 17.76m (Pounds 11.6m). Other important pictures sold below estimate, in particular '0 Through 9' by Jasper Johns, which made Dollars 2.3m as against its Dollars 2.8m-Dollars 3.5m estimate, and 'No 6: 1948' by Jackson Pollock, which went for Dollars 1.98m (estimate Dollars 2.5m-Dollars 3.5m). There was one artist record, for Joseph Beuys: Dollars 385,000 was paid for a cello which he had covered with grey felt and decorated with a red cross. There were also setbacks at Christie's English furniture auction in London yesterday. The two star items, a commode and a pair of secretaire bookcases, all decoratively painted and attributed to George Brookshaw, failed to sell, in spite of Pounds 200,000 bid for the bookcases. A George IV ormolu mounted centrepiece, depicting the king as a Roman emperor, more than doubled its estimate at Pounds 121,000. In Geneva Sotheby's sold for Pounds 2.05m the fourth-largest emerald cut diamond to appear at auction, weighing 50.83 carats. It was bought by a Saudi sheikh, Ahmed Fitaihi. In London a nine-volume set of Blaeu's 'Atlas major', in Dutch, and in a contemporary 17th-century cabinet, beat its estimate at Pounds 187,000.</p>

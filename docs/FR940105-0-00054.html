			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to Mr. Wollersheim's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 781, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49949), proposing the establishment of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The notice requested comments from all interested persons by October 25, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Seven comments were received concerning the proposal to establish the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. All seven commenters stated that they fully support the proposed area as delineated in Notice No. 781. One of the commenters was under the mistaken impression that this area had been proposed to be called the Roxbury Viticultural District. However, despite the misunderstanding about the name, this commenter stated in his letter that he heartily supports the establishment of a new viticultural area in this part of Wisconsin which includes the Wollersheim Winery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Viticultural Area Name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The place-name ``Lake Wisconsin'' was first used ca. 1917 to describe a widened section of the Wisconsin River that was submerged when the Baraboo hydroelectric dam was constructed one mile upriver from the town of Prairie-du-Sac. A travel brochure and map produced by the Lake Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce in 1989, entitled Lake Wisconsin Chamber Recreation Area Vacationland, shows various recreational and tourist facilities in the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The viticultural area has a long history of wine grape growing and wine making activity. Agoston Haraszthy, an immigrant from Hungary well known as an early pioneer in the American wine industry, first planted wine grapes on Wollersheim Winery property in 1847. Cold winter temperatures frustrated this early attempt to establish grapevines and two years later Haraszthy moved to California. However, wine grape growing and wine making continued in this area until 1900. Because of its role in the early history of Wisconsin, Wollersheim Winery and the adjacent homestead were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence of Boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The boundaries of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area are clearly shown on two U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps, Sauk City, Wisc. and Lodi, Wisc. The Sauk City, Wisc. quadrangle map shows the viticultural area to be bounded by the shoreline of Lake Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. The southern boundary is defined by Mack Road and State Highway Y, and the eastern boundary, shown on the Lodi, Wisc. quadrangle map, follows State Highway Y, State Highway 60, State Highway 113, and Spring Creek. The petitioner states that some of the natural boundary features, which closely approximate some of the roads and highways used as boundaries for this viticultural area, can be found on county maps, plat maps and county atlases dating back to 1861.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Geographical Features  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Wisconsin River (of which Lake Wisconsin is a part) is a major natural feature of the State and of the region. It is the largest river in the State after the Mississippi River, of which it is a major tributary. Roads and highways define the southern boundary of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The landscape of the viticultural area is comprised of discontinuous end moraines interspersed with ground moraines and occasional outwash plains. The landscape outside the southern boundary is of higher elevation and is comprised of rolling, hummocky upland with some outwash material. The eastern boundary, which closely approximates Spring Creek, identifies an area of low relief, continuous and intermittent stream drainage, and marsh. To the east of Spring Creek and outside the viticultural area is a glaciated upland plain where the landscape is generally of higher elevations and comprised of end moraines with little or no outwash material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

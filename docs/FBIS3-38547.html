			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Norman report: "Sustained Recovery Foreseen by Bank </F> Governor"]    [Text] Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of  England, last night said prospects for sustained output growth  and gradually falling unemployment were "better than at any  time" in his 31-year professional career.    In a speech to the Bankers Club annual banquet in London's  Guildhall, Mr George backed up this optimistic view with the  observation that UK underlying inflation was lower than for a  generation.    But the governor couched his remarks in such a way as to  quash any idea that he might argue for a cut in bank base rates  from their current 5.5 percent level when he meets Mr Kenneth  Clarke, the chancellor, for their monthly monetary meeting later  today.    Instead of discussing the short-term outlook, Mr George  spoke  of the need to make "sustained, non-inflationary growth a  reality over the years ahead." He recalled that the government  had the "declared longer-term aim of price stability" and, with  the bank, was "making solid progress towards that goal."  However, the desired outcome of stable prices, rising output  and falling unemployment was "not assured," he said.    Mr George said price stability was necessary for avoiding  the  exaggerated boom and bust cycles that had caused repeated social  and economic damage since the second world war.    On independence for the bank, he criticised those MPs who  last Friday voted against a private member's bill to give it  more autonomy on the grounds that the government must retain  direct control over short-term interest rates. This stance was  hard to understand, given proposals to make the bank more  accountable to parliament.    On the other hand, he would not wish for independence  without  a broad consensus in favour of price stability. That would be  "a poisoned chalice that I would be reluctant to take up even if  it were offered," Mr George said.</p>

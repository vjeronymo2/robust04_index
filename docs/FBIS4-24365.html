			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official Liu  Huaqiu today shared the view with visiting Gertrude Mongella,  secretary general of the Fourth World Conference on Women, that  they would enhance ties and cooperation and make concerted  efforts for the successful convocation of the conference.    During their talks here this morning, Liu, vice-chairman of  China's organization committee of the fourth women's conference  and vice-minister of foreign affairs, reviewed the preparatory  work that China has done over the past one year.    He described the conference to be held here in September  next  year as a "grand meeting" for the woman representatives from all  over the world during which the participants will discuss the  issue on how to raise women's status.    Liu said the Chinese Government, as a host, places great  importance on the conference.    He told Mongella that the preparations for the conference  have been fully conducted according to the plan under the  leadership of the State Council and the guidance of the  organization committee of the conference.    He said the conference's significance and background have  been widely popularized in China and the holding of the  conference here has won powerful support by the people from all  walks of life.    Liu said the preparations that China has made have been  supported by the United Nations. Both secretary-general and  deputy secretary- general of the U.N. have introduced China very  good experiences and raised feasible suggestions.    Meanwhile, he said: "Mongella has offered us very good ideas  in this regard".    "It is our inclination to continuously maintain and  strengthen such cooperative ties," he added.    Mongella said she has known more about China's preparations  for the conference after she made a study tour of Beijing and  other parts of the country.    She said what she has seen during the study tour is that the  Chinese Government attaches great importance to the conference.    The Chinese women have shown their strong self-confidence in  raising their social status and their great enthusiasm for the  conference has been supported powerfully, she said, adding that  this is an important condition for the success of the conference.    She expressed the belief that through friendly cooperation  between the U.N. and the Chinese Government the meeting will  surely achieve a full success.</p>

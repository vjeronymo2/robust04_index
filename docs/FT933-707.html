			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Labour at Brighton: Conference Notebook - No sign of the big idea NEVER under-estimate the legacy of the Lady. Thatcherism died in the Conservative party three years ago with her departure from Downing Street. Mr John Major is floundering still in the consequent ideological vacuum. Now the electorate appears also to be disavowing the triumphant individualism of the 1980s. Society and community have returned to the lexicon of political respectability. After an economic recession which ravaged the southern middle-classes, so too has the notion that governments might have the ambition at least of full employment. But the Labour party is as uncertain as the Tories how to fill the philosophical gap. The message from its Brighton conference yesterday was a curious mix of confidence, complacency and confusion. On one side the so-called modernisers fretted over the ground they had lost since the cold shower of last year's fourth election defeat had been replaced by the warmer climate of the government's disarray. Mr Tony Blair is in belligerent mood these days. On what used to be called the soft left, Mr David Blunkett and Mrs Ann Taylor relied on the well-tried tactic of attacking the Tories over health and education while offering few clues as to their alternative strategies. Leaving aside for a day or two the dispute over one-member-one-vote, Mr John Edmonds of the GMB went on the offensive over the party's economic strategy. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, he called for the party to break with the Tories' economic agenda. What was wrong with spending and borrowing? With large numbers of the delegates in Brighton convinced once again that victory at the next election is only a matter of time, it is a seductive strategy. It is being presented daily and with some eloquence by Mr Bryan Gould, now the most powerful voice of dissent on the Labour backbenches. For his part, Mr John Smith sat rather uneasily on the platform, convinced that Labour cannot abort the process of change but reluctant to abandon the traditionalist reflexes which sustained Labour in Scotland even through the wilderness years of the 1980s. His speech later today will combine an angry denunciation of the 'chaos' of Mr Major's government with an assertion that wealth creation, full employment and better public services are all part of the same picture. In the jargon of the spin-doctors, it will be a put-Britain-back-to-work speech. But the pivotal figure for the moment remains Mr Brown. He has spent the past year clearing the decks of tax and spending pledges made by Labour at the last election. It has not made him very popular with Mr Edmonds et al, and his friends say he has been feeling the heat. So Mr Brown has now adopted a more populist tack. Despite all those prawn cocktail lunches, he devoted a significant chunk of his speech to an attack on City boardroom. Financiers, it seems, are to Labour conferences what social security cheats are to Tory ones. There was a more important message, though. For all his caution the shadow chancellor has decided that Labour's economic strategy must be seen to be expansionist. He will not suggest tax increases beyond the closing of the lengthening list of executive loopholes he publishes every other day (unless, that is, Mr Kenneth Clarke gets there first). But the unifying goal is to be full employment. It is an approach designed to solve two problems. It should take some of the internal pressure off Mr Brown, and it will give Labour a clear basis from which to attack the government in the approach to the November Budget. Tactically, it makes sense. The economy remains the government's weakest point. Nothing could be more potent than unemployment for their university-educated sons and daughters in shifting the allegiances of the aspirant classes. But it does not fill the vacuum. 'Found the big idea yet?' asked one member of the shadow cabinet yesterday. 'Don't bother. There isn't one.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma </F> Committee for Defense, by unidentified correspondent; place and  date not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Your committee is composed of  representatives from various factions; do you think that you  will be successful in coming to positive decisions with such a  mix?    [Yushenkov] We all have one aim -- legislative support of  reliable Russian defense. In this sense, I think that by  building on reality and Russian practices and traditions we will  be able to work out mutually acceptable decisions.    We must realistically address the situation which has  developed. The situation is such that troops, the army in  general, [pauses, changes thought] many army units are stationed  outside the borders of the Russian Federation and are  participating in such things as peacekeeping duties. Whether I,  or others, like it or not, it is a fact. Servicemen serving  abroad need legislation to feel that they are really protected  in the social and legal sense.    [Correspondent] Will you comment on the work of the  commission appointed to investigate the events of 3-4 October,  1993.    [Yushenkov] As a former member of a similar commission  appointed to investigate the events of 19-21 August, I remember  its activities well. Regardless of the fact the Supreme Soviet  in the past had more authority and opportunity than the present  State Duma, the decisions of that commission did not have any  significant influence on the processes going on in society. In  fact, they did not avert the repeat of the putsch. I am coming  to believe that these types of commissions -- when there is an  investigation and the State Duma has no clearly prescribed role  in the investigation -- cannot undertake, adopt, or in any way  influence what happens in society.    [Correspondent] Sergey Nikolayevich, the former Supreme  Soviet and old committees, such as the one you served on,  adopted quite a number of good laws in principle. Officers are  still writing to us about the law on the status of servicemen,  in particular, but the problem lies in the fact that these  rather good laws are not being implemented.    [Yushenkov] If they are not being implemented that means  they are not very good. There are two reasons why laws do not  work: Either they do not conform to the existing realities in  society -- the real state of affairs -- or they lack a mechanism  for their implementation. We have already started a careful  inventory of all ineffectual laws, separate clauses, and  statutes to determine the reason why such regulations do not  work. We will strive to either abolish the regulation, make it  conform to reality, or structure a mechanism for its  implementation.    [Correspondent] I understand.    [Yushenkov] The issue which you raised earlier even now has  great significance, the essence of which is that we need to  clearly define the type of army we want to build.</p>

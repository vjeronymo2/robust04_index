			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua by Jacques </F> Fleury, Thierry Oberle, and Ivan Rioufol; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] Algerians are  starting to flee their country and come to France. Does this  worry you?    [Pasqua] So far, the exodus you mention has not occurred.  We have gone from 104 applications for asylum in 1992 to a  little more than 1,000 last year. It is obvious that if the  situation in Algeria were to worsen, we would probably receive  more requests.    [LE FIGARO] If the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] comes to  power in Algeria, there will be many people requesting asylum in  France. Are you prepared to accept them?    [Pasqua] There is no reason why the FIS should gain power in  Algeria. France wants Algeria to find the economic and  political means of solving its problems. This depends on  discussions between the government and its existing opponents.  It is out of the question for us to accept a flood of people  coming from Algeria. We would not be in a position to accept  several tens of thousands of people.    [LE FIGARO] But will these exiles not be able to take  advantage of the right of asylum?    [Pasqua] The right of asylum is an individual right, whereas  you refer to an exodus of a population. We would obviously  accept those who have French nationality. Those with dual  nationality will have to justify their claim.    Aside from these exiles, we have no obligations, or else we  will have to accept half the world! Moreover, if this problem  was raised, it should be examined not in the framework of our  own country, but in that of the Mediterranean countries and at  the level of the European Union. Italy, Spain, and France would  face the same problem. We cannot be the natural receptacle for  all the oppressed, all the persecuted, all oppositionists.    [LE FIGARO] Do you take seriously an Islamic fundamentalist  threat in France?    [Pasqua] The government's role is to take seriously any  possible threats. Moreover, it is in this spirit that we  launched a preventive operation against FIS supporters in Paris  and in central France, which has resulted in the destabilization  of that organization.    We have carried out the same operation with regard to the  Kurds. We will do it with regard to others if necessary. All  groups which might carry out violent or unlawful actions in our  country are obviously kept under surveillance. But, for the  time being, there is no Islamic fundamentalist threat in France.    [LE FIGARO] How do you interpret the recent arrest in Lille  of two alleged FIS supporters?    [Pasqua] I take these arrests very seriously. We will now  try to unravel the question, which is the natural role of the  legal system and the police. [passage omitted]    [LE FIGARO] In Corsica, is the dialogue with the  nationalists not a failure, since the terrorist campaign  continues?    [Pasqua] Do you have a better policy? The aim is not to  have dialogue with the nationalists, but primarily to give  Corsica the necessary means for its economic development.  Corsica is the first region of France to sign the state-region  reorganization law. We are now preparing the revenue bill,  which will be presented to Parliament sometime in May. I think  that there is a very broad agreement in Corsica on this  legislation and on the development measures, including circles  close to the nationalists. The arrest of the Sperone commando  was a serious blow to the nationalists, but it will not lead to  their disappearance. This kind of actions will be halted  through a series of measures, the weariness of the population,  and, finally, a new awareness by all the nationalists, or at  least by the most responsible ones. But all attacks must not be  lumped together. There is a good proportion of crime and  racketeering. I have given the police instructions and  resources, and we are beginning to have results.

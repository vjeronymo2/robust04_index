			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Credit Suisse provisions hit peak CREDIT SUISSE has joined the parade of international banks making huge provisions for bad loans. The banking group, Switzerland's third largest, said its provisions ballooned last year to a record SFr1.5bn (Dollars 873m), a third above those in 1991. However, a robust 14 per cent rise in cash flow to SFr2.8m, thanks mainly to higher commissions and trading profits, enabled the group to end with a meagre 1.1 per cent rise in consolidated net income to SFr857m. 'Given the difficult economic climate, our results were thoroughly satisfactory,' said Mr Robert Jeker, the outgoing chief executive. Mr Josef Ackermann, incoming chief executive, forecast that cash flow would 'develop rather well' in the current year, but said that provisions would remain substantial because of the continuing recession. Mr Ackermann also warned of the costs of integrating Swiss Volksbank. Credit Suisse has made an agreed SFr1.6bn takeover bid for the troubled Volksbank, and completion is expected to be completed next month. Up to 2,000 jobs and at least 100 of the two banks' 400 branches are to go. Of total income of SFr5.8bn, 40 per cent came from lending. Improvements in margins on an expanded loan book were offset by provisions against interest rate risk of more than SFr200m. Commission income rose 13 per cent to SFr1.66bn, reflecting higher revenues from investment business and securities administration. Trading income jumped 26 per cent to SFr1.6bn mainly because of a SFr202m surge in foreign exchange dealing profits to SFr672m and a SFr172m jump in securities trading profits to SFr440m. Credit Suisse's 50 per cent interest in Credit Suisse Financial Products, the CS Holding group's derivatives specialist, was SFr98m. Mr Jeker said 35 per cent of cash flow came from overseas operations, up from 34 per cent last year. On the other hand, two thirds of the bad loan provisions arose in Switzerland. Assets rose 11 per cent to SFr173bn, with SFr3bn of the rise coming from the acquisitions of two Swiss regional banks and SFr3.7bn from the currency effects. Lending was up 4 per cent to SFr99.9bn and customer deposits rose 8 per cent to SFr113.8bn.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese builder down sharply HASEKO, a leading Japanese condominium-builder, was hit by the worsening domestic economy. Reporting a sharp drop in profits, the company pointed to an especially harsh environment in the real estate and construction industries, with investment down sharply in office buildings and large apartment complexes. It posted a non-consolidated Y25.2bn drop in pre-tax profits, to Y25bn (Dollars 187.96m), and a 42.8 per cent fall, to Y8bn, in net profits in the year ended March. Sales increased 1.5 per cent to Y529bn. Haseko's construction sales were up 6.8 per cent to Y328bn, and management income 3 per cent to Y19.4bn. Design management sales, however, fell 9 per cent to Y7.1bn. Real estate was down 7 per cent to Y174bn. Order receipts declined 33.4 per cent to Y280bn. Haseko drew down current assets Y47bn to Y839bn, including a drop in cash reserves of Y32bn to Y96bn and a sell-off of its entire Y1.5bn securities portfolio. Current liabilities were off Y85bn to Y646bn. With no signs of a pick-up in private capital investment or consumer spending, it expects continued hard times for construction orders and real estate activities. For the year ended March 1993, it expects its first sales decline in nine years, of 9.2 per cent to Y480bn. Pre-tax profits are also seen falling 40 per cent to Y15bn, and net profits 54 per cent to Y6.5bn.</p>

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Weir pays Dollars 210m for US pump maker: Group announces Pounds 96m one-for-four rights issue Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering group, is paying Dollars 210m (Pounds 136m) to acquire EnviroTech Pumpsystems, a leading US manufacturer of specialist pumps. The acquisition will be partly funded through a proposed one-for-four rights issue of about 39.3m shares at 252p each to raise Pounds 96m after expenses. The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The balance of the purchase price will be in cash and the enlarged group will have little or no gearing. The group announced a 10.6 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits yesterday to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.8m) but admitted that orders in the second quarter had fallen off from the strong first quarter. Weir Group shares closed 2p higher at 304p. EnviroTech, a pump manufacturing group headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is part of the Baker Hughes group. In the year to September 30, EnviroTech reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 21.7m on sales of Dollars 220.5m with net assets of Dollars 98.3m. Weir has been looking for an acquisition which would improve the international balance of its pump business which had sales last year of Pounds 180m. Lord Weir, chairman, said the purchase would enable the group to expand into a truly international business with a combined turnover of about Pounds 330m. He added that it would offer the group an improved marketing and manufacturing capability worldwide and give the group's pump operations important critical mass. The combined pump business will represent about 55 per cent of the enlarged group's sales and will increase Weir's presence in the important North American market and expand its operations in most other regions. Lord Weir said the deal should enhance earnings in 1995. The US group, which employs about 2,000 people, also has plants in California and Missouri and operations in the UK, continental Europe, South America, Africa, Australia and Canada. Its main worldwide markets are the mining and mineral processing, chemicals and refining, water and waste water, power and utilities and pulp and paper. Last year the US gave rise to 44.2 per cent of its operating revenues, Europe 25.9 per cent, Africa 14.3 per cent, South America 11.1 per cent and Asia/Pacific 4.5 per cent. Results, Page 16</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors still enjoy positive returns - Junk bonds Junk bonds - corporate debt issued in the US and rated below investment grade - lost more than 2 per cent of their value in November, according to figures published last week by Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency. Noting an increased rate of default and rising yield spreads, Moody's said the decline was the second largest since the inception of its speculative grade index in February 1991. The news will reinforce the views of critics who see dabbling in the Dollars 290bn junk bond market as tantamount to wild and dangerous speculation - but the market's recent evolution and performance defies this kind of judgment. Certainly, prices of junk bonds have fallen this year, principally because of the 2.5 per cent increase in US interest rates and investors' expectations of higher inflation. The Moody's index - made up of 553 bonds - fell by 2.28 per cent in November bringing the cumulative decline for 1993 as a whole to 9.82 per cent. However price declines have been mitigated by relatively large coupon payments and tightening credit spreads. Overall - when the effect of interest payments is included - junk bonds have offered positive returns of 0.35 per cent over the year to November, according to Moody's. Between May and October investors saw six consecutive months of positive overall returns. 'In this rout for the bond market, returns are still positive,' says Mr Lea Carty, an economist with Moody's in New York. Even in November, investors in bonds rated B1 and Ba1 - the upper end of Moody's speculative grade spectrum equivalent to B plus and BB plus ratings issued by Standard &amp; Poor's, the other major rating agency - earned positive total returns - of 0.49 per cent and 0.47 per cent respectively. Taking a longer-term view, junk bonds have also done surprisingly well. Many corporate issuers have been performing well as the US economy pulled out of recession. In price terms, junk bonds have outperformed US Treasuries, especially since 1992, and spreads over Treasuries tightened sharply in 1993 and 1994. Moody's B3s (equivalent to S&amp;P's B minus) were trading at 672 basis points over Treasuries in February 1993, narrowed to 483 basis points over in February this year and 431 basis points since November, for example. Moody's Ba1 bonds, the highest rated non-investment grade, traded at a spread over Treasuries of 306 points in February 1992, falling to 260 points over a year later and 182 over in February 1994. At the end of last month Ba1 bonds had narrowed further to 175 points. The improvement has also been reflected in a gradual decline in the rate of default. Default rates reached 9.5 per cent in 1991 before falling to 3.1 per cent in 1993. In June 1994, based on Moody's trailing 12-month issuer-based rate, rates fell to a decade low of 1.44 per cent. Mr Anton Simon, head of high yield investments at the United Bank of Kuwait in London, says this year's decline in prices has been less marked than many would have expected, partially because the market has become both deeper and more liquid as a result of a change in the profile of investors, following the entry of bigger institutional investors into the market since 1990. Some 30 per cent of the high yield market is owned by mutual funds, 25 per cent by US insurance companies, 12 per cent by US pension funds and 10 per cent by investment grade and equity investors, with only 3 per cent of the market owned by foreign investors, according to figures cited by Mr Simon. 'In the past, the high yields would have been clobbered in this kind of market,' he says. 'People just saw it as dirty asset class - when they felt nervous they just got rid of it.' Mr Simon says the level of research and understanding of the market has also increased and there is growing receptivity among institutions to arguments that high yield corporate bonds should be treated as a separate asset class. In a report published earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based SEI Capital Markets Research noted low levels of correlation in the performance with either US equities, investment grade bonds or Treasury bonds. SEI said investors should hold between 10 and 30 per cent of their fixed income portfolios in high yield bonds. It maintained that a portfolio of fixed income becomes more efficient when high yield bonds are admitted - the efficiency stemming from greater return and lower volatility. SEI added that 'risks can be minimised through diversification among a range of high yield issues'. Enthusiasts also point out the importance of carefully monitoring the credit quality of issuers, with the investment focus much more akin to that taken by a manager of equity rather than fixed income. 'Never compromise on credit vigilance,' says Mr Simon. As signs of an economic slowdown in the US build up, that looks like essential advice for investors tempted by the potential returns offered by the sector.</p>

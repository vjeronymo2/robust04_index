Yoshiharu Sato, chairman of the Central Union of  Agricultural  Cooperatives (Zenchu), told reporters in this northern Japanese  city that he expects to submit his resignation to the  Tokyo-based organization on Thursday.    Sato, 68, has been in hospital for cancer treatment. He did  not name a successor but said he hopes the new Zenchu leadership  will work out a policy to deal with the opening of the rice  market.    Sato, who became Zenchu's chief in July 1993, has criticized  the government's decision to partially open the rice market as  "totally unacceptable" for rice growers.    The decision last month by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's  government marked the end of Japan's half-century ban on rice  imports.    Tokyo accepted a proposal made by the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which calls for Japan to open 4  percent to 8 percent of its domestic rice market as the minimum  access for imports, while giving a six-year moratorium for  replacing all import restrictions with tariffs.</p>

"We have decided to furnish 40 million U.S. dollars to China  initially this year, taking into account the projects the money  would finance and the availability of EDCF funds," the official  said.    The projects include a bridge construction in north China's  coastal city of Tianjin, harbor expansion in the eastern  province of Shandong, and railroad facilities and airport  communications and control facilities in northeastern province  of Heilongjiang.    The official added that Seoul made the decision after a  feasibility study of the projects by a fact-finding team sent to  China toward the end of last year.</p>

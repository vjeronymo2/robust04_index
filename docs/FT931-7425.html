			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Loan losses hit Bank of Montreal A FURTHER climb in loan losses caused Bank of Montreal's first-quarter earnings to dip by 5 per cent, despite strong growth in mortgage and commercial loans. Earnings dropped CDollars 155m (USDollars 124m), or CDollars 1.12 a share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 164m, or CDollars 1.23 a share, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 12.5 per cent from 15.1 per cent. Net interest income climbed to CDollars 764m from CDollars 744m, helped by the receipt of CDollars 29m in overdue interest from Brazil. But this improvement was offset by a 30 per cent jump in loan loss provisions to CDollars 162m. The bank said it expected loan losses for fiscal 1993 as a whole to total CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 550m last year and almost double the figure for 1991. The latest figure includes a general provision of CDollars 100m for hitherto unidentified losses.</p>

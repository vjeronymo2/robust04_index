			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cheung Kong 28% ahead - Hong Kong Results CHEUNG KONG, Mr Li Ka-shing's flagship Hong Kong group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent rise in net earnings to HKDollars 6.2bn (USDollars 800m) for 1992 from HKDollars 4.88bn in 1991. The result, which was within the market's forecast range, was achieved on virtually static growth in turnover to HKDollars 10.3bn from HKDollars 9.9bn. Underlining what an exceptional year 1992 was for property development companies in Hong Kong, Cheung Kong's operating profits - at HKDollars 3.4bn  -were three times those earned in 1991. The directors declared a final dividend of 60 cents a share making 80 cents for the year - a rise over 1991 of 18 per cent. Mr Li expects economic conditions in Hong Kong and China to provide the basis for the improved performance of Cheung Kong in 1993. The group signed five joint venture deals with mainland parties to develop property in China last year, principally in Shanghai, Guangdong and Hainan. Mr Li said the economic reforms the Chinese government was pursuing were encouraging. The property market in Hong Kong stabilised in 1992, but with the overall economy remaining robust he expected the market for small to medium-sized flats - the market which Cheung Kong dominates - to improve towards the end of the year.</p>

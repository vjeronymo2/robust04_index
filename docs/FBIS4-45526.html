			<p>for   Campaign   <F P=102> PA2406123394 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 0405 GMT 24 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2406123394 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] An article published by Miami's EL NUEVO HERALD has  made accusations in the disturbing case of the narco-cassette  tapes, according to which drug trafficking groups made donations  to the campaign of President-elect Ernesto Samper. With the  case still under investigation, EL NUEVO HERALD added things  that have not been alleged here in Colombia.    In turn, President-elect Ernesto Samper sent the following  letter to the editors of EL NUEVO HERALD--Messrs. (David  Lorenz), (Bob Scribford), and (Sandra Keys)--and Roberto Suarez,  a reporter for THE MIAMI HERALD and EL NUEVO HERALD:    Dear Gentlemen: With suprise and indignation I read today  the report that appeared in EL NUEVO HERALD, according to which  the U.S. Government has confirmed I received money from the Cali  Cartel for my electoral campaign. In addition, the report  presents a totally false story that contains slanderous remarks  I am not willing to let go unchallenged, not only for the sake  of my own dignity but for that of all of Colombia.    I have never received money from any criminal organization  to  fund my political activities, as demonstrated by my campaign  ledgers. These ledgers show that we carefully monitored the  origin of campaign funds.    As president-elect of all citizens of Colombia, I renounce  the article published today, and I demand that you correct the  false information in this report, which damages my honor and the  honor of my country.    [Signed] Yours Truly, Ernesto Samper Pizano</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELEVANGELIST DEMANDS ETHICS PANEL HEARING;  </P> <P> TRINITY NETWORK FOUNDER IS 'GRIEVED AND OFFENDED' BY UNETHICAL CONDUCT  ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> The founder and president of the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network has  responded for the first time to allegations of unethical conduct and business  practices and is demanding a hearing before the Ethics Committee of the  National Religious Broadcasters, which is investigating the network.  </P> <P> Televangelist Paul F. Crouch also acknowledged, in a letter to the NRB, that in  1981 "I probably did pray that God would kill anyone or anything that was  attempting to destroy the ministry. My prayer has not changed today."  </P> <P> Trinity, now a 24-hour-a-day Christian programming service, was founded by  Crouch and several other backers in 1973. Since then, Crouch has assumed total  control of the network, which has experienced spectacular growth and now  encompasses 14 full-power commercial stations, three educational stations and  more than 90 low-power television stations in the United States, along with  more than 20 overseas stations.  </P> <P> On Feb. 2 The Times reported that Crouch and TBN were the subject of an  investigation by the NRB's Ethics Committee, in part because of complaints that  Crouch used unethical practices in building and acquiring Christian television  stations.  </P> <P> In the first of two letters of response to Richard Bott, Sr., chairman of  ethics panel, Crouch said he was "deeply grieved and offended by your actions  as head of the NRB Ethics Committee," adding that "I now demand a hearing  before your committee." TBN provided copies of both letters to The Times.  </P> <P> Bott, president of Bott Broadcasting of Independence, Mo., was traveling Monday  and could not be reached for comment. However, in an interview last week, Bott  said that Crouch would have 30 days to respond to the complaints before the NRB  would decide whether TBN could retain membership in the voluntary organization.  </P> <P> The ethics committee is looking into two formal complaints against TBN.  </P> <P> The first, made in the form of a sworn affidavit by the Rev. Keith A. Houser,  of Irving, Tex., grew out of a dispute over control of an upstate New York  television station that is now owned by Trinity. The Federal Communications  Commission has ruled in favor of Trinity, but the matter is scheduled to be  decided soon in civil court in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.  </P> <P> Houser alleged in court documents that Crouch unethically took over the New  York station, which Houser said he founded. Crouch joined with other station  board members, Houser alleged, and "cut deals with these parties without my  prior knowledge and virtually started a hostile takeover of the television  station."  </P> <P> The second complaint was made in a four-page letter to Bott from Marvin L.  Martin, an Orange County resident who said he worked for Crouch for 10 years,  until 1981. His duties, he said in the letter, included producing the nightly  talk show "Praise the Lord," which featured Crouch and his wife Jan.  </P> <P> Martin said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, that in  1981, "I gave Paul Crouch a letter demanding his and Jan's resignation because  of their moral and financial improprieties. . . ."  </P> <P> Martin declined Monday to elaborate on his letter and the substance of his  allegations could not immediately be independently confirmed.  </P> <P> Both Houser and Martin testified before a closed meeting of the ethics  committee in Los Angeles in late September. Crouch expressed outrage that  copies of the two complaints were leaked to The Times.  </P> <P> "At a minimum," Crouch wrote to Bott, "I feel ethics charges should be brought  against you and your ethics committee as well as Keith Houser and Marv Martin."  </P> <P> Crouch said he denied "categorically" Martin's allegations, characterizing them  as "mostly fabrications and outright lies from a bitter and sick mind."  </P> <P> Crouch referred to Martin's "infamous letter of demand for my resignation. . .  . He did produce such a letter and I fired him on the spot. His allegations  about 'moral and financial improprieties' were just as vague then as they are  now. What are these improprieties? Let my accusers come forward if they can!"  </P> <P> Martin alleged that in the mid-1970s, as TBN became more successful, a number  of employees complained to him about the pay scale at the network. "Employees  were constantly complaining to me that their families were hurting," he wrote.  </P> <P> When a group of these employees attempted to organize, Martin wrote, the  Crouches took action against them.  </P> <P> The way Crouch recalled the incident, "an attempt was made by a handful of  disgruntled production employees to form a labor union attempting to force  raises which the ministry could not afford. We resisted these attempts and  proved that the (National Labor Relations Board) had no jurisdiction over a . .  . tax-exempt ministry organization. A few (five or six) did resign when they  realized that their attempt had failed but no one was fired by TBN for their  actions. . . . Nearly all the employees involved have since returned to ask my  forgiveness for the harm and dissension they caused. Jan and I freely have  forgiven and continue to work with some of the employees in question."  </P> <P> Officials of the NLRB could not immediately be reached to comment on the case.  </P> <P> Martin also wrote that "at one staff prayer meeting in the TBN chapel, Paul  Crouch prayed aloud in my presence that God would 'kill' a man in the community  who had filed for an FCC license to take over TBN's flagship station (in Orange  County). Paul Crouch said that those who opposed him or did anything to hurt  the Trinity Broadcasting Ministry were 'coming against God's anointed.' "  </P> <P> Crouch acknowledged that "one of Martin's charges is true. I did pray for the  wrath of God to fall on enemies of TBN who at the time were attempting to take  the license of KTBN-Channel 40. This would have destroyed the entire ministry  which was just beginning to burst forth with growth. At the time we had four TV  stations. Today, 8 years later, we have 154. I probably did pray that God would  kill anyone or anything that was attempting to destroy the ministry. My prayer  has not changed today."  </P> <P> Last week, in place of a scheduled live telecast of "Praise the Lord," the  network substituted a year-old tape which included Paul Crouch accepting an  award on behalf of TBN from the National Religious Broadcasters at their 1988  national convention in Washington. Before the award was made in 1988, the  ethics committee voted unanimously to withhold the award, according to a  committee member, but their recommendation was overruled by the NRB's executive  committee after a stormy meeting with Crouch.  </P> <P> The Rev. Philip Crouch, Paul Crouch's brother and vice president of TBN, said  in a telephone interview last week that he did not make the decision to run the  year-old tape but that he assumed the purpose in airing it at this time was "to  kind of settle anyone's fears that we were in good standing with the NRB."  </P></p>

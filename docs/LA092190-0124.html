			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR RACES TO WATCH IN THE FALL;  </P> <P> 72ND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT  </P> <P> The combatants: Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) faces a political  newcomer in Democrat Tom Umberg. Incumbents are usually safe, but Democrats  consider this race one of their best chances this year to unseat a Republican  because Pringle is sitting in the only district in Orange County that is not  dominated by GOP voters.  </P> <P> Key issues: This district includes some of the county's most notorious drug and  gang neighborhoods, so both candidates are fighting hard for the title of crime  fighter. Umberg has attacked Pringle for his connection to the hiring of  uniformed guards at polling places in his 1988 campaign. Pringle calls Umberg a  carpetbagger for moving into the area so he could run for office.  </P> <P> Outlook: Look for a close and muddy campaign. Also, watch how the candidates  appeal to minority communities since this district the county's largest Latino  and Vietnamese communities.  </P> <P> Campaign funds as of 6/30:  </P> <P> Pringle: $103,000  </P> <P> Umberg: $24,000  </P> <P> </P> <P> District Attorney  </P> <P> The combatants: James G. Enright, the chief deputy, is taking on his  boss-by-appointment, Michael R. Cappizzi, who was the protege of longtime Dist.  Atty. Cecil Hicks, have been adversaries within the office for years. Enright  was second-in-command as chief deputy, but Capizzi wielded all the power as  Hick's right-hand man. Most of the staff backs Capizzi, who was appointed  district attorney by county supervisors in January.  </P> <P> Key issue: Enright is trying to depict Capizzi as the politician's choice,  claiming that Hicks and Capizzi engineered Capizzi's appointment. Capizzi said  he will run only on his record and not attack Enright during the campaign.  </P> <P> Outlook: Most court house observers see Capizzi as being hard to beat, but they  say Enright's surprisingly strong showing in the June primary might give him  momentum.  </P> <P> Campaign funds as of 6/30:  </P> <P> Enright: $18,102  </P> <P> Capizzi: $140.541  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Supervisor, District 2  </P> <P> The combatants: Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder faces a tenacious but underfunded  challenge from Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer. Wieder has won the  endorsement of local conservative Republican clubs; one reason was her recent  opposition to Measure M, the proposed transportation sales tax. Since she  supported the measure until June, that could leave her open to charges of  inconsistency from Neugebauer, who has always opposed it.  </P> <P> Key issue: Wieder. She took a beating in a 1988 congressional race after she  was caught lying about her resume. Neugebauer will try to capitalize on that.  The two candidates also differ on abortion: Neugebauer calls herself  "pro-life," while an upcoming Wieder fund-raiser bills the supervisor as the  county's "only Republican pro-choice candidate."  </P> <P> Outlook: Wieder holds the reins. If she stays out of trouble, she's the  favorite.  </P> <P> Campaign funds as of 6/30:  </P> <P> Neugebauer: $3,014  </P> <P> Wieder: $15,812  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Superintendent of Schools  </P> <P> The combatants: Longtime incumbent Robert D. Peterson faces an upstart effort  by political neophyte John F. Dean, a Whittier College Professor. Dean has  tapped resentment toward Peterson, but the incumbent is a scrappy and  experienced politician.  </P> <P> Key issue: Money. Both campaigns are running on fumes, and each candidate has  been forced to dip into his personal accounts: Peterson has spent $20,000 of  his own cash, Dean has contributed $30,000 to his own campaign. With such an  obscure office, whoever has more money will have a big edge.  </P> <P> Outlook: They're scheduled to meet face to face in a forum at the Irvine Hilton  on Oct. 10. Look for tough campaigning all the way to Election Day.  </P> <P> Campaign funds as of 6/30:  </P> <P> Peterson: $2,266  </P> <P> Dean: $10,439  </P></p>

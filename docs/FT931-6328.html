			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Repsol The timing of the Spanish government's international sale of up to Dollars 1bn of Repsol shares has more to do with deteriorating public finances than choosing an opportune moment in the business cycle. Yesterday's full-year figures maintained the company's record of earnings growth, but refining, marketing and petrochemicals are all slowing. The extent of rationalisation suggests the government's current 54 per cent stake has not been too much of a restraint on management. Since car ownership and the economy are forecast to grow faster than the European average, Spain ought to be comfortable home turf. Yet with its home market in recession and the government soon reduced to a minority, Repsol is understandably considering expansion abroad. BP and Elf have started to encroach on Spain. Exceptionally high refining and marketing margins cannot last forever. Deregulation of the local butane market will produce wider margins in the short run. It also brings the long-term threat of competition. Diversification could be achieved through asset swaps with other oil companies. Repsol might surrender a portion of its local refining share in return for a marketing toehold in France or the UK. If crude oil prices start to rise, it will be harder to resist the temptation to acquire more upstream assets to match downstream capacity. Either option carries a degree of risk. Repsol has proved itself in a protected domestic energy market. The risk is that it gets sucked into unwise expansion.</p>

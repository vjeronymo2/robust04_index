The wounded and some 47 family members were taken to Citluk,  around 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Mostar, in Spanish UN  Protection Force vehicles, before being flown to the Croatian  port of Split on British helicopters, said journalists.    They were due to be flown to the Italian military base of  Ancona where they are to be taken to a transit centre before  flying on to hospitals in Britain, Denmark, Italy, Spain, the  United States and the United Arab Emirates.    The evacuation comes after a ceasefire between the  Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Bosnian Croat forces came into  effect February 25.    Some 55,000 Moslems are holed up in the shattered remains of  eastern Mostar, battered by 11 months of shelling from Croat  forces camped in the western districts of the historic city.</p>

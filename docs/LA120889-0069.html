			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPIRITED MASTER'S ROLLS OVER WHITTIER, 98-71  </P> <P> Strands of twinkling lights bedeck the trees that surround Bross Gymnasium,  evoking a pristine holiday spirit on The Master's College campus.  </P> <P> But as the Whittier College men's basketball team discovered Thursday night,  Master's is wont to be anything but charitable once the Mustangs are within the  cozy and noisy confines of their home facility.  </P> <P> Master's routed the Poets, 98-71, for a non-district victory that improved the  Mustangs' record to 6-3, 4-1 at home.  </P> <P> Whittier dropped to 1-6.  </P> <P> "We knew we were bigger than them so we just wanted to take it at 'em," said  Master's forward Tom Bruner, who had a game-high 16 points and nine rebounds.  "When we come in here, it's just like, 'Bring it on.' We can take on anybody."  </P> <P> Bruner and the Mustangs will get a more challenging opportunity to prove  themselves Saturday when Master's plays host to Westmont (5-1) in a key  National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 game.  </P> <P> Master's shot 61% from the field against Whittier to earn its fourth victory in  its past five games.  </P> <P> Stuart Epperson scored 13 points and grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds for the  Master's. Jeff Newton also scored 13 points while Ted Hahs and David Moore each  scored 10 points for the Mustangs.  </P> <P> Despite committing six turnovers in the first three minutes, the Mustangs were  ahead from the outset and enjoyed a comfortable 51-32 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> Jason Webster and Bruner each had two baskets as Master's bolted to a 10-1 lead  before Whittier called a timeout.  </P> <P> It took the Poets, who shot just 32%, more than 4 1/2 minutes to make their  first field-goal attempt.  </P> <P> Master's, meanwhile, shot 63% in the first half and led by as many as 21  points.  </P> <P> The Mustangs led, 22-16, with 13 minutes left in the half when Moore came off  the bench and ignited a Master's scoring run that helped the Mustangs to take  an insurmountable lead.  </P> <P> Moore, a 6-foot-6, 215-pound junior forward, scored eight points and grabbed  five rebounds during the 12-2 run that put Master's in front, 34-18.  </P></p>

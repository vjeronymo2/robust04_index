			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dividend up 20% at Eastern Electricity Shares in UK regional power companies moved ahead for a third day yesterday as Eastern Electricity, Ipswich-based power distributor, announced a near 20 per cent rise in full-year dividend payments, the highest in the sector so far this year. Eastern said the dividend reflected the effects of buying back shares as well as a successful year, and should not be interpreted as a pointer to future dividend policy. However, the increase, together with a 15.85 per cent rise at Northern Electric, did nothing to dent the growing perception in the market that the companies' regulatory review would be less severe than feared. In common with other regional companies, Eastern and Northern would say nothing about the contents of a 30-page letter they received from Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, at the weekend. It is thought the regulator has assuaged some of their worst fears. Most analysts believe that cuts in distribution prices of as much as 20 per cent from April are now less likely. These charges account for some 25 per cent of consumers' electricity bills. Eastern's 19.8 per cent dividend rise for 1993-94 came in spite of a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 176.8m, from Pounds 193.4m. However, underlying profit growth, before exceptional charges of Pounds 48.3m, was 24 per cent. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said that because Eastern had bought back shares, the dividend bill of Pounds 59.6m was only 15 per cent ahead of 1992-93, in line with other recs. The company has bought back 5 per cent of its equity, and is seeking shareholder permission to buy back a further 14.9 per cent. It also announced a Pounds 6 rebate for domestic and small business customers. At Northern Electric, the dividend rise was in line with profits, which increased 15.5 per cent to Pounds 128.7m before tax. Mr David Morris, chairman, said the Newcastle-based electricity distributor was financially strong 'and we have every confidence that with further cost reductions we can continue to pay real dividend increases'. Northern also said it would be cutting prices to customers this year, but would wait until the regulatory review before deciding by how much. Details, Page 30</p>

Speaking at a lecture  meeting in his home base of Tochigi Prefecture, Watanabe said  the coalition government must not carry through Ozawa's alleged  plan to "railroad" the package of four political and electoral  reform bills through the Diet.    Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is a core party in the  seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa. Ozawa is widely regarded as a chief strategist for  the coalition which swept Hosokawa to power last August.    "It is a dictatorial plan advanced by Shinseito to try to  railroad the bills through the Diet on the strength of a  majority vote," Watanabe said.    Watanabe is the leader of one of four major factions within  the Liberal Democratic Party which fell to the opposition last  year after 38 years of rule.</p>

Brazauskas, along with V.  Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] National  Security Committee, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius,  and other officials, visited the former Russian Army bases and  inspected the condition of the transferred facilities.    First of all, the delegation visited the Rukla base in the  Jonava region. "There are lots of buildings, but they are used  ineffectively," said the president. Previously, the base used  to house 12,000 servicemen, while now there are only several  hundred soldiers -- the first field army motorized battalion  "Gelezinis Vilkas" [Iron Wolf]. An opinion was voiced that  Rukla could become the key Army training base and a center for  motorized training. The base has comfortable vacant apartments  which could accommodate servicemen coming for training.    In the Panevezys region, A. Brazauskas and his accompanying  delegation showed interest in the Pajuoste base. They discussed  ways of better utilizing its facilities. The president said  that it would be our key air base.    In the Siauliai region, the president visited the military  airport in Zokniai.</p>

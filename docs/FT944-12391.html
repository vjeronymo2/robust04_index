			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Frankfurt bank shut because of bad loans German finance market watchdogs yesterday shut down a Frankfurt bank which had been crippled by bad loans to clients allegedly introduced to it by Mr Tevfik Ozal, son of Turkey's late president, Mr Turgut Ozal. The Deutsch-Schweizerische Bank, which recently passed into the control of Mr Sergio Cuoghi, an Italian investor, had its licence withdrawn and about DM100m (Pounds 41m) in customer deposits frozen. The action was taken, said the banking supervisory office, because 'considerable additional valuation adjustments and write-offs' were needed in its credit business. According to the latest available figures, DSB, a small, unprofitable operation, had a balance sheet total of DM233.8m at the end of 1992, down from DM400m two years earlier. A statement from the bank yesterday said it had been left with no basis for continuing in business after Mr Cuoghi failed - despite 'several reminders'  -to inject new capital and credit guarantees due in mid-September. Mr Cuoghi, who was described in the statement as the 'extremely rich' head of the EhroFin financial group with offices in Geneva, London and New York, recently bought 75 per cent of DSB from Mr Ozal and the Alem Bank of Kazakhstan for an undisclosed sum. The remaining 25 per cent is held by the Zug-based Swiss Cantobank. Mr Ozal resigned his management board seat two weeks ago after Mr Cuoghi took control, according to Mr Volkmar von Alten, a DSB director. Mr von Alten, a member of the bank's management board since last February, said bad loans to three Turkish banks which were the cause of DSB's problems had been on the books when he arrived. The banks, introduced by Mr Ozal, had since been ordered to close by the Ankara government. 'I am not responsible. It is very difficult to judge what has happened,' he said, adding that he would offer to resign once the affair was cleared up. The scale of the bad loans was 'not outrageous, but enough'. Mr von Alten, formerly a senior manager at Dresdner Bank, said he was certain Mr Cuoghi would meet his commitments, including the injection of additional capital, possibly by as early as this week. As for the future of DSB, he said that Mr Cuoghi, rather than applying for a new licence to operate the business as a bank, intended to run it in future as a 'finance and investment house'. 'I think Mr Cuoghi is a good businessman and is determined to stick to his commitments,' he said. Mr Cuoghi was at his offices in Chelsea, London, yesterday, but could not be contacted for comment.</p>

			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BEATHARD: HENNING'S JOB IS SECURE  </P> <P> With the Chargers off to a 1-4 start, the questions about Coach Dan Henning's  job security are beginning to surface. Henning, who replaced Al Saunders before  last season, has a record of 7-14 with the Chargers.  </P> <P> Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard gave his coach a vote of confidence  Monday, after a 36-14 loss to a Steeler team that hadn't scored an offensive  touchdown this season before Sunday's meeting with the Chargers.  </P> <P> "I have all the confidence in the world in Dan," Beathard said. "That's a  thought that's never crossed my mind. I think Dan's going to succeed. I don't  have any doubts about Dan Henning."  </P> <P> In Beathard's mind, the losses have nothing to do with Henning's ability to  motivate.  </P> <P> "I tell you, he's terrific," Beathard said. "I can't tell you how good he is  talking in front of these players. I mean the guy has been just fantastic."  </P> <P> While he was at it, Beathard also gave his vote to the players.  </P> <P> "As bad as I felt yesterday, I still don't feel much different about the team,"  he said. "I think we have a much better team than we saw (Sunday), or that we  saw so far this season. We just have to work our way through this."  </P> <P> The problem, he says, is one of emotion, or lack thereof.  </P> <P> "If you're going to win in this league it takes emotion," he said. "All I hear  everywhere, and I can't argue with it, is we aren't playing with emotion. I  think even teams that I don't think our as good as we are have won because of  that."  </P> <P> Running back Ronnie Harmon suffered a mild concussion Sunday when he tackled  Steeler cornerback Rod Woodson on a kickoff return. He is expected to be ready  for Sunday's game against the New York Jets. Safety Vencie Glenn, who sprained  his ankle Sunday, is also expected to be ready to play. DON PATTERSON  </P></p>

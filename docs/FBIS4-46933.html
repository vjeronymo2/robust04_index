			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Mark Viktorov: "Minimum </F> Wage Currently Equals the Cost of 13 Loaves of Bread"]    [Text] According to the kray statistical  administration report, the greatest price increases in May were  registered with respect to for-fee services for the  population--8.8 percent; prices for foodstuffs and consumer  goods rose, respectively, by 6.2 percent and 6 percent.    Within the foodstuffs category, the greatest price increases  occurred with respect to cereals--by more than 14 percent. For  instance, the price of polished rice rose by 17 percent. Prices  for quick-frozen fish (not including gourmet varieties) rose by  12.5 percent.    The last week, however, was marked by a certain decline in  prices for milk and products made of it. In particular, milk  prices declined by 2.1 percent: from R1,096-R1,073 in the kray  on average.    It should be noted that rye bread--whose price, by the way,  rose by 40 percent last week, from R773 to R1,087 per kg--was  not available for sale anywhere in the kray except in  Vladivostok.    Despite the fact that, as statistical data show, food prices  rose at a somewhat slower rate, their range in different cities  and rayons continues to vary greatly. For instance, prices for  macaroni items differ by a factor of three: While the cheapest  macaroni is sold in Vladivostok (R662 a month), the most  expensive ones are in Pogranichniy Rayon (R2,100). At the same  time, Vladivostok is the leader in milk products cost. The same  applies to very expensive meat products and imported sausages.  As to our own bologna, which is affordable for our population,  it is practically impossible to find it in the stores. The  exception is the Vladivostok meat combine's own store.    Those whose refrigerator, washing machine, or vacuum cleaner  broke down, discovered in May that the cost of their repairs  went up by 25 percent. For instance, the cost of repairing the  refrigeration unit in a refrigerator increased from R133,000 to  R165,000.    Barber salon services also cost more now. For instance,  men's  fancy haircut now costs more than R7,000, and the cost of  chemical permanent increased to R16,500.    The cost of car maintenance service increased over a month  from R105,000 to R122,000.    Prices for tickets for concerts and the circuses increased  over May by almost one-third. For instance, while in April one  ticket to a concert cost in the kray on average R20,000, in May  it cost R26,000.    The cost of housing and municipal services increased almost  1.5-fold over last month. However, as VLADIVOSTOK has already  reported, beginning 1 June these services will cost many times  more.</p>

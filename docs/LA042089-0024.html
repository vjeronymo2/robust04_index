			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG BROTHERS  </P> <P> Nearly every day I read of a gang- or drug-related shooting incident on our  city streets. I'm amazed at how young some of the boys are that are involved in  these problems. I'm probably not wrong to assume that many of these kids come  from single-parent (read mother only) households.  </P> <P> I like to feel that I'm contributing in a small way to preventing some of these  problems. I'm a Big Brother to two fatherless, brotherless young Chicano boys.  We have a great time together and I feel I'm a positive influence in their  lives. Their mom certainly thinks so.  </P> <P> All of the Big Brother organizations, including mine, Catholic Big Brothers,  desperately need more volunteer men. We have great group activities and  outings, and it's also a good networking opportunity on the adult-to-adult  level.  </P> <P> Next time one of you guys see our "It takes a big man to be a big brother"  billboards around town, please call.  </P> <P> STEVE JONES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

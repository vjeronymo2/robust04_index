			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I watch Keith Olbermann (KCBS) because I will see something I won't see  anywhere else -- humor.  </P> <P> His work is original, he has a clever play on words and sometimes he's just  plain silly.  </P> <P> More than this, he places events in historical perspective with a knowledge of  tradition and an obvious love of the games.  </P> <P> And since in all this there is a recognition that the viewer might actually  have some intelligence and awareness of sports and something beyond, I will  continue to watch Keith Olbermann.  </P> <P> Lulu Lewis, North Hollywood  </P></p>

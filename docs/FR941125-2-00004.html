			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic location, socioeconomic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the advancement of this principle. Academic programs under the authority of the Bureau must maintain their scholarly integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goal of the project is to assist the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University, and social science departments at other universities in the region to develop up-to-date curricula, revise existing curricula, establish new courses, and develop and utilize new teaching methodologies and materials in local languages. In addition to a common emphasis on public policy analysis, the program at Warsaw University will also include empirically based approaches to the study of industrial relations, while at Babes-Bolyai University the program will also include the study of comparative politics and other aspects of political science. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The curricular development at all three departments will emphasize empirical methods and will enable faculty and students to gain experience with the tools for analyzing social, political, and public policy issues empirically. At the conclusion of the project, the faculty at participating departments should be capable of teaching the newly introduced or revised courses with appropriate teaching materials and should be able to participate more fully in international scholarly dialogue in their respective disciplines. Students graduating from the participating departments should be prepared to assume responsibilities in public service, education, and the private sector with the expertise required to plan and evaluate programs responsibly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project is designed for the following participants: faculty and students associated with the departments identified for primary support; faculty and students from other institutions in the region; and postdoctoral specialists from the U.S. who are qualified to train the central European faculty and students (applicant organizations do not need to obtain letters of commitment from the primary foreign institutions, which have indicated their interest and commitment directly to USIA). The primary departments are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Budapest University of Economics, Center for Public Affairs Studies, to assist in developing the Center's program for students specializing in empirically based public policy analysis; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Warsaw University, Institute of Sociology, to develop programs of instruction in empirically based approaches to industrial relations and public policy analysis; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Babes-Bolyai University, Faculty of History and Philosophy, to develop a department of political science emphasizing empirical methods, public policy analysis, and comparative politics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In addition, funds are available to enable the participation of faculty and students from other institutions in Poland, Hungary, and Romania in programs offered in cooperation with the three core universities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Logistics <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recipient organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material, and working with the foreign participating universities, U.S. host institutions and individual grantees to achieve maximum program effectiveness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Visa/Insurance/Tax Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. lecturers and consultants participating in the project must be U.S. citizens. Programs must comply with  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> J&hyph;1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in Application Package for further details. Administration of the program must be in compliance with reporting and withholding regulations for federal, state, and local taxes as applicable. Recipient organizations should demonstrate tax regulation adherence in the proposal narrative and budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange and non-exchange activities should complement and reinforce one another within and among the primary supported departments and at other institutions in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The ability to coordinate and evaluate exchange mechanisms and other activities to support the goal of faculty and curriculum development in the primary departments and at other institutions will be critical to the success of the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Boots Boots' campaign to persuade the City that its core chemist chain is sound in wind and limb has been pretty successful if the recent share price performance is any guide. Boots The Chemist's margins and high return on capital are considered sustainable because BTC matches Superdrug's prices on a basket of goods. Besides, in other areas such as product ranges, quality, stock control, and standard of staff BTC is ahead by a street. Superdrug, it is alleged, makes so much of price because it has nothing else to say. In so far as it goes this is quite a good line, yet the risk remains that some of the mud slung by Superdrug may stick. Marks and Spencer countered stagnant sales and fears of uncompetitive pricing with its successful 'Outstanding Value' campaign last autumn. BTC could perhaps regain the initiative on value with a similar exercise. A larger threat, however, comes from the food retailers. If a serious price war breaks out among the grocers, they may also cut margins on other goods, such as toiletries. While food retailers only stock limited ranges, any quantum shift in toiletry prices would force BTC to respond. Given its advantages Boots would doubtless emerge a winner from any price war, but the cost to margins could be substantial. Boots' management is understandably more upbeat. Its vision, though, sees Boots The Chemist as a kind of infernal Sorcerer's Apprentice, throwing off cash at an ever increasing rate. Finding a home for that money will be a challenge for a company which has scarcely covered itself with glory in its attempts to diversify.</p>

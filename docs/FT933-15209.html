			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Weak demand and high grape prices hit Remy REMY-COINTREAU yesterday highlighted the problems of the French drinks industry by announcing a 25 per cent fall in net profits, to FFr202m (Dollars 35.43m), in the year to March 31, from FFr271m in the previous year. The group, which owns a string of famous French drink brands, ranging from Remy-Martin cognac to Cointreau liqueur, attributed the fall in profits to the difficulties of the champagne market, where many producers have been badly affected by the combination of weak demand and high grape prices. The squeeze on champagne margins was the chief cause of a reduction in operating profits, from FFr1.05bn to FFr876m. The Cointreau brand was affected in the first half by a change in its distribution arrangements. However, Remy managed to maintain margins in cognac, which was buoyed by strong growth in the fledgling Chinese market, and to improve them in liqueurs and spirits. Turnover fell from FFr6.47bn to FFr5.83bn in the year to March 31, but Remy benefited from a reduction in financial costs, from FFr605m to FFr577m, over the same period. The news of Remy's fall in profits comes at a sensitive time for the French drinks industry, particularly for the champagne sector.</p>

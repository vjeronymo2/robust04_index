			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THEY'VE JUST BEGUN THE BOOK ON COURTIE MILLER  </P> <P> It was just after dinner on a school night sandwiched between the first round  and semifinals of the Southern California Regional Division II boys' basketball  playoffs.  </P> <P> Karen Miller slid to the edge of the couch in her Del Mar condominium and  enthusiastically opened a scrapbook filled with memories of son Courtie's  basketball career at Torrey Pines High School.  </P> <P> Courtie sat quietly in the easy chair, watching her show a visitor some clips  and pictures she had collected.  </P> <P> One night later, Courtie's game-high 31 points would not be enough to advance  the Falcons to the Southern California Regional championship game. The Falcons  were eliminated by Dominguez, a snappy, well-disciplined team from Compton. So  ended a season and, temporarily, Karen's quest to get her hands on every  newspaper in the county. She had been buying three daily papers each day and  two local papers twice a week. She will add to her clips, which include two  Times player of the year awards, after Courtie plays in the San Diego County  2-A vs. 3-A All-Star Game Saturday night at Serra High School.  </P> <P> The wall behind the television is covered with plaques, earned by Courtie for a  variety of basketball achievements. Karen jumps up at one point and explains  what each represents. Courtie watches.  </P> <P> The awards, the newspaper clips and the pictures mean the world to Karen. Last  Labor Day weekend, a fire started by a spark from a neighbor's barbecue  destroyed Karen and Courtie's condominium in Solana Beach. Karen was home.  Courtie wasn't. Karen grabbed the trophies and the baby pictures and took them  outside. Then she ran back inside and upstairs for the scrapbook.  </P> <P> "It was pretty stupid," she said. "I felt the wall, and it was warm, but it  wasn't hot. (The scrapbook) really was irreplaceable. I got the stuff I really  cared about.  </P> <P> "I'm so darned proud of this," she said, pointing to the wall. "This is what  it's all about. Honest to God, it feels better than anything I've ever  accomplished."  </P> <P> Suffice it to say, the memorabilia means a lot more to Karen than it does to  Courtie.  </P> <P> Courtie just plays.  </P> <P> Growing up has been enlightening for Courtie Miller, if not always simple.  Karen and his father, William, were divorced when he was 5. William rarely kept  in touch, Karen said, and Courtie hasn't seen or spoken to him in two years.  </P> <P> Karen says it hurt Courtie but didn't scar him. Courtie brushes it aside,  saying he isn't affected. He has had other father figures. Coaches. Family  friends. And he insists he doesn't think about his father.  </P> <P> "I'm not bitter," Courtie says. "If he comes up to me, I'm not going to be  rude. He is my father, after all. But if I never see him again, it wouldn't  break my heart."  </P> <P> When Courtie was midway through fourth grade, Karen made the decision to move  from Pasadena in search of a change and a better environment for Courtie. The  schools in the area had barbed wire on the fences. The Millers lived in a  middle-class neighborhood, but drug dealing and crime weren't far around the  corner.  </P> <P> San Diego, by comparison, was paradise, though Courtie says drugs never tempted  him anyway. He has seen the effect they have on people he has grown up with.  </P> <P> Courtie says he stays away from parties and doesn't drink beer because it's  just not for him. He prefers to spend time with his girlfriend or stay home and  watch basketball on television. But, he says, he doesn't judge people who do  drink. It's a choice. Each person makes his own.  </P> <P> Courtie took a drink once. He had a swallow of champagne, or at least that's  what he thinks it was, at his grandmother's house when he was 13. That was  plenty.  </P> <P> "It was just awful," he says. "It did not go down well. Alcohol, to me, doesn't  taste very good. If I'm going to drink something, I'll drink soda or juice."  </P> <P> There's another reason.  </P> <P> "I don't like to not have control of myself physically," he says. "I like to  have my senses."  </P> <P> And not just for athletics. Basketball might be important to Courtie, but it's  not all-consuming. He likes to be aware of what's going on in the world. Dinner  at the Millers' home is often eaten in front of the television, watching CNN  newscasts. Karen and Courtie discuss the issues.  </P> <P> Take Oliver North. At first, Karen says, Courtie supported North. Karen didn't.  Courtie says it just took time for him to understand the issue. As he watched  more newscasts, read newspapers and talked to people about it, he changed his  mind.  </P> <P> He expresses it this way: "Anytime you circumvent the Constitution of the  United States, there's definitely something wrong."  </P> <P> How does this tie in to his basketball career? Easy. It's all relative. Making  a jump shot, layup or free throw is cake and ice cream compared to what he sees  people dealing with in the news each day.  </P> <P> "For me," he says, "pressure is seeing kids on CNN in Afghanistan that don't  have any food. People are starving. People are dying every day for drugs and  money. Living in Del Mar is a blessing for me."  </P> <P> So he doesn't put too much pressure on himself when playing. He doesn't worry  if his car isn't the nicest in the Torrey Pines High School parking lot. An '82  Citation is fine; it gets him where he wants to go.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids would kill to have a car," he says, then pauses. "And a lot of  kids do kill to have a car."  </P> <P> Perceptive? Yes. Maybe impatient at times. He finds himself wishing he didn't  have to deal with the stereotype of the dumb athlete. Reporters, even teachers,  sometimes slow their speech when talking to him.  </P> <P> Those are the ones who don't know he spends hours in his room reading about the  Vietnam War. Or who were never told that when he went to natural history  museums as a kid, he would read every caption in the dinosaur section. Or who  haven't heard him describe his basketball relationship with Torrey Pines center  Kevin Flanagan as "symbiotic."  </P> <P> Until they find out, conversations are slow.  </P> <P> "I just wait for (reporters) to get going because I have to take a shower and  get home," he says. "They start off at what seems to me to be a kindergarten  level."  </P> <P> Then there are also those who assume Miller is cocky because of all the  recognition he has received. Classmates sometimes come up to him and say  something like, "Another award. You must think you're so cool."  </P> <P> "How do you react?," Miller says. "There's not much you can say. It kind of  gets to me."  </P> <P> Miller's girlfriend, Ashli Carpi, a senior at Torrey Pines, has never  understood why people think Miller is stuck on himself.  </P> <P> "I don't know where they get that," she says. "He's real humble."  </P> <P> The thing with basketball recruiting is it's a far bigger game than the one on  the court. Miller found that out during the past year.  </P> <P> He finally got to see the origin of all those letters he has been receiving on  his recruiting trip to UCLA. It was on campus, in the middle of the tour, that  he noticed the machine. There's one in the football office. One in the  basketball office. And they turn out these beautiful letters with nice type  resting under a letterhead. And they're all the same. The only difference is  the kid's name at the top.  </P> <P> "You figure there must be 15,000 guys across the country with the same letter,"  Miller says.  </P> <P> Then there are the phone calls. Every night after dinner, Miller would talk to  coaches. Some were fairly sincere, talked a little basketball, told a bit about  their program and let it go at that. Others, essentially, didn't know when to  quit. Or even where to start.  </P> <P> Sample questions. What did you eat for dinner? How's your mom doing? How's your  girlfriend?  </P> <P> "You can tell schools like that are just trying to butter you up," Miller says.  </P> <P> At the beginning of the school year, Miller was "99.9%" sure he would attend  UCLA to play basketball. The winning tradition was attractive. But when Karen  and Courtie visited UCLA, they both began to have second thoughts.  </P> <P> Courtie remembers standing in the UCLA trophy room, looking at all the  reminders of past championships. Courtie recalled when UCLA Coach Jim Harrick  came up to him, put his arm around him and said, "Courtie, you're a Bruin,  aren't you?"  </P> <P> Then came the pitch. Harrick, Courtie says, told him he could take him back to  the office and sign him right away.  </P> <P> "That's when I started to turn off to him," Karen said. "He was real pushy. It  really was kind of car salesman rhetoric. I just get (acting like) mother bear  real fast."  </P> <P> That alone did not sway Courtie away from UCLA. Jim Brandenburg did.  </P> <P> Originally, the Millers planned to have the SDSU coach over as a courtesy. But  Brandenburg said the right things. He was sincere. Courtie was sold. Karen too.  </P> <P> "There was no BS," Karen said. "He gave me goose bumps, and I'm a hard sell. I  felt Coach Brandenburg was going to take care of Courtie."  </P> <P> So Courtie signed to be an Aztec before the high school season even began.  There was some speculation as to why he didn't take the other trips. Stanford  wanted him. So did USC and California. But Courtie was certain. He still is.  </P> <P> "I'm positive I made the best decision for myself."  </P> <P> What's the big deal? Why was Courtie Miller chosen a preseason honorable  mention All-American by Street and Smith? Why did college coaches from all over  the country try to get him to attend their schools? Why was he selected to  Cal-Hi Sports all-state high school basketball team? What will this slender,  6-foot-8 forward have to offer the fans Saturday night in the all-star game?  </P> <P> Take a look back. Early in grade school, a coach recognized Miller's potential.  Renell Nailon, Miller's close friend to this day, taught him the fundamentals  when Miller played at the Solana Beach Boys Club. Nailon, the club's athletic  supervisor, saw something a little special. So he pushed Miller harder than  anybody else. Sometimes too hard. Courtie would come home and tell Karen that  Nailon hated him.  </P> <P> "I was extremely hard on Courtie," Nailon says, "because he needed to develop  an inner toughness. He needed a strong male role model."  </P> <P> And basketball? Well, Miller was taller than the other kids. He was quicker,  smoother and had softer hands. The tools were there. The polish wasn't.  </P> <P> When Miller first came to Torrey Pines, Coach John Farrell saw he had an oil  field that, if drilled deep enough, would pay off richly. Before Miller's  junior season, Farrell said Miller could be the best player in the county if he  would just play up to his potential all the time. The year before, Miller had  shown what he could do in sprinkles and splashes. But never consistently.  </P> <P> Miller admits he was a little lazy. Not willing to assert himself the way he  needed to to take charge and lead the team.  </P> <P> All that changed last year. In one tournament game against highly regarded El  Camino, Miller scored 34 points, many after he had dragged himself off the  court for a few minutes in the third quarter with a turned ankle. He came back,  took over the game and Torrey Pines won. He was the tournament's MVP.  </P> <P> This season, he did what it took to win the San Diego Section Division II  championship. A little bit of everything. There are still a few whispers from  those who see he didn't finish in the top five in the county in scoring and say  he's overrated. But the ones who count, such as Brandenburg, Farrell and  Miller's teammates, like what they see.  </P> <P> Brandenburg: "I think he has very good quickness and speed for a kid his age  and size. He can accelerate and put it into gear in the open court. He's a very  instinctive passer."  </P> <P> Teammate Kyle Armstrong: "The quality I like about Courtie's game is he sees  the floor like a point guard. You don't usually see that in a guy his size."  </P> <P> If Miller doesn't succeed in college basketball, so be it. He isn't counting on  basketball exclusively. He has seen players at camps he has attended who could  barely read or write. It makes him sad to think that basketball is their only  hope.  </P> <P> Miller, Farrell says, has many options.  </P> <P> "Courtie's the kind of guy that comes around once in a lifetime," Farrell said.  "Courtie Miller will be a success in life. I'm not worried about him. I think  he knows what's really important."  </P></p>

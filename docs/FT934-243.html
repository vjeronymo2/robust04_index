			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / US seeks to speed Nafta tariff cuts The US yesterday said it would soon begin talks with Mexico and Canada to speed tariff reductions negotiated under the North American Free Trade Agreement on such items as flat glass, foods, wine, bedding components, and big household appliances, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Tariffs are scheduled to be phased out over 15 years. However, the Clinton administration has promised to accelerate reductions for products where the Mexican or Canadian duty is substant-ially higher than the US tariff. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the US, in most cases, would request the reduction for non-controversial products. Three rounds of tariff acceleration talks have already been held under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, yielding accelerated duty reductions on Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) in two-way trade. Trade officials will give priority to petitions received by January 21. Petitions received by February 25 will be considered later in the year.</p>

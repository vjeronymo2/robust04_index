			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey's main opposition party, the Motherland Party  [ANAP], has submitted a motion to the Turkish Grand National  Assembly [TGNA] to hold a general debate on the latest  developments regarding Cyprus. The motion refers to reports  that during Prime Minister Ciller's recent visit to the United  States, President Clinton pressured her in connection with the  Cyprus question. ANAP said: It is inconceivable to accept such  behavior, which means that our foreign policy is under foreign  domination regarding a national issue such as Cyprus. The prime  minister herself must urgently clarify this issue before the  TGNA.    ANAP said the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC],  which has been living in peace for a long time, is recently  being pushed toward chaos, step by step. It claimed that the  debates being held at the United Nations are nothing but efforts  to exert pressure on the TRNC delegation and Turkey. ANAP also  charged that the government program does not pay enough  attention to the issue of the TRNC.</p>

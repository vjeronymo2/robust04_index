			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> BENSONHURST JURY SAYS IT'S DEADLOCKED  </P> <P> Jurors deliberating the fate of the third young man to be tried in the  Bensonhurst racial slaying announced Thursday that they were deadlocked over a  verdict in the racially charged case, but the judge told them to keep trying.  Appearing tired and frustrated, the jurors told state Justice Thaddeus Owens on  the fourth day of their deliberations that they could not reach a consensus on  several of the counts against John Vento, charged with murder for allegedly  helping recruit a white group that killed a black teen-ager. Both juries in the  previous Bensonhurst trial announced in the middle of their deliberations that  they were deadlocked, and both eventually reached verdicts.  </P></p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Trade News: China prepares foreign trade law CHINA, striving to improve its trading rules to bolster its attempt to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has finished drafting its first foreign trade law, Xinhua news agency reported, Agencies report from Beijing. Yesterday, the China Daily quoted Ms Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation, as saying China hoped to increase foreign trade to Dollars 200bn (Pounds 132.4bn) by 1995 and enter the ranks of the world's top 10 trading countries. It was the world's 11th largest trader in 1992 with a volume of Dollars 165.6bn, ahead of Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea but behind Hong Kong, Xinhua News Agency recently reported. Xinhua quoted Ms Wu as saying the law was an effort to develop trade based on international norms. It will soon be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the parliament, for deliberation after being approved by the State Council, or cabinet. Other laws relating to foreign trade such as anti-dumping and subsidies were also under consideration. China is anxious to rejoin Gatt to protect its booming trade, now about 40 per cent of gross national product. But it must first satisfy the US it has established a market economy that does not distort trade with unfair subsidies or secret regulations. US negotiators last month dashed Beijing's hopes of an early return to the world fair trade body by saying China was refusing to make concessions. China was a founder member of Gatt in 1948 but quit the following year after the Communist revolution. It is keen to rejoin before Taiwan, which has a strong case to support its application. The minister said China would try to diversify its markets, paying greater attention to countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States, eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Xinhua reported.</p>

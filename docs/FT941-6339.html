			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition forces radical restructuring at British Gas Sir, Your article (Lex, February 25) misses one fundamental point. British Gas has now lost 78 per cent of the firm contract market and, since August 1992, 33 per cent of the market between 2,500 and 25,000 therms. In total this now represents a loss of 41 per cent of the market open for competition, compared with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission target of 45 per cent. Furthermore, the company is prevented from defending its position because the playing field is artificially tilted against it. Finally, from 1996 onwards competition will be introduced to the rest of the market below 2,500 therms. The company has taken firm management action by restructuring the business to enable it to compete effectively in these significantly changed circumstances. Clearly the market has changed dramatically and British Gas has changed rapidly to adapt. It is disappointing that your article appears to treat a serious situation so superficially.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: King Baby - Theatre James Robson is a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's The Archers. His new play at The Pit perhaps helps to explain why that everyday story of country folk sometimes becomes so tired and emotional. King Baby is set in a rehabilitation unit for alcoholics. It is very intense, nothing much happens and it lasts for three hours. On the other hand, it is quite beautifully done. The dialogue is riveting and the length is necessary to the theme, which is that people sometimes drink to overcome boredom and without a drink time can seem to pass very slowly. King Baby works by a mixture of case studies and group therapy. There are seven characters, all but one of whom is either a reformed alcoholic or seeking to become so. Jimmy, who runs the unit, is there because his wife was killed in a car crash while he was the drunken driver. Raymond, his assistant, used to be an alcoholic ambulanceman. Once when he ran somebody over, he drove him straight to the hospital and people said how lucky the victim had been to be knocked down by an ambulance. This is one of the few (chilling) laughs in the piece. The rest are a social mix. Jimmy, the 70-year-old Irishman, says that the English think his condition comes with the accent. There are two women, one middle-aged, the other only 20. The hardest nut to crack is James King or King Baby, the car dealer who used to make a lot of money 'when that sort of thing was fashionable'. The problem is his pride: he does not want to admit that he needs to be treated and is there only because his wife (the seventh character in the play) has otherwise threatened to leave him. The plot, such at it is, hangs on the breaking down of Jimmy. He despises group therapy and at one stage ostentatiously reads the Financial Times rather than take part in the exchanges. At another he appears to be back on malt whisky until the bottle turns out to contain only Tizer. But break down he does, in the end. By then everyone has told their story, but there is a final twist. The explanation of why King Baby became so disturbed in the first place is conventionally feeble and it is not clear why there are so many references to religion when the message is that alcoholism is a self-inflicted medical disease, 'the most expensive club in the world with people dying to get in'. Yet those are small matters. King Baby as it goes on becomes an addiction in itself. Jimmy is played by Lalor Roddy; his stature grows as the role develops. Tom Georgeson's King has the occasional lapse in diction, but that may be part of the act. There is a wonderful vignette by Sheila Reid as the elder of the women alcoholics. The smaller parts are faultless. The direction by Simon Usher judges the pace with precision. In repertory at The Pit, (071) 638 8891</p>

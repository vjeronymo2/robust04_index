			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: US defence groups aided by purchases Martin Marietta and Loral, two US defence companies, reported markedly different results for the three months to June, a period in which both were buoyed by con-tributions from recent acquisitions. Martin Marietta failed to meet market expectations with a 31 per cent advance in net income, to Dollars 162m. Earnings per share of Dollars 1.29, fully diluted, were ahead of last year's 99 cents but well short of some market expectations. Meanwhile, Loral's earnings of 65 cents a share were ahead of last year's 48 cents and above what the market had been looking for. Martin Marietta's figures in the second quarter were the first to include contributions from the space systems division of General Dynamics, acquired in May. Despite this, sales fell 5 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn. Loral, meanwhile, reported net income of Dollars 55m on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, compared with Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 850m a year ago.</p>

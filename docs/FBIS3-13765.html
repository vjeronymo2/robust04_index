			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alexandria, 18 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa has affirmed that in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations  Egypt places its direct and indirect contacts with the various  parties at the disposal and in the service of the Arab party.    In an interview on the program "Guest and Issue" transmitted  by Arab Radio and Television (ART) from Rome and monitored here  today, the foreign minister noted that Egypt is a responsible  Arab state. It is the biggest Arab state and it was the one that  launched the first initiative for Arab-Israeli peace.    Musa said that the Arab-Israeli conflict has a long and  complex history, resulting in numerous concepts and stances. He  added that overcoming these contradictory concepts demands three  elements: The first is time, the second is determination and  persistence, and the third is a high level of negotiating skills.    The foreign minister pointed out that these three elements  have made it possible for the Palestinians and Israelis to reach  agreement on the Declaration of Principles. But the actual  implementation of these principles has been facing many  difficulties and obstacles.    Musa said the Palestinian issue is in the process of being  solved; the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles marks  the beginning of this solution. This also means that there are  Palestinian rights that must be accepted and restored, and that  the situation cannot continue as it has under any circumstance.  The foreign minister affirmed that this agreement was a first  step and not the final one, as the Israelis think. He said:  Neither the Palestinians nor Egypt would accept this. This  step does not give us everything but some of what we want.    He added that there are essential differences between the  Israelis and the Palestinians about the details. Both parties  maintain positions of principle on every point. He said: We  need a step that will touch the essence of the  Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and the word withdrawal is  considered extremely important in this regard.    Asked about the issue of regional security, which countries  are covered by this security concept, and the relationship  between this and the Arab interests, Musa said: Regional  security is not open to everyone. Inclusion in it must be the  subject of a political decision. Anyone who wants to be  included must make many concessions to convince the others of  its desire for peace. He added that this applies to states  outside the Arab geographical sphere. It also applies to a  state such as Israel.    Regarding weapons of mass destruction in Israel, the foreign  minister said: A resolution of this issue is a precondition for  the establishment of comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    Asked about relations with Iran, the foreign minister said  there is a very large scope for the establishment of very good  relations between Iran and the Arab states. It is possible to  have Arab-Iranian cooperation and ties provided Iran proves its  true desire for the establishment of such relations and refrains  from anything that could negatively affect such relations. He  noted that one cannot talk about good relations while part of an  Arab state's territory, such as the United Arab Emirates, is  under occupation.    Asked about the Middle Eastern market and reports about  Israeli and U.S. pressures for the establishment of such a  market, Musa said: We cannot prevent any Israeli official from  talking about this issue or from visualizing what he wants. But  this does not mean that there are Israeli pressures.    Musa affirmed that Israel cannot dominate the economies of  the neighboring Arab states, as it is not an oil-producing  country and, therefore, cannot control it and its prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China will provide  the service of launching the Asia-Pacific Satellite No. 2 toward  the end of this year, according to a contract signed here today  between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) and  the Asia-Pacific Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd.    The Asia-Pacific Sat-2 is a large-capacity HS601  telecommunications satellite made by the United States' Hughes  Company. It will be launched by using the Long March 2E booster  carrier rocket between October and December in China's Xichang  satellite launch center, according to the contract.    Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, said at today's signing  ceremony that since 1985, when the Chinese Government announced  that it was bidding for international satellite launches with  Chinese-made Long March carrier rockets, China has successfully  launched a number of overseas satellites and contracts that are  being performed involved the launching of Intelsat 7A,  Asia-Pacific Sat-1, Asiasat 2, a number of iridium satellites,  echo satellite and a resources satellite of Brazil.    Zhang said that in the past few years the CGWIC has used  multi- model Long March carrier rockets in the international  commercial launching service, and the result of market  development has promoted rocket research.    At present the Long March series can meet the demand of  various launches in the international market, including the  launching of small, medium-size and large satellites to low,  middle and high orbits.    He said the international satellite launching service by  CGWIC is a good supplement to the international launching market  and it also provides new opportunities for satellite owners.  The U.S. Government has lately lifted the ban on three  satellites that will be launched by China, a move which deserves  welcome; but it was regrettable that the U.S. Government has not  removed its sanctions on the CGWIC.    Zhang added that the U.S. Government should readjust its  present space policies, remove sanctions on the CGWIC and give  licences to other related satellites, which would not only  benefit satellite owners, but also protect the interests of U.S.  satellite producers.    Sources said the memorandum on the agreement of  international  trade problems for commercial launching service signed in 1989  by the Chinese and U.S. Governments will expire by the end of  this year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Press Release No. IP/94/425: "EU and Kazakhstan Initial </F> Partnership  and Cooperation Agreement"]    [Text] The European Commission and the authorities of the  Republic of Kazakhstan have initialised a Partnership and  Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan. The  agreement aims to provide a solid global framework for the  development of deeper relations between the two parties.    In October 1992 the EC Council of Ministers adopted  negotiating directives for the negotiation of partnership and  cooperation agreements with countries of the former Soviet  Union. In the course of 1993 and 1994, two rounds of  negotiations with the Republic of Kazakhstan were held on the  basis of these negotiating directives. The negotiations have now  been concluded.    The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will replace the  Trade and Cooperation Agreement of 1989 between the EC and the  Soviet Union as far as the Republic of Kazakhstan is concerned.    The agreement covers in particular the following  areas:     -  political dialogue;    -  trade in goods;    -  provisions  affecting business and investment, including labour conditions  and establishment and operation of companies;    -  cross-border  supply of services;    -  payments and capital;    -  intellectual,  industrial and commercial property protection;    -  economic  cooperation in many areas.     The general principles of the agreement state democratic  values, respect for human rights and market economy principles  as essential elements of the partnership established by the  agreement. The general principles also state that the parties  consider it essential for the future prosperity and stability in  the region of the former Soviet Union that regional cooperation  should be continued and strengthened.    The agreement foresees an intensive political dialogue,  including the possibility of meetings at the highest political  level. Trade in goods will take place on the basis of  most-favoured-nation treatment with a general rule curbing  quantitative restrictions in line with the Community's new  commercial defence policy. Specific agreements will be  negotiated in the case of coal and steel products and as regards  trade in nuclear materials. An agreement on trade in textile  products is already in force.    In terms of labour conditions the agreement calls on the  parties to prevent discrimination between legally employed  workers.    As far as conditions for the establishment and operation of  companies are concerned, the agreement establishes a liberal  regime with Kazakhstan offering full national treatment for  establishment and operation of community companies.    The agreement stipulates with limited exceptions a free flow  of capital payments in particular those related to trade in  goods and direct investments.    The agreement provides a timetable for the rapid development  of intellectual, industrial and commercial property protection  in Kazakhstan equal to the level of protection in the EU.    In the field of economic cooperation the agreement lists  agreed principles and areas of future possible cooperation in  the following fields: Industrial cooperation, investment  promotion and protection, public procurement, standards and  conformity assessments, mining and raw materials, science and  technology, education and training, agriculture and  agro-industry, energy, the civil nuclear sector (including  cooperation on the effect of the Chernobyl disaster),  environment, transport, space, telecommunications, financial  services, money laundering, monetary policy, regional  development, social cooperation, tourism, small and medium sized  enterprises, information and communication, consumer protection,  customs, statistical cooperation, economics and drugs.    Cooperation in these fields may, as appropriate, be  supported  by technical assistance from the European Union through the  TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent  States] programme, which finances moves to economic reform in  the former USSR republics.    The agreement finally establishes an institutional framework  for future cooperation, including a cooperation council that  will meet at ministerial level once a year, as well as a  parliamentary cooperation committee.</p>

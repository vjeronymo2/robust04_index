			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: Please let me know what Wall Street thinks about Union Carbide Corp. What is  the present health of the corporation now that the accident in Bhopal, India,  is behind it? -- Allentown, Pa.  </P> <P> A: You can always get information on the record from analysts who follow a  company. But sometimes it is the off-the-record stuff that's more intriguing.  </P> <P> One Wall Street source, who is very familiar with Carbide, says he doesn't  expect much of an improvement in the company's earnings, mainly because its  commodity chemical business is suffering along with the rest of that industry.  And he doesn't expect an internal restructuring that could unlock some of the  company's value. In short, says this source, "the management continues to screw  up." He thinks that the stock could be worth more than $40 if a restructuring  took place. It was selling at around $20 last week.  </P> <P> The only hope for shareholders may be an unfriendly takeover attempt. And since  junk bond, bust-up takeover bids by corporate raiders seem to be a thing of the  past, the only potential buyer would be another chemical company or maybe an  oil company. "Oil and chemical companies are the natural buyers, but they don't  make unfriendly offers. And this would have to be unfriendly -- management  likes its job," says my shy source.  </P> <P> There are some admirers of Carbide, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out a  few weeks ago. But for the most part, experts see a company whose earnings are  slipping because of bad business conditions and because it is still paying off  the restructuring it undertook a few years ago to escape a takeover attempt by  GAF Corp.  </P> <P> Fred Seimer, a long-time chemical analyst now with Chemical Research Corp.,  expects Carbide's earnings to fall sharply to around $2.35 a share this year  and down again in 1991 to around $2 a share. Carbide earned $4.07 a share in  1989, even after a big extraordinary charge.  </P> <P> Seimer is one of the more pessimistic analysts. According to Institutional  Brokers Estimate System, the average estimate of all analysts who follow  Carbide is for earnings of $2.67 a share this year. The most optimistic analyst  thinks that earnings could be $3.80; the most dour prediction is $2.09.  </P> <P> "The outlook for the stock all depends on a restructuring," says Seimer,  echoing my off-the-record source. "Everyone is expecting that, at some point,  (Carbide) will restructure itself."  </P> <P> Seimer says the company might decide to sell its carbon products business and  might spin off its industrial gases operation to shareholders. When? Probably  not this year -- the company needs the cash that these businesses generate  right now, Seimer says.  </P> <P> Q: I have made several attempts to check the status of certain savings and loan  institutions in my area, with no success. I started with my senator and was  given the phone number of a regulatory office in San Francisco. This office  interrogated me as to my need for the information.  </P> <P> I explained that I was investing in jumbo certificates of deposit and wanted to  be sure that I was not putting the money in an S&amp;L that was in danger of  being taken over. They told me that they could not give me the information I  wanted.  </P> <P> Do you know if such information is available? Is it being kept secret? --  Malibu, Calif.  </P> <P> A: Information as to which S&amp;Ls are in trouble certainly is being kept  secret. If it weren't, there would probably be a run on all the unhealthy  savings institutions in the nation, and the federal government would have an  even bigger mess to clean up.  </P> <P> The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, of course, has a list of all the  nation's troubled S&amp;Ls. I asked a spokesperson whether the government would  like to share that information with my readers. "Heck, no," was the reply,  "because that would make them go under. And they are doing a good job at that  themselves."  </P> <P> But there is hope. Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a Wall Street investment  firm, keeps very close tabs on the nation's banking and savings industry. The  firm recently issued a major report on California thrifts. It also does reports  on banks and S&amp;Ls in other regions. The firm has an office in San Francisco  at (415) 434-3390.  </P> <P> But the long and short of Keefe Bruyette's advice is: Put your money into one  of three large California thrifts if you don't want to be troubled by a  takeover. The firm considers Great Western Financial, Golden West Financial and  H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. safe.  </P> <P> But keep in mind that your deposits are insured up to $100,000, even if a  thrift institution does get into trouble.  </P> <P> Q: I would like to know if a bond I have, drawn by the state of North Carolina  and dated 1868, has a value as a bond rather than as a collector's item. --  Dunkirk, N.Y.  </P> <P> A: The bond appears to be worthless, according to Everett Chalk, assistant  director of North Carolina's division of state finance. Here's why.  </P> <P> When the American Civil War ended in 1865, carpetbaggers traveled south to make  their fortunes. In many instances, Chalk says, they floated bond issues for  projects that were never really intended to be built. It took an amendment to  the Constitution, but the carpetbaggers' debt was generally repudiated by the  Southern states, although some did pay off bonds at far less than their face  value.  </P> <P> Chalk says the bonds that you hold do not show up on his list of North Carolina  securities that are redeemable. But he suggests that you write to him at the  Department of the Treasury, 325 N. Salisbury St., Raleigh, N.C. 27603, for more  information.  </P> <P> Q: My dad passed away recently and my mother found in his belongings shares of  stock in a company called Cheyenne Resources Inc., dated Sept. 10, 1981. She  would like to know if the company still exists. I've searched the public  library, and looked through financial books and papers, but could not find any  listing. -- Sarasota, Fla.  </P> <P> A: Cheyenne Resources does exist, but just barely.  </P> <P> According to Robert Fisher of R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., the New York company that  specializes in finding long-lost companies, "Cheyenne was incorporated under  the laws of Wyoming and is still in existence." Its address is 3001 Henderson  Drive, Suite A, Cheyenne, Wyo. 82001, (307) 632-6437.  </P> <P> Fisher says Cheyenne's stock trades over- the-counter and is now offered at  only 1 cent a share, with no bids. "In the absence of a bid for the stock, it  is doubtful whether any value will accrue to this holding," Fisher says. JOHN  CRUDELE  </P></p>

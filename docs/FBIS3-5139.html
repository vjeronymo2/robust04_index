In a document submitted to the National Assembly, the Trade,  Industry and Energy Ministry noted that the Republic of Korea's  Constitution stipulates that the Republic shall consist of the  Korean peninsula and its adjoining islands: That the basic  inter- Korean agreement put into force in February 1992 provides  for economic exchanges and cooperation between North and South  Korea such as joint resources development, merchandise trade as  internal transactions of the Korean people and joint ventures;  and that the U.N. Charter expressly permits racial  self-determination.    When West Germany subscribed to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, the GATT recognized inter-German trade as an  internal matter of the German people, the ministry said. The  German case set a precedent for the two Koreas, and there is no  need for GATT recognition of inter-Korean trade as internal  business dealings of the Korean people, it added. Some foreign  countries are moving toward regarding inter-Korean trade as  international trade subject to tariffs.</p>

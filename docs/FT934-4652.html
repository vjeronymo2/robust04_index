			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: GEC upset The market's fears earlier this week that GEC's interim results would be accompanied by a warning of continuing difficult trading proved correct as the company warned that its full year earnings were unlikely to be substantially higher than last year's. It was that warning, rather than the actual figures - which showed half-time profits at the top end of market expectations - that produced the latest severe bout of underperformance by GEC shares. They dropped to 317p in the aftermath of the results and accompanying statement before embarking on a rally which left them a net 13 off at 320 1/2 p. Turnover in the stock reached a hefty 44m, easily the highest since January 1989, shortly after GEC launched its ultimately successful bid for Plessey. GEC shares have come under sustained downside pressure since early October, retreating from a peak 366p. 'It seems likely that downgrades in the order of 3 to 5 per cent will be the norm,' said one specialist. Previously analysts had been looking for full year profits of between Pounds 910m to Pounds 945m. A figure of Pounds 900m was being pencilled in late yesterday.</p>

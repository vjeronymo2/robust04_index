			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-STATE ACUPUNCTURE OFFICIAL SENTENCED IN BRIBE CASE  </P> <P> Chae Woo Lew, a former state acupuncture official who pleaded no contest to  accepting bribes in exchange for answers to licensing exams, was handed the  maximum five-year prison term Wednesday on two bribery-related conspiracy  convictions.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Neidorf imposed the sentence after a  two-day hearing during which a sobbing Lew professed contrition, and his  attorney's request for leniency was opposed by the prosecution on grounds that  Lew did not cooperate in identifying acupuncturists he helped license  fraudulently.  </P> <P> "It seems patently clear . . . the defendant has created a situation where the  health and safety of many acupuncture patients has been put at risk for many  years to come," Neidorf said as Lew sat leaning forward, his face resting on  folded hands.  </P> <P> "We don't know how many people are out there practicing acupuncture without  having had the qualifications to pass the exam and receive their credentials,"  the judge said. "That's the overriding aspect of this case; that is, the risk  that has been created.  </P> <P> "It's doubtful that the defendant ever thought about that risk at the time he  was taking the money."  </P> <P> Neidorf said prosecution evidence showed that Lew had been given the chance "to  right the wrongs" committed, but that he balked when questioned by district  attorney's investigators.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contended that the 53-year-old San Mateo acupuncturist, who served  on the state licensing board until June, 1989, was paid at least $500,000 for  rigging exams throughout his eight-year tenure.  </P> <P> In exchange for Lew's no-contest pleas to one count of conspiracy to commit  bribery and one count of conspiracy to dissuade a witness, prosecutors dropped  56 bribery charges filed against him last February, Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb  Lapin said.  </P> <P> When Lew entered his plea, he agreed to cooperate with the district attorney's  investigation of other acupuncturists, Lapin said.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Lew contradicted himself as he maintained that he took  money from only six aspiring acupuncturists and that he did so begrudgingly.  When Lew failed to provide information leading to other fraudulently licensed  practitioners, he was deemed uncooperative, Lapin said.  </P> <P> "The man subverted an entire profession and has refused to help correct his  wrongs," Lapin said after the sentence was pronounced. "Therefore he deserves  everything he can get."  </P></p>

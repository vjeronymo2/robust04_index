			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Half year upturn for FW Thorpe FW Thorpe, a maker of industrial and commercial lighting equipment, lifted net earnings from 3.25p to 3.4p in the half year to December 31, and is raising the interim dividend from 0.7p to 0.8p. Turnover rose to Pounds 6.93m (Pounds 6.67m) and pre-tax profit reached Pounds 630,000, against Pounds 616,000. Order intake for the opening two months of 1992 was encouraging. If that trend was maintained full year results would show further improvement, and would confirm the group was continuing to obtain a greater share of an exceptionally competitive market.</p>

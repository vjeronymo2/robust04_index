			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profits taken as turnover improves A REVERSAL of nearly 50 Footsie points during yesterday's equity session in London indicated the market's vulnerability to profit-taking after its sharp advance over Christmas. Wall Street performed steadily, and sterling was only slightly lower against the German D-Mark. But an early gain of 36 on the FT-SE Index was transformed into a loss of 10.9 in the face of a further spate of corporate downgradings by City brokers and a sudden shrinking of the premium on the Footsie futures contract. The market opened firmly after weekend press comment had suggested a slackening in the political tension which has been prompted by Britain's economic situation. The investment mood was also helped by City forecasts that UK equities will advance again this year, in spite of the current uncertainty over the economic and political outlook. Trading volume returned to more normal levels as Christmas 1991 faded into memory. The erosion of the premium on the FT-SE March futures contract in part reflected the success of marketmaking dealers in straightening out their trading books as they were freed from the straightjackets imposed over the holiday. In early deals, the market moved to FT-SE 2,540, helped by the futures markets and Friday's 29-point gain on Wall Street. But trading then became markedly two-way, with the institutions willing to take profits on some of the sectors which had starred in the Christmas advance. Gains were lost, and with oil shares particularly weak in late trading the Footsie slipped steadily downwards. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,493.2 for a decline on the day of 10.9 points. Seaq volume totalled 492.4m shares against 452m on Friday. Traders maintained that 'the market did not feel busy' but added that this was perhaps because business was healthily two-way, with both buyers and sellers able to transact their business without facing unduly large movements in share prices. A leading agency broker downgraded its profit forecasts for two major sectors; both, the oils and the banks, have been the subject of previous downgrades within recent weeks. Bank stocks were targeted because of renewed fears of loan losses in their corporate business, while sharp falls in such leading oil producers as BP and Shell reflected concern about the impact of falling demand on the outlook for crude prices. Second thoughts on the Christmas rally brought falls in several leading stores as profit-taking was prompted by adverse reports on holiday trading, which were emphasised by comments on Ratners, the high street retail jewellery group. But, in spite of the persistent worries about the outlook for domestic interest rates should sterling come under pressure within the ERM range, there was some support yesterday for a number of the construction and building shares which have suffered so harshly from rate pressures. Most of the blue chip internationals stood up well to weakness in the US dollar yesterday. But among the individual stocks to run into profit-takers, Glaxo, last year's star performer, shaded lower while Wellcome, one of the more ebullient performers of the Christmas rally, came back smartly. Eurotunnel units, however, were firmer.</p>

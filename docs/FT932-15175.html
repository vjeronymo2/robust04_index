			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / North Korean prime minister attacks 'enemies of Pyongyang' North Korean Prime Minister Kang Song-san lashed out yesterday at enemies confronting Pyongyang in the nuclear inspection crisis in the midst of a gushing 81st birthday tribute to 'Great Leader' Kim Il-sung, Reuter reports from Tokyo. In a keynote speech to a 'national celebration' in the capital, Mr Kang hailed Mr Kim's birth on April 15, 1913, as 'a big stroke of luck which heralded the dawn of national liberation and rebirth on the dark land of the country ..' Pyongyang's defiance of demands by the UN atomic watchdog agency for access to suspected nuclear weapons sites has prompted the UN Security Council to consider punitive sanctions.</p>

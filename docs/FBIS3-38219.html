The  prime ministers of Sweden and Belgium were sitting on the  platform with a select group of businessmen as their audience;  the theme was the future of the welfare state. [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Dehaene, who claimed he was speaking from a  Belgian and European point of view, emphasized that the share of  social security in national income, has reached "the highest  possible level." In his opinion, we must define the social  adjustments we deem necessary, within a European context. The  biggest challenge will be to preserve social security and to  prevent a dual society from being formed, in which part of the  population would become marginal.    He believes that the problems on the labor market must be  dealt with on three levels: A liberalization of the excessively  stringent rules, which keep employers from hiring people, a  substitution of unemployment pay by an active policy of training  and by an obligation to accept jobs, and a reduction of wage  costs, especially those of unskilled workers, by trying to find  alternative financing for social security.    Dehaene also believes that the labor unions and employers'  organizations are still too much a reflection of the situation  in the period of industrialization. This pursuit of uniform  regulations for everyone, which was inherited from the past,  thwarts the necessary flexibility.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / EC officials hold emergency talks EUROPEAN Community finance officials were locked in emergency talks in Brussels early today following the suspension yesterday of sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK government's move to withdraw sterling 'temporarily' from the ERM followed the largest assault by currency speculators on the exchange rate system since its formation in 1979. Sterling fell sharply against all leading currencies. In New York, it lost 5 per cent against the dollar from Tuesday's London close, and fell to DM2.6951, against its former ERM floor of DM2.7780. Very slow dealings early in Tokyo, as traders awaited the outcome of the Brussels meeting, saw the pound at DM2.6850. On the agenda at the Brussels meeting of the EC's monetary committee was expected to be the temporary withdrawal from the mechanism of its other weaker currencies - the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and perhaps the Portuguese escudo - all of which were said by foreign exchange dealers overnight to be trading below their ERM floor levels. The move followed a day of deep confusion on European foreign exchanges, which ended with the UK government rescinding the second of two interest rate rises announced during the day. The confusion came after foreign exchange traders in Europe seized on the uncertainty surrounding next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty to increase speculation about an imminent realignment of currencies within the exchange rate mechanism. The meeting of the EC monetary committee - which has powers to decide on currency realignments - had been called following intense talks among senior economic policy makers in European capitals after the failure of central banks' intervention to support the weaker EMS currencies. Rises at one stage totalling 5 percentage points in UK interest rates and huge purchases of sterling by the Bank of England failed to lift the pound above its permitted ERM floor against the D-Mark. Heavy intervention elsewhere in Europe also failed to alleviate renewed pressure on the Italian lira - which had been devalued by 7 per cent at the weekend - and on the Spanish peseta. In London, overnight money market rates spiked to 100 per cent, while the one-month rate neared 30 per cent. Stocks, however, rallied on hopes of an imminent devaluation of sterling and prospects for German interest rate cuts.</p>

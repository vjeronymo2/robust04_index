			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wait for Fed Foreign exchanges yesterday traded in a fairly narrow range ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee which will decide on US interest rate policy, writes Philip Gawith. Traders were reluctant to take positions with both the FOMC meeting, and the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, holding out the possibility of rate changes. Most European markets were closed for the Assumption Day holiday, and this put a dampener on activity. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5533, from DM1.5557 on Friday, and at Y100.265 from Y99.99. It finished in New York at DM1.5521 and Y100.13. In Europe, the D-Mark retained its recent strength, although the Italian lira and Swedish krona managed to recoup some of their losses of last week. The pound suffered at the hands of the stronger D-Mark and the trade weighted sterling index ended at 78.8 from 79.1. The New Zealand dollar firmed after the ruling National party's weekend victory in holding on to the closely contested Selwyn by-election seat. It finished at Dollars 0.6041 from Dollars 0.6007. The market consensus has now shifted firmly towards asking not whether the Fed will tighten, but by how much. Opinion is split as to whether the Federal Funds rate will be increased, from 4.25 per cent, by 25 or 50 basis points. Whichever route the Fed takes, it is not clear that the dollar will profit. The market does not appear yet to have shaken off the bearish psychology that attaches to the US currency. Higher rates thus seem more likely to upset the US bond market, with the dollar falling in sympathy, than to attract funds into dollar deposits, helping the currency. The spectre of political weakness also hangs over the dollar following President Clinton's setback last week when the House blocked a key piece of domestic legislation on crime. So far this year the dollar has failed conspicuously to profit from four previous rounds of monetary tightening. Some analysts argue that sentiment will turn when US and German short-term rates cross - the gap is currently about 60 basis points in Germany's favour. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said that while most policy moves under Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had been in 25 basis-point increments, there was sufficient evidence to allow a larger move. Although underlying CPI and PPI remain subdued, Mr Greenspan has called into question the utility of such figures as advance indicators of inflation. He told a House Committee recently that once 'price indexes reveal that inflation is on the upswing, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have developed already'. He suggested that information from financial and commodity markets could serve better as a leading indicator. July industrial production and capacity utilisation figures released yesterday had little market impact. While market consensus towards the dollar is clearly more bearish than earlier in the year, some analysts are still calling its recovery. Mr Mike Norman, publisher of the Geneva-based Economic Contrarian Update, said the US currency was oversold and he was advising his clients to buy the dollar during the current dip against European currencies. He is forecasting for the dollar to reach DM1.75 by the end of the year, and Y110-113. With most Continental exchanges closed, trading of European currencies was quiet following the turmoil sparked off last Thursday by rises in Swedish and Italian rates. The lira closed at L1,024 against the D-Mark, from L1,026, while the krona finished at SKr4.985 compared to SKr5.008. Mr MacKinnon of Citibank said the weekend rapprochement between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, and Mr Umberto Bossi, his Northern league ally, had provided the lira with only temporary relief. 'Investors feel that the Berlusconi administration has a very limited shelf life. They are not convinced the government intends to do anything serious to address the budget deficit,' he commented. 'The lira remains friendless and it would be a brave soul who regarded current levels as a buying opportunity.' The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 200m assistance after forecasting a similar size shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 and 4 3/4 per cent. In the cash market, rates were up slightly, with sterling three-month LIBOR at 5 per cent. In Germany, call money was unchanged at 4.90/5 per cent ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. There is speculation about whether official rates will be cut, and whether the central bank will set another fixed rate repo, or revert to a variable rate tender. The interest rate futures markets were very quiet. The December short sterling contract saw less than 10,000 lots dealt and ended at 93.19 from 93.23. The Euromark contract traded under 13,000 lots to close at 94.82 from 94.80.</p>

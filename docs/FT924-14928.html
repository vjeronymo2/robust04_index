			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Variations in the prices of Japanese cars can be 'huge' Sir, It should come as no surprise that there is a substantial price differential for the Primera between the Japanese and UK markets ('Go to Tokyo, save Pounds 2,840 on a UK-built Nissan', October 5). The prices of Japanese cars show huge variations between the low-price markets of Japan and the US on the one hand, and the high-price markets of the EC on the other. European manufacturers, too, are obliged to sell at competitive prices in Japan and the US. A survey of Japanese models in the Primera size class, from two rivals of Nissan, conducted by CAIR in February 1992, revealed the following index of pre-tax advertised prices for four markets: Japan 100; US 103; France 141; UK 153. Depreciation of the pound and the dollar have changed the picture somewhat to give a revised index as at October 2: Japan 100; US 99; France 148; UK 147. The US now appears as the cheapest country in which to buy a Japanese make in this size class, while post-ERM Britain is now marginally less expensive than France. Discounts do help to redress the balance to a limited extent when comparing the UK with Japan, but not with the US. Once taxes are added, consumers in Britain can expect to pay 50 per cent more than Japanese purchasers of similar vehicles, in most instances. The differential for the Nissan Primera eGT, reported in the FT, is very modest by this standard. In the leading car markets of the world, it is the American consumer, benefiting from bigger discounts than his Japanese counterpart, who probably enjoys the best bargain of all. If Primeras from Sunderland were sold in the US, I am confident that this pattern would be repeated.

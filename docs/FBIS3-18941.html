That is what emerges from the report for 1993 that Bundestag  Defense Commissioner [Alfred] Biehle presented to the public in  Bonn on Tuesday [8 March]. Financial cutbacks in particular,  but also questions that are still unanswered about which tasks  the Bundeswehr could assume within the framework of the UN, as  well as administrative obstacles and injustices in the course of  the unification process, have imposed a burden on the inner  cohesion of the Bundeswehr. "The motivation of many soldiers  has been impaired," states Biehle's report. Biehle is full of  praise for the Bundeswehr troops who were deployed in Somali and  Cambodia. Their selection and training proved their worth.  Their ability merits recognition and extensive praise.    Biehle criticized the political leadership. He complained  that after unification the Bundeswehr received three great  tasks, but no political direction on how they were to be  fulfilled. In particular, there was a lack of clarity about the  availability of financial resources. These tasks were to reduce  the size of the Bundeswehr to 370,000, to develop the armed  forces in the new laender, and to restructure with a view to  performing additional tasks. In view of the lack of consensus  about the deployment of troops abroad, many soldiers feel that  parliament, the government, and society are unable to provide  certainty about the Bundeswehr's future tasks. Biehle said many  soldiers found it difficult to trust politicians and their  superiors.    There was also criticism of the leadership of the Defense  Ministry. Leadership also means that one can rely on decisions  that have been made. Short-term changes in stationing decisions  that were described as "binding" have caused uncertainty among  troops. Only 20 percent of the married long-term and  professional servicemen that are being transferred would move to  new locations with their families, whereas 10 years ago the  number was three times higher. The difficult housing situation  is also a reason for this. That is why provision of housing  must be considered a "top priority," said Biehle: "A family  that is intact is an important source of strength for the  soldier in his daily life."    The report also points out that compulsory military service  enjoys little support among the young men affected by it. About  30 percent of the young men in each conscription year receive  exemptions, and a further 30 percent opt to perform civilian  duties instead. The remainder just about satisfy the  Bundeswehr's need for conscripts. In the perception of society  and those eligible for military service, the importance of  military service and alternative national service as something  enshrined in the constitution is continually declining.    People view the relationship between the two forms of  service  as a rule-and-exception issue. This is because 95 percent of  applications for exemption from military service are granted.  Whoever pursues the matter with determination does not have to  do his military service. Today, there are 150,000 conscripts  doing their basic service compared to 131,000 doing alternative  national service. Biehle called for "boosting" the  attractiveness of military service "so that military service can  be maintained at all."    As part of the austerity measures, those doing military  service have seen a 14-percent reduction in entitlements, which  means that their entitlements have been reduced more than those  of any other social group. Biehle said it was "unbearable and  intolerable" that soldiers who had previously served in the NVA  [GDR's National People's Army] and were by chance promoted while  training in western Germany received their full salaries while  their comrades in the east received only 80 percent. The return  of these soldiers to the east created a socially explosive  situation.    Biehle's report described relations between the main  branches of the armed forces as "extremely critical." With the  exception of units that are intended for deployment abroad, the  Bundeswehr's personnel and material situation deteriorated  significantly in 1993. Biehle stated that supplies of fuel and  ammunition were insufficient to train troops properly. Some  forms of firing range training such as "fire for effect" had to  be abandoned altogether because of a lack of ammunition.  Training at night had to be stopped after a short period of  time, because of a lack of lighting. According to information  from the officers and noncommissioned officers responsible for  training, at the present time, there is only half the  large-calibre ammunition needed to achieve prescribed training  objectives. Even the training of infantry in the use of  handguns was, in some cases, impossible because of a shortage of  ammunition for maneuvers. Marksmen have had to indicate they  have fired by saying "bang!" Because of a shortage of  ammunition, trainers often had to use the words "bang!" or  "detonation!" to indicate that a fuse had been ignited. Both  trainers and those being trained found this ridiculous, states  the commissioner's report. Complex battlefield maneuvers could  not be practiced often enough, because of fuel economies and the  need to save materiel. To prolong the life of equipment, all  Bundeswehr units that do not belong to the crisis reaction  forces intended for deployment abroad had to mothball half their  equipment. In the case of the remaining equipment, shortcomings  in maintenance increased significantly with shortages of spare  parts becoming apparent. Biehle reports that some units had to  wait three months for tank brake linings and some units had to  wait 22 months for maintenance work to be carried out on armored  reconnaisance vehicles. The Air Force has also experienced such  deficiencies. "To preserve the state of aircraft," pilots'  flight training hours have been reduced. Units stationed in  eastern Germany have complained about receiving large items of  equipment from the old laender that cannot be used or are in a  bad state. The situation is compounded by the fact that  soldiers responsible for maintenance have been inadequately  trained. In addition, the periods of time spent on firing  ranges by units that are not expected to be used for missions  abroad have been reduced drastically. There is even a shortage  of office equipment. Trainers have to pay for such equipment out  of their own pockets in order to be able to teach. Finally, the  effectiveness of training has been diminished because of the use  of officers from Bundeswehr universities who have been  inadequately prepared for teaching troops and are insufficiently  motivated. Occasionally, one gets the impression they do not  identify with their occupation. The declining physical  condition of young people also has had a negative effect on  training. "The discrepancy between assignments and available  resources has prompted a feeling of resignation among many  officers. Trainers rightly fear they will have to accept a loss  of authority."</p>

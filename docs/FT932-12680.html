			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola buys 30% stake in Mexican bottler FOMENTO Economico Mexicano (Femsa), the largest Mexican beverage and bottling company, has agreed to sell 30 per cent of its soft drinks division to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m. Femsa owns the Coca-Cola franchise in Mexico City, the largest such franchise in the world. Coca-Cola's purchase ties in with its strategy of buying minority stakes in bottling companies throughout the world as a way of increasing management control and expanding into high-growth markets. The soft drinks division of Femsa accounted for about 25 per cent of the overall group's revenue of Dollars 2.12bn last year. The Coca-Cola brand has about 50 per cent of Mexico's soft drinks market, with Pepsi, the main rival, having 21 per cent. Femsa is expected to separate the soft drinks division from the rest of the company when the transaction is completed. Mr Othon Ruiz, chief executive of Femsa, said earlier this year that the new company would be an anchor bottling operation for all of Latin America, and was likely to be awarded new franchises, both in and out of Mexico. Femsa took on considerable debt about 18 months ago when its principal shareholders bought a 56 per cent stake in Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest bank, for Dollars 2.88bn (after interest). Since then, Femsa has sold its mineral water division to Cadbury Schweppes for Dollars 325m. The latest divestment will allow Femsa further to reduce debt. Mr Carlos Laboy, an analyst with James Capel in New York, said the purchase was 'in some respect a defensive measure against the recent consolidation of Pepsi Cola in Mexico.' Grupo Embotellador de Mexico, the largest Pepsi bottler outside the US, recently completed a Dollars 190m stock offering to help finance its move into south-east Mexico. Femsa is also looking for a partner for its beer division, with Miller of the Philip Morris group tipped as a possible buyer. Philip Morris has a 7.9 per cent stake in Femsa.</p>

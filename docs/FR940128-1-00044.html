			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(ii) that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those operations in which microbiological contamination can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely affect the safety of the product (e.g., the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of cooked, ready-to-eat products), the equipment also be washed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sanitized at least every 4 hours during processing. Washing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sanitizing with this frequency is necessary to inactivate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mesophilic pathogens, such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella spp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , before they leave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lag phase of growth and enter the rapid log phase (Ref. 23).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Temperatures in fish and fishery product processing plants are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally not low enough to control the growth of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms and are certainly not low enough to control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth of such psychrotropic pathogens as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. monocytogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Refs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23, 78, 79, and 80). Therefore, FDA tentatively finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing and sanitizing equipment every 4 hours is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require both cleaning and sanitizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because neither step is fully effective without the other. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizing occurs without benefit of cleaning, pathogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms can be protected from the action of the sanitizer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by food residue. Conversely, while cleaning can effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove product residue and a portion of the microorganisms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizing is generally needed to remove the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms (Refs. 81 and 82).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor inspect the condition of the utensils and surfaces of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that contact food immediately after each cleaning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizing. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of the cleaning and sanitizing operations, and to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the equipment is in a condition that is suitable for further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is also proposing in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor document the time of each cleaning and sanitizing, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of the sanitizer, and the condition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Documentation of the time of each cleaning and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizing will facilitate an assessment of compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency requirement of &sect;123.10(a)(4). Documentation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of the sanitizer will facilitate an assessment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adequacy of the sanitizing operation. Sanitizers must be of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient strength to be effective, while excessive sanitizer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations can contaminate the product with indirect food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives (21 CFR part 178) (Ref. 82). Documentation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of the equipment is necessary to ensure that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined after cleaning and sanitizing to make sure that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes were done properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(5) to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that gloves and outer garments that contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the food or food-contact surfaces are made of an impermeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gloves or aprons that are made of cloth or other porous materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are difficult to clean and may serve as a reservoir for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate to the food during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing, in much the same manner as previously described for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing equipment (Refs. 65 and 83). Gloves and aprons that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition can also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> house pathogens that can migrate to the food. Therefore, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively finds that it is appropriate to require the measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set out in &sect;123.10(a)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> like most of the other sanitation measures that FDA is proposing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitary condition and impermeability of gloves and outer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garments that may contact the food or food-contact surfaces be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checked at least daily while processing operations are occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such checking will ensure that employees arriving for work are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with gloves and outer garments that will not serve as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of contamination to the product. It will also ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees are never using personally owned gloves and garments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are made of materials that are unsuitable for the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment. Proposed &sect;123.10(c) also requires that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checking be documented on a daily basis to provide a record that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such checking has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(6), the processor must ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that employees' hands, gloves, outer garments, utensils, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food-contact surfaces that come into contact with insanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objects are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before contacting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish or fishery products. Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(7), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor must also ensure that employees' hands, gloves, outer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces that contact raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees and food-contact surfaces can serve as vectors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transmission of filth and pathogenic microorganisms to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food. Filth and pathogenic microorganisms can be brought into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processing environment on the employees' hands from outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, restrooms, contaminated raw materials, waste or waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receptacles, floors, and other insanitary objects (Refs. 63, 64,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 73, 74, 84, and 85).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bacteria naturally present on fresh fish skin and gills and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the gastrointestinal tract reflect the microbial content of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the water from which the fish were harvested. Typical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microorganisms found on and in fresh fish include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enteric bacteria,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vibrio parahaemolyticus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , salmonella, shigella,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hepatitis A, and other microorganisms that pollute harvest waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 7). These microorganisms contaminate the environment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing plants and cannot, using reasonable methods, be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completely eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proper precautions, such as proper hand and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning and sanitizing, must be taken to minimize opportunities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for contamination of the finished product (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 84). Therefore, FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10 (a)(6) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)(7) that such precautions be taken with respect to hands,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gloves, garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Luton accuses BAA of predatory airport pricing: Inquiry sought into aid for loss-making Stansted LUTON AIRPORT has launched the first full-scale attack on BAA's monopoly of London airports by accusing it of anti-competitive behaviour and abusing its position. Luton airport, owned by the local authority, filed a formal complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday asking the regulatory agency to investigate what it claims are anti-competitive subsidies and predatory pricing policies by BAA to support its loss-making Stansted airport. The CAA has a statutory duty to investigate the complaint. The move could have far-reaching implications for BAA, which is expected to report a sharp rise in pre-tax profits on Monday of between Pounds 275m and Pounds 285m for its financial year ending March, compared with Pounds 192m the previous year. Luton reported a tiny profit of Pounds 10,000 in the financial year ended March. Opponents of the government's policy argue that there would have been more competition between UK airports, especially in the south-east of England, if BAA had been broken up when it was privatised. BAA owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports and its airport network accounts for 73 per cent of total UK passenger traffic and 84 per cent of air cargo. In its filing to the CAA, Luton accuses BAA of cross-subsidising Stansted's operations from the profits it makes at Heathrow. Luton airport, which is only 30 miles away, competes head-on with Stansted, in which BAA has invested about Pounds 500m in a new terminal and other facilities. Luton claims Stansted receives up to Pounds 75m a year of cross-subsidies from BAA's other profitable operations. Luton says its business has been depressed by artificially low airport prices at Stansted. Mr Richard Gooding, Luton airport's chief executive, also said Stansted had 'raided' his business with predatory pricing. Ryanair, the Irish carrier, had already moved the bulk of its operations from Luton to Stansted, while airlines wanting to operate new services were being lured to Stansted by artificially low charges, he claimed. He said Luton had been forced in some cases to reduce charges below cost to keep business from going to Stansted. Luton, where passenger numbers fell from 2.7m in 1990 to about 2m last year, wants an immediate doubling of Stansted's airport charges and a requirement that the airport should supply services only on published terms and conditions.</p>

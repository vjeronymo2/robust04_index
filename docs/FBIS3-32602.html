			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Two U.S. Embassy drivers appeared in Sensuntepeque  courts this morning to testify as the main eyewitnesses to the  death of bodyguard Crescencio Diaz Atencio, allegedly  assassinated by U.S. Major Mike Lopez. The prosecutor handling  the case thinks the two drivers' testimonies conclusively prove  that Lopez shot and killed Diaz inside the car.    The drivers testified behind closed doors in Sensuntepeque  preliminary judge Lucila de Paz's office. Legal proceedings  lasted nearly eight hours. A representative of the Prosecutor  General's Office was present at all times.    The key witness, Lopez's driver, refused to speak to the  press after making his statements for the judge. The other  driver said he did not know the motives for the crime, although  he received in his Soyapango residence the U.S. Embassy vehicle  with Diaz's body still inside.    [Begin recording] [Second driver] Yes, they arrived at my  home.    [Reporter] What happened? What did the other driver tell  you?    [Driver] He only told me they were racing. Only that. [end  recording]    The drivers' statements confirm their earlier statements  made  to the Soyapango court. The prosecutor general's office has  reported that Diaz was indeed killed by a .38 caliber bullet  while taking Maj. Lopez from Cabanas to San Salvador.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It is clear that  although the witness did not say he saw who fired, the three men  were in the car. The shot came from behind. The only person in  the back seat was the major. There is an extremely strong  presumption of guilt. Unfortunately, presumption tends to  disappear from penal codes. At present, however, the  presumption that the major did fire on Diaz is strong. [end  recording]</p>

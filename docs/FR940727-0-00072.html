In deciding whether to authorize release of official information, the deciding official should consider the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has the requester complied with DA policy governing the release of official documents in &sect;516.41(d) of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is the request unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is the disclosure appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the request arose?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Would the disclosure violate a statute, executive order, regulation, or directive?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Is the disclosure appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Would the disclosure reveal information properly classified pursuant to the DOD Information Security Program under AR 380&hyph;5, unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to 32 CFR &sect;250, or other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutional rights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information, or, otherwise be inappropriate under the circumstances?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Would the disclosure violate any person's expectation of confidentiality or privacy?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.45  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Records determined to be releasable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the deciding official, after considering the factors set forth in &sect;536.44, determines that all or part of requested official records are releasable, copies of the records should be furnished to the requester.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.46  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Records determined not to be releasable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. If the deciding official, after considering the factors in &sect;516.44, determines that all or part of requested official records should not be released, he will promptly communicate directly with the attorney or individual who caused the issuance of the subpoena, order, or request and seek to resolve the matter informally. If the subpoena or order is invalid, he should explain the basis of the invalidity. The deciding official should also explain why the records requested are privileged from release. The deciding official should attempt to obtain the agreement of the requester to withdraw the subpoena, order, or request or to modify the subpoena, order, or request so that it pertains only to records which may be released.

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Eko Stahl workers watch with little hope: Judy Dempsey visits an east German town on the eve of a decision about the fate of its steelworks Mr Joachim Wunderlich will celebrate his 53rd birthday today. But he has mixed feelings about the occasion. Had he been one year older, he would have been entitled to a generous redundancy plan the Treuhand privatisation agency is offering to those aged 54 and over and lucky enough still to be employed at Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill. The redundancy plan is dependent on the Treuhand agreeing today to selling Eko Stahl to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producers. 'These people will receive 80 per cent of their income until they reach the pensionable age of 60,' said Mr Wolfgang Ramthun, head of the workers' council at Eko Stahl. 'It is a good package. But we do not know what will happen to the rest of the workers, whether or not Cockerill takes us over,' he added. The news that Cockerill intends to buy Eko Stahl has evoked little enthusiasm among it's remaining 2,900 employees, less than a quarter of the total workforce employed at the mill before German unification. 'We have been let down so many times in the past,' said Mr Wunderlich, who has worked in the mill for nearly two decades. 'Many of us are sceptical about the latest offer, especially since the European Union, and particularly the British, will try to veto the deal, even though Brussels helped British Steel in the past. Memories are short'. The planned investments for Eko Stahl are likely to cost the German taxpayer about DM1.2bn. (Pounds 490m) In an attempt to make the mill competitive, the Treuhand will spend DM470m on building a new blast furnace. The federal government and the state of Brandenburg, where Eko Stahl is located, will each spend DM150m on modernising the cold-rolling mill. Cockerill will invest DM530m in installing a hot-rolling mill, although the Belgians are insisting that the Treuhand will subsidise a part of these investments through providing generous credit and grant facilities. 'There is simply no alternative to these investment plans,' said Mr Ramthun. 'Without Eko Stahl, the town of Eisenhuttenstadt is dead. Withouth Eko Stahl, there will be no chance for an industrial core to support a Mittelstand (small and medium-sized enterprises). Without Eko Stahl, the government will be forced to financially support the 50,000 inhabitants who are dependent on the mill for their livelihood,' he added. Unemployment is already officially 15 per cent of the labour force. Another 15 per cent are on government support schemes, with little prospect of re-entering the labour market. 'The unemployed are depressed, with nothing to do,' said Ms Birgit Pfeiffer, a nurse at the local hospital. 'Look at them,' she said, pointing to several early-to-middle-aged men walking their dogs. 'You are lucky if you see young people around. Over 5,000 people have migrated to western Germany. We have lost our young, energetic generation,' she said. It is hardly surprising that few German politicians are prepared to let Eko Stahl collapse, particularly since 10,400 workers have already lost their jobs there over the past three years. Yesterday, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, visited the mill to reassure the workers. 'He's coming just 11 days before the election,' said Mr Wunderlich. 'Every politician is trying to gain mileage out of Eko Stahl,' said Mr Ramthun. 'In fact, Eko Stahl is a political and social issue,' he said. It was ever thus. Back in 1950, east Germany's Communist party built the giant steel complex, close to the Polish border, in order to industrialise this under-developed and largely agricultural region of eastern Germany. The mill - and the town which was built around it - was called Stalinstadt after the Russian dictator. It was later changed to Eisenhuttenstadt - Iron Works City - and was honoured as the first socialist city of the German Democratic Republic because it had no churches. 'The communists made a terrible mistake with the mill,' said Mr Ramthun. 'They never installed a hot-rolling mill. This meant we had to send the blocks of steel to other enterprises to be warm-rolled. They were delivered back to us out of which we made finished products in the cold-rolling mill. 'For years the communists thought about building the hot-rolling mill. When they finally decided to do so in the mid-1980s, they had run out of money.' Herein lies the crux of Eko Stahl's problems. Over two-thirds of the mill's annual DM150m losses on a yearly turnover of DM1bn are caused by high transport costs required to get the steel hot-rolled. What the Treuhand - and Cockerill - now want to do is to create an integrated steel mill through building a hot-rolling division. 'That will cut losses and ensure a future for us,' said Mr Reinhard Behrend, head of Eko Stahl's public relations department. 'Of course the west Germans do not like this. They know we will become a real competitor. They disguise their concern by accusing of creating over-capacity.' 'No matter what we do, it is wrong. But we have to keep hoping,' said Mr Wunderlich. He asked that he not be given birthday greetings before today. 'It is supposed to bring bad luck.'</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Personal View: Return trip to familiar ground The original objectives of Britain's privatisation programme were laudable and to a considerable extent successful. They involved the replacement of monolithic state monopolies with the forces of the free market, and the replacement of institutionalised management with the entrepreneurial skills of private management. The successes were in those areas where competition was real, such as road transport, British Aerospace, British Airways and Rolls-Royce. However, the quite different considerations and results which emerged after telephones, gas, electricity and water were privatised raise serious doubts about the prospects for British Rail, which the government remains determined to include in its privatisation programme. The doctrine established earlier in the privatisation process did not change fundamentally to take account of the public utilities' lack of a free market in their products and their effective monopolies; rather, an economic model was substituted for the reality of competition. Thus, in the case of telecommunications, competition was introduced by the development of alternative providers; the inevitable snail's pace of such developments, coupled with the oppressive market-power of Telecom, made the government-appointed industry regulator the residual legatee of the dream. In a similar way, the gas regulator has had to substitute for the shortcomings of the chosen organisation, with its inevitable lack of the assumed mainspring of the process - a free market. Such substitution is taking place in the water and electricity industries. Against this background, it is clear that privatisation of the electricity supply industry was ill-conceived. Attempts to create competition were based on a flawed organisational structure in which electricity production was separated from its distribution and sale, except in Scotland. A duopoly of production was created in England and Wales and nuclear power was retained in state ownership, but subsidised by the newly liberated companies. Competition began with a big distortion, made worse by the price mechanism of the 'power pool' of the producers and their virtual freedom from regulation. But this was not the most important shortcoming of the privatisation process, for the privatised industry has no mechanism for developing a strategy of plant or fuels for the future. Since that future tends to be 10 years or more, the market process is simply incapable of recognising, much less dealing with, the problem. Such a strategy vacuum led, inevitably, to the recent pit-closure proposals which were the result of a 'dash for gas' driven by market forces, without consideration of the long-term interests of the industry, the consumer or the nation. The short-term gains were hypnotic; responsibility for the long term rested nowhere. To the surprise of no intelligent observer, this vacuum forced the government back into the role it had so precipitately abandoned. The price of the competitive pretence of privatisation is the reversion to government of a responsibility it had sought to escape. Where this leaves the original objectives of privatisation is an interesting question, and one is forced to conclude that the government's objectives of management freedom and competition have been supplanted by the Treasury's desire for financial rewards. These problems offer pointers to the difficulty of privatising the railways. Here we are again offered a hypothetical market, but with a multitude of supervisory bodies. Experience should suggest that the 'freedom' of management will be heavily circumscribed by the new bureaucracy and that a strategic vacuum - and probably a safety vacuum too - will result. Even worse, from point of view of the Treasury at least, government may find it has not succeeded in hiving off its national responsibility. For the passenger, there is little hope of improvement from the combined efforts of the various constituent bodies - Railtrack, the franchising authority, the Safety Commission, the operators and so on. Much more likely is a paralysis of decision and planning, with a built-in system for 'passing the buck'. Once again, finally, government will find itself the residual legatee of its reorganisations. I hope that it will reconsider its proposals. By all means try to introduce private-sector methods and management into the railways, but do so by means which leave management in effective control of their industry's future. Target-setting, management agencies and contracts are the way forward - not the limited nostrum of yesteryear. Lord Tombs was chairman of South of Scotland Electricity Board 1974-1977 and of the Electricity Council for England and Wales 1977-80</p>

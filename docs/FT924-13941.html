			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / People: Another rung up the Wickes ladder Bill McGrath, currently chairman of Wickes retail group, has succeeded Dick Clark as group managing director of the parent company. Wickes, which operates a chain of highly successful DIY stores, was almost sunk last year following a disastrous diversification into the timber business but has since steadily clawed its way back from the brink. McGrath can therefore expect an easier ride than his predecessor had; he will have more time to spend developing the company's core business in the UK and mainland Europe. McGrath joined Wickes in 1987 following the acquisition of the Builders Mate business, where he was chief executive, and rapidly climbed the Wickes ladder overseeing the opening of its 100th store earlier this year. Clark will remain with Wickes as a consultant helping to develop its operations in new European markets.</p>

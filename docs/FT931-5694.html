			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank and broker form Belgian futures venture BELGIUM'S largest independent stockbroker and third-largest bank have joined forces in an attempt to gain an edge over London-based specialists on the fledgling Belgian derivatives market. Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout (Petercam) and Kredietbank marked the formation of Kredietbank-Petercam Derivatives yesterday by launching an issue of 1.5m put and call warrants based on the Bel-20 index of largest Belgian stocks. The warrants should be listed on the Brussels bourse next month, once new Belgian legislation classifying the instruments as securities is formally adopted. Mr Remi Vermeiren, Kredietbank's managing director said the purpose was to develop derivatives activity and expertise in Brussels, rather than leave it to London. Mr Vermeiren said the joint venture would not launch products to compete directly with Belfox, the small Belgian futures and options exchange of which he is also chairman. Regarding Belfox, Mr Vermeiren said the exchange hoped to add an option on the Bel-20 index to the two company options already traded, at the end of this month, or the start of April. The aim is to offer six to eight options, and three futures contracts, including one on the Bel-20.</p>

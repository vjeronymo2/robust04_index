			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Gatt Deal: The people who made the Uruguay Round Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner (above), and his American counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, are both 54-year-old lawyers of Lithuanian Jewish origin. But otherwise they have little in common. Sir Leon, a former minister in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, cultivates a languid superiority that has not always served him well in Brussels, despite his acknowledged intellectual gifts and prodigious hard work. After a sticky start, he and Mr Kantor managed to put their relationship on a workable footing. Over the course of this year the two men met a dozen times to thrash out key Uruguay Round issues, knowing that responsibility for the success of the Round lay on their shoulders. Sir Leon's insistence in tackling French trade obstinacy head-on could have jeopardised united EU support for the Round and raised questions on his political touch. But Sir Leon finally persuaded Paris that he was an impartial and tough champion of European interests, despite being British and therefore a suspect 'Anglo-Saxon'. Pulling off a Gatt agreement will do wonders for Sir Leon's reputation in Brussels and will serve him well in his candidacy for the EU's top job of Commission president when Mr Jacques Delors stands down at the end of 1994. 'In the beginning Mickey wanted to look dangerous, to show he was not afraid of breaking some furniture,' says a US acquaintance of Mr Kantor, the US trade repres- entative (left). Whatever the reason, early pronouncements of this trade novice and former Clinton campaigner instilled anxiety around the world. Imposition of punitive duties on steel (though initiated by the Bush administration) and sanction threats against the EU over government procure- ment raised fears that, with Mr Kantor in charge, the Uru- guay Round was a dead duck. The pessimists were wrong. With completion of the Uruguay Round a key comp- onent in President Bill Clinton's emerging geopolitical strat- egy, the baseball-loving lawyer defined his job as securing the best possible settlement for the US. He proved a flex- ible negotiator, if a tough one. Mr Kantor and Mr Clinton have already proclaimed the Uruguay Round 'a victory for the American people' and begun the necessary selling job to Americans and their representatives. Mr Bill Brock became US trade representative in 1982 and quickly became the foremost advocate of a new trade round. He was first to insist the round should include such issues as services, intellectual property and investment, as well as traditional areas such as tariffs. This line, pushed by his successor, Mr Clayton Yeutter, not only prevailed but has resulted in more compreh- ensive agreements than Mr Brock can have dreamed of. A spry septuagenarian and competitor for Gatt's top job this year, Mr Julio Lacarte- Muro (above), could be called 'father of Gatt'. He was in on negotiations which established Gatt in 1947, becoming deputy executive secretary of the organisation at its inception. During three tours of duty as Uruguay's Gatt ambassador in Geneva, he was chairman of Gatt's governing council and of the contracting parties (members). He has taken part in all eight trade-liberalising Gatt rounds, and was instrumental in persuading Gatt members to choose Punta del Este - the fashionable seaside resort where he has a holiday home - to launch the Uruguay Round in 1986. As Uruguay's chief negotiator in the latest Round, he played an influential role in securing the backing of Latin American countries for an open multilateral trading system. The wheel came full circle for him when this autumn he was made a 'friend of the chair', mediating on Mr Sutherland's behalf in difficult negotiations on creation of a World Trade Organisation. An International Trade Organisation was centrepiece of the 1948 Havana Charter which he helped draw up, only to see it vetoed by the US Congress. Brazil's Gatt ambassador immediately before and after the Uruguay Round launch in 1986, Mr Paulo Nogueira Batista (left) is remembered as the man who tried on every possible occasion to sink the negotiations - and failed. With his inseparable companion-in-arms, Mr Shrirang Shukla, India's Gatt ambassador, Mr Batista fought tooth and nail to keep the new issues of services, intellectual property and investment measures off the Uruguay Round agenda. A lawyer described as a 'relentless negotiator', Mrs Carla Hills combined tough rhetoric with a tempering sense of realism as US trade representative from 1989 to 1993. While threatening trading partners with the 'crowbar' of unilateral action to open up their markets, she used these powers with marked restraint. While frequently intoning that no agreement was better than a bad agreement, she worked unfailingly for a Uruguay Round settlement. Mr Peter Sutherland, a pugnacious former rugby player and EC competition supremo, became Gatt director-general from July 1993. He used a potent mixture of Irish eloquence and, in his own words, 'putting in the jackboot' to cajole and bully governments into closing the Uruguay Round deal. He criss-crossed the globe to meet political leaders, key officials and opinion-formers in every important trading country. In speech after speech he hammered home the message that the Uruguay Round was essential to world economic security and that failure would be catastrophic. Governments believed him. Mr Sutherland has described his Uruguay Round role as a facilitator but this scarcely does justice to his energetic 'hands-on' approach to securing the final accord. He has also been an active champion of the interests of the poorest developing countries. Mr Sutherland can now look forward to becoming the first head of the World Trade Organisation, on equal terms with his counterparts at the IMF and World Bank. 'The Uruguay Round will remain his personal legacy to the world,' Mr Peter Sutherland said of his predecessor in the job, Mr Arthur Dunkel (above). The final package of Uruguay Round rules - on everything from textiles to trademarks - follows in large measure the 'Dunkel draft' of December 1991. The former Swiss trade negotiator was also instrumental in persuading developing countries to fall in with US demands in the mid-1980s for a new trade round and in ensuring a fair hearing for their concerns. When the talks broke down over farm trade at the mid-term review in Montreal in 1988, it was Mr Dunkel who got the show back on the road. Mr Dunkel once said that one of his qualifications for the job was being Swiss - supposedly neutral and not likely to offend anyone. Yet this chainsmoking workaholic proved a shrewd diplomat, a skilful mediator and an able advocate of freer trade.</p>

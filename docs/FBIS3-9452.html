According to her words, Alexander Vershobow expressed  satisfaction with Prime Minister Moravcik's statement that the  government would strive to calm down the political situation and  with the government's determination to pursue a positive policy  toward minorities.    The talks were also attended by Ralph Johnson, coordinator  of  U.S. assistance to the countries of Central and East Europe. The  two representatives voiced apprehension lest the interim nature  of the present government unfavorably influence the government's  economic policy and economic life become excessively  politicized, especially during the election campaign.    The Slovak deputy prime minister replied to this that the  future government would undoubtedly be a coalition one and that  some and, possibly, even all of the current coalition parties  would probably participate in its formation. Therefore, it  would be shortsighted of them to misuse economic power for their  own political aims because they would have to bear the  consequences for this after the elections. "This line of  argumentation convinced the U.S. side," Schmognerova said.    The subject of Brigita Schmognerova's talks with IMF  Executive Director William Kieckens was the extension of a  so-called standby credit to the Slovak Republic to reinforce its  foreign-exchange reserves. The extension of the credit would at  the same time be an expression of trust in [the government's]  economic policy and an important signal for other financial  institutions.    According to Brigita Schmognerova, during its February visit  to Slovakia, an IMF mission arrived at the conclusion that the  fulfillment of one of the indicators for the provision of the  credit--that the [budget] deficit not exceed 4 percent of gross  domestic product--will be very difficult to achieve. It did not  content itself with the previous government's assurances that  this indicator would be achieved by tightening discipline  regarding expenditures and proposed additional measures to meet  this indicator, which, however, the previous government did not  have time to approve.    Brigita Schmognerova did not tell the TA SR correspondent  that specific measures had been proposed. She only said that  one part concerns the solution of the deficit and another the  monetary program of the Slovak National Bank.    "During the talks, we reached the conclusion that it is  exceptionally important to achieve those indicators. If we are  able to fulfill them by other measures [than those proposed by  the IMF mission], however, the IMF will essentially accept  that," Schmognerova said.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Court case against Lloyd's opens today THE FIRST of a series of legal battles involving members of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, will start in earnest today when the High Court in London considers a case involving Oakeley Vaughan Names. The case is particularly significant as Lloyd's itself is specified in the action. It will be the first time in the market's 300-year history that it has been sued by Names, as members of Lloyd's are known. Four underwriting syndicates managed in the early 1980s by the Oakeley Vaughan agency - now liquidated - suffered losses of Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m. More than 250 Names were originally members of the syndicates, and 23 Names are suing the Lloyd's Corporation for failing to supervise the market properly. Twenty-two Names are party to a subsidiary writ. The case could bring unwelcome publicity when Lloyd's is seeking to persuade many of its 26,500 Names to increase the amount they commit to underwriting. It comes less than three weeks after it emerged that the Serious Fraud Squad was considering an investigation into a separate business deal at Lloyd's. Furthermore, civil cases by more than 3,000 Lloyd's Names involving accusations of negligence against agents and - in some cases - brokers are set to come to court later this year or in 1992. In the Oakeley Vaughan case the Names are suing Lloyd's to establish whether Lloyd's owes a duty of care to them in relation to the supervision of their syndicates. The Names allege that Lloyd's was negligent in that it should have taken action to close the Oakeley Vaughan agency before the losses were incurred. They allege that Lloyd's was in breach of its duties to Names under contract, statutory and common law. It is understood that Lloyd's denies that it has a duty of care in the sense that a Name is entitled to rely upon Lloyd's to exercise satisfactory supervision of the market. Lloyd's will also claim that under the terms of the Lloyd's Act of 1982 it is immune to any action alleging breach of duty. The case is to be heard by Mr Justice Gatehouse and is expected to last up to nine weeks. Oakeley Vaughan managing agency, originally part of a group which owned a Lloyd's broker, managed four syndicates specialising in aviation, marine and non-marine business. It was led by Mr Charles St George, a former Coldstream Guardsman and racehorse owner, and developed a glamorous image, attracting celebrities such as Mr Henry Cooper, the boxer, to be directors of its broking company. The Names allege that Lloyd's knew as early as 1981 that the syndicates were breaking market regulations, among other things by 'overwriting' (writing more premiums than they are allowed to do under Lloyd's rules). But it was in November 1982 that Lloyd's decided to withdraw permission from the managing agents to manage the syndicates.</p>

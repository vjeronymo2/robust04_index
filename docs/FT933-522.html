			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Anglo American switches assets to Minorco ANGLO AMERICAN, South Africa's largest industrial company, is simplifying its complicated international holdings in a deal that will add Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 900m) of assets to the balance sheet of Minorco, its Luxembourg-quoted offshore investment arm. The deal comes only days after the world began lifting sanctions against South Africa following an appeal at the United Nations by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo American and Minorco, said it was 'entirely coincidental' that the deal had been announced so soon after the US Congress had voted to lift sanctions. It did, however, 'flow from the re-entry of South Africa into the full membership of the world community'. Minorco will effectively take control of all Anglo American's non-diamond investments outside Africa, in particular Anglo American's unquoted mining investments in South America. It signals a renewed emphasis by Minorco on copper mining and will give the Luxembourg company control of, among others in Latin America, the giant Colla-huasi mine in Chile. In return, Minorco will relinquish its interests in Africa, particularly in the Zambian copper mine, and will issue 55m shares to Anglo American. Minorco's asset value will increase by 25 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn, but Anglo American's interest in the quoted Minorco will also rise from 39.1 per cent to 43.1 per cent. The deal gives Minorco a 100 per cent holding in the group's paper and pulp interests, Mondi European Holdings, giving it a fourth strategic leg to add to precious metals, base metals and industrial minerals. Mr Hank Slack, Minorco chief executive, said the deal meant that the company could now be seen as having made the transition from holding company to a full-blown natural resources operating company. Minorco has been trying to make that transformation since its failed bid in 1988 for Consolidated Gold Fields, the UK minerals and industrial company later bought by Hanson. Analysts, however, said the deal was only a step along that path. The group still had some way to go before the shares stopped trading at a substantial discount to net asset value - a sign that Minorco was no longer seen by potential investors as a holding company. They said Minorco still had Dollars 1.1bn of cash in its balance sheet to invest. Lex, Page 26 Minorco claims a future, Page 31</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte in demand A change in stance on Forte by Kleinwort Benson, one of the market's leading brokers in the hotel sector, added support to the stock's recent strength as the broker turned buyer for the first time in two years. Kleinwort, which admitted the change but refused any other comment, is believed to have focused on recent management changes and the slow but gathering momentum in the hotel market. Forte is thought to be on the verge of appointing a former Savoy executive to its management team in what observers say could be the opening shot in its effort to takeover the group. Under an agreement with Savoy, Forte is unable to make an offer until November 1994. Forte shares added 2 to 200p, while the tightly-traded Savoy was steady at 785p.</p>

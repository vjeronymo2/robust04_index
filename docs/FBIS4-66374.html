			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Xue Changci [5641 2490 6101]: "China </F> Completes Large Superconducting Tokamak Device, A Major Advance  That Moves Our Nuclear Fusion Research Into the World's Advanced  Ranks"]    [Text] The Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS] has now  invited 12 well-known world fusion scientists headed by  professor (Pailunbu), renowned director of the European  Community's Ministry of Research, to evaluate the large HT-7  superconducting Tokamak device China has completed at Hefei and  the research plans for it.    The experts agree that this newly-completed Tokamak is the  most advanced device in developing countries and that it will  move fusion research in China into the world vanguard. The  quasi-stable state operation carried out in this device is very  important for fusion reactors. They feel that the HT-7 device  has substantial flexibility and that this research work is very  significant for fusion as a whole and that several important  technologies can be further developed and applied in industry.  The experts approved of the completion of the HT-7 in a very  short time and under conditions of extremely limited funds.    The goal of fusion research is to achieve mankind's  "ultimate" clean energy resource and is an important topic in  man's peaceful use of nuclear energy. The hybrid fusion-fission  reactor project in China's high-tech plans is making  preparations for producing large amounts of nuclear fuel using  hybrid reactors in the next century. During the past 40 years,  international fusion research has been relatively concentrated  on high-temperature plasma confinement, heating, and other basic  questions and has provided a substantial foundation for  designing fusion reactors or hybrid reactors. However, there has  been relatively little research on how to achieve a stable state  or quasi-stable state high-temperature plasma and on its basic  properties. Thus, this research project has become one of the  realms that attracted the greatest amount of attention in fusion  research at the present time, and will be the focus of China's  hybrid reactor research for several years into the future.    The HT-7 superconducting Tokamak system was built on the  basis of broad-ranging international cooperation by the CAS  Plasma Physics Institute and is the world's third largest  superconducting Tokamak device at the present time. It has  China's largest superconducting magnet system and China's  largest low-temperature liquid helium system as well as China's  biggest continuous high power microwave system and radio  frequency system, more than 20 types of advanced testing and  diagnostic systems, and a computer and data collection system  that is capable of collecting and processing over 1 million  pieces of data each second. Its primary objective is research on  high-temperature stable-state plasma properties and to prepare  for achieving continuous operation of Tokamak fusion reactors,  which is also a question that is of the greatest concern in  fusion research in the world now. Completion of the HT-7 has  laid a foundation for China's fusion research to move to the  world's leading edge in the next century.    While discussing the construction of the HT-7 device,  China's  Plasma Physics Institute director and fusion expert Huo Yuping  [7202 5940 1627] said that a basic research achievement must be  a theory that has not been previously proposed by anyone, a  phenomenon or experimental result that has not been observed, or  a new experimental method. China's basic research should and  must be opened up to the outside world and should participate in  competition on a world scale. Only in this way can our basic  research very quickly enter the world's leading edge in the  entire field. Basic research cannot work only on attaining  advanced levels within China. High-level international  evaluations in several important fields or important projects  are an effective way to spur China's basic research work to  enter competition on a world scale as quickly as possible.</p>

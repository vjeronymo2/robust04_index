			<p>BFN     [Text] Suzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to mark the  official start in the construction of a joint land development  project between China and Singapore was held here Thursday [12  May].    Located by Jinji lake in the eastern part of Suzhou city,  the  project covers an area of 70 sq km, and is expected to develop  into a modern industrial park with modern industries as the main  structure, and new- and high-technology as the leading sectors,  complemented by service industries and public welfare services.    According to an agreement concluded by the two sides, the  Suzhou Industrial Park will be developed in three stages.    The first stage will focus on building a trunk road linking  the park with the downtown area and a 45-ha industrial district.    Construction of standardized workshops with a combined floor  space of 90,000 sq m, 1,200 apartments and an office block is in  full swing in the district, which is scheduled for completion in  July next year.    In addition, the park is building a special highway linking  the city with Shanghai's Hongqiao airport.    A number of Singapore companies will support the development  of the project, with 65 percent of the shares owned by the  Singapore side and the rest by the Chinese side.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The Bulgarian paper  TRIBUNA March 12 carried an article titled "Soap Bubbles Burst"  and "U.S. Yields to Resolute Position of DPRK."    The article said the DPRK achieved a successful economic  progress under the rigorous international situation caused by  the intensified campaign of the west to stifle it.    The article continued:    In the 1987-1993 period, the industrial output rose 1.5  times  and the average annual growth rate was 5.6 percent.    The wages of factory and office workers, the social security  pensions and the scholarships for the university and college  students jumped more than 40 percent.    The U.S.-led imperialist forces have resorted to economic  and  diplomatic pressure and military threat in order to isolate and  stifle the DPRK.    The "nuclear issue" is a typical example.    The Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency,  which has been reduced to a branch of the U.S. intelligence  service, tried to make "a special inspection" of military sites  of the DPRK.    In Korea, all people are armed and the whole country is  fortified.    The DPRK Government solemnly declared its withdrawal from  the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This unexpected, resolute step  totally upset the camp of U.S. imperialism which boasts of being  "the only superpower" in the world.    In face of the brilliant wisdom, iron will and matchless  grit  of a great general and the singlehearted unity of the whole Army  and the entire people around him, the imperialists' show of  power was shattered to smithereens like soap bubbles hitting a  rock.    In June 1993, the United States was compelled to come out to  the negotiating table.    The achievements made by the DPRK in the political,  economic,  military and all other fields serve as a source of confidence  and courage for the progressive people of the world and all  people anguishing under imperialist oppression.</p>

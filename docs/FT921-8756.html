			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax puzzle for pensioner I SHALL soon have to make a tax return for my 89-year-old mother, who moved to an old people's home early in 1991. While her flat was being sold, my mother received the full entitlement of Pounds 171.40 income support and old age pension as she had no other income apart from Pounds 2,000 in her building society. At the beginning of 1991 we arranged for her building society to pay interest gross. Last October the sale of her property went through and the proceeds went into a gross monthly income account. At this time income support ceased. Is my mother liable for tax on the income support she received, plus her pension and building society interest? Income support is exempt from tax, by virtue of section 617(2)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. (There is a limited exception to that rule, in section 151 of the Act, but that does not apply to your mother.) Your mother will be exempt from tax for 1991/92 provided that her pension and building society interest do not exceed Pounds 4,180. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

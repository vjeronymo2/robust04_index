			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ernst Uhrlau from the Social Democratic Party of  Germany, chief of the Hamburg Office for the Protection of the  Constitution [BfV], calls for the classification of the  Republikaner as "extreme right." Uhrlau told FOCUS: "Of  course, we class the Republikaner among the right-wing  extremists. After all, they are watched by the BfV all over the  FRG." The Cologne Office for the Protection of the Constitution  takes a different view. In internal statistics for 1993, the  Cologne officials do not class Schoenhuber's adherents among the  43,000 right-wing extremists in Germany. According to Office  Spokesman Hans-Gerd Lange, there are "only starting points for  extreme-right aspirations." Uhrlau, however, talks of 66,000  right-wing extremists, including 23,000 Republikaner. Uhrlau  said: "I do not understand why the Republikaner are ignored in  the statistics."</p>

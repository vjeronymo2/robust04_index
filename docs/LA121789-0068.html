			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CUTS  </P> <P> Before we begin to make the deep military budget cuts presently being proposed  by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, let us wait for the Soviets to turn their  talk and promises of peace and disarmament into reality. It would be foolish  for us to cut our defenses during this delicate time in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Both World War I and World War II started from the collapse of powerful  empires: We may now be witnessing the collapse of the Soviet empire.  Consequently, I believe we should be cautious and avoid the discredited  McGovernite policy of unilateral disarmament.  </P> <P> HELEN KNIPE  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: Reform of UK company law essential to meet present-day needs of ensuring accountability of management Sir, According to your report ('CBI and IoD attack corporate governance reform plan', July 30) both the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors are opposed to the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee in spite of their limited attempt to make company managements more accountable to their shareholders. This should be a clear message to the government that effective self-regulation is unlikely to be achieved and legislation is therefore the only alternative. Present company legislation is based on the Limited Liability Acts of 1855-62. These acts created the limited liability of shareholders, and at the same time gave them the right to hold management accountable at the annual general meeting of the company. The consequences were so profound that they unlocked the door to the commercial developments of the Industrial Revolution and brought such prosperity that Britain became the leading industrial nation. Nevertheless, company structures have evolved to such an extent that company legislation now bears little relevance to current practice. In such circumstances reform becomes essential to meet the new situation. In particular, account needs to be taken of the fact that now the majority of shareholders are themselves corporate entities and have ceased to carry out their function at the annual general meeting. Thus, the procedure by which management is held accountable to the shareholders has become nullified. One consequence has been that boards have become self-perpetuating, since invariably it is only they who originate nominations for directors which are supported at the annual general meeting by the proxies of absent institutions. Additionally, any erosion of accountability increases the complacency of management and decreases the commitment to achieving the full potential of the business. Thus, many British companies have been unable to compete effectively with their counterparts in Germany and Japan, with adverse consequences to our economy. In order to reform corporate governance it will be necessary for new legislation either to restore the authority of the annual general meeting or to create, as in Germany, a supervisory tier of representation of shareholders within companies. Coupled with circumstances in which the government had achieved its commitment to low-level or even zero inflation such legislation would dramatically improve the international competitiveness of British business. Thus, by the Limited Liabilities Act of 1855, a new Companies Act could herald a second era of British prosperity. Maurice Gillibrand, 7 Tal-y-Cae, Tregarth, Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 4A</p>

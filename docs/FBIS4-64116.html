			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi May 26 TASS -- Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze said: "Since Georgia normalised relations with  Russia, and President Boris Yeltsin and myself announced to the  world that our countries are friends and good neighbours, it has  become possible to build the republic's strong armed forces as  guarantors of Georgia's independence and territorial integrity."    The statement, made at the close of the military parade in  Tbilisi's Central Square to mark independence day, was born out  by the march-past of infantry, naval and paratrooper units  sporting new uniforms and armed with the latest Kalashnikov  automatic guns, the roll-past of armoured vehicles, artillery  guns and anti-aircraft missiles. A squad of the Su-25 attack  planes assembled at the Tbilisi plant performed aerobatics in  the sky above the Central Square during the parade.</p>

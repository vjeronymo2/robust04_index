			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Gateway chief may get bonus of Pounds 16m MR DAVID SIMONS, chief executive of the Gateway supermarket chain, would earn a Pounds 16.6m bonus if the group ever returned to its one-time valuation of Pounds 1.8bn. The management bonus scheme was published in a document yesterday after the Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing of Gateway parent Isosceles was signed by its bankers. The document said 'the operation of the long-term bonus plan may result in substantial payments to David Simons'. Mr Simons said yesterday the target Pounds 1.8bn value for Gateway, needed to raise the total bonus for senior managers to Pounds 50m, was 'totally unrealistic'. Isosceles paid more than Pounds 2bn for Gateway through a leveraged buy-out in 1989, but since then parts of the business have been sold. The maximum Pounds 50m pay-out, of which Mr Simons would receive one third, would be triggered only if all the company's debts were repaid with interest and the original shareholders began to get their money back. Mr Simons said that if that happened, shareholders 'would be so delighted they would be happy to reward the management team'. Mr Simons said it was more probable that Gateway's value would rise to Pounds 500m, which would give him a share of a half to a third of a Pounds 4.5m bonus fund. Management can also earn annual bonuses if profits exceed budgets, with a maximum bonus of 100 per cent of salary if profits are 70 per cent over budget. Large incentive packages are becoming a standard feature of refinancing deals where companies are rescued from insolvency. Mr Simons, a former finance director at Storehouse, was brought into Gateway in January to try to reverse declining sales volumes and falling profits. Isosceles yesterday published interim results for the period to November 7 1992, which showed a fall in operating profits from Pounds 102.3m to Pounds 71.2m on static sales of Pounds 1.6bn. A further fall in operating profits is expected in the second half, to give a figure of about Pounds 100m for the year to April 24. Exceptional costs of Pounds 190.6m, interest charges of Pounds 106.6m and other write-offs meant a total loss for the half-year of Pounds 306.4m. Gateway's balance sheet shows net assets of Pounds 302.5m.</p>

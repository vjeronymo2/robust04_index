			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Airtours seeks Pounds 15m in share issue AIRTOURS has become the latest holiday company to come to the market for funds to take advantage of last month's demise of International Leisure Group, the UK's second largest tour operator. The Lancashire-based company is raising Pounds 15.4m in a share placing and offer to shareholders that will greatly increase its holiday capacity. This follows a Pounds 28.9m rights issue from Owners Abroad last month, which also attributed the cash call to opportunities provided by the collapse of ILG. The exit of ILG from the tour operators' league, headed by Thomson, has left Owners in second place, through its Falon and Redwing subsidiaries, and Airtours third. Mr Peter Hilliar, leisure analyst with BZW, estimated that of the 1.5m holidays that ILG might have provided this year, Thomson would get about 300,000, and Owners and Airtours about 200,000 each. Airtours carried 720,000 customers in 1989-90. The loss of a big competitor will also cushion the decline in the foreign package holiday market: only 9m UK holidaymakers are expected to be carried this year, compared with 10m in 1990. Mr Harry Coe, Airtours' finance director, said the Pounds 15.4m would enable the company to expand without hitting the limits set by the Civil Aviation Authority to protect customers. The issue of 5m shares, at 320p each, will increase Airtours' share capital by 30 per cent. It follows the rise in the share price from 156p in January to 373p earlier this month. Before that the company had not regained its March 1987 flotation price of 180p since the stock market crash of that year. Shareholders taking up the offer can do so on a three-for-ten basis. The proportion of shares held by directors is expected to fall from 70 per cent before the issue to less than 50 per cent after. Mr David Crossland, chairman, who holds 8.2m of the existing 16.6m shares, is not taking up the bulk of his entitlement. His brother-in-law Mr Tom Trickett, a director coming up to retirement, is placing part of his stake. For the six months to March 31, Airtours is forecast to cut its seasonal pre-tax loss from Pounds 8m to Pounds 4m, or Pounds 6.5m after the start-up costs of its five-aircraft airline. For the full year, its house broker BZW is forecasting that pre-tax profit will more than double from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 13.2m, with earnings per share of 48p.</p>

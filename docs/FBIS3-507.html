By late afernoon live rounds  were being used in attempts to defuse a swell of action that  started at the weekend when workers at the Bophuthatswana  Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] joined the homeland civil servant  strike.    On Tuesday the workers took over the BBC offices and held  hostage Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Zebulon  Masilo and BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, son of the Bophuthatswana  President Lucas Mangope.    Attempts to defuse the situation at the BBC led to a meeting  between South African ambassador to the homeland, Prof Tjaart  van der Walt, and President Mangope and his cabinet, who asked  him to refrain from interfering. The Bophuthatswana government  also accused SA [South Africa] Foreign Minister Pik Botha of  meddling and inciting violence.    The offices of the BBC were occupied early on Tuesday and  Prof van der Walt arrived shortly after 9am to try and negotiate  to defuse the situation.    He was allowed to enter the sealed building and met Mr  Mangope who said he would try and sort out the situation  himself. Prof van der Walt told SAPA on Tuesday evening he had  suggested to the Bophuthatswana government that it try and  mediate with the host of disgruntled civil servants and try to  reach am amicable solution.    The siege at the the BBC ended shortly after noon when  homeland police entered the building and fired tear gas into  areas where alproximately 300 staff members were holding a  meeting. Beween 10 and 20 members of a workers' committee were  arrested. Both radio and television broadcasts were blacked out  for the whole day.    Teachers at most schools in the homeland joined the strike  and pupils who gathered at schools were tear gassed.    Health services also suffered labour setbacks in most of  Bophuthatswana on Tuesday and more work stoppages in the public  sector are expected on Wednesday.    A rally at Rooigrond outside the town did not get underway  and people returning from the area entered Mafikeng in cars,  taxis, trucks and buses singing, shouting and whistling. This  led to Bophutatswana police and the demonstrators running up and  down one of the town's main thoroughfares, Station Street, for  most of the afternoon.    By late Tuesday station street resembled a war zone with  garbage littering the streets as large, cylindical cement dirt  bins were rolled into streets, upended and used as barricades.  At least one scratchcard kiosk was used for the same purpose.    The area around the station, in the vicinity of the ANC  [African National Congress] offices, was also the scene of a  number of fires -- mainly of garbage and tyres. According to ANC  organiser Nathaniel Ngakantsi the police were asked to stop  "provoking violence" downtown. "The police provoked people by  chasing them up and down the street.    "We asked the police to leave them alone but they kept on  coming back," he said.    At one stage in the late afternoon reporters and ANC workers  saw police firing a volley of live ammunition outside the ANC  offices.    Police also fired live ammunition on the University of  Bophuthatswana campus when they went there to stop a student  protest in which the national flag was burnt. Bophuthatswana  government spokesman Alwyn Viljoen denied that police used live  ammuniion or that the flag was burnt, despite a large number of  witnesses confirming the events.    The situation in Mafikeng and Mmabatho was tense on Tuesday  evening wih a pall of black smoke hanging over Mafikeng. Burning  barricades of rubbish were placed across the road in streets in  Monstshiwa township where groups of youths, armed with rocks,  stood on street corners.    There is fear of a rightwing backlash against the protesters  and some reporters were mistaken for white rightwingers.    A source close to the Bophuthatswana government told SAPA  that members of the Freedom Alliance had already offered "to  help out" in Bophuthatswana. This could not be independently  confirmed.    A number of journalists were manhandled by police and at  least two camera teams had their film confiscated. The  government spokesman would also not confirm these incidents nor  would he confirm the high incidence of tear gassing that took  place throughout the day.</p>

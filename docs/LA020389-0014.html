			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LIONS' GUARD FLANAGAN KEEPS ORDER IN THE COURT  </P> <P> Whatever the Loyola Marymount women's basketball team needs, Lynn Flanagan  provides. The stocky 5-8 off-guard is the stable base of Loyola's most  successful women's basketball squad.  </P> <P> When the Lions require a passer who can also play defense, they turn to the  sophomore guard. When they need a ball handler who can drive the lane to the  hoop, they also look to her. And when they want points, they know Flanagan can  produce.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old, who is known for consistency, physical strength and aggressive  play, is currently in her scoring mode.  </P> <P> She leads the Lions, who are in a three-way tie for first place in the West  Coast Athletic Conference, in scoring with an 11.6 average. She's led in  scoring in seven of 20 games.  </P> <P> "Lynn is real steady," said fourth-year Coach Todd Corman. "She does the same  things every night. We rarely have a bad night with her. She's a very intense  player and an excellent scorer."  </P> <P> Flanagan's partner in the back court, point guard Kristen Bruich, says she's a  well-rounded and multitalented player who motivates the team and can do  whatever she's asked.  </P> <P> "I'd rather have her at off-guard than anyone else in the league," Bruich said.  "She's good, game in and game out. When I give her the ball, I know she's going  to make something happen."  </P> <P> The added stability has been a great part of Loyola's success. The Lions are  13-7 (5-1 in the WCAC) after sweeping a two-game series against cross-town  rival Pepperdine last week. Loyola has almost matched last year's victory total  and there are eight games left in the regular season. Last year, the Lions  finished with their best overall record (15-15) but were sixth in the  eight-member WCAC (5-9).  </P> <P> Thanks to experience, better player-coach communication and outstanding  performances such as Flanagan's, the Lions have a five-game winning streak  going into tonight's game at St. Mary's. The Gaels, along with Loyola and  Gonzaga, are tied for first place in the WCAC.  </P> <P> "I like this team this year," Flanagan said. "I think we've jelled. It really  is exciting to win after being so down. We knew we should have done better  (last year). Todd made us feel proud, but deep down inside we knew we could  have done more."  </P> <P> There wasn't, however, much more for Flanagan to do as a freshman. She started  in every game and added immediate spark to struggling Loyola as the team's  second-leading scorer (10.2 points a game).  </P> <P> She earned a reputation for aggressiveness.  </P> <P> "I said: 'So what? I'm not gonna be pushed around just cause I'm a freshman.' I  think I got a big, bad reputation last year because of that. The coaches in the  league said I was mean and too aggressive. I've always been that way, though."  </P> <P> Corman says Flanagan is just doing her job. He says she uses her physical  strength and intensity wisely.  </P> <P> "Lynn epitomizes what our team is about," he said. "We're extremely physical  and tough, and we're not backing down from anybody. That's what she stands for.  </P> <P> "She's the enforcer. There's no question about it. If there's an altercation on  the court, Lynn will be the first one out there to defend herself and her  teammates."  </P> <P> Flanagan has always believed in doing that. At Louisville High in Woodland  Hills, she was a three-time Assigner League selection and an All-CIF player as  a senior with a 16-point average. Her team went to the playoffs every year.  </P> <P> Loyola forward Regan O'Hara, who played with Flanagan for one year in high  school, says Flanagan was a tough little player at Louisville who ran over  anyone who dared to get in her way. She says Flanagan was always more muscular  than her counterparts, which is owed, in part, to her childhood days as a  gymnast.  </P> <P> Flanagan was involved with gymnastics for six years and went to the state  finals in Class III twice. Her specialty was the vault.  </P> <P> "She was always a very physical player," O'Hara said. "She's just so much  stronger than anyone else. We could always count on her then and we can always  count on her now. With Lynn, it's like a guarantee that things will go right."  </P> <P> O'Hara's brother Brian, who coaches the girls basketball team at Louisville,  says Flanagan is the hardest working player he's ever coached.  </P> <P> "I wish I had a million Lynns," he said. "She worked her butt off and she  became a fantastic player. She was our stud defensive player. Now other teams  get mad at her because they think she plays too hard, but she just plays the  game the way it should be played. She does great things out there."  </P> <P> Flanagan could have played at Arizona or North Carolina but chose Loyola  because she wanted to play in every game, she said. She didn't want to waste  her overwhelming energy on the bench.  </P> <P> "I can take losing better than sitting," she said. "I'd rather be here playing  than on the bench at Texas. Besides, it was a challenge coming here because  it's like, 'We're going to turn this program around.' "  </P> <P> Flanagan and the Lions seem to be on their way.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Amounts of Arms Sold by Russia May </F> not Change"]    [Text] Viktor Samoylov, general director of the  "Rosvooruzheniye" state company, maintains that Russia can  potentially sell in 1994 $20 billion worth of arms and military  hardware (nearly $2 billion in 1992). Mr. Samoylov has stated  that Russia is ready to trade with the traditional partners:  Middle East countries, India, China, African, and East European  countries. Also, according to him, deliveries have fallen  because, beginning in 1991, Russia went over to settlements in  cash and stopped the granting of credits to its customer  countries. Besides, Russia lost $10 to $15 billion over the UN  sanctions against Libya and Iraq. According to him, Russia,  unlike the Western countries, received no compensation from the  United Nations and the IMF for the economic ties with them that  were severed.</p>

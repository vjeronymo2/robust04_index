			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Film production gains from a weak pound THERE ARE growing signs of life in the British film production industry, largely because of the weakness of the pound against the dollar. Mr Sydney Samuelson, the British film commissioner, just back from meeting senior executives of all the main studios in Los Angeles, found evidence of renewed interest. 'There was 10 times the level of interest this time compared with a year ago,' said Mr Samuelson, who heads the National Film Commission, a body funded by the government. The commission took front-page advertisements in the Hollywood trade press, highlighting the way in which British costs have come down because of the pound's fall. Mr Samuelson provided real examples such as a two-person sound crew for 60 hours, or six days, shooting in the Highlands of Scotland which cost a total of Dollars 2,700 on September 2 last year but by February 15 would only have cost Dollars 1,917. The savings hold true for every category from non-speaking extras to make-up artists. When Mr Samuelson went for meetings with studio executives the advertisements were often on their desks. 'They like working with British technicians and they like shooting in the UK. But when it's too expensive they are prepared to compromise and go somewhere else,' said Mr Samuelson, who believes the government is now more sympathetic to the industry. Last year 48 feature films went before the cameras in the UK - three less than in 1991. Mr Samuelson is more optimistic for this year. The film commission hopes, for example, that a film about King Arthur and the Round Table will start shooting at Pinewood studios in June and that part of a new film based on The Three Musketeers will be based in the UK. A Dollars 40m-a-year NBC television series, Jewels, set in the UK, will be filmed in the Irish republic because of better incentives. The UK film industry hopes that more encouragement from the government may be on the way, either in next week's or the autumn Budget.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sea Containers expects an increase to Dollars 2.25 in earnings per share SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based cargo equipment and ferry group, has forecast an increase in earnings per share from Dollars 1.95 to between Dollars 2.10 and Dollars 2.25 in the year ended December 31 1992. In addition, the group is pressing ahead with plans to sell a second Dollars 25m tranche of senior subordinated debentures as part of an overall plan to sell Dollars 125m as it raises funds to expand its container and high-speed ferry operations. Mr James Sherwood, chairman, said the group's fourth quarter results would show a modest profit against Dollars 0.40 loss per share in the same period in 1991. SeaCon reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 28.5m (Dollars 27.6m) in the September quarter. He noted that 1991 earnings included a Dollars 0.62 per share contribution from an Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement with British Rail. SeaCon entered litigation with BR over a dispute regarding reciprocal travel arrangements after the container group acquired Sealink in 1984. Mr Sherwood said that the group expected earnings this year would be higher than last year's 'in view of our rapidly expanding marine container leasing business and imp-roved ferry fleet deploy-ment'. Improving market conditions for high-yield bonds in the US had allowed the group to proceed with the total debenture sale, after poorer conditions limited the sale to Dollars 100m on November 19 last year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Management of Hospitalized Patients Who Have Confirmed or Suspected TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Initiation of Isolation for TB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;In hospitals and other inpatient facilities, any patient suspected of having or known to have infectious TB should be placed in a TB isolation room that has currently recommended ventilation characteristics (Section II.E.3; Suppl. 3). Written policies for initiating isolation should specify (a) the indications for isolation, (b) the person(s) authorized to initiate and discontinue isolation, (c) the isolation practices to follow, (d) the monitoring of isolation, (e) the management of patients who do not adhere to isolation practices, and (f) the criteria for discontinuing isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In rare circumstances, placing more than one TB patient together in the same room may be acceptable. This practice is sometimes referred to as ``cohorting.'' Because of the risk for patients becoming superinfected with drug-resistant organisms, patients with TB should be placed in the same room only if all patients involved (a) have culture-confirmed TB, (b) have drug-susceptibility test results available on a current specimen obtained during the present hospitalization, (c) have identical drug-susceptibility patterns on these specimens, and (d) are on effective therapy. Having isolates with identical DNA fingerprint patterns is not adequate evidence for placing two TB patients together in the same room, because isolates with the same DNA fingerprint pattern can have different drug-susceptibility patterns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be evaluated for potential infectiousness according to the same criteria as are adults (i.e., on the basis of symptoms, sputum AFB smears, radiologic findings, and other criteria) (Suppl. 1). Children who may be infectious should be placed in isolation until they are determined to be noninfectious. Pediatric patients who may be infectious include those who have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary involvement, pronounced cough, positive sputum AFB smears, or cavitary TB or those for whom cough-inducing procedures are performed ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The source of infection for a child with TB is often a member of the child's family ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Therefore, parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be evaluated for TB as soon as possible. Until they have been evaluated, or the source case is identified, they should wear surgical masks when in areas of the facility outside of the child's room, and they should refrain from visiting common areas in the facility (e.g., the cafeteria or lounge areas).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;TB patients in intensive-care units should be treated the same as patients in noncritical-care settings. They should be placed in TB isolation and have respiratory secretions submitted for AFB smear and culture if they have undiagnosed pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If readmitted to a health-care facility, patients who are known to have active TB and who have not completed therapy should have TB precautions applied until a determination has been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl. 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. TB Isolation Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Patients who are placed in TB isolation should be educated about the mechanisms of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> transmission and the reasons for their being placed in isolation. They should be taught to cover their mouths and noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, even while in the isolation room, to contain liquid drops and droplets before they are expelled into the air ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Efforts should be made to facilitate patient adherence to isolation measures (e.g., staying in the TB isolation room). Such efforts might include the use of incentives (e.g., providing them with telephones, televisions, or radios in their rooms or allowing special dietary requests). Efforts should also be made to address other problems that could interfere with adherence to isolation (e.g., management of the patient's withdrawal from addictive substances [including tobacco]).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Patients placed in isolation should remain in their isolation rooms with the door closed. If possible, diagnostic and treatment procedures should be performed in the isolation rooms to avoid transporting patients through other areas of the facility. If patients who may have infectious TB must be transported outside their isolation rooms for medically essential procedures that cannot be performed in the isolation rooms, they should wear surgical masks that cover their mouths and noses during transport. Persons transporting the patients do not need to wear respiratory protection outside the TB isolation rooms. Procedures for these patients should be scheduled at times when they can be performed rapidly and when waiting areas are less crowded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Treatment and procedure rooms in which patients who have infectious TB or who have an undiagnosed pulmonary disease and are at high risk for active TB receive care should meet the ventilation recommendations for isolation rooms (Section II.E.3; Suppl. 3). Ideally, facilities in which TB patients are frequently treated should have an area in the radiology department that is ventilated separately for TB patients. If this is not possible, TB patients should wear surgical masks and should stay in the radiology suite the minimum amount of time possible, then be returned promptly to their isolation rooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The number of persons entering an isolation room should be minimal. All persons who enter an isolation room should wear respiratory protection (Section II.G; Suppl. 4). The patient's visitors should be given respirators to wear while in the isolation room, and they should be given general instructions on how to use their respirators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disposable items contaminated with respiratory secretions are not associated with transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, for general infection-control purposes, these items should be handled and transported in a manner that reduces the risk for transmitting other microorganisms to patients, HCWs, and visitors and that decreases environmental contamination in the health-care facility. Such items should be disposed of in accordance with hospital policy and applicable regulations (Suppl. 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The TB Isolation Room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;TB isolation rooms should be single-patient rooms with special ventilation characteristics appropriate for the purposes of isolation (Suppl. 3). The primary purposes of TB isolation rooms are to (a) separate patients who are likely to have infectious TB from other persons; (b) provide an environment that will allow reduction of the concentration of droplet nuclei through various engineering methods; and (c) prevent the escape of droplet nuclei from the TB isolation room and treatment room, thus preventing entry of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> into the corridor and other areas of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To prevent the escape of droplet nuclei, the TB isolation room should be maintained under negative pressure (Suppl. 3). Doors to isolation rooms should be kept closed, except when patients or personnel must enter or exit the room, so that negative pressure can be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Negative pressure in the room should be monitored daily while the room is being used for TB isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the American Institute of Architects (AIA) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and the Health Resources and Services Administration ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) recommend a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for TB isolation and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is based on comfort and odor control considerations. The effectiveness of this level of airflow in reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of airborne pathogens, has not been evaluated directly or adequately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventilation rates of >6 ACH are likely to produce an incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of bacteria in a room than are lower rates ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 50&hyph;52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). However, accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that would result from specific increases in general ventilation levels has not been performed and may not be possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB isolation and treatment rooms in existing health-care facilities should have an airflow of "6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to "12 ACH by adjusting or modifying the ventilation system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA filtration systems or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.5.a) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 53 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). New construction or renovation of existing health-care facilities should be designed so that TB isolation rooms achieve an airflow of "12 ACH.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to treat patients who have known or suspected infectious TB should be exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The air should not be recirculated into the general ventilation. In some instances, recirculation of air into the general ventilation system from such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the ventilation system or facility configuration makes venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters should be installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to the general ventilation system to remove infectious organisms and particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned to the general ventilation system (Section II.F; Suppl. 3). Air from TB isolation and treatment rooms in new or renovated facilities should not be recirculated into the general ventilation system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

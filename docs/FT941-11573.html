			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: State Bank of India sales raise Dollars 1bn The State Bank of India, India's largest state-run bank, has raised Rs32bn (Dollars 1bn) in the country's largest bond and share funding package. The bank has raised 42 per cent more than its Rs22.5bn target. The recent surge in the Indian stock market, fuelled by foreign buying, encouraged 2.6m investors to apply for SBI stock. With the additional capital, SBI will be one of the largest companies in India by market capitalisation. Its stock should be attractive to foreign investors because it will be widely held and therefore easily traded. As a result of the combined sale of shares and bonds, which started in December and finished last week, the government's stake in SBI - held through Reserve Bank of India, the central bank - will fall to 66 per cent from 98 per cent. 'This was the biggest offering in India by any standards,' says Mr R. Viswanathan, the bank's deputy managing director, who supervised the fundraising. The funds are being used to bolster the bank's capital base to make it better able to compete with other banks, including state-owned institutions, foreign banks and a new batch of privately-run banks which are being approved as part of the government's financial deregulation programme. Mr Viswanathan says SBI will now have more than enough capital to meet the 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets laid down by international regulations. SBI, the first of India's 26 state-owned banks to be partially privatised, is one of the world's largest banks in terms of staff and branches, with more than 200,000 employees in 8,800 offices. India's restrictive labour laws have prevented SBI from streamlining manpower. Nearly 2,400 of its branches lose money, but the bank will find it difficult to close them without reform of the labour laws and co-operation from trade unions. Banking unions have been unable to stop partial privatisation but their opposition has helped to convince the government to retain control of state-owned enterprises by holding at least 51 per cent. They have also secured promises from finance ministry officials and bank managers that there will be no compulsory job cuts in banking. Mr Viswanathan says that there will be 'no retrenchment' at SBI but the payroll will gradually be cut through voluntary retirement and non-replacement. SBI made an operating profit of Rs2.12bn in the year to last March, up from Rs1.75bn. Net profits, including investment income, fell from Rs25.9bn to Rs18.5bn, partly because of losses of Rs7.06bn incurred in the 1992 Bombay securities market scandal, when money was illegally siphoned from banks into stocks and shares.</p>

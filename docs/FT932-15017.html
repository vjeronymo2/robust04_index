			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts lose ground as signs of recovery dash rate-cut hopes THE UK government bond market lost nearly a point yesterday as the latest indications of recovery in the UK economy dashed hopes of further interest rate cuts. Yesterday saw the release of better-than-expected manufacturing output figures and a relatively favourable Treasury report on the economy. Manufacturing output rose 1.2 per cent in February after a revised 1.3 per cent rise in January, whereas economists had forecast a much smaller rise of only 0.2 per cent. Industrial output rose 1.6 per cent in February, following a 0.1 per cent fall in the previous month, whereas a rise of 0.5 per cent had been expected. The Treasury report pointed to an improvement in demand and activity, while adding that inflationary pressures remained subdued. Sterling remained strong yesterday, trading at DM2.4723 to DM2.4733, against DM2.4616 to DM2.4648 the previous day. Among short-dated issues, the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 fell  21/32 to 101 3/4 , while at the long end of the market the 8 per cent gilt due 2013 fell  29/32 to 46 7/8 . Dealers said the market expected the Bank of England to announce its next gilt auction tomorrow. THE Bundesbank disappointed the German government bond market as it allowed only a small easing in its repo rate yesterday, leading to a fall in bund prices. The rate was lowered from 8.13 per cent to 8.11 per cent at the central bank's latest allocation of 14-day securities repurchase agreements, whereas many bond market participants had hoped for a more generous easing. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 96.52 and, after reaching a high of 96.60, it gradually fell back to a low of 96.21, ending the day at about 96.23. The weaker German government bond market helped to pull down other main European bond markets, including France and Italy. Dealers reported profit-taking in the Italian market, despite the relative strength of the lira. The BTP futures contract fell from 95.36 to 94.90. SPANISH government bonds recovered recent losses, with the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond falling from 11.71 per cent to 11.61 per cent. IN THE absence of fresh economic statistics, US Treasury prices traded firmer yesterday after the Federal Reserve completed the coupon pass dealers had been hoping for. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 104 23/32 , yielding 6.752 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.757 per cent. At the opening, prices drew strength from buying on foreign markets overnight, but failed to match the gains earned on Monday and early Tuesday, when the market advanced strongly in response to good inflation news. The main focus of the day was the possibility that the Fed might go into the market and purchase coupon securities outright (in a manoeuvre known as a coupon pass) to bolster the banking system's reserves. In the event, the Fed did take some supply out of the market, by buying coupons with maturities of November 1993 and beyond. Although prices fluctuated temporarily after the coupon pass, the market eventually settled down. JAPANESE government bond prices rose in futures-driven trading yesterday, prompted by signs of profit-taking in the stock market. The futures contract opened at 108.29 and rallied to a high of 108.75. The contract ended in Tokyo at 108.63, but picked up again in the London session to trade at 108.68. Dealers are waiting to see if the futures contract will test the next resistance point of 109.01 soon. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.25 per cent and moved in a range of 4.195-4.265 per cent, before ending the day at 4.205 per cent. Dealers said the bond market took its cue from falling stock prices, as the Nikkei average index closed down 206.01 points, or 1.00 per cent, at 20,533.38 after Tuesday's strong rally.</p>

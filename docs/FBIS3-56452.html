			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed roundup of comments on Gaydar's resignation, </F> followed by excerpt "`From the Draft Declaration on the Social  Policy of the Government of Economic Reforms' prepared by the  Ministry of Social Protection of the Population," carried under  the general heading "Reorganization of Cabinet of Ministers  Ended in Sunday's Sudden Government Crisis. Its Essence: Will  the Character of the Reforms Be Preserved Given the Change of  Cast?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Boris Fedorov: The  Executive's Recent Decisions Herald the Start of a Change of  Direction    I understand Yegor Gaydar's decision to turn down the post  of  first vice premier of the government. The executive's recent  decisions do indeed herald the "beginning of a change of  direction."    I "had no advance information" about Yegor Gaydar's  decision.  I have not yet personally been invited to join the new  government.  <H3>  Valentin Sergeyev: Gaydar's Decision to Refuse To Join the  New Government Was Not Unexpected </H3>   "Yegor Gaydar's decision to refuse to join the new  government  was not unexpected for Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,"  Valentin Sergeyev, leader of the Russian Federation Government's  press service, stated. The first vice premier's decision, he  added, was also inevitable if only because he has been elected  leader of the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction.    Concerning the charges of some democratic parties that  reduction of the government corps is being carried out at the  expense of the reformist wing, Valentin Sergeyev stressed: "The  government headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin was, is, and will be  reformist."  <H3>  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy: Gaydar's Reappearance in Government  Was Rather a Token Gesture </H3>   Yegor Gaydar has been unable to pursue his line in the  government for quite some time now.    Gaydar really did have disagreements with a number of  government members, but he could only try to defend his  positions, since he was deprived of the opportunity to make any  decisions. In effect the situation developed without Gaydar's  influence. Gaydar's reappearance in the government last  September itself was rather a token gesture. Now the need for  the gesture has faded. That is why Gaydar is quitting.  <H3>  Aleksandr Shokhin: Reasons Cited Clearly Insufficient for  Resignation </H3>   Yegor Gaydar's resignation statement is "either an emotional  step, or a tactical maneuver. At any rate, the reasons cited by  Yegor Gaydar are clearly insufficient for resignation." It  cannot be ruled out that this could be just "an attempt to bring  about the formation of a pro-Gaydar government cabinet." If  Gaydar was really concerned by the problem of uniting the  monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, he should have  concentrated on working on this problem. In fact he did not do  so. As for the question of building a parliamentary center in  Moscow, this question should be settled with the president, not  the prime minister.  <H5>  Vyacheslav Kostikov: A Compromise Is Still Possible </H5>   The possible departure of Yegor Gaydar from the post of  first  vice premier "would seriously denude the Russian president's  reformist wing." A statement to this effect was made on Sunday  by the president's press secretary, Vladimir Kostikov. He  expressed the hope that Boris Yeltsin would not accept the  resignation and that the factors which caused Yegor Gaydar to  take this step will be removed. In the press secretary's  opinion, the arguments with which Yegor Gaydar supports his  decision to resign are "a considerable weight." At the same  time Vyacheslav Kostikov stressed that the reasons which  prompted Yegor Gaydar to resign "do not bear a globally  strategic character which would make compromise impossible."  <H5>  Ella Pamfilova: I Worked While Hope Remained </H5>   I have decided not to except an offer to join the  reorganized  government. The point is that I cannot work in a situation  where I have to answer for the consequences of decisions which  are made by others. I worked while hope remained that I could  change something. But now I am finally convinced that nothing  depends on me. I am sad to observe that the package of  documents on social questions which was prepared by our ministry  was simply buried in the government apparatus. Further efforts  on our part would be simply senseless.  <H3>  From the Draft Declaration "On the Social Policy of the  Government of Economic Reforms" Prepared by the Ministry of  Social Protection of the Population </H3>   B. Monetary Income of the Population    1. Social and legal recognition of income from  entrepreneurial activity and from property.    2. The inadmissibility of any direct state-imposed ceiling  on income earned, except for the use of the system of  progressive taxation.    3. The establishment by the state of a centrally established  minimum wage in all sectors of the economy and transition to  determining tariff rates and salary scales for employees by  means of contracts between the state, employers, and hired labor  organizations.    4. Obligatory state insurance for the working population,  including insurance against unemployment.    5. Bringing the minimum work wage and the minimum pension up  to the subsistence minimum (as the economic situation improves).    6. The protection of citizens on fixed incomes from  inflation.    7. The preservation of savings in state banks and the  indexation of these savings in conditions of inflation.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITERS GUILD'S EXPANSION PLANS GET TENTATIVE OK;  </P> <P> W. HOLLYWOOD COUNCIL REVERSES BOARD RULING  </P> <P> Overturning a unanimous decision by its Planning Commission, the West Hollywood  City Council voted this week to conditionally approve expansion of the Writers  Guild of America West Inc. headquarters.  </P> <P> About 40 people in the standing-room-only audience at West Hollywood Park  Auditorium on Monday night rose to speak before the council voted 4 to 1 to  grant an appeal by the screenwriters' union that would permit construction of  additional offices, a parking garage and two residential townhouse units on its  property off Beverly Boulevard at Almont Drive and Rosewood Avenue.  </P> <P> Final approval of construction is contingent upon several changes in design and  landscaping that would make the project less objectionable to residents who are  concerned about its size and impact on the neighborhood.  </P> <P> A City Council staff report addressing these concerns recommended that the  council overturn the Planning Commission's decision to deny construction  permits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Appeal Should Be Denied'  </P> <P> Speaking for the planning board, Commissioner Steve Smith told the council,  "The commission unanimously and very strongly feels the appeal should be  denied."  </P> <P> He added that the commission "is not shy about adding 20 items to mitigate the  negative impact of a project. We could not find any mitigation that would be  sufficient here. The fate of a stable, coherent neighborhood is being forfeited  to P.R. concerns."  </P> <P> Several guild representatives said the union must expand its headquarters or  leave West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Attorney Tom Mesereau reminded the council that the guild is "not a business,  or a real estate investment firm. We operate at a deficit." He said the guild  has been a "good citizen" of West Hollywood by making its boardroom and theater  on Doheny Avenue available for city functions, by keeping its script library  open to the public and by its members' participation in volunteer projects in  the city.  </P> <P> Before the meeting, Karen Clark, a West Hollywood resident and guild member  whose writing credits include "The Long Journey Home," admitted that she was  nervous about addressing her colleagues who had come to speak for guild  expansion, even though "I give the guild a lot of money." Clark, who lives on  Rosewood, said she feared that the commercialization would set a precedent for  the rest of her block.  </P> <P> Clark believes that the expansion is unnecessary. "I've seen how many employees  they have -- only 74," she said. "Most of our meetings don't take place at the  guild anyway. We meet at the Writers Guild Theater or at the Palladium."  </P> <P> Professional writers were not only outnumbered at the meeting, they were also  outstripped rhetorically by members of homeowners groups and residents. One  member of the West Hollywood West homeowners association called the expansion  "a cancer in the neighborhood." Another said construction would "stifle the  cool breezes and create a mini-greenhouse effect" on the block.  </P> <P> When Ethel Shapiro, a community activist and gadfly, asked audience members  opposing the project to stand, about two-thirds of those in attendance rose to  their feet.  </P> <P> After hearing more than threehours of emotionally charged testimony, council  members spoke about the difficulty of the decision. Paul Koretz said: "One of  the treasures we were given upon cityhood was the Writers Guild. The other  treasure was a single-family (residence) neighborhood. I don't want to see the  neighborhood ruined. I don't want to see the Writers Guild lost."  </P> <P> Helen Albert said she feared that, if the Writers Guild appeal were denied and  the union were to vacate its headquarters, "someone else would do something far  worse to the neighborhood."  </P> <P> Ultimately, Councilman Steve Schulte cast the lone dissenting vote, saying the  council may have erred when it initially changed the property's zoning to  commercial in adopting the city's General Plan last year. "It is not beyond us  to admit that there might have been a mistake," he said. "That's what the  planning commission has seen. We have to come to grips with that."  </P> <P> Reacting to the vote, Smith said, "The council acted for honorable reasons but  came to a regrettable decision." He attributed the vote to "chamber of  commerce-type thinking. We have one good Chamber of Commerce already. The  council may be turning itself into a second one, regrettably at the expense of  the neighborhoods. If it lost the guild, the city would suffer a temporary P.R.  setback. But the loss of the neighborhood is permanent."  </P></p>

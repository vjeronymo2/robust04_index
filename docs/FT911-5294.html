			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Dynamic duo square up for an educational test: Michael Prowse on America Batman and Robin are swinging into action, determined to transform American education. Batman is Mr Lamar Alexander, President George Bush's new education secretary, who won a reputation as an educational reformer while governor of Tennessee in the 1980s. Robin, his deputy, is Mr David Kearns, chairman of Xerox and a leading campaigner for educational change in the business world. The Alexander-Kearns team is unusually talented by the low standards of the US public sector. Mr Alexander actually sounds intelligent on television; with fewer brains he might make a Republican presidential candidate. Mr Kearns is one of only a handful of top US executives to take a senior post in an unfashionable department. An educationalist who knows both men says their 'silky-smooth exteriors hide aggressive, action-oriented personalities'. Both have shown a long-term interest in education; both are used to getting their way. But can they deliver results that will justify Mr Bush's claim to be the 'education president'? Their headaches include: Egregiously low average levels of achievement. Two-thirds of high school students cannot place the American Civil War within the correct half-century. The average mathematical attainment of Japanese pupils exceeds that of the top 5 per cent of US students. Low calibre of teachers. Four-fifths of science teachers did not major in science at college. According to Mr Albert Shanker, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a third of physics teachers never took a course in physics, not even in high school. Bureaucratic school districts. Mr Denis Doyle of the Hudson Institute says as much as 40 per cent of total educational expenditure is absorbed in non-instructional overheads and bloated administration. Schools are big (4,000 pupils is not uncommon), impersonal and inflexible. High drop-out rates. The overall drop-out rate is about 28 per cent. But in inner cities and among minorities, it is much higher. (Some drop-outs subsequently pass a high school equivalency examination at college but this does not excuse schools' initial failure to motivate them.) Alexander and Kearns will unveil their strategy for reviving US schools shortly. It is expected to focus on two themes: choice and accountability. Choice is a shorthand for policies which encourage greater competition between schools. During the 1980s, many reformers became convinced that schools performed poorly because they had captive markets. Several states are already promoting greater competition. Liberal Minnesota, allows parents to cross district boundaries and choose any public school in the state. But radicals want to go much further. Allowing parents to choose freely is of limited significance, they say, if all schools are controlled by bureaucratic school districts. Reformers such as Mr John Chubb at the Brookings Institution want different groups to be able to compete for the right to run public schools. Mr Alexander, who has spoken of the need to 'reinvent the public school', appears to favour such radicalism. Accountability is a codeword for an even more controversial idea: national tests. The US, alone among industrialised countries, lacks a comprehensive examination system. There is nothing comparable with the French baccalaureat, the British A-level or the German Abitur. The few tests that are used, for example for college entry, are typically of multiple-choice format, and designed to measure aptitude rather than achievement. Like US television, they consist of lots of items, none of which warrants more than a few seconds' attention. Reformers are beginning to recognise that the failure to test properly lies at the heart of educational problems in the US. Mr Bush has set some ambitious (and improbable) goals, such as that US students should be 'first in the world in math and science by 2000'. But how will the US know if it is gaining ground on Japan unless it introduces a decent examination system? And how can greater choice help to raise standards if parents lack objective information about schools' attainment levels? National tests are common sense. But that will not stop them being violently opposed, for example, as an infringement of individual liberties. Plans for greater choice are less threatening. But faith in them may be misplaced. If competition is so important, why has it has played only a minor role in other countries? The biggest difference between the US and educationally more successful countries lies not in structure (most systems are bureaucratic) but in simple things such as effort and discipline. Children attend school for 180 days a year in the US compared with 243 in Japan and about 230 in Germany. US students do only three-and-a-half hours' homework a week. And they avoid difficult courses: many do little maths and science; almost none masters a foreign language. The arrival of the Alexander-Kearns team augurs well: it suggests that the Bush administration, at last, is serious about educational reform. But, like the Batman and Robin of Gotham City, this dynamic duo will often appear to face impossible odds. Ironically, the biggest roadblock is the US Constitution. Powers not specifically granted to federal government are reserved for the states. Education is one such power. State and local government provide 95 per cent of the funds for education. Washington is largely impotent. It cannot enforce greater competition, impose national tests or lengthen the school year. What it can do is preach eloquently and hope against hope that somebody out there is listening.</p>

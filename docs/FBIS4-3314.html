			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xia Haitao, Song Bingheng, Liu Shun] </F>   [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak hoped the year of 1994 will be a year of peace in the  Middle East.    He spoke of the aspiration in an interview Monday [18 April]  with resident Chinese journalists in Cairo prior to his visit to  China.    The Middle East cannot afford to remain always in a state of  war, for war is not the solution, peace is the only choice, the  Madrid peace conference is deemed as a historic turn in boosting  the Middle East peace march, he said.    Throughout the two years of difficult, sometimes faltering,  talks, all parties concerned have unanimously expressed their  will to opt for peace, overcome all obstacles and rebuild  long-lost confidence, Mubarak noted.    The Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached  last September is undoubtedly an important landmark, which has  brought together all the parties concerned close to an  acceptable peaceful settlement, Mubarak said.    This settlement will bring the Palestinian issue to the  threshold of a new phase in which self-rule will be realized by  the start of interim arrangements and negotiations on the final  status of the occupied territories, he added.    With the same level of importance, there have been serious  negotiations along the Syrian-Israeli, Lebanese-Israeli and  Jordanian-Israeli tracks. This reflects an obvious political  will on the part of parties concerned that the best means to  reach agreement is through dialogue and mutual acceptance, he  said.    Mubarak said a resolution of the conflict between Syria and  Israel needs a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan  Heights.    Mubarak said Egypt has been committed consistently to the  strategy of peace based on justice. The Egyptian role started  years before the Madrid peace conference and has continued till  now since Egypt enjoys the trust of all the concerned parties in  the peace process and has direct contacts with both regional and  international leaders.    Egypt is the only Arab country that has diplomatic relations  with Israel and maintains good relationship with the Arab  parties involved in the Arab-Israeli negotiations. It has  received leading officials of the parties to the conflict  regularly to narrow gaps of differences.    Establishing comprehensive peace in the Middle East region  is  a great historic contribution to the peace and stability in the  world, concluded the Egyptian president.</p>

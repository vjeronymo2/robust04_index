			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU eases 'mad cow' curbs on British beef The European Commission's veterinary committee yesterday lifted restrictions on some beef exports from the UK which were introduced in July because of fears about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or 'mad cow disease'. Farmers welcomed the move as it eases controls on the most lucrative section of the export market for prime beef. The vets decided producers no longer needed to certify that animals born in the UK after January 1 1992 had not been in herds affected by BSE if they wanted to export carcass meat. Rules introduced in July at the insistence of the Germans forced producers to go on a time-consuming search for the history of the animals they were selling to ensure they had not been in herds affected by BSE in the previous six years. Since 1992 the incidence of BSE in the UK has declined to a rate naturally occurring in most European Union countries, so animals born after that date are unlikely to be affected. 'The change in the rules is a considerable alleviation of a bureaucratic burden for many farmers and should be a welcome boost for the beef export market,' said an official at the National Farmers' Union. The easing of restrictions affects around a third of carcass beef exports. And as the meat comes from prime beef cattle it is the highest-value part of the market. Most beef exported to EU countries is from old cows, which will still be subject to the rules. There was a drop off in prime beef exports from Britain following the imposition of the new rules.</p>

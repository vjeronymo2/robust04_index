			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 June, the office of the provincial party  committee and the office of the provincial government issued a  notice on halting the abuse of power by party and government  organs and their working personnel in making use of enterprises'  finance without compensation.    It has been decided that from June to October this year, the  problem of party and government organs at all levels throughout  the province and their working personnel making use of  enterprises' finance without compensation will be dealt with  seriously in four stages.

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Michaelmas Term cases THE VERACRUZ I (FT, November 19) A contract of sale of a vessel stipulated its delivery in inspection condition on a specified date, but repairs were necessary and the seller was unable to deliver on the due date. In the ensuing arbitration the buyer was concerned that the purchase price paid in London would be the seller's only asset within the jurisdiction. He applied ex parte for a Mareva injunction restraining the seller from dealing with the price payable on delivery so that the order was not to come into effect until after delivery and payment. The seller applied to discharge the injunction on the ground, inter alia, that until delivery the buyer had no cause of action for defective condition. Allowing the appeal in part, the Court of Appeal stated it was firmly established by principle that the right to an interlocutory injunction was dependent on a pre-existing cause of action. HALLS vs O'DELL (FT, November 20) In 1981 liquidators of a company first intimated that they might have a claim against its directors for misfeasance but they were only ready to proceed with the action in 1983. Originating summonses under section 333 of the Companies Act 1948 were taken out in 1985. At first instance the directors succeeded in their application for striking out for want of prosecution. Allowing the liquidators' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that there were many cases where the plaintiff had a choice and might initiate proceedings by writ or originating summons. There were other cases where it might be fortuitous whether a particular claim was made by summons or originating summons. Further, the test for dismissal for want of prosecution was the same as for ordinary actions, namely whether there had been an 'inordinate and inexcusable delay' so as to prejudice the fair trial of the defendant. No such causal link had been established in this case. IN RE A COMPANY, EX PARTE ND PRITCHARD (FT, November 22) The petitioners in a winding-up were members of three Lloyd's syndicates who claimed the company owed them Pounds 59,911 on a treaty of reinsurance. The company claimed that presentation of the winding up petition was an abuse of process because the indebtedness was disputed in good faith on substantial grounds. The treaty provided that books should 'be open to the inspection of an authorised representative of the reinsurers at any reasonable time during the continuance of this reinsurance or any liability hereunder'. Similarly, the notice of loss clause provided that all papers in connection with a claim should be 'at the disposal of the reinsurers on this insurance or parties designated by them for inspection'. The syndicate managers, however, wrote saying that there were claims unpaid and that no inspection would be allowed until payment had been received while the company was not willing to pay until it had been given the opportunity to inspect. Granting an ex parte injunction to restrain the winding-up of the company, Hoffmann J stated that it would be unfair to allow the syndicates to enforce their claim by a winding-up petition when they had flatly refused to allow any inspection at all. NEW HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE CO AND OTHERS v STRABAUG BAU AND OTHERS (FT, November 26) Three companies, two German and one Austrian, which formed a joint venture for the construction of an international airport in Iraq were collectively insured with the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs avoided the policy when subsidence occurred to the building and sought to issue writs on the defendants out of the jurisdiction. At first instance, they were prevented from so doing on the ground that, under section 3 of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments, 'matters relating to insurance' could only be brought in the courts where the defendants were domiciled. Dismissing the plaintiffs' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that member states had already attempted to limit the definition of 'matters relating to insurance' but had been unable to find a suitable demarcation line. For the court to draw a line would be to carry purposive construction far beyond any previous European court decision. WELSH DEVELOPMENT AGENCY v EXPORT FINANCE CO LTD (FT, November 27) Exfinco authorised a company, Parrot, to sell goods on its behalf as agent to overseas buyers. The plaintiff, the WDA, guaranteed Parrot's obligations to Exfinco and Parrot's counter-indemnity to the WDA was secured by debenture. When Parrot ceased trading, the issue was whether the WDA's receivers or Exfinco were entitled to sums payable by overseas buyers of the goods that Parrot had exported. Allowing Exfinco's appeal against a decision that the WDA was entitled under its debenture to those sums, the Court of Appeal stated that on termination, by clause 9 of the operating procedures, all amounts owed by overseas buyers became immediately due for payment by Parrot to Exfinco, and any payment received from buyers into the collection accounts after Exfinco had been fully repaid would be refunded to Parrot. Clause 9 was plainly drawn on the basis that moneys were owed to Exfinco by the buyers, because Exfinco had acted throughout as Parrot's undisclosed principal. IN RE THE ERAS EIL APPEALS (FT, November 29) A group of companies in the UK, Clarksons, had decided on a new way to write environmental impairment liability insurance (EIL). Risk-rating, underwriting and claims-handling were dealt with by participants in the pool, which was led by Scor, a French company. The pool was a disaster for all concerned and litigation ensued on both sides of the Atlantic. All the claims were derivative in the sense that they were not due to the initiative of the claimants but in response to allegations made against them by others. The defendants appealed against a first instance decision granting leave to serve the derivative claims out of the jurisdiction. Dismissing their appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that in the interests of justice the whole affair should be explored before the same tribunal. Clarksons were the organisers of the scheme and remained at the heart of it, however much of the day-to-day work was executed abroad. Only by bringing the principal players together could the responsibility for the disaster be ascertained and distributed between those concerned. GALLIC LEASING LTD v COBURN (HM INSPECTOR OF TAXES) (FT, December 3) Gallic Leasing was a member of a group of companies and it was assessed to corporation tax for the period ending March 31 1982. On October 31 it appealed the assessment and applied to postpone payment on the ground that 'profits will be covered by group relief'. Thereafter its accountants sent a computation of the assessable income submitted 'subject to group relief'. The general commissioners upheld the inspector that the references to group relief in the notice of appeal, in the note on the accounts, and in the accountants' computation, did not constitute a valid claim to group relief. Mr Justice Vinelott allowed Gallic Leasing's appeal, holding that in order to make a valid claim to group relief all that was required was for the claimant company to make it clear that a claim was being made. Allowing Gallic's appeal against a Court of Appeal decision in the commissioners' favour, the House of Lords stated that allowance was permitted 'on the making of a claim' under section 258(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 but the provision said nothing about the procedure for making a claim. OVERSEAS UNION INSURANCES LTD AND OTHERS v INCORPORATED GENERAL INSURANCE (FT, December 4) The seven plaintiff insurance companies instituted proceedings against a South African insurance company, for money allegedly due under reinsurance contracts. The contracts were identified by description and period and the affidavit identified the five contracts and exhibited the cover notes. They asserted an express or implied term of the contracts that premiums and claims should be paid in London, and that demands for payment had been made without satisfactory answers. At first instance, the writ outside the jurisdiction was set aside on the ground inter alia that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a good arguable claim. Allowing the plaintiffs' appeal against that decision, the Court of Appeal stated the plaintiffs had produced evidence that they were contracting parties and that monies were due which was sufficient. With regard to the alleged illegality issue set up by the defendant, it was not enough to conclude that there was a prima facie case of illegality; there would have to be grounds to conclude a strong probability that the offences had been committed.</p>

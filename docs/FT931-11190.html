			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Social dumping - hardly an open and shut case: The arguments about switching jobs between countries are not so simple THOMSON Consumer Electronics, the state-owned French group, last year rationalised its European operations by closing its Ferguson television plant in Gosport, southern England, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. The event scarcely merited a mention at the time on either side of the Channel. But some British trade unionists are now recalling it, as the acrimonious dispute over the transfer of work from Hoover's plant in eastern France to Scotland rumbles on. This sort of cross-channel sniping reflects how completely relations between British and French unions have broken down. But it also illustrates the difficulty facing unions in dealing with the ebb and flow of jobs across the European Community as a wave of recession-induced restructuring begins. Following the British opt-out from the Maastricht social chapter, and the subsequent devaluation of sterling, many continental European workers and politicians fear that capital will be sucked into the 'Hong-Kong of Europe' at their expense. The propaganda material of Britain's inward investment agencies certainly stresses the relative freedom of Britain's 'hire and fire' workplace culture and the relatively low labour costs. But the reality is that neither the opt-out nor the devaluation were factors in Hoover's decision to shift some jobs to Scotland. Britain has always had a relatively unregulated labour market which used to be qualified by strong trade unions, now considerably weakened. British wages are also low by EC standards, but the real advantage enjoyed by the UK is low non-wage labour costs. These are usually about 15 per cent of wage costs compared with more than 50 per cent in many other EC countries. That is partly because the UK pays for health care through general taxation while employers have to bear a large part of health care costs in several continental countries. This clearly was just one factor in Hoover's decision but it is not something that the social chapter directly affects. Mr William Foust, president of Hoover Europe, said yesterday that non-wage labour costs of only 10 per cent in Scotland, compared with 45 per cent in France, was a factor in the company's decision. But the decision was also influenced by the fact that the Scottish plant had spare capacity. Hoover's decision is unlikely to herald any significant increase in Britain's comparative advantage. It is based on long-established factors which Hoover, a particularly footloose US investor in Europe, has often found attractive in the past. Britain has always been the most popular destination for new international investment within the EC (see chart) and that has not changed markedly in recent years. Until German car workers started to worry about the Japanese car industry investing in Britain, new international investment had not been the source of much tension, and is unlikely to be much of an issue over coming years as that new investment will not be plentiful. On 'beggar-my-neighbour' industrial restructuring within the EC, where one country loses jobs and another gains them, things are more complex. But as the Thomson Electronics case illustrates, Britain has often lost out in such restructuring precisely because it is easier and cheaper to close plants in Britain than in most EC countries. In the Thomson case at Gosport the average redundancy payment was Pounds 7,000 compared with Pounds 47,000 in Spain. In Holland, Spain, and Germany agreement on a redundancy package has to be reached with workplace representatives before closure is allowed. If, for example, British Leyland Daf decides to keep open its Belgian and Dutch plants and close only its British plant, as seemed possible yesterday, that differential cost of redundancy is likely to be a factor. Britain also loses out from its relatively low skill base and poor educational standards, one reason behind Ford's decision to switch more of its R&amp;D work to Germany. The 'social dumping' theory that capital will flow to areas where labour is cheapest and least protected, dragging down labour standards elsewhere, has scarcely materialised in the EC because low wages are usually cancelled out by low productivity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman today described as "sheer fabrication" the  assertion that China is continuing to export prison labor  products to the United States.    Spokesman Wu Jianmin made the remarks at a weekly news  briefing here this afternoon when asked to comment on the report  that on may 18, Wu Hongda and U.S. Congressman Smith asserted  that China is continuing to export prison labor products (PLPs)  to the U.S.    "This is sheer fabrication," Wu said.    With regard to export of PLPs, China and the U.S. have  signed  the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prohibiting import and  export trade in PLPs. China has acted in strict compliance with  the MOU, he said.    Not long ago, China and the U.S. also signed a statement on  cooperation for the implementation of the MOU, Wu said.    Both Chinese and U.S. sides share the view that the two  documents are being implemented smoothly, he noted.    "It is out of ulterior motives for a handful of people to  spread lies and make vicious slanders on this issue," the  spokesman said.</p>

Voges, is unsuitable for his task of combatting the  administrative chaos on the Netherlands Antillean island. His  checks on the government apparatus, which has become derailed,  are a failure. Also he has not proved able to play the  pioneering role which could lead the St. Martin Government to a  healthy future.    This was the conclusion of the Joubert commission, one year  after Justice and Antillean Affairs Minister Hirsch Ballin put  the island under legal restraint when he introduced his Higher  Supervision regime. Voges reacted furiously to the  recommendations, which could cost him his job because Hirsch  Ballin has in the meantime let it be known that he wanted to  adopt Joubert's proposals.    "I completely reject this attack on my person," Voges said.  "I have not failed, but I have been abandoned by the civil  service apparatus in St. Martin at every stage. I was given  completely insufficient support in my attempts to restore order."    Hirsch Ballin also received some indirect criticism: His  controversial policies for fighting the considerable financial  disorder, administrative chaos and faulty checks on government  policies have not achieved the desired results one year after  they were started, the advisory committee under the leadership  of E.L. Joubert noted. Joubert is rector-magnificus of the  University of the Netherlands Antilles.    Joubert suggested a number of far-reaching measures, the  most  important of which was to put St. Martin under a new period of  legal restraint of at least two years using a general Measure of  Central Government Administration.    Last summer Hirsch Ballin announced his Higher Supervision  regime, which included strict financial curbs on the island (to  be carried out by Voges, the person in charge who has now been  challenged). These policies had produced only meagre results,  according to Joubert. The worst evils had been removed, but as  yet little improvement could be seen, the advisory committee  said.    Joubert and his camp now want to intervene in three ways:  The civil service should be drastically reorganized and  strengthened under the leadership of an interim manager with  exclusive powers, who will be appointed for a period of two  years to succeed Voges.    St. Martin's Island Council should also be forced to set  policy plans within one year in the fields of the economy,  welfare, traffic, tourism, town and country planning,  environmental management and public health.    The Island Council, if necessary under pressure from the  Netherlands Government, should also pass provisions to increase  government income (there is still a budget deficit of many tens  of millions of guilders), improve financial management and  guarantee effective and democratic decision making procedures.    The Island Council is accused of taking a wide range of  decisions and approving expenditure, despite Hirsch Ballin's  Higher Supervision regime, without providing any adequate  justification of these decisions.    In a reaction to the report, Hirsch Ballin spoke of "proper  recommendations" which he "would adopt in general lines." In  the near future he will present them to the central government  cabinet and parliament and hopes to be able to take decisions on  18 February under the slogan "Now Let's Get To Work."</p>

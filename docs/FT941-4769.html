			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Brussels to probe aid for airlines The European Commission is to investigate the state aid which Portugal and Greecehave offered to their national airlines, TAP-Air Portugal and Olympic Airways. The investigation is likely to fuel the long-running row between member states over the Commission's efforts to curtail state aid to airlines - a dispute that seems likely to gather pace with the announcement of a new state package for Air France in Paris this week. The Commission's investigation into TAP follows the Portuguese government's approval two months ago of a Es180bn (Pounds 687m) aid package for the airline, designed to bail out the loss-making group as part of a broader restructuring programme. This aid, which would absorb TAP's Es124,4 debts, will be allocated in four tranches over the next four years, according to the plans submitted to the Commission by the Portuguese government. At the same time the Commission will examine the Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.51bn) of state aid that the Greek government has offered to Olympic Airways. This aid is to be split into two parts, with Ecu1.1bn designated to absorb Olympic's previous debts and Ecu96m earmarked for future capital projects. Commission officials said yesterday the investigations into state aid for airlines were now almost standard policy, given the increasingly tough line that the Commission has taken in recent years towards state subsidies in European industry. Last December the Commission approved IPounds 175m (Pounds 168m) aid for Irish carrier Aer Lingus after a similar investigation, although it insisted the aid could only be used to restore the company to financial viability and could not be used to distort the market. A more controversial investigation into the FFr1.5bn (Pounds 174m) of aid for Air France is under way, with results expected in several months. The question at stake will be whether the Greek and Portuguese aid represents a 'one-off' attempt to make the airlines viable for future competition, Commission officials said. Although they insisted that 'one-off' aid was still permissible, under Commission rules, aid that could seriously distort the market would not be permitted.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Observer: Packing in There is a touch of irony in Roger McKechnie's decision to sell his Phileas Fogg snack food group to United Biscuits. More than a third of the Pounds 24m McKechnie and his pals are being paid is in the form of UB shares. Indeed, UB is portraying the vendors as supportive long-term investors. However, if McKechnie had himself seen the promise of enduring support from the City, he wouldn't now be handing in his chips. His company, one of the few success stories in north-east England, needed a hefty capital injection if it was to expand, and McKechnie was dubious whether City institutions would stand by him long term. As for his new UB shares, the 51-year-old stresses that there are no ties. 'I can sell out the day after I get them,' he smiles.</p>

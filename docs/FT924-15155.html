			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stora suffers SKr383m shortfall STORA, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, suffered a SKr383m (Dollars 71m) loss in the second four months of the year. This contrasts with a SKr860m profit it made for the same period of 1991 and a SKr3m profit for the first four months of this year. Invoiced sales fell to SKr31.07bn for the first eight months, from SKr34.87bn for the same period of last year. Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive, said the company would suffer a further deficit in the final four months of this year. Earlier assessments had assumed a summer business recovery in the US which did not happen. The decline in the dollar exchange rate also resulted in further pressure on prices. Stora said the forest products industry continues to face a 'substantial degree of overcapacity'. As a result, prices have had to be cut severely with falls as big as 23 per cent in newspaper print and 11 per cent in fine paper. The company's loss would have been much higher but for a rationalisation programme. The drop of SKr2.65bn in revenues was partly offset by SKr1.4bn savings so far this year with SKr800m of that coming in the second four months. Costs will be cut by a further SKr300m in the third four months. Stora said it plans further restructuring to reduce costs by a further SKr1bn next year and by SKr1bn in 1994. The workforce was being cut from 45,643 at the end of 1990 to just over 39,000 by December. Productivity has risen 12 per cent this year. However, the company said the present worries in Sweden's financial markets had not affected the group's position. Interest-bearing net indebtedness actually fell to SKr23.71bn at the end of August from SKr24.74bn at the beginning of the year. Stora's pulp business made a SKr239m operating loss in the first eight months compared with a SKr89m loss for the same period of last year, mainly due to falling pulp prices.</p>

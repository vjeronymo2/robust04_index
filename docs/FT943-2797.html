			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Rabin ready to return entire Golan Heights: Israeli premier set to drop election pledge in order to win peace deal with Syria At the height of a stormy Knesset debate this week on the future of the Golan Heights, Mr Uzi Landau, a hardliner from the main opposition Likud party, declared bluntly from the podium that Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin was 'a liar'. When seeking election two years ago, he recalled, Mr Rabin had promised never to sanction Israeli withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights. Yet now, Mr Landau charged, Mr Rabin was planning exactly that: a full pull-out in exchange for full peace with Syria. Sitting in the front row of the hall, Mr Rabin flushed a deep red, and turned furiously to Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, the Likud party leader, demanding that Mr Landau be condemned for branding him a liar. Mr Netanyahu grinned, and retorted that he would be happy to condemn Mr Landau in the strongest terms 'as soon as you convince me that you're not planning to withdraw from the Golan'. Mr Rabin had no answer for that: he stood up and, without another word, stalked out of the chamber. The lesson from this extraordinary exchange is plain: Mr Rabin has indeed changed his mind and his policies. The man who just two years ago said, and believed, that to abandon Golan was severely to undermine Israel's security, now thinks differently. Privately, and anonymously, some of his aides are confirming what Mr Rabin's Likud critics and the leaders of the 13,000 Jewish residents of Golan have been saying for several weeks now: that the prime minister now considers a peace treaty with Syria, the last and most implacable of Israel's former ring of neighbouring antagonists, to be worth the price of a complete pull-out. Mr Rabin has said nothing too explicit in public, but he has been dropping hints. In recent interviews marking the Jewish New Year, he expressed his firm hope that an accord could swiftly be reached with Syria, despite the 'painful compromises' he knew would be involved. Earlier this month, he unveiled a simplified peace formula - providing for an initial 'slight' Golan withdrawal, to be followed after three years of normalised relations by a 'substantial' pull-out. Crucially, cabinet sources stress, he did not rule out a complete withdrawal. And when, a few days later, Syrian President Hafez Assad responded with a speech to his parliament, intimating that Syria was ready for full relations with Israel provided the entire Golan was returned, Mr Rabin and his ministers reacted positively. An old equation; a newly upbeat Israeli response. Just over a year ago, Mr Rabin departed from a policy he had endorsed for decades, and grudgingly stretched out a hand to welcome the Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, into the peace process. Now, his aides indicate, he has made another strategic policy departure, abandoning his insistence on retaining at least part of the Golan. Why has the prime minister - who as chief of staff in 1967 oversaw the capture of the Golan Heights - changed his position, flying in the face of his own Labour party platform? Mr Yoel Marcus, a veteran observer of Mr Rabin who writes for the respected Ha'aretz daily newspaper, put it simply yesterday: 'He has come to the conclusion that peace without the Golan will contribute more to Israel's security than the continued retention of the Golan without peace.' Three dozen Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf war taught him that land is not the peerless security asset it once was. And with Egypt, the PLO and Jordan on board, a deal with Syria - and the accord with Lebanon that would automatically follow - would give Israel peace on all frontiers. At 72, Mr Rabin is nearing the end of his political career; a treaty with Damascus would be a crowning achievement. However, at present, the prime minister does not even have his whole party, let alone the country, behind him. Mr Avigdor Kahalani, a Labour backbencher who, as a battalion commander, was one of the heroes of bitter fighting on the Golan in the 1973 war, is defying Mr Rabin by leading a bipartisan campaign against withdrawal. A group of Golan residents are several days into an anti-withdrawal hunger strike. And an opinion poll published this week indicated that fewer than 50 per cent of the electorate are ready for even a partial withdrawal. But these are early days. Mr Dennis Ross, the US Middle East peace talks co-ordinator, is due in Israel next week for a series of Jerusalem-Damascus mediation trips. His boss, secretary of state Warren Christopher, is expected next month. By the end of the year, says Israeli army chief of staff Ehud Barak, believed to be one of the very few aides directly involved with Mr Rabin in the secretive peace manoeuvrings with Damascus, 'we could well be in the midst of negotiations with Syria.' Mr Rabin has pledged that, when the final deal is drafted, assuming it involves significant territorial concessions, he will hold a referendum. As things stand today, he would lose, but he will doubtless utilise the next few months to prepare the Israeli public for the bitter pill of complete withdrawal, seeking to sweeten it by persuading President Assad to come to Jerusalem or at least meet him for a smiling eve-of-referendum summit. After all, if President Assad wants the entire Golan Heights back, it is he, not Mr Rabin, who will have to play the main role in persuading a sceptical Israeli electorate of the virtues of the full-withdrawal-for-full-peace equation.</p>

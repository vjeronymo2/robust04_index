			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian lawmakers have moved  for inviting presidential parliament spokesman Aleksandr  Yakovlev and Chairman of the Federation Council Vladimir  Shumeyko to one of its forthcoming sessions to report on the  situation inside the Russian procurator-general's office.    They expressed concern about the fact that in accordance  with  a presidential decree, all of the Russian procurator-general  deputies had been dismissed and wanted to know the reasoning  behind the decision.    Russian legislators also voted on Wednesday to invite head  of  presidential administration Sergey Filatov to a plenary session  of the State Duma to answer to their inquiries related to  President Yeltsin's letter in regard of the law on the status of  a State Duma deputy, which he signed earlier.    They were dissatisfied with explanations which were offered  by the chief of the Main Legal Department under the Russian  president Ruslan Orekhov at a plenary session of the Duma last  Friday.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'GIDEON OLIVER' GETS OFF TO A PONDEROUS START  </P> <P> Gideon Oliver is a character for all seasons: a man of action and intellect, a  teacher, a scholar, an athlete and -- unofficially -- a detective. He even  dresses great.  </P> <P> An interesting presence. And he has to be to rise above the plot in the  premiere of "Gideon Oliver" at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42.  </P> <P> This is the third rotating component of "The ABC Mystery Movie" series that  recently opened with a resurrected "Columbo" starring Peter Falk, followed by  "B. L. Stryker" starring Burt Reynolds.  </P> <P> Louis Gossett Jr. is Gideon, a brilliant anthropologist and charismatic college  professor who tonight injects himself into an investigation of the murder of  his former girlfriend. Elements of Satanism and kiddie porn surface in a  laborious story that frequently tangles while seeming at least vaguely  reminiscent of rumors that have shrouded the infamous McMartin case since its  inception.  </P> <P> Gideon ends up teaming with a maverick police detective (Michael Rooker) whose  unorthodox ideas about a Satanic link to some prominent murders places him in  jeopardy.  </P> <P> "Gideon Oliver" has nice visual texture and a worthy star in Gossett, whose  performance as Gideon intriguingly hints at layers yet to be explored and  growth yet to occur. That's promising.  </P> <P> Without Gossett's intensity, the premiere would be a total loss. Even with it,  the two hours pass slowly and are strangely unsuspenseful and uninvolving.

Robaina and Asamoah today held a one-hour-plus meeting  during  which they exchanged ideas on the world situation, and in  particular, their respective nations.    The foreign minister from the Caribbean nation arrived  yesterday in this capital as part of a two-week tour of the  continent that also includes Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and  Namibia, in that order.    During their official conversations, Robaina offered an  overall outlook on his country's economic and political  situation, as well as the changes being implemented in the wake  of the Soviet Union's demise and the stepping up of the blockade  imposed on the island by the United States more than three  decades ago.    In this regard, he explained that his government has opened  doors to foreign investment under Washington's relentless  persecution to hamper these negotiations.    The visitor indicated that more than 100 foreign companies  are established on Cuban territory and one of 1994's priorities  is to promote Latin American and Caribbean investments.    When referring to the conflict with the United States, the  Cuban diplomat ruled out improved relations, although he  remarked that as time goes by more and more sectors of U.S.  society oppose the blockade.    Robaina expressed his appreciation for Ghana's position with  regard to the Caribbean island in diverse international forums  and particularly at the United Nations.    Meanwhile, Asamoah emphasized that this support, besides  being based on friendship, is a matter of principle at a time  when there is an attempt to force Cuba to change its political  system.    We do not want the small nations to be pressured by the  Western powers, stressed the African minister. It is very  clear, he said, that the West tries to control the Third World  through the UN Security Council, demonstrating the absence of  consistency in this body.    To conclude, he expressed his satisfaction for being able to  count on good friends such as Cuba.    The Cuban minister arrived in Accra on a two-day official  visit accompanied by Alberto Rodriguez Arufe, coordinator of the  Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee International  Relations Department and by other Foreign Ministry officials.    During today's visit the Cuban delegation laid a wreath at  the Kwame Nkruman monument, father of Ghana's independence. The  wreath was received by Daniel Anam, president of the ruling  party National Democratic Congress, and by its general secretary  Huudu Yahaya.    Before travelling to Angola, Robaina met with Ghanaian  President Jerry Rawlings. With a population of over 15 million  people, Ghana, a former British colony, is Cuba's first trading  partner in Africa.</p>

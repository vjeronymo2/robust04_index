			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Belgium decides to pull out paratroops BELGIUM yesterday decided to start withdrawing its paratroops from Congo's Brazzaville by the weekend, after most Belgians who wanted to flee the violence in the Zairean capital Kinshasa had already been evacuated, AP reports from Brussels. 'The government has decided to start the retreat of its troops in Brazzaville on Friday,' a government spokesman said. He said that 600 Belgians remained in Kinshasa after 864 had been repatriated with government help in the wake of the riots that swept the city this week. Heavy weapons fire erupted late on Tuesday and tracers could be seen over Kinshasa's skyline, but no information was available on the circumstances of the firing. Zaire's opposition said on Tuesday that President Mobutu Sese Seko's special forces had killed at least 1,000 people, mainly regular army troops after soldiers rioted to protest at being paid in new banknotes that they considered worthless. Belgium yesterday impounded a cargo of the new notes in Ostende after Zaire's transitional government asked for the move, the Belgian Foreign Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'The transitional government asked the Belgian government not to authorise the departure of the plane with its cargo to Zaire and to seize the banknotes,' the statement said. The banknote is the highest denomination in Zaire but is worth less than two dollars.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Shoppers tell parties to get on their trolleys BRITAIN'S vote-seeking politicians were yesterday given a comprehensive thumbs down by that driving force in any election, the blue-rinse brigade of Sainsbury shoppers. Trolley-pushing voters in six safe southern Tory seats - Carshalton, Sutton, Epsom, Horsham, Worthing and Hove - granted John Major a narrow vote of confidence. In an exclusive FT poll of blue-clad middle-aged lady shoppers outside Sainsbury stores there was one overwhelming message to the politicians: head for the electoral checkout and get it all over with as quickly as possible. Out of the small but scientifically chosen sample of women shoppers wearing blue coats or pullovers - two in each constituency - five said they would vote Conservative, two each gave their allegiance to Labour, the Greens and the Liberal Democrats, with one saying she would abstain as a protest. Their overriding comment was of boredom or outrage at the politicians' antics. Outside Sainsbury's, Wallington, in the Carshalton constituency (majority: 14,409), Mrs Mary Cunningham, in a bright-blue coat, said she was a traditional Conservative but had hesitated in making up her mind this time before being pushed back to the Tory camp by fury over Labour's health broadcast last week. 'I'd like to punch Neil Kinnock on the nose,' she said. In North Cheam, in the Sutton constituency (majority: 15,718) Mrs Jacqueline Brown said she would vote Liberal. 'None of them are coming over very well.' Mrs Ida Cass, wearing turquoise with a mauve tint to her hair, said she was Green 'because of what they're trying to do for the world.' In Epsom (majority: 20,761) Mrs Evelyn R, a lifelong Tory in a blue anorak said that for the first time she would not be voting. She was 'disgusted' by the Conservative performance. 'Education, employment - you name it, they've messed it up.' She did not want her name quoted because friends in the Tory party would think she was 'a renegade'. In Horsham (majority 23,907) Mrs Doris Whitehead said she would opt for the Tories but without enthusiasm. 'I can't see it getting any better.' Mrs Dora Silver would also vote Conservative. 'I'm sick to death of the politicians on TV. They go on and on and on. But I don't like Mr Kinnock as a man,' she said.</p>

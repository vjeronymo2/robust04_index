At the Nordic Council session in Stockholm last  week, he was introduced to the expression "late milking." "All  this must of course be seen from the standpoint of Finland's  specific situation. In my view, a Swedish judgment on this  matter is neither easy nor warranted." Bildt is quite clearly  convinced about Finland's negotiatiated agreement with the EU  [European Union]. It is what he believed from the very  beginning, although he did not want to question his Finnish  counterpart [Prime Minister] Esko Aho's gloomy reaction to the  information about his achievements in Brussels a couple of weeks  ago.    "There are always things that have to be interpreted from  within an agreement," Bildt added diplomatically. Sweden has  similar problems and needs complementary measures at the  national level. This does not actually affect the agreement with  the EU. The problem of complementary national financing of  regional support also arises in Sweden. Bildt pointed out that,  unlike Finland, Sweden has been adapting to EU price levels ever  since the mid- 1960's, based on a belief that sooner or later it  would be knocking on the EU's door.    "It has always been my firm belief that this would happen  sooner or later, although my time-frame estimates have varied  from the short term to a pessimistic distant future." But this  Nordic advocate of Europe has always been sure about Swedish EU  membership: "I think I became convinced about the present  schedule in 1987-88. That is when the events became  predictable." Bildt was referring to the 1985 European Single  Act decision. The white paper resolutions were to be  implemented by the end of 1992, and that paved the way for an  extension. The prime minister and leader of the Swedish  Conservative Party states that all his efforts from 1987-88  onward were focused on getting Sweden's application submitted by  1991-92, negotiations in 1993, ratification in 1994, and  membership in 1995. In other words, Carl Bildt has worked hard  for Swedish accession to the EU over the last seven years.  <H5>  Opening of the Nordic Council Meeting </H5>   "I am convinced about membership in 1995," he said, without  showing any doubt as to the outcome of the planned consultative  referendum. The date of the referendum has not been agreed upon  yet, but negotiations are now under way between the government  and the opposition. Bildt would prefer to see it take place in  June, while the opposition and one of the government coalition  parties, the Liberal Party, have indicated that the referendum  cannot be held before November, in other words a couple of  months after the elections. "As far as I can judge, there is a  parliament majority for a referendum in June, with or without  the Liberal Party."  <H5>  Must Not Become an Issue of Conflict </H5>   Bildt does not see any point in turning the referendum  question into a political conflict. "Trying to split a nation  is a bad way of trying to unite Europe." The parties in Sweden  are now evaluating the pros and cons of the alternatives. Bildt  does not want to predict how long the discussions will last, but  he does not believe it is absolutely essential for the  referendum to be out of the way before the 18 September  elections.    "The important thing for us is to get a good result," he  said, adding that a referendum in June does not mean a great  personal political victory for him. After the successful  outcome of the negotiations, there is only one good result in  the Swedish prime minister's eyes: a yes to the EU from the  majority of the people.    Bildt does not think that a change of power in the middle of  the campaign would influence the outcome of the referendum. "It  may be significant if the Social Democrats lose the elections,  which I think they will, in which case their party will be in  fairly bad shape this fall. If the referendum is not held  before November, there is a danger or a chance that the  conservatives will no longer be in power on the planned date of  the country's accession to the EU. Various opinion polls  indicate that a change of power can be expected in Sweden this  coming September. The Social Democrats have a strong position  and in the eyes of many it takes a good deal of self-confidence  and optimism today for a Conservative leader in Sweden to  believe in victory, no matter how little significance he sees in  the opinion polls: This is relatively limited," he said, and  added that he is confident about "the evolution of political and  economic events."    Bildt believes in a yes to the EU at the referendum  regardless of who is in power after the fall elections. This  yes will be the outcome of a debate which informs and involves  the people: "The problem with the Social Democrats is that they  did not believe we could reach such a good agreement so  quickly." According to Bildt, this has led to the Social  Democrats campaigning predominantly for a no vote. Today, a  clear majority of Social Democrats -- some 75 percent -- are  against EU membership. "The longer they postpone the start of a  proper yes campaign, the more problematic the no situation will  become within the party. Problems are seldom solved by waiting."    The Social Democrats Have No Opinion    And the social democrats have waited. Last fall they decided  to adjourn the party congress because they could not achieve  unanimity on the EU issue. "It is remarkable that they have not  made any decision in principle. They are the only political  party without a principle on this issue."    While the discussion about the date of the Swedish  referendum  is going on, Bildt does not really believe in simultaneous  plebiscites in Finland, Sweden, and Norway, but he is sure that  Norway will succeed: "I think they are very near a solution."  And he is just as sure of a yes vote in the referendum to  follow: "Opinion polls record the opinions of yesterday, or  rather, they reflect an approximate, often fairly unreliable  picture of yesterday's situation. The only thing one can be  absolutely sure about is that things look different tomrrow," he  added to his somewhat enigmatic view on opinion polls. Bildt  was referring to opinion polls in Norway from 1972 when the no  ethos predominated to a considerably greater degree than today.    The Swedish Prime Minister takes the view that Norway cannot  manage without the EU, not even with its oil and fish, because  that is not what it is all about: "What is at stake is  political influence in shaping the Europe of the future, and not  sitting and leading a dull life on an island. Of course, one  can pursue a Robinson Crusoe-like policy, cracking a coconut now  and then. But that will hardly satisfy any nation in the long  run."  <H5>  Isolation Is No Solution </H5>   Bildt does not believe that the EU poses any direct threats  other than in the guise of bad decisions. But of course, such  decisions could also be made by parliaments in Sweden and  Finland. "It is very hard for me to see that there is anything  intrinsically wrong in cooperation. You either cooperate or  remain isolated," he argued. "I cannot find a single valid  argument why we in the Nordic countries should be isolated from  European cooperation. Not a single one!"    He is not laboring under any illusions, however; this  cooperation is likely to be laborious, time-consuming, and  complicated, but he thinks it is worth it: "One must, of  course, give up some of one's independence in exchange for  something else. This happens with people who get married. I  suppose, or rather know, that they give up some of their  independence while being aware of gaining other benefits from  the arrangement," he added firmly.    Carl Bildt believes that the Nordic countries will work  closely together as members of the EU. Among other things, they  will be actively supporting membership for the Baltic states and  other countries like Hungary and Poland, which were seen last  week knocking discreetly on the EU's door....    The Swedish Prime Minister is convinced that membership in  the EU is also a guarantee of security, but he does not think  Finland needs the EU specifically for that reason: "Soviet  policy always included an expansionist element. This trait is  not present in Russian policy today." Neither does Bildt see  any threat of this kind in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Bildt does  not set much store by his threats to put the Russian Army on a  war footing: "I find it hard to believe that anyone can win  many votes by promising a super-Afghanistan as an electoral  pledge."    Bildt does not doubt Russia's ability to take a tough stand  to safeguard its national interests, even if there is a risk  that this may lead to conflicts -- although not military ones --  with the West: "But I think that a prevalently ideological  attitude belongs to the past." Bildt believes that security and  stability will increase in Europe with its northernmost  countries as members of the EU: "I see this as one of the  strongest arguments for membership. It offers a security bonus."  NATO membership, on the other hand, is not necessary and the  candidate countries will, in time, define their relationship to  the WEU [Western European Union].    What matters to Carl Bildt today is to pilot Sweden into the  EU. He is now on the home stretch of his race to make an old  dream come true.</p>

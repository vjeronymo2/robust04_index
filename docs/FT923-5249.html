			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (18): A money spinner for the intermediaries - Leasing of aircraft is again becoming a convenient form of finance AIRCRAFT LEASING is not what it used to be. A combination of falling interest rates, troubled banks and the recession has prompted airlines in the past year to reconsider their enthusiasm for leasing. But now the tide may be turning again in favour of leasing as financiers step up their efforts to secure new business from airlines and investors. During the late 1980s some of the world's most successful financial organisations were aircraft leasers. At the top of the tree were, and are, Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), of Shannon, Ireland, and Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), owned since 1990 by the American insurer AIG. The business is hugely profitable for these intermediaries: over the past five years, GPA achieved an average profit margin of 15.6 per cent on the aircraft it bought in bulk from manufacturers and sold to investors. Their airline clients liked leasing because it freed capital for other purposes. By last year, one third of British Airways' entire fleet was owned by investors and run by the airline on operating leases. The investors, for their part, were able to divert taxable profits into aircraft - mobile and sought after assets - and received an income stream derived from the regular lease payments made by airlines. This cosy arrangement began to go wrong two years ago. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait frightened passengers away from international air travel and the recession slowed their return to the skies. Airlines struggled, often in vain, to make profits. Furthermore, one technique used by airlines to cuts costs has been to defer orders, which did little to support the view that aircraft values would be supported by continuously rising demand. The recession was accompanied by a worldwide fall in asset prices, especially property and shares. This meant that banks' investment portfolios became more skewed away from shares and property and more dependent on other investments such as aircraft. To rebalance their portfolios, investment managers, especially in Japan, staunched the flow of funds into aircraft. The recession also slowed inflation, which upset the calculations involved in leasing aircraft. The depreciation profile of aircraft in the 1980s suggested a negligible fall in the nominal value of an aircraft over the first five years of its life. According to Avmark, an aviation consultancy, a 1985 Boeing 737-300 would have cost Dollars 22m new and would have been worth the same in 1990. This reduced the risk attached to investing in aircraft and so cut the cost of lease payments. However, the same type delivered new in 1987 is now worth only about Dollars 18.5m. Such declines have hit narrow bodied jets such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 757 harder than the more popular new wide-bodied aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and McDonnell-Douglas MD-11. Finally, as world economies slid towards recession, most governments tried to cut interest rates. In the US, the biggest single market for aircraft, interest rates are at their lowest level for almost 30 years. This has pulled airline executives towards simple bank borrowing rather than leases. 'The pendulum has swung away from leasing,' says Mr Dan Garton, vice-president of financial planning and analysis at American Airlines. 'The alternative of borrowing money on the market through bonds looks more economical. Interest rates have fallen faster than lease rates, especially in the US.' This attitude was dramatically revealed in the failure of GPA's aborted Dollars 1bn share sales in June. US investors in particular were unconvinced of the security of airlines' profits and thus their ability to pay lease rates. Financiers have since put on a brave face on the future of leasing. Citicorp Investment Bank in London raised Dollars 522m at about the time of the failed GPA share sale. It used an innovative aircraft securitisation technique to repackage old leases for new investors. The bank is optimistic that such deals can be repeated. It points to historic growth in airline traffic being double economic growth and growth in aircraft sales should be even faster than that because 30 per cent of new aircraft are to replace old ones, it says. The bank estimates the total value of aircraft to be sold in the 1990s at Dollars 45-50bn, three times the level during the 1980s. It believes that the demand for leasing will continue to come from smaller airlines where the off-balance sheet nature of leasing is particularly attractive. Some airlines agree there is room for the opportunistic banks now: 'Over the next few months, leasing will get easier because both demand has fallen as well as supply,' says Garton. Financiers might take heart at this analysis. But there is another airline view that they may also have heard often in recent months. Says Mr Tony Galbraith, the treasurer of British Airways: 'leasing is just another way of borrowing. The decision to lease is entirely a matter of cost.'  ---------------------------------------------------------                AIRCRAFT LEASE RATES 1992  ---------------------------------------------------------                               Year     Monthly    Annual                               built    lease      change %                                      (dollars000)  --------------------------------------------------------- WIDE BODY Boeing 747-400                1989     1125       -2 McDonnell-Douglas MD-11       1990      883       -2  --------------------------------------------------------- NARROW BODY Airbus A320-200               1989      270       -23 Boeing 737-500                1989      230       -8  --------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL JETS BAe 146-300                   1987      225       -10 Fokker F 100                  1989      175       -27  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: Avmark Aviation Economist  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

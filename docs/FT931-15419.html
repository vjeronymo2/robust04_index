			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Letter: International trends point to an uncommercial future for Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant Sir, British Nuclear Fuels' denial of the economic and political reality surrounding the future of its Thorp plant (Letters, January 6) does not mean the facts will disappear. BNFL's two largest foreign customers, Germany and Japan, are reconsidering the wisdom of reprocessing nuclear waste. The chairmen of the German electrical utilities are engaged in discussions with politicians to reach a consensus on energy policy. These discussions include ceasing reprocessing in favour of the cheaper option of direct storage. BNFL's contracts include clauses enabling its customers to withdraw from reprocessing. The Japanese government has been rocked by international protest surrounding the recent plutonium shipment from France - a taste of things to come if Thorp begins operation. Technical problems with the Monju fast breeder reactor and widespread fear of regional political instability caused by Japan's plutonium surplus, has prompted a reappraisal of its commitment to the plutonium path. For these and other reasons, not limited to Germany and Japan, the likelihood of BNFL obtaining contracts beyond the first decade of Thorp's operations is remote. Further, it is doubtful whether existing contracts for the first decade will run according to BNFL's plan. The UK government's refusal to underwrite BNFL's contracts with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear is a sign that BNFL's optimism is unwarranted. Thorp's profit seems destined to change from meagre to negative. The question facing the UK government is whether to operate Thorp and create a costly decommissioning problem (even using BNFL's minimal estimate of Pounds 900m) or to recognise that times have changed since 1977 when the go-ahead for Thorp was given. The only rational conclusion is to scrap Thorp. Richard Le Coyte, nuclear campaign, Greenpeace, Canonbury Villas, London N1 2PN</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Dancing for posterity Cameras were in the Royal Opera House last week to record two performances of Mayerling which will provide the substance of a commercial video. The news is doubly good. Mayerling is a repertory favourite - MacMillan's most adventurous full-length creation - and it is currently receiving admirable performance from Irek Mukhamedov as Rudolf, Viviana Durante as Mary Vetsera and Lesley Collier as Countess Larisch. And it is a work which shows the depth and assurance of the Royal Ballet as an ensemble of dance actors. This is where the good news is doubled, for the history of the Royal Ballet repertory on film, of making sure that significant ballets and outstanding performances have a lasting memorial, is not happy. How did Antoinette Sibley dance Aurora? Why was Lynn Seymour's Juliet so perfect? What of Anthony Dowell in Shadowplay and David Wall in Knight Errant, - Antony Tudor's contributions - or Monica Mason's prodigious incarnation of the Chosen One in MacMillan's Rite of Spring? Future generations of dance-lovers will never know, because film has failed them. And what of La Fille mal gardee with its glorious original cast, excellently captured in 1962 by Margaret Dale for BBCTV in black and white but never made available to the public? What, indeed, of the Ashton repertory - the foundation of our national ballet - which should have been preserved under Ashton's supervision so that his 'style', the essence of his creativity, might be understood for the future. An appreciable number of Balanchine's works have been saved on film: the next century will know how he wished his ballets to look. A decade after Ashton's death, his choreography languishes in the repertory, and is already diminished in manner. The catalogue of missed opportunities is long and lamentable. The music of this century is securely ours, thanks to the gramophone. Of great and un-recorded dance, in an age when film has perpetuated scoundrels, political nonentities, and an eternity of foolish acting, only those who long for a brief clip of Nijinsky or of Diaghilev's troupe can know. And despair. We have thrown away our dance-past. Ballet has always been an art of the moment: it seems more than perverse that, in an age when we can capture the moment easily, we have missed the chance to keep great art for posterity. In 1978, when Mayerling was new, it was filmed at Covent Garden by Derek Bailey, one of the most influential of directors of dance for the screen. Sections of this performance were seen in his programme MacMillan's Mayerling, which won the Italia Prize for the South Bank Show. The full ballet was never released for public viewing, and the staggering performances of David Wall, Lynn Seymour, Merle Park, still lie in the vaults. I suppose. I hope. It was, happily and ironically, Bailey who also directed last week's recording. In the post-war years, BBC TV transmitted a fascinating variety of dance. In what must seem a golden age in the 1970s, both BBC and independent companies initiated programmes which brought important dance to the public. Later events - the Bolshoi in the Park of 1986, and the 1988 celebration of Makarova's return to the Kirov Ballet in London, together with recordings, again by Derek Bailey, of MacMillan's The Prince of the Pagodas and Winter Dreams - seem exceptions rather than the entertainment rule. Today, the ballet repertory shrinks as audiences decline. (And switch off - and are switched off by - dismal nonsenses like the Dancing series that cluttered BBC schedules last year, or the witless miniatures lately offered as an Arts Council project.) People are reluctant to go to the ballet: ticket prices are prohibitive and titles have to be brand-name familiar. Such attitudes have diminished the dance itself; companies increasingly rely upon Swan-fakery to fill the house. If an attempt is not made to bring more theatrical dance to the screen, to win and inspire an audience, we fail the public, as we fail dance.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): NFC's glamour fades - Simon Davies analyses its sagging fortunes and what needs to be done / Company in the news NFC's 1993-1994 profit figure, announced on Tuesday to market gloom, was a sour finale to a year that has seen the former glamour stock dragged down from grace with an almighty thud. Once the leading participant in the high-growth logistics and distribution sector, it rode the recession with extreme ease and steady profits. But the slide in the economy finally caught up with the former government-owned National Freight Consortium. Throw in the shock departure of its chief executive, plus the first-ever suspension of profit-sharing to employees in a company renowned for its paternalism, and the result has been a free-falling share price. Each of the past three sets of quarterly results has been met with a share price decline of at least 7 per cent. In late trading on Friday, NFC's shares stood at 145p, representing a hefty decline from the start of the year when they stood at 234p. NFC has two major businesses. It owns Allied Pickfords and has a substantial house-moving operation. This, inevitably, was a casualty of weak property markets in the UK and the US, and its recovery has been slow. NFC's fortunes were, however, supported by its transport and logistics business. (Logistics is the jargon term for the new breed of former haulage and transport companies). Once, retailers tied up their own money in expensive stocks. No longer. In the mid-1980s, logistics companies installed complex computer systems, expanded their warehouse space and emerged as one-stop shops for the efficient storage and distribution of goods. Retailers pushed the burden of controlling stocks on to the middle-man. Typical customers are retailers such as Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer. This new and exciting concept was extraordinarily profitable in the mid-1980s and had the added attraction of contracts of up to five years in length. Companies such as Exel, Hays, Tibbett &amp; Britten, Christian Salvesen and Transport Development Group all made merry. But, when the recession came, clients had to continue paying the same rates under long-term contracts. It was different when the contracts came up for renewal. Because of increased competition among logistics companies, and retailers' ability to resume their own distribution, reduced rates were quickly on offer. NFC looked at two routes to avoid this this path. First, it moved to persuade other industries, from oil companies to manufacturers, to pass on their distribution activities at better rates than retailers would pay. This proved reasonably successful. Second, NFC moved into Europe and the US, both comparatively undeveloped markets, offering attractive business opportunities. But market development overseas has been slow, and acquisitions have proven difficult. Indeed, acquisitions worth Pounds 10m in Germany contributed an unexpected level of loss last year. Against this more difficult background, Peter Sherlock stepped unto the breach early in 1993. He came up with a Pounds 45m strategic plan, focusing NFC on distribution and moving services and attacking its cost base. The ideas won support, but patience became stretched at the absence of results and he left suddenly in August. NFC intends to continue the programme, at an increased cost of Pounds 50m, but is now looking to accelerate the cost-cutting process. Profits' growth will be slow, however: UBS Securities, the house broker, forecasts a pre-tax figure this year of Pounds 115m. NFC now needs to bring in a credible new chief executive and re-focus attention on its skills as the leader in the increasingly sophisticated UK logistics market. It could, however, take some time to win back its faded glamour.</p>

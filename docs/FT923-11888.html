			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Congressmen block preferential trade status for China THE House of Representatives yesterday passed legislation overturning the annual renewal of China's preferential trade status and prepared to pass another bill to grant only a heavily conditioned renewal. Neither bill is expected to survive a presidential veto, but the Democrats are making the effort - as they did last year - to make a point about their distaste for China's human rights record. The renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status, which accords Beijing the lowest tariffs available, was once passed every year with little difficulty. But after the Tiananmen Square massacre the idea that trade should be tied to human rights and weapons proliferation has gained support among most Democrats and many congressional Republicans. The latest version of the conditional MFN bill would deny tariff preferences for goods made by state-owned enterprises. The aim is to avoid harming both private Chinese companies and business interests in Hong Kong. Any bill will be vetoed by President George Bush, as it was last year, with little hope the two-thirds vote to overturn the veto can be mustered. 'The president has argued against all the evidence that China's record has improved on all fronts,' said Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic majority leader. 'But the reality is that his policy has failed. Beijing's brutality cannot be ignored any longer.' The votes came hours after Bao Tong, the most senior official arrested in connection with China's 1989 pro-democracy protests, was sentenced to nine years in prison, according to his family in Beijing. The former aide to disgraced Communist party general secretary Zhao Ziyang was arrested in 1989, one month before student-led protests were crushed with troops and tanks around Tiananmen Square, with heavy loss of life.</p>

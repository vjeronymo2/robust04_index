			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Control Techniques Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 183(b)(4) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments), requires the Administrator to issue CTG's for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC and particulate emissions from coatings (paints) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents used in shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the adoption of BACM. Volatile organic compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> react in the atmosphere to form ozone, a criteria air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant for which primary and secondary ambient air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality standards have been established. The EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to take into account the applicable requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112 in developing the guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The organic HAP emissions described in the remainder of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document are, with only one exception, a subset of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC emissions from coatings and solvents used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipbuilding and ship repair facilities. Thus the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques evaluated for the MACT standard are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to VOC emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has traditionally issued draft CTG's containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA is using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document to request public comment on a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended by BACM. The recommended BACM is identical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed MACT for coatings and solvents, stated in terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of VOC units rather than VOHAP units (where a VOHAP means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any compound of carbon, excluding metallic carbides and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbonates, that is listed in or pursuant to section 112(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act; this includes both VOC and exempt compounds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are listed as HAP). For those options using VOC as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrogate for VOHAP for the MACT standard, compliance would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be based on the Agency's reference Method 24. For any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance option involving measurement of actual VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content, the test method used by the source must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented and approved by the Administrator. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received on the proposed MACT rule will also be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in formulating a final recommended BACM and vice-versa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meanwhile, States are in the process of developing VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules for these sources to meet other Act requirements. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published an alternative control techniques (ACT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document in February 1994 to provide guidance to the States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these efforts. The recommended BACM described here is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with information in the ACT. Also, as explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the ACT, although control technologies for particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions at shipyards are in development, none are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently demonstrated at this time to recommend as BACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency has no recommendation for BACM for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate emissions at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary of the Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Description of the Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule would apply to each shipbuilding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility whose total activities emit or have the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to emit, considering controls, 9.1 megagrams per year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Mg/yr) (10 tons per year [tons/yr]) or more of any HAP or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tons/yr) or more of any combination of HAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the shipbuilding industry covered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule is represented by SIC Code 3731, ``Shipbuilding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Repairing.'' This industry consists of establishments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that build, repair, repaint, convert, and alter ships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, SIC Code 3731 includes the manufacture of both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offshore oil and gas well drilling and production platforms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine coatings used on such platforms will not be subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this rule, but rather to limitations imposed by the EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal rule on Architectural and Industrial Maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on information obtained through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U. S. Maritime Directory Listings (June 1992), there are an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 437 facilities of varying capabilities involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the construction and repair of ships in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 437 facilities, an estimated 25 qualify as major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources of HAP emissions and would be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. The total VOHAP emissions from surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating operations at the 25 facilities that would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed rule are estimated at 1,155 Mg/yr  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1,272 tons/yr). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

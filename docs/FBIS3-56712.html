Viktor Chernomyrdin Has Had  a Lunch With Senators]    [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy chairman of the  State Committee on Federal Affairs and former speaker of the  House of Nationalities in the former Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet, has become deputy head of the Russian senate. He  received 117 votes out of 156 in the Federation Council.  Informed sources say that there was covert agreement between  Ramazan Abdulatipov and Vladimir Shumeyko whereby the former  speaker of the House of Nationalities must not obstruct the  first deputy premier's taking the chairman's spot. It is no  wonder that after his victory Vladimir Shumeyko offered Ramazan  Abdulatipov the post of his deputy on nationalities affairs.  The second deputy chairman of the Russian senate (in charge of  industry and agriculture) is Valeryan Viktorov, chairman of the  Chuvashia Council of Ministers. For him the new post is an  opportunity to avoid a highly likely resignation which could  follow the inauguration of Chuvashia's first president, Nikolay  Fedorov.    The post of the third deputy chairman of the Federation  Council was contested by Vladimir Shumeyko's main rival for the  chair of speaker in the upper parliament chamber, Petr Romanov,  director of the Krasnoyarsk-based Yenisey chemical plant; and  Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the Voronezh Oblast administration.  Neither of them polled the requisite number of votes.  Therefore Vladimir Shumeyko proposed that the election of his  third deputy be moved to the next session of the upper  parliament chamber. In between the election of the deputy the  Russian senators discussed a list of committees in the upper  house. At 1340 the session was interrupted. Government  chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin invited the heads of the Russian  regions to lunch. It will be recalled that on 13 January Viktor  Chernomyrdin had lunch with the heads of the krays, oblasts, and  republics, persuading them to vote for Vladimir Shumeyko as  speaker of the Russian senate.    The meeting between the regional leaders and the chairman of  the Russian Government lasted for two hours. According to one  of the participants in the meeting, Victor Chernomyrdin stated  that all the requisite powers must be transferred to the  regions. He told the heads of the republics that especially to  this end, a government commission is being set up headed by Vice  Premier Yuriy Yarov which is to discuss and map out ways to  address the problems involved in relations between the center  and regions, primarily those concerned with the budget and  finances. According to another participant in the meeting, the  Yarov commission will include two representatives from eight  interregional economic associations. In a goodwill gesture  Viktor Chernomyrdin said that as of now the institution of the  Russian Federation president's representatives in the krays,  oblasts, and republics is abolished. A corresponding edict will  be promulgated shortly.    Viktor Chernomyrdin told the regional leaders that the  composition of the new government will be announced on 18  January. Apart from the ministries five committees will remain  in the government, including the State Property Management  Committee. Responding to complaints by the regional leaders  about the state's debts and problems of mutual financial  settlements and payments, Victor Chernomyrdin said that a draft  decree on the agriculture sector is pending whereby the state  will settle its debts with agricultural producers (400 billion  rubles) and make available credits for spring field work.  Furthermore Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to set up a special  commission to speed up settlements within Russian's banking  system and thereby resolve the problem of mutual clearance. It  is noteworthy that Viktor Chernomyrdin did not say a single word  about the election of Vladimir Shumeyko as chairman of the upper  chamber.</p>

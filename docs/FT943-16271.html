			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Australian stock market launches 100 share index The Australian Stock Exchange yesterday launched an index, called the ASX100. The aim of the index is to give institutional fund managers a better indication of how portfolios based on the leading big company shares are performing than the current All-Ordinaries Index. The All-Ordinaries Index is made up of 305 stocks at present. However, according to Mr Richard Humphry, managing director of the ASX, equity portfolios held by both local and overseas institutional investors typically contain about 30 to 40 of the top 100 stocks. The new index is designed to provide them with a better match. In addition, the ASX claims the index could prove particularly useful for managers of index funds, who aim to have portfolios which duplicate the main market index as closely as possible. The index is made up of the stocks in the existing 50 Leaders Index, and then adds the next 50 largest stocks based on market capitalisation and liquidity. At end-June, the resulting 100 stocks accounted for 87 per cent of the All-Ordinaries Index and 80 per cent of the Australian equities market by capitalisation. About two-thirds of the ASX100 is accounted for by industrial stocks, as opposed to resource shares. The ASX plans to follow up the move with a series of indices, dividing the market into three components (top, medium and small stocks) and into industrial and resources group. All will have a base date of December 31, 1990.</p>

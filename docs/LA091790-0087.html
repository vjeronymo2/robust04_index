			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Asahi Buying Stake in Australian Brewery: Japan's Asahi Breweries will pay $770  million for a 19.9% stake in Australia's largest company, Elders IXL, the maker  of Foster's beer. The linkup between Japan's second-largest brewery and Elders,  the world's No. 4 beer maker, paves the way for an Asian powerhouse in the  brewery business. Elders Chairman John Elliott agreed to sell 446.6 million  Elders shares held by his Harlin Holdings Ltd. and relinquish majority control  of the company in order to reduce a $1.6-billion debt.  </P></p>

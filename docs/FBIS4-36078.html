			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri have made separate telephone calls to  'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah. They discussed with  him the recent Zionist assaults on the Ba'labakk area.    Al-Hariri sent Lebanese Minister of State for Finance Fu'ad  Sinyurah to the headquarters of Hizballah's Consultative  Council. Sinyurah, speaking for the Lebanese Government,  affirmed that the government support for the resistance will  continue until the occupied territories are liberated.    Sinyurah announced: We express our appreciation for  Hizballah's martyrs who gave their lives to defend the homeland  and confront Israeli arrogance.    Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz described  the Zionists' recent brutal attacks on Ba'labakk as an attempt  to damage Syrian-Lebanese relations.    Speaking to the newspaper AL-SAFIR, Buwayz said that Israel  has lately been exerting pressure on the Lebanese Government to  make it halt the resistance operations against the Zionists in  south Lebanon. He pointed out, however, that the Lebanese  Government believes that as long as the Zionists occupy parts of  the Lebanese territory, resistance is the people's legitimate  right.    The Lebanese foreign minister referred to the total backing  that the Lebanese public and their various political factions  are giving to the resistance movement. He accused the United  Nations of weakness and inability to adopt firm resolutions to  halt the Zionist attacks on Lebanon.</p>

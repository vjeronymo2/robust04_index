			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Thorp's weak glow From electricity too cheap to meter to nuclear power stations which fail to find private buyers, atomic accountancy has a pretty shabby record. So it is right to greet British Nuclear Fuels' claim that the Thorp reprocessing plant will be a moneyspinner with scepticism. All the more so since it refuses to disclose the details of its calculations or contracts. Accountancy of deferred costs and contingent liabilities is a notoriously slippery subject - as firms such as British and Commonwealth have found out to their great cost. Far more information is needed to form a judgment on Thorp. BNF's public case for preferring Thorp to the alternative of storing fuel assumes that the capital costs of the plant are excluded since they are already spent. Yet even when the capital costs are, in effect, written off, the government is hardly rushing to apply market tests to the reprocessing plant. If Thorp is such a good deal, why are private companies not to be invited to tender for the project to recoup some of the money already spent? Why are so many in the electricity industry privately sceptical about Thorp? Why has Scottish Nuclear opted for dry storage of spent fuel once its existing contract with BNF expires? The worry must be that Thorp is not all that BNF cracks it up to be. BNF's cost-plus contracts are also under threat with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear trying to turn existing contracts into fixed-price deals. Other customers may follow suit. If they do, will the contingent risks lie with the government or BNF? Until such issues are resolved, there is no case for starting Thorp. If a suitably robust market solution is not found, there may never be.</p>

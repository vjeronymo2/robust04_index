			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Prices of Treasury notes and bonds suffered a series of blows at the end of last week as the market took fright at a second straight day of strong economic news. Thursday had already seen the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond shed almost a point in response to stronger than expected growth in consumer spending. Then on Friday, it lost nearly half a point more when the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production had jumped by 0.7 per cent in December compared with expectations of a figure nearer 0.4 per cent. After that, the coming week should look relatively tame. For a start, the market is closed today for Martin Luther King Memorial Day - and the rest of the week is likely to mark a hiatus after last week's activity as investors regroup in readiness for the release of the key data for January employment, due out on February 4. That said, the market will not be left without some data to chew over. The figures for November's trade deficit are expected to show a slight shrinkage from October's Dollars 10.5bn on Wednesday. On Thursday, December housing starts should show a slight fall from November's 1.43m and new filings for unemployment claims are expected to have stood at 325,000 in the week ended January 15.</p>

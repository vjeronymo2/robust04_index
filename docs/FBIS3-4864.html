A YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey showed that support fell sharply in  February to 58 percent, down 14.4 percentage points from the  previous month.    Meanwhile, the disapproval rate increased 11.6 points to  29.5  percent. Pollsters surveyed 3,000 eligible voters nationwide  from February 26 to 27 and got responses from 2,081, or 69  percent.    According to a separate nationwide survey carried out by the  ASAHI SHIMBUN, support fell to 57 percent from 60 percent  recorded in a December survey.    The paper got responses from 2,318 eligible voters out of a  sample of 3,000 surveyed from February 27 to 28.    It said strong support for Hosokawa personally appeared to  be  putting a brake on the slide in his cabinet's popularity, with  66 percent of respondents expressing confidence in the prime  minister's leadership abilities.    Both dailies noted that the Hosokawa cabinet remains  significantly more popular than previous Liberal Democratic  Party administrations.    But the YOMIURI said the plunge in support will come as a  heavy blow to a government that has relied on strong popular  approval ratings to compensate for its weak base in the Diet.</p>

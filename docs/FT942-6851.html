			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares hold steady in nervous trading session - Market report A calmer mood prevailed in the UK stock market yesterday as investors came to terms with the blood-letting of the previous session. Confidence was challenged again on three occasions when the FT-SE futures contract bounced on the 3,000 support level, but the stock market closed little changed after moving narrowly during the session. At the final reading of 3,019.7, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of only 1 point on the day. The FT-SE Mid 250, on the other hand, fell 13 points to 3,616.4 as the broader market waited for a more convincing lead from the blue chips. London opened firmly as a few bargain hunters were encouraged by improvement in the German bund. For a while, the UK stock market stood up against further falls in British government bonds, but it proved unable to do so when the stock index futures turned down. A gain of 10.5 on the Footsie turned to a fall of 16 within the first hour of trading, but 3,004.7 proved to be the day's low. For the rest of the session, the stock market followed the futures market, trying unsuccessfully to move ahead and dipping very briefly into negative territory again in mid-afternoon. The general picture was one of nervousness, and reports of some buying at lower levels by the big investment institution were not borne out by the trading volume statistics. However, some analysts believe that UK stocks are undervalued at current levels. Seaq-reported business of 613.5m shares compared with 646.1m on the previous session. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail business on Wednesday, when the Footsie dropped by 2.2 per cent, was worth Pounds 1.49bn, which was by no means a high volume figure. At least two trading programmes were identified, only one of which was of significant size. But for the most part, the London stock market continued to watch the European markets, which benefited from good inflation figures in Germany. Towards the close, shares brightened when Wall Street opened higher but the pace flagged as the Dow turned less decisive to show a minor fall as London closed down for the day. Traders commented that the market was beginning to slow down ahead of the holiday closure on Monday of markets in London and New York. Today brings further tests for the markets in the form of important reports on economic progress on both sides of the Atlantic. The Confederation of British Industries presents its monthly report on business trends in the domestic economy. Investors will look carefully for signs that export volumes are recovering with the improvement in economic activity in Europe. In the US, investors will today scan the gdp figures for the first quarter, and in particular the deflator figure which will give the Federal Reserve its latest guide to inflation pressure in the US economy. Traders warned that the equity market remains at the mercy of the bond markets which, in turn, are dependent upon trends in German and US fixed interest stocks. With German interest rates now evidently on hold for the time being, the focus is expected to be on the US markets. An unimpressive performance by the US dollar since last week's decisive hike in key rates has left markets fearing that the Fed may feel obliged to act again soon.</p>

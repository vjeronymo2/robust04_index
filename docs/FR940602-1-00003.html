The power supply borrower owns or controls generation and bulk transmission facilities. The distribution members own the facilities necessary to serve consumers on the retail level. Taken together, a power supply borrower and its distribution members are essentially one economic unit, similar to a typical investor-owned utility which owns or controls both the sources of production and the retail franchises. This unity of ownership and interest between the power supply cooperative and its owners has made possible a highly efficient capitalization structure uniquely suited to the needs of REA's constituency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution cooperatives entered into long term contracts to purchase all their power requirements from the power supply cooperative at the rates necessary to cover all the power supplier's costs, including debt service on its loans. These contracts, together with all other assets of the power supply cooperative, are pledged as security for billions of dollars of loans to the power supply cooperatives by the Government and private sector alike. The Government and other lenders have generally not required power suppliers to develop and maintain equity. As a result, consumers benefitted from lower electric rates,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While, in most cases, REA credit support requirements currently include the long term, all-requirements wholesale power contract and the first lien on all property including after acquired property, in several instances REA has required additional credit support in the form of guarantees from the G&amp;T's members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA is undertaking to review the requirement for credit support in connection with G&amp;T loans and loan guarantees. REA will be taking into consideration the G&amp;T profile and the projects undertaken by the G&amp;T. This profile includes some of the following characteristics: 100% debt financing from REA; equity considerations; and complex issues concerning their wholesale power contract agreements. REA financing of G&amp;T projects generally consists of primarily guarantees of FFB loans and lien accommodations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Credit Support Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA is requesting input on all factors that impact on the feasibility and risks associated with the borrower and the project to be financed. Factors to be considered may include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The regulatory climate (degree of regulation, regulatory body policies);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Economics of the service territory (consumer growth trends, consumer load diversity, revenue by consumer class),;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The power supply borrowers' current and future electric resource arrangement (capacity, fuel agreements, purchased power, generation statistics);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Construction and operating risk of the proposed facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Quality of management (strategic planning, consumer relations, experience, depth, capability, credibility, response to changing environment);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Whether the borrower is operating under a debt restructure agreement with REA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Impact on distribution member cooperative rates; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Rate competitiveness;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i Territorial integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Diversification activity and/or plans:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. Analysis of accounting practices vs. industry practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically requested on what factors should be considered, how the factors should be weighted, i.e. the ranking criteria, and on when REA should generally not require additional credit support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA anticipates reserving the right to require credit support on any loan or loan guarantee it deems necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Types of Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA is also requesting input on the forms of credit support REA should require under those circumstances where additional credit support is required. Respondents should consider, among others, in addition to the lien on wholesale power contracts and all system assets, the following types of support:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. G&amp;T member guarantees of loans made to a G&amp;T;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Guarantees by financial institutions of G&amp;T loans in lieu of member guarantees; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Letters of Credit obtained by members in lieu of a guarantee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA is also requesting comments and suggestions on the terms and conditions that would attach to such credit support. Comments are specifically requested on the concepts of joint and several liability of guarantors, liability caps, pro rata sharing of liability, acceleration of the support obligations under certain circumstances, collateralization, term, and termination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950(b); Public Law 99&hyph;591; Delegation of Authority by the Secretary of Agriculture, 7 CFR 2.23; Delegation of Authority by the Under Secretary of Small Community and Rural Development, 7 CFR 2.72.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bob J.

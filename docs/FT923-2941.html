			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Angel Chuan must prove strength / Assessing the future for the soft star of Thailand's anti-military camp UNLIKE his immediate predecessors, Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat party leader who expects to become prime minister of Thailand following Sunday's general election, is neither an army general nor a western-educated aristocrat. His father was a teacher and his mother a vegetable seller. 'I am an ordinary man who came from a rather poor family,' he said recently. 'During my younger days I had to collect rubber from the trees before going to school.' And, unlike some of its rivals, the Democrat party was not formed on the eve of the election for the convenience of a few influential politicians with short-term common interests; it was founded 46 years ago and is Thailand's oldest. The rise to prominence this week of Mr Chuan and the Democrats is an important but still tentative change of direction for contemporary Thai politics. The Democrats impressed many voters by their cautious handling of the clashes between the armed forces and pro-democracy demonstrators, which culminated in the killing of at least 50 protestors in May. They opposed military interference in politics and business, but attempted to resolve the dispute in parliament, warning of the dangers of street confrontations. They were rewarded with the largest bloc of seats in the 360-seat House of Representatives, increasing the number of their MPs to 79 from the 44 they won in the previous election and winning several Bangkok seats from the Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party of Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the fervent Buddhist who led the street protests. Just as Bangkok intellectuals have grown suspicious of what they regard as Mr Chamlong's political posturing, so have Thai entrepreneurs begun to distrust what they see as his idealistic egalitarianism. Foreign and local businessimmediately welcomed the probability that Mr Chuan would head a coalition centred on the parties that opposed the military in May. Yesterday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand gave a warm welcome to the results, with the SET index rising 2 per cent, to reach 817.95 points. The 54-year-old Mr Chuan, a lawyer by training, lacks economic expertise, but he has promised to reinforce existing policies aimed at liberalising trade; improving the competitiveness of Thailand's export industries; and diverting more resources to neglected regions. He will attempt to construct a coalition this week, and may choose a private sector technocrat - the names of several senior bankers are being bandied about - as finance minister. Mr Chuan, however, will need to overcome some formidable obstacles. He has been an elected MP for 23 years, and has held portfolios in nine previous governments, but his critics say he lacks initiative and has failed to shine in any of his ministerial posts. One western diplomat described him yesterday as a 'wimp'. Mr Chuan acknowledged the accusations in a campaign speech this month when he said he might be 'too soft and not aggressive', although he declared that 'when it comes to making decisions, I am resolute and strong.' In an earlier interview with The Nation newspaper, he said: 'Politeness is unfortunately seen sometimes as a weakness.' The Democrat party itself, although strengthened by popular and energetic activists such as Mr Apisit Vejjajiva, the Bangkok MP, is as prone to splits as other Thai parties and has never been a clear-cut success in government. Even more worrying for advocates of stable government will be the fragility of any coalition the Democrats are likely to create in their negotiations this week. The loose alliance of the four so-called 'angel parties', which opposed the military in May - the Democrats, Palang Dharma, the New Aspiration party and Solidarity - together has only 185 seats, or a majority of five, and the NAP is regarded as a weak link in the group. Mr Chuan is likely to bring in at least one smaller party, and possibly the Chart Pattana (National Development) party of Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, the former prime minister overthrown by the armed forces in the February 1991 coup d'etat. The reality is that the Democrats made many of their gains at the expense of their alliance partners, while Chart Thai (Thai Nation), a 'devil party' which supported the army, won 77 seats. The level of violence and vote-buying in the election campaign, in keeping with Thai tradition, also suggests that it will be some time before politicians such as Mr Chuan can safely claim to have consigned corruption and military coups to the history books.  --------------------------------------              THAI ELECTION  -------------------------------------- Official results: seats won on Sunday (March 22 election results in brackets)  -------------------------------------- Democrat               79     (44) Chart Thai             77     (74) Chart Pattana*         60      (-) New Aspiration         51     (72) Palang Dharma          47     (41) Social Action          22     (31) Seritham*               8      (-) Solidarity              8      (6) Muanchon                4      (1) Prachakorn Thai         3      (7) Rassadorn               1      (1)  -------------------------------------- *New party.

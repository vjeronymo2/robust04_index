			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Confusion still clouds dioxin debate Dioxins might be the world's most toxic poisons, but scientists are still unsure of precisely how dangerous they are to humans. The poisons  - a large family of related substances - are produced in minute quantities as a by-product of industrial activity in which chlorine is involved. Typical sources are wood-pulp processing, herbicide manufacture and waste incineration. Dioxins are emitted with other waste products and ingested by animals and absorbed by plants. Humans take in dioxins when they eat meat, fish and milk products. Early research showed that dioxins could cause cancer. Now some scientists suspect that the poisons can have a detrimental effect on the immune system and can retard physical and mental development in children. The lack of knowledge has direct effects on some businesses. European incinerator operators, for example, will soon have to make big - and they say expensive - reductions in their permitted dioxin emissions. Dioxins first came to public attention when they were found to be a contaminant in a defoliant called Agent Orange, used by the US during the Vietnam war. Some people who came into contact with the defoliant developed a skin condition called chlorachne, but there was no conclusive evidence that dioxins killed people. Nevertheless, scientific concern about the poison led to the evacuation of an entire community in Times Beach, Missouri after dioxins were found in a chemical waste dump nearby. More recently the Dutch authorities banned the sale of milk from cows that were grazing near a waste incinerator. And this year the UK government stopped the sale of milk from two farms in Derbyshire when high levels of dioxins were discovered in animals, milk and plants near an industrial plant. The World Health Authority in 1990 revised the safe levels for human consumption upwards to 0.01 nanograms per kilogram body weight per day. The level was increased after a panel of leading scientists decided that dioxins provided less of a threat to human health than at first thought. Last year a US report described the danger from dioxins as no more harmful that a week of sunbathing. But the US government is now in the process of revising the official view and it looks likely that dioxins soon will be back on the extreme danger list. The chlorine industry has been lobbying hard on both sides of the Atlantic to prevent stricter regulations. A review of global research into dioxins - by the industry-funded European Chemical Industry Ecology and Toxicology Centre - is due to be published this month. According to Peter Jones, a scientist who worked on the report: 'I think the dioxin issue has been overblown but I am not saying that it is unimportant. Some concern is certainly due, but not paranoia,' he says. But environmental campaigners are concerned about the increase in the number of incinerators and the continuing use of processes and chemicals that create dioxins. 'There are some powerful vested interests that are trying to cloud the issue,' says Rebecca Rees of the Women's Environmental Network. 'The most recent findings indicate that there is no tolerable level of dioxins for humans, even one molecule can trigger an effect in the body. In the long term we are looking for a phase-out of the chlorine industry,' she says.</p>

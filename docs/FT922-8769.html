			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / EC holds up Dollars 150m grants for Nigeria THE European Community said yesterday that Nigeria could not tap approved EC grants totalling about Dollars 150m (Pounds 84.7m) until it had International Monetary Fund approval for tough economic reforms, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'We need the approval in order to guarantee that Nigeria will make effective use of the money,' an EC official said. The money in question is an Ecu83.7m General Import Programme allocation and an Ecu40m export promotion grant. Nigeria, in the sixth year of free market economic reforms, is negotiating a new standby loan facility with the Fund. It does not draw on IMF facilities but needs IMF endorsement of its reforms to claim easier terms on its roughly Dollars 30bn foreign debt and to gain access to new funds. The reforms were introduced by military President Ibrahim Babangida to rescue an economy crippled by low oil prices, corruption and poor productivity. The IMF and Nigeria signed a 15-month, Dollars 450m credit deal in January 1991 but Lagos failed to win IMF approval last year under a mid-term review of the accord. It failed to meet IMF conditions such as public spending cuts and closing a gap between official and free market exchange rates for its naira currency. It has since taken steps to close the exchange rate gap.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FARMERS WORRIED BY EDISON MERGER;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: AN AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE SAYS A KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER AIR QUALITY  WILL WORSEN IF MORE POWER IS GENERATED IN THE COUNTY.  </P> <P> County farm leaders voiced strong concerns Wednesday about the possible effect  of a proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric on agriculture in Ventura County.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Agricultural Advisory Committee, describing a draft  environmental impact report on the proposed merger as too vague, voted to ask  the California Public Utilities Commission for a more thorough study of the  potential effects on farming.  </P> <P> The committee, which advises the County Board of Supervisors on agriculture  issues, said one key question to be answered is whether air quality in the  county will suffer if Edison generates more power in the county as a result of  the merger.  </P> <P> Other questions of concern to the committee are whether more pollution will  affect sensitive crops, whether the merger might generate more smog regulations  on farm equipment and how much more of the county's fresh water will be needed  to cool the power plants.  </P> <P> The draft environmental impact report is too vague when it comes to the  merger's potential effects on agriculture, committee members said. They agreed  to write a letter asking the PUC for more information in the final  environmental statement.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure that agriculture does not have to cut down on its  emissions to compensate for what Edison puts out," said Charles Schwabauer,  committee chairman and manager of Leavans Fairview Ranch in Moorpark.  </P> <P> "I don't really think we're opposed to the merger, but we don't want to find  that Ventura County will be adversely impacted for air quality," he said.  "Agriculture is usually not at odds with the Edison Co., but on the other hand  we don't want to have to be penalized for something we didn't do further down  the line."  </P> <P> The advisory committee of 10 ranchers is appointed by the Board of Supervisors  to review planning issues that affect agriculture. The committee advises the  board on development projects and planning policies.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of nervous farmers out there now" as a result of the drought and  the threat to agriculture from the Mediterranean fruit fly, Fillmore citrus  rancher Mary Ann Berrington said after the meeting.  </P> <P> Berrington, who is not a committee member, monitored the meeting for an east  Santa Clara Valley farm group that is seeking representation on the advisory  body for the Piru area. She had strong words against the merger.  </P> <P> "They are going to pollute the air in this county to give power to San Diego  County and all we get is dirty air," she said. "We're concerned if they allow  Edison to pollute, what are they going to require us to do? Put catalytic  converters on our tractors? Somebody will have to cut down on pollutions  somewhere."  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Schwabauer said more smog restrictions could be placed on  ranchers who operate stationary power plants, water pumps and all types of farm  engines that are not as closely regulated now in an effort to mitigate  pollution caused by the possible merger.  </P> <P> Some citrus growers still use diesel-burning smudge pots to keep crops from  freezing, Schwabauer said, and the devices might be regulated if the county's  smog level grows worse because of the merger.  </P> <P> Supervisor Susan K. Lacey demanded at a public hearing on the merger in Ventura  last week that Edison provide offsetting measures for every additional ton of  pollution that additional power generation might emit in the county.  </P> <P> By shifting some of its power production from San Diego County to Ventura  County, up to 200 more tons of pollutants per year could be added to the  county's air from Edison's two power plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay Bay in  Oxnard, county officials have said.  </P> <P> However, Edison officials are negotiating an agreement with the county's Air  Pollution Control District on how to offset the additional emissions. The  district is also drafting a regulation on electrical power generators which, if  approved by county supervisors, would require Edison to reduce the plants'  combined emissions 90% by 1996.  </P> <P> Public comment on the environmental impact report is being accepted by the PUC  through May 29 and a decision is expected on the merger by the end of the year.  </P></p>

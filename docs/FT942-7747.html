			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Slow start hits Ladbroke shares - Decrease in large bets on credit leaves gaming division lower The number of significant bets on credit made by high spending customers with Ladbroke fell in the first few months of the year hitting profits in its betting and gaming division. Shares in the hotels, betting and DIY group fell 16 1/2 p yesterday to close at 182 1/2 p after Mr John Jackson, chairman, told the annual meeting that overall group profits were 'currently below last year's level'. Credit betting 'had a poor start to the year', he said, and the division's profits were lower than last year. Credit betting is thought to account for about a quarter of the division's turnover. The peaks and troughs of credit gambling are similar to those faced by top casinos, which can rely on a tiny number of high spending customers for a large proportion of their profits. Mr Jackson said that the UK retail betting business had performed reasonably well, helped by the successful running of the 1994 Grand National. Both the average amount staked and the number of bets were ahead in the first four months, lifting turnover by 5 per cent. The shares hit 208p shortly after the announcement of the preliminary results in early March, before retreating to 181p in early May. They started to climb to Friday's close of 199p in the hope of some good news from the AGM. However, the chairman's statement at the London Hilton yesterday morning proved to be disappointing. Mr Jackson warned that while Texas Homecare sales were 3.5 per cent higher compared with the first four months of last year, profits were significantly lower. Operating profits at Hilton International were slightly ahead, with overall occupancy similar to last year and better average room rates. The property division experienced reduced rental income following disposals. Negotiation on further sales continue, and the group would be making further progress in reducing its investment in commercial property for the rest of this year. Ladbroke was emerging from a period of considerable change, Mr Jackson said. While profits were below last year's levels, 'they are in line with the board's expectations. The board continues to look forward to the future with confidence'.</p>

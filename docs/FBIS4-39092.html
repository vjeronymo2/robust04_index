			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 4 Jun -- The beginning of a well-organized  and directed campaign of terror against the Russian military  contingent in Tajikistan was how Lieutenant General Anatoliy  Chechulin, commander of the Russian border troops in the  Republic, saw the killing of seven Russians, including five  senior officers, two of whom were border guards. All the  murders were committed over a short period, from 31 May to 4  June.    Speaking today at an emergency press conference in Dushanbe,  the commander declared that the border guard leadership "does  not intend to tolerate any more blows from behind and is  adopting the most decisive measures to ensure the armed  protection of its servicemen both at their duty station and at  their family residences." Anatoliy Chechulin said that other  action was also to be taken to ensure the servicemen's personal  security. Authorized weapons and standard-issue military  hardware were being made available for the protection of Russian  citizens.    The commander demanded that Tajikistan's law-and-order  bodies  should adopt all possible measures to catch the criminals, as  well as a strict and objective investigation. "The criminals,"  declared Gen. Chechulin, "must be brought to justice for what  they have done."</p>

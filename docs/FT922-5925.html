			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Prudential cuts cash bonuses for executives UNDER a new share scheme for senior executives of the Prudential, the UK's largest life assurance company, the maximum bonus receivable in cash has been reduced from 50 per cent to 15 per cent of basic salary. Shareholders were told the details at yesterday's annual meeting. The change has been made following a row last year about the remuneration received by Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive. It involves a 40 per cent reduction in bonuses and an even sharper fall in the amount of the bonus receivable in the form of cash. Sir Brian Corby, chairman, explained that the aim was to 'link the remuneration of senior executives to long-term performance.' If recipients choose to buy Prudential shares with their bonus the company will match the amount with an equal number of shares. These extra shares, however, cannot be sold for at least five years.</p>

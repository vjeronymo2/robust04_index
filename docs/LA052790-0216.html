			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO REPORTEDLY TO SEEK EXTRADITION OF DEA OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Mexico will seek the arrest and extradition of a Drug Enforcement  Administration official for his role in the abduction of a Mexican physician  facing trial in the death of a U.S. drug agent, according to news reports.  </P> <P> Mexico City newspapers reported Saturday that the attorney general's office  will seek the extradition of DEA supervisor Hector Berrellez, for alleged  involvement in the kidnaping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain. The physician  faces trial for alleged participation in the 1985 slaying of DEA agent Enrique  Camarena.  </P> <P> Berrellez testified Friday at a federal hearing in Los Angeles that up to  $50,000 was authorized for the capture of Alvarez. He said that DEA Deputy  Director Pete Gruden knew of the plan.  </P> <P> The seizure of the doctor from his office has caused tension between the U.S.  and Mexican governments. Mexico has demanded his return, saying his delivery to  the United States violated Mexican sovereignty.  </P> <P> Alvarez, a Guadalajara gynecologist, was arrested April 3 after being taken to  El Paso to face charges that he administered drugs to Camarena during the  kidnaping, torture and murder of the drug agent and his pilot.  </P> <P> DEA spokesman Frank Shults in Washington denied that the government offered a  reward for the people who captured Alvarez, saying the $20,000 payment was for  "services." He said it could have covered such things as rental of the plane  that flew Alvarez to El Paso.  </P> <P> Former Mexican police officer Antonio Garate Bustamante, who is wanted by the  Mexican government, testified he paid $20,000 in DEA money to the people who  captured Alvarez, and was continuing to pay their expenses.  </P> <P> Garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the border with the  approval of DEA officials. He said he found friends who would do the job  without advance payment.  </P> <P> "I told them that no money would be provided up front, and they would have no  assistance from the DEA," he said. "Whatever they were doing they were doing on  their own."  </P> <P> The attorney general's office said Friday that it would present formal  accusations against Berrellez and Garate in a Mexico City district court,  according to news reports. After obtaining warrants, it will present the  accusations to the Foreign Ministry to seek the official's extradition, the  newspapers said.  </P> <P> Mexican officials call Garate the "connection" between DEA officials and the  Mexicans who abducted Alvarez, the news reports said.  </P> <P> On April 28, the attorney general's office announced the arrest of six people  for alleged involvement in Alvarez's capture.  </P> <P> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Friday that the abduction "does not  help in the fight against drug smuggling."  </P> <P> Speaking in the northern state of Chihuahua, Salinas said that the U.S. and  Mexican governments should conduct themselves with mutual respect.  </P> <P> Testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that Camarena was  tortured and interrogated by drug lords. Prosecutors maintain Alvarez gave  Camarena drugs to revive him for additional torture before his slaying.  </P> <P> The drug lords reportedly were angered because Camarena's undercover work had  led U.S. and Mexican authorities to a desert marijuana plantation, where they  seized 10,000 tons of the drug worth billions of dollars.  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soviet uranium sales target 'impossible' URANIUM MARKET analysts yesterday said it was impossible for the former Soviet Union's Atomic Energy Ministry to make good its objective of boosting uranium exports this year from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1.5bn. 'They haven't a cat's chance in hell of doing that,' said Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation and chairman of the Uranium Institute's committee studying supply and demand. Other analysts pointed out that the west's requirement for uranium was 120m to 130m lbs a year. Exports from the former Soviet Union had already sent prices to 40-year lows. At present prices the ministry's target implied that it aimed to sell more than 150m lbs of uranium oxide in the west in 1992. Even if some of the material was highly-enriched uranium, commanding a higher price because it required no further processing before use by power stations, the target was unreachable. Analysts said the ministry, which is still operating despite the break-up of the Soviet Union, was 'sabre rattling' to retaliate against allegations in the US and Europe that it was dumping uranium in those markets. One suggested: 'This is shock therapy aimed at the US producers to underscore the fact that the former Soviet Union is serious about selling fuel to the west and won't be blocked by any anti-dumping case in the States'. The former Soviet Union had about 400m lbs of uranium in strategic stocks, according to a paper presented by Nuexco, the US nuclear market consultancy organisation, last year. Of the total, only about 40m lbs was of commercial quality and available for sale. About 240m lbs was highly-enriched uranium and the rest was held by domestic power plants. Uranium has only one application - for nuclear energy. It is mined it four Soviet republics: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Mr Albert Shishkin, head of the Atomic Energy Ministry's export division, pointed out last week that the republics accounted for 45 per cent of the world's known uranium reserves and 25 to 30 per cent of the mining, processing and enriching capacity. Yet they accounted for only 6 per cent of uranium world production. He issued a thinly-veiled threat that anti-trust action by the US and Europe might drive the ministry to seek other markets 'where it is much harder to carry out full control over the distribution of radioactive products'.</p>

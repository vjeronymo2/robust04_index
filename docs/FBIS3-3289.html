We  have invited the responsible persons of the People's Bank of  China to answer your questions on reform and development in  China's banking system. Attending today's news conference are  Zhou Zhengqing, Dai Xianglong, and Chen Yuan, vice governors of  the People's Bank of China.    [Zhou] Today, I and my colleagues are ready to exchange  views with you on issues of interest to you and to answer your  questions.    [Unidenified correspondent] I am a reporter from JINGJI  RIBAO. Governor Zhou [as heard], what do you think of the  results of rectifying the financial order and of actual  difficulties currently faced by enterprises?    [Zhou] As you know, China's economy began to enter a new  stage of rapid development in 1992. China's economy grew by  about 13 percent for two consecutive years, and new progress has  been made by all sectors of the national economy. Of course,  some new situations and new problems have cropped up in the  course of rapid growth. The main problems are as follows:  investment in fixed assets increased excessively. Moreover,  the investment structure in this area was irrational. In  monetary matters, an excessive amount of currency was put into  circulation. Moreover, irregularities such as indiscriminate  fund-raising activities and inter-bank lending emerged. As a  result, the financial order was plagued by chaos. To deal with  these situations and new problems which emerged in the course of  economic operations, the party Central Committee and the State  Council promptly adopted a measure to strengthen macroeconomic  regulation and control by stressing the method of deepening  reform and of using economic and legal means to rectify the  financial order. The chaotic situation in the financial order  was quickly reversed. The main indications in the reversal of  the situation are: 1. Excessive issuance of currency was  effectively checked. The amount of residents' savings deposits  rebounded quickly and increased considerably. Last year urban  and rual savings deposits rose by 320 billion yuan; 2. We have  done well in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control.  We regulated the structure and use of loans to ensure that  there was capital for key projects of the national economy. As  you know, last year there was an ample supply of funds for the  purchasing of farm and sideline products, and the practice of  writing IOU's disappeared. Ninety-nine percent of the state key  projects were ensured of funds. The situation in which large  and medium enterprises, including those involved in foreign  trade, were short of working funds was alleviated; 3. The  exchange rate remained stable. The rate between the U.S. dollar  and renminbi remained at 8.7 renminbi to the dollar. 4.  Irregularities such as indiscriminate fund-raising activities  and inter-bank lending were effectively checked. At the same  time, various measures for banking reform have been introduced  gradually, and have been implemented very well.    [Unidentified correspondent from DPA in English, fading  into Mandarin translation] I am a correspondent from Germany.  Since China unified the exchange rates, some units have raised  their charges by 50 percent. For example, some telephone  companies have done so, and the service bureaus for diplomats  usually charge in U.S. dollars instead of renminbi. I wonder  whether the officials also justify this. There are now two sets  of prices in China: one for the Chinese and the other for  foreigners. This is obviously against the circular issued by  the central bank. My question is: Whether the People's Bank of  China has taken some measures to check the practice of two  prices?    [Chen] We maintain that the unification of exchange rates  has not caused price fluctuations in general, but the problem of  price hikes did emerge following the unification of exchange  rates. Government departments concerned are investigating this  problem to ascertain the situation and will launch necessary  checks and rectification. Although this problem relates to the  reform of exchange rates, it is not completely the Central  Bank's responsibility. We have also received some complaints  about this problem from foreign banks and organs and have  addressed their opinions to department concerned. I hope this  problem will be settled properly while reform proceeds further.    [Unidentified Correspondent] I am a correspondent from  JINRONG SHIBAO [FINANCIAL TIMES]. A package of measures for  economic reform were presented successively from the end of last  year to the beginning of this year, and banking reform is the  most important among them. Vice Governor Zhou, could you  elaborate on the focal points of this year's banking reform and  tell us what kinds of difficulties may be encountered in the  course of implementing the reform? Thank you.    [Zhou] The goals for this year's banking reform can be  generally summed up as establishing three systems and  accomplishing two tasks in real earnest. The establishment of  three systems means: 1. Establish a powerful and effective  macroeconomic regulation and control system governed by the  central bank; 2. Establish an organizational system with  state-owned commercial banks as the mainstay, whereas various  kinds of banking institutions are also included; 3. Establish a  banking market system that is unified and open, allows orderly  competition, and is strictly administered. Accomplishing two  tasks in real earnest means constructing the People's Bank of  China into a genuine central bank and constructing the existing  state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks.  This is certainly the goal of our reform. To attain this goal,  we should advance step by step and pay attention to three issues  in the course of proceeding reform: 1. In the course of  shifting from the old mechanism to the new one, it is necessary  to control aggregate credit and forestall the cropping up of  serious inflation. Aggregate credit must be controlled. 3. [as  heard] Banking reform must closely keep pace with the drafting  of banking laws and regulations and be carried out in an orderly  manner. I would like to disclose some information to you: We  are now working hard to draft and, by going through legal  procedures, strive for the passage of the central bank law,  commercial bank law, securities law, law on negotiable  instruments, insurance law, and a series of banking laws and  regulations in the second half of this year.    [Unidentified correspondent] Vice Governor Zhou, I am a Hong  Kong correspondent. A great quantity of Hong Kong currency is  circulated in the Zhujiang Delta, particularly in Shenzhen and  Zhuhai. It has been learned that the People's Bank is going to  end situation -- to make the Hong Kong currency flow back to  Hong Kong. Does the People's Bank have any measures in this  regard now?    [Zhou] China has been asserting and reiterating its demand  in  the reform of the foreign exchange system that foreign  currencies may not be used in quoting prices, settling accounts,  and may not be circulated in Chinese territory. In handling  some specific problems in localities which have frequent  contacts with Hong Kong and Macao areas, such as the Shenzhen  Special Economic Zone, we will take Hong Kong's and Macao's  economic development into consideration and take some specific  measures to resolve the problems. Hong Kong's financial  management authorities have addressed the situation to the  People's Bank of China. We have been informed.    [Unidentified CCTV Correspondent] I am a reporter from the  Central Television Station. A few minutes ago, Vice Governor  Zhou said one of the important aspects of the reform of the  banking system in China is turning existing specialized banks  into state-owned commercial banks. May I ask how do you  transform specialized banks into commercial ones? Can you tell  us some specific methods?    [Zhou] In establishing state-owned commercial banks, first  it is necessary to separate the policy-lending functions  belonging to state-owned specialized banks. We plan to  establish three policy-lending banks to undertake the task of  granting loans allowed by policies. Once the policy-lending  functions are separated from specialized banks, they should  operate step by step in line with the principles commonly  practiced by commercial banks around the world and organize  their loans and assets in acccordance with the principles of  fluidity, effectiveness, and safety. Beginning this year, the  Central Bank has distributed relevant regulations and procedures  regarding management of the proportions of assets and  liabilities and management of risks in commercial banks. Now,  the commercial banks should act upon these requirements. First  of all, they should start by transforming their operating  mechanisms and gradually standardize their activities and  improve their management in accordance with the requirement on  the management of the proprotions of assets and liabilities and  the requirement of the risk responsibility system. However, to  achieve the goal of becoming commercial banks, we should proceed  step by step. Success cannot come overnight.    [JOURNAL OF COMMERCE correspondent in English, fading into  Mandarin translation] I am a reporter from the JOURNAL OF  COMMERCE. Last year, you said China carried out macroeconomic  regulation and control. Is it necessary to further inject money  into these state-owned enterprises? And if money is injected,  will this lead to the aggravation of inflation?    [Dai] The Central Bank has been pursuing a steady and stable  monetary policy for years. It has neither adopted a strict  policy to limit the growth of the money supply nor has it  adopted an easy money policy to ensure steady economic growth.  In July and August last year, we adopted a correct policy to  appropriately increase loans to large and medium-sized  enterprises to undertake the construction of key state projects.  As a result, the economy grew steadily. In January this year,  we succeeded very well in recovering Central Bank loans. As of  now, nearly 90 percent of the currency issued by the Central  Bank from 1 January to the Spring Festival has been recovered.  We expect all can be recovered by the end of March.    [XINHUA correspondent] I am a reporter from XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY. Governor Zhou, what specific measures has the People's  Bank taken to control inflation this year?    [Zhou] An important function of the Central Bank is to  stabilize the value of the renminbi. Therefore, we are paying  special attention to the current inflationary pressure. To  preserve the value of the renminbi, I think, it is -- speaking  of the overall economic situation as a whole -- necessary to  strictly control the scale of investment in fixed assets. At  the same time, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of  taking agriculture as the foundation of the economy and to  ensure a steady growth in the output of grain, cotton, oil- and  sugar-bearing crops, meat, and vegetables so as to develop all  sectors of the rural economy. At the same time, it is also  necessary to achieve a basic balance between total supply and  total demand. To ensure that the value of the renminbi remains  stable, we will adopt four measures: First, we will strictly  control total credit in society, especially controlling the  increase in the total amount of loans for use in fixed asset  investment; no one is allowed to exceed the ceiling prescribed  by regulations. Second, it is necessary to control the increase  of the money supply and to make vigorous efforts to recover  currency from circulation. Third, beginning this year, the  Central Bank will no longer grant loans to enterprises or  institutions with financial deficits. Fourth, it is necessary  to strengthen monetary supervision and management to prevent the  recurrence of the financial chaos in the first half of last year  in which indiscriminate fund-raising activities and inter-bank  lending were rampant. I am convinced so long as the Central  Bank seriously carries out these four measures, the value of the  renminbi will remain stable.    [Moderator] The news conference concludes here. Thanks to  all.</p>

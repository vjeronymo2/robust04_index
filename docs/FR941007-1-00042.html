			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Also, Standard No. 213 has been amended to require either of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following labels on rear-facing infant seats or on child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraints that can be converted for use in a rear-facing infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mode: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> WARNING: PLACE THIS RESTRAINT IN A VEHICLE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> or <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> WARNING: WHEN YOUR BABY'S SIZE REQUIRES THAT THIS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RESTRAINT BE USED SO THAT YOUR BABY FACES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE, PLACE THE RESTRAINT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IN A VEHICLE SEAT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR BAG <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The first warning is to be used for child seats that are rear-facing only, and the second warning is to be used for infant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seats that convert from forward-facing to rear-facing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the language of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labels need not be amended. Manufacturers of child restraint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems are required to state in the printed instructions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanying the restraint that the safest location for any child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint is in the rear seat, regardless of whether the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an air bag. In addition, NHTSA is concerned that changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the language to clarify that the warning does not apply when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air bag can be deactivated will lessen the impact of the message  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the public. Since not all vehicles may be equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutoff devices, NHTSA is concerned that the result of lessening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact of the message would be the placement of an infant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a seating position with an air bag that cannot be deactivated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Phase-out of Manual Cutoff Devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has tentatively concluded that use of manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutoff devices should not be permitted indefinitely. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has also tentatively concluded that vehicles with air bags having  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manual cutoff devices should not be counted toward compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the phase-in for air bags. Further, manual cutoff devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be prohibited in all passenger cars manufactured on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after September 1, 1997, and all light trucks manufactured on or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after September 1, 1998. These are the dates on which 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent compliance is required by 49 U.S.C. 30127. To implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposals, NHTSA would amend S4.1.5.1(b)'s definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ``inflatable restraint system,'' a term used in the paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to the air bag requirements, to state that it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include an air bag that can be deactivated by a manual cutoff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This several year period would give manufacturers time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop and introduce automatic devices. Automatic technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would reduce the potential problem with either intentional or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental misuse of these devices to deactivate an air bag at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> times other than when a rear-facing infant restraint is in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seat. The agency is optimistic that new automatic sensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology will soon be available to deactivate an air bag in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain situations, or to modify the deployment rate of the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bag according to the speed of the impact or the distance between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the air bag and the occupant to be protected. NHTSA encourages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle manufacturers and suppliers to continue and accelerate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their efforts to develop such technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shopping for European expansion  -Ronald van de Krol finds Ahold seeking acquisitions closer to home INVESTORS pondering the question of where Ahold, the acquisitive Dutch supermarket group, is likely to make its next significant purchase have a yet wider range of possibilities on which to place their bets. Ahold, the Netherlands' dominant food retailer, which already generates half its sales in the US, is rapidly building up a presence in two virgin territories, Portugal and the Czech Republic. In Portugal, Ahold has recently concluded a series of deals with new joint-venture partner, Jeronimo Martins, making it the second-largest food retailer in the country in just 12 months. In the Czech Republic, Ahold has taken advantage of the country's privatisation programme to build up a 23-store chain. By the end of the year it hopes to have 30 stores. Concerted expansion in Europe is a new phenomenon for Ahold, whose acquisitions outside the Netherlands have focused until recently on the US, where it owns more than 500 supermarkets in the Boston-Chicago-Atlanta triangle. The stores are spread mainly over four well-known supermarket chains: First National, BI-LO, Giant and Tops, the last of which was acquired in 1991. Mr Cees van der Hoeven, Ahold's former finance director and now president, says the company sought to spread its risks and build up a balanced portfolio of companies. However, whether it invests in the US or in Europe will depend on available opportunities, not on the pursuit of pre-determined targets for geographic spread. Southern Europe is particularly attractive because of expectations of high growth, he says, but the company is casting its net widely. 'Ideally, I think in a number of years' time we should have operations in a number of European countries. But by the same token, we should also have further growth in the US,' says Mr van der Hoeven. He says Ahold is in contact with potential acquisition candidates in the US. In Europe, it is in constant touch with at least three companies interested in pursuing ideas for business partnerships. The timing of any big acquisition will determine whether financing is by equity or debt, Mr van der Hoeven says. In the spring, Ahold made a Fl 450m (Dollars 238.1m) rights issue to strengthen shareholders' equity after its recent string of acquisitions. Ahold's expansion in Europe is proceeding quite differently from its US experience. In the US, Ahold grew by gradual expansion in 12 contiguous eastern states, creating opportunities for co-operation between the various chains in advertising, warehousing, distribution, private labels and merchandising. If this pattern could be followed in Europe, acquisitions in neighbouring Germany and Belgium would be logical, but prospective candidates are expensive and difficult to find. Instead, Ahold has chosen two very different, far-flung markets to gain its first European footholds. 'There is some synergy in Europe, though admittedly less than in the States,' he says. For instance, the Portuguese joint-venture has joined the Associated Market Services alliance, which groups 11 top European food retailers, including Argyll of Britain, Casino of France and Ahold itself. Further synergy is created by the transfer of know-how in systems and distribution to the Portuguese and Czech stores. Mr van der Hoeven estimates that Portugal could eventually account for a sizeable share of Ahold's annual sales, though probably not more than 10 per cent of the total. The Czech Republic - a longer-term proposition - will probably not come close to reaching this 10 per cent level, he says. Unlike in the US, Ahold has chosen to expand in Portugal by way of a joint-venture. Such arrangements are less common in the US, where people prefer to know who 'the boss' is. In its joint venture with Jeronimo Martins, the Dutch company holds 49 per cent of the shares, but its voting power is equal to that of its 51 per cent partner. All told, the two companies own 45 'Pingo Doce' supermarkets; another 40 stores to be given the Pingo Doce name; three Feira Nova hypermarkets; and the 54-store Ino Supermercados chain of smaller grocery stores. These stores have a combined annual turnover equivalent to Dollars 900m. For all the excitement surrounding Europe's single market, Ahold does not believe that exporting supermarket formulae from one country to another will work, because each culture has its own way of presenting food. In Spain, hypermarkets are a fixture in the food retailing landscape; in the Netherlands, they are not. Mr van der Hoeven says: 'Although Spaniards will be drinking Coca-Cola, eating Campbell Soup and using Heinz ketchup and Nestle chocolate, they will shop in a different environment.'</p>

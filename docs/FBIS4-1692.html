			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said here today that Russia will join NATO's  partnership for peace program in late April.    According to an INTERFAX report, Kozyrev made the remarks at  a press conference after meeting UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali at the airport.    He said the program accords with Russia's demand for  establishing a partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO). However he added that by no means will  Russia join NATO itself.    He said that to join the program is an important part of  Russia's partnership strategy of Europe.    Kozyrev said suggestions by President Boris Yeltsin's  spokesman that it would take Russia six or seven months to join  the partnership for peace program referred only to the  implementation of the partnership, not to the signing of the  agreement itself.    Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told  reporters Thursday that it may take Russia six or seven months  to make a final decision on joining NATO's partnership for peace  program.    So far 14 east European countries have signed up for the  partnership program, launched at the NATO summit in January in  order to establish closer military links between the western  alliance and East European countries.</p>

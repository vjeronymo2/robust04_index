			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (5): R&amp;D spending holds up - Six companies canvassed by the FT indicate that product development is buoyant in spite of lower output / Money for Development It may not be much consolation to engineering workers who have lost their jobs over the past three years, but an informal Financial Times survey does at least suggest that the cuts in manufacturing have not been repeated in product development, writes Andrew Baxter. The six engineering companies which the FT has been tracking out of recession all have high hopes from new or recent product introductions. They will be hoping to continue the British tradition of innovation in engineering while avoiding the other great British practice of failing to profit from it. There are all sorts of reasons why that has happened, including the lack of finance available to help innovators turn an idea into money and other external factors such as a comparatively unfavourable tax regime for encouraging research and development. 'Culturally we are a nation of innovators, we have been for many, many generations,' says Mr Mark Abrahams, Fenner's finance director. 'Where we have failed as a nation is in marketing, we do the clever bit and we let other people take it away.' Dr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, says part of the problem is that innovation is an individualistic activity and marketing is a group activity. 'We are much better as a nation of individuals than we are working in groups, which is almost the reverse of the case with the Japanese.' Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich Engineering, even talks about the 'myth' of Japanese engineering - they are very good at applying new ideas but not the best original engineers. Bloxwich, for example, has developed a process for making one-piece car power train pulleys - they are normally two-piece and welded together, which can cause corrosion problems. After an 'enormous' R&amp;D programme, it is now negotiating to sell the pulleys into Japan, where manufacturers have been unable to produce it. These are some of the new products which the FT Six have recently developed and hope will have a big impact financially: FENNER: the Hull-based industrial group's fluid power division has developed a vapour recovery pump for garage forecourts, in response to legislation that is already enacted in German and Sweden and likely in most of the developed world, to remove potentially carcinogenic vapours. Mr Abrahams says that, with 2.5m petrol pumps in the developed world, the potential is 'really quite enormous.' There are rival products, but the clever bit about Fenner's pump, he says, is its ability both to compress vapour and to take neat liquid down a coaxial pipe without jamming. 600 GROUP: the machine tool and materials handling equipment group has been active in both the traditional and more high-tech ends of its business. Next month it unveils its new Tornado range of CNC lathes after an unprecedented market research exercise designed to match the product to the needs of small engineering companies. It has also recently introduced a laser marker which Dr Gaskell believes has 'enormous potential' because of its versatility. 'You can struggle your way out of almost anything if you've got the right products at the right time,' he says. 'If you research the market right and you've got a distribution network, and you've got the right product, hopefully it will go, and that's what we are doing.' JCB: the UK's biggest construction equipment producer has invested heavily over in new product development over the last three years, and mostly in smaller machines where the market is fast growing, says Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive. Last month in Spain JCB rolled out seven new products and it's a very exciting time for the company, says Mr Coyne. The pace of new product development has been maintained, and indeed the recession is a good time to be launching and preparing new products, he says. In recent years the much expanded presence of Caterpillar, the industry's biggest producer, has produced very serious competition for the first time at the smaller end of the market where JCB mainly operates. But JCB hopes to hit back at the larger end of the market with two big new wheeled-loaders. BLOXWICH: the manufacturer of vehicle and other parts is still in business only because over the last 10 years it has been concentrating on R&amp;D and new designs, says Mr Burton. In its security seals business, Bloxwich decided six years ago to build its own range of metal seals and related manufacturing equipment, ending the need to pay royalties to a US licensor. On the automotive side, Bloxwich is a big producer of door checks, one of the hundreds of car parts which only get noticed if they start making a noise. The company recently developed what Mr Burton calls the best door check in the world through innovative designs of plastic materials. 'We believe that this product will take off,' he says. SENIOR: the tubing, ductwork and specialist engineering group has 'bought in' its major innovation in the past three years through the 1992 acquisition of Flexonics in the US, but has developed its new business quickly since then, says Mr John Bell, chief executive. Flexonics makes a range of flexible hoses and expansion joints used for example in exhaust systems in the the automotive industry. Investment in the new business has continued and Flexonics is now supplying the Japanese transplants in the US as well as the Big Three. 'We have also brought the technology into the UK we are one of the few companies that can boast we have opened a greenfield factory in the past year,' says Mr Bell. POSIVA: the Scunthorpe-based company sells gears and drives produced by its German parent, and Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director, says innovation does not stop at new product development. His innovation has been to take a fresh approach to marketing. 'I increased the number of people I had to sell the products, to at least maintain my market share. We also concentrated on products coming through which had not previously sold very heavily in the UK.' New product devlopment in Germany, meanwhile, has continued apace, with recent offerings including a range of flexible couplings for off-the-road vehicles, which Mr Bricknell says is innovative and also good value.</p>

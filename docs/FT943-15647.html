			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Trump takes the Empire State Mr Donald Trump, casino operator, property developer and unrivalled exponent of the art of self-promotion, yesterday achieved his greatest coup yet by announcing that he had bought New York's famed Empire State Building - or at least half of it, writes Richard Tomkins from New York. He has entered into a 50-50 joint venture with a secretive group of Asian and European investors who, it emerged yesterday, had quietly acquired ownership of the Manhattan office block from a wealthy New York family in 1991. 'This is a great deal for me,' said Mr Trump. 'It solidifies my position as New York's Native Son. I get 50 per cent of all the upside and I intend to make my position worth a fortune.' Although world-renowned for its awe-inspiring height and architectural design, the Empire State Building is not regarded as a particularly lucrative piece of real estate because it is encumbered by a lease that runs until 2075. The Asian and European investors are believed to have acquired it for barely Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m). Sources close to Mr Trump, however, suggest that he may try to regain control of the building by claiming the leaseholder is in default. The lease specifies the building should be a class A office building, the sources say, but instead, it is occupied by about 800 small businesses, mainly in the clothing industry.</p>

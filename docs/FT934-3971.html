			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Seoul braced for rice protests The South Korean government is braced for possible violent protests after reports emerged from Geneva that the government had agreed in principle to open the country's rice market as part of the Uruguay Round of trade talks. Police are being placed on alert for a mass rally by farmers today in central Seoul to protest at the decision. Korea is seeking a 10-year grace period before adopting a system of tariffs protecting local farmers. During this time, it would allow minimum access to foreign rice, rising from 3 per cent of total rice consumption at the outset to 5 per cent at the end of the grace period. Korean negotiators are also pressing for a moratorium on introduction of the minimum access arrangement. Pressure on Korea to reach a compromise has mounted strongly over the past week as it has become clear that Japan, which also has a ban on rice imports, has negotiated a six-year moratorium, with market access rising from 4 to 8 per cent. International trade negotiators have been increasingly unwilling to regard Korea as a developing country, and thus concede to it the 'special and differential status' which allows poorer countries to seek exemption from Gatt rules. In parallel with the rice issue, it has faced extreme pressure to open its financial services markets. Top US Treasury negotiators arrived in Geneva yesterday to tackle this issue not just with Korea, but with Japan and other newly industrialising Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The rice issue has posed the toughest political challenge to President Kim Young-sam since he came to office in February and threatens to damage his popularity. Mr Kim has until now enjoyed wide public support because of his political reforms. The president's decision to open the rice market is seen as a key test of his commitment to make the centralised and protectionist economy more outward looking. Government officials explained that Korea had little choice but to lift its rice import ban if it was to avoid retaliatory measures against exports of its manufactured goods. Korea has barred foreign rice by arguing that imports would threaten the survival of at least a fifth of the nation's 6m farmers. Rice, which accounts for 22 per cent of total farm produce, is the country's most important agricultural product.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAULEY LEARNS TO BANISH HIVES  </P> <P> Jane Pauley has had it all -- even hives.  </P> <P> The former "Today" co-host, now a fill-in anchor on the "NBC Nightly News,"  told New York magazine that at age 7, she broke into hives after being punished  for another child's prank.  </P> <P> "My eyes swelled up or something glamorous like that and my mother had to take  me home from school," she said. "Later she took me to a specialist who said  that I was a nervous child who would have to be careful my whole life."  </P> <P> Pauley added: 'This is good information for a kid who is anxious about life.  Instead I grew up to do live television. I think it's kind of funny."  </P> <P> Pauley got over her problems with hives and headaches years ago, the magazine  reported in its July 23 issue.  </P></p>

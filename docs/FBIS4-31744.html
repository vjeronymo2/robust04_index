			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(is)"-signed report: "Abolishing Clearing Is, Perhaps, </F> More To Be Expected From the Czech Side"]    [Text] Bratislava -- According to CTK, Economy Minister P.  Magvasi has expressed himself in favor of abolishing clearing  between Slovakia and the Czech Republic [CR]. He based his  statement, among other things, on the positive increase in the  two states' foreign currency reserves. In that connection,  Deputy Prime Minister B. Schmognerova told CTK that, in a  memorandum to the IMF, the Slovak Government committed itself to  rendering accounts in convertible currencies in trade with the  Czech Republic by the end of 1995 at the latest.    Slovak National Bank (NBS) Deputy Governor M. Jusko has told  SME that, officially, the Slovak Republic only declared that it  is interested in abolishing the so-called clearing account  old-block. Unfortunately, in this context, the two governments  have adopted resolutions that are not consistent with each  other. M. Jusko sees three possible alternatives. First, that  the governments will agree upon an acceptable compromise.  Second, that one of the sides will make concessions. The third  alternative would be if one of the sides, in harmony with its  interests, were to make a sovereign decision and withdraw  unilaterally from the payments agreement. According to M. Jusko,  the fact that the CR is striving to introduce a fully  convertible currency quickly means that interest in abolishing  the payments agreement will come more from the Czech side. On  the other hand, in view of the fact that the foreign currency  reserves are increasing and that measures to liberalize foreign  currency relations may be expected, "we also must consider  certain steps that do not have to be in harmony with the  payments agreement," added M. Jusko.    According to M. Jusko, the situation in clearing is  favorable  for the NBS at the moment. The overall balance recently  amounted to around 44 million ECU in Slovakia's favor.</p>

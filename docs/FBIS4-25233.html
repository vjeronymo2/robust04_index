			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["New Talks" column article: "Is the DPRK Situation Changing </F> Its Course of Development?"]    [Text] What U.S. President Bill Clinton talked about when  he was interviewed by the CBS network television on board the  aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which anchored in French  waters, was the current DPRK situation and not the landings of  Allied forces on Normandy 50 years ago. This shows that the  world after 50 years of the event has not been genuinely  tranquil.    Clinton's conversation with the reporters was still two  sided. On the one hand, he said sanctions should be imposed on  the DPRK and, on the other hand, he said that there was still  time for the DPRK to change its course. Therefore, on the  dispute over the DPRK nuclear issue, he has not yet fully  disclosed his stand.    Before Clinton left Washington for Western Europe, the  United  States, the ROK, and Japan held a meeting of senior officials  and adopted two resolutions. One was that the UN Security  Council would be first invited to discuss the issue of sanctions  against the DPRK and the other was that if the council failed to  adopt any sanctions after discussion, the United States, the  ROK, and Japan would impose sanctions by themselves.    It can thus be seen that the United States was not very sure  of the results of the Security Council discussion. When  speaking to reporters in the White House, although Clinton  indicated that China and Russia, permanent members of the  Security Council, were in support of the U.S. stand, this was  not so as far as estimates of the international community were  concerned.    Although Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that he  agreed with the U.S. stand on the whole, he still added: Even  if sanctions are really imposed, they will not have any great  effect.    So far Beijing has not made any official indications about  how it will handle the issue. China has not made any remarks,  agreeing or disagreeing, on the imposition of sanctions against  the DPRK, let alone mentioning the issue of a veto.    According to reports from foreign new agencies, Beijing has  indicated its support for Russia's proposal of convening an  international conference. If this is true, it means that China  is obviously unwilling to take a stand in the Security Council  on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, but hopes for  another way of handling the issue. Nevertheless, the United  States indicated that now was not the time to convene an  international conference because the issue should be first  handled by the United Nations.    In fact, even though the United States, the ROK, and Japan  have already made common resolutions, still there are differing  views among themselves. In the last two days, ROK Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu has carried out activities in the United  Nations and held talks with the Chinese ambassador to the United  Nations, Li Daoyu. Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will  also visit China to discuss the DPRK issue. All these show that  there is still some gap [biao xian 5903 3807] among the three  countries in terms of agreement.    Pyongyang indicated: If the United Nations does adopt any  sanctions, this will be an act of war. This remark was in sharp  contrast to the 50th anniversary of the landings of the Allied  forces in Normandy, which was held yesterday. Now let us see  what new developments will take place this week.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / UK Company News: Worcester shareholders at odds with Takeover Panel ANGRY INVESTORS in Worcester Group, the manufacturer of central heating boilers, are considering a complaint to the Takeover Panel about the terms of an agreed bid for the company which they claim gives management a better deal than they will receive. Shareholders say they will argue that the first general principle of the Takeover Code states that 'all shareholders of the same class of an offeree company must be treated similarly by the offeror'. They also feel that management could have obtained a better price from another bidder. The dispute raises questions about directors' obligations to shareholders even when industrial logic renders an offer in the best long-term interests of a company and its employees. Shareholders receiving cash for their shares have no interest in a company's long-term prospects following a takeover. Worcester had been in talks with Robert Bosch, the German automotive components, telecommunications and appliances group, for more than a year. It had terminated preliminary conversations with other potential buyers who could not have offered the same long-term growth prospects or security to employees. Worcester's management and their families control 38.4 per cent of the company's shares. They have accepted the Bosch offer, which will give shareholders 225p per share in cash. Also, institutional shareholders representing 13 per cent of Worcester's shares have given commitments to tender their shares at the agreed price. In exchange for their shares, management will receive shares in the new subsidiary of Bosch. Its stake will then be bought out in 1996 at a price dependent on the performance of Worcester of up to 393 1/2 p, and not less than 100p. The Panel said it had looked at the offer carefully before it was announced and it was satisfied that the offer to management was not worth more than the cash offer. It said it was unusual, but constitutionally possible, for shareholders to appeal against a decision by the executive of the Panel. However, the Panel repeated that it was satisfied by the arguments put to it by Bosch and Worcester that shareholders were not being unfairly treated in the offer. However, shareholders argue that the Panel has only con-sidered arguments from the two parties interested in consummating the deal and that their views should also be heard. Under rule 16 of the Takeover Code the management of a company could keep a stake in a business when it was taken over so long as there were risks as well as rewards attached to the retained holding. JO Hambro Magan, which is acting for Bosch in the bid, said that more than 50 per cent of shareholders regarded the price as fair and had accepted. Corporate financiers said that it was difficult for minority shareholders to exert much power once a bidder had more than 50 per cent. 'It takes a brave institution to accept the position of a minority holder, especially in a subsidiary of a private German company,' said one. Merchant bankers said that other possible buyers of Worcester had been put off because they regarded the Bosch bid as a fait accompli.</p>

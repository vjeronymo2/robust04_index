			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Cumbria road benefits outlined THE Pounds 195m cost of upgrading the A590, A595 and A66 trunk roads in Cumbria to dual-carriageway standard would be more than recouped by the government, according to a consultants' report considered yesterday by Cumbria county and district councillors. The report says the expense would be more than offset by the benefits in retaining employment and attracting inward investment. An accelerated roads programme for remote West Cumbria and Barrow-in-Furness, suffering from heavy job losses and poor communications, might mean those areas together having 4,000 more jobs by the year 2000, consultants Segal Quince Wicksteed estimate. Aggregate savings in state benefits due to consequent reduced unemployment and increased tax revenue would amount to about Pounds 180m by the year 2000 and between Pounds 215m and nearly Pounds 300m over 30 years, they say. Those projected savings are additional to the normal economic benefits of road schemes. Mr David Cole, county highways and transportation director, told yesterday's meeting those should themselves exceed the Pounds 195m upgrading cost. The report, commissioned by the county council, Furness Enterprise and West Cumbria Development Agency, is the latest phase in a campaign to persuade the government that Cumbria's transport infrastructure needs urgent investment. About 10,000 jobs are being shed from submarine builders VSEL in Barrow and the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site, and unemployment as high as 25 per cent is predicted in the area. The meeting agreed to send the report to all relevant government departments and to press Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, for a meeting.</p>

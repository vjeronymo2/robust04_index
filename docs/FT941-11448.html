			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Lloyd's declares 'satisfactory' rise in capacity Lloyd's of London yesterday announced that its capacity - the amount of premium its syndicates are allowed to accept - will increase towards the upper end of expectations to Pounds 10.9bn this year compared with Pounds 8.9bn in 1993. Corporate investors have supplied Pounds 1.6bn in capacity, while individual Names, who have traditionally provided the insurance market's capital base, are committing Pounds 9.3bn. 'It is a very satisfactory situation for the market to be in and as good as we could possibly have hoped,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman. An increase in average commitments by individual Names partially reflected the relaxation of solvency requirements and helped offset a decline in the number of Names to 18,022 from 19,537. Ninety-five corporate members - most of which are subsidiaries of more than a dozen Lloyd's investment trusts - have joined the market. So-called 'working Names' - who work with agencies and brokers at Lloyd's - raised their average involvement to Pounds 372,000 from Pounds 318,000, while external Names raised their overall premium limits to Pounds 561,000 from Pounds 486,000 last year. The total number of Lloyd's syndicates fell to 179 from 228 at the start of last year, underlining recent rationalisation in the market. More than 400 syndicates underwrote in 1990. Lloyd's, which is expecting to make profits when it reports its results for 1993 in 1996 - in line with its three-year accounting system - said that the recent Los Angeles earthquake was unlikely to affect its 1994 results. Mr Rowland said that the London market would not be affected unless total insured losses exceeded Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.33bn). Insured losses are currently expected to be less than this. The chairman also announced that Lloyd's was considering changes to new voting rules, after protests by Names action groups. Lloyd's took the first steps to weight its voting system in favour of Names committing greater amounts of capital to the market last year. But many existing individual Names argued that they could be forced to pay levies as a result of votes cast by corporate capital, which itself has protection from such levies. Lloyd's council - or governing body - will consider the issue next month. Lloyd's issued details of disciplinary procedings against Mr Edward Cowen, former underwriter of syndicate 529. Mr Cowen was suspended from the market and publically censured after being found guilty of charges of 'disreputable' and 'detrimental' conduct.</p>

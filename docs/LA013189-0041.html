			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> D.C. COUNCIL TARGETS GUN MAKERS, SELLERS  </P> <P> The District of Columbia City Council, trying to stem the city's rising  homicide rate, proposed making handgun manufacturers and sellers liable for  injuries and deaths caused by those weapons. Sponsors of the legislation said  it will be the first of its kind in the nation. "This legislation is designed  to force gun manufacturers to consider carefully the purposes for which  handguns are manufactured," said Council Chairman David Clarke, the bill's  original sponsor. The bill, which would hold handgun manufacturers, importers  and dealers liable for damage caused by handguns, is supported by 12 of the 13  council members. Clarke predicted that pro-gun groups will try to block the  measure in the House of Representatives, which reviews legislation from the  council.  </P></p>

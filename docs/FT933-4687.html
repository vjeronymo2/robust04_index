			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Moves to pacify farm lobby - Commission agrees to increase EC 'set-aside' compensation THE European Commission yesterday agreed to increase the amount of compensation for EC farmers for land they have to take out of production. The move was seen in Brussels as a further attempt to pacify the French farm lobby, and to make it easier for France to accept the international farm trade accords on which the future of the Uruguay Round now hangs. Paris at the weekend renewed its threat to veto last year's Blair House deal on farm trade between the US and the EC, a linchpin of any future deal on world trade reform. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday refused to yield to the entreaties of European employers' leaders for a speedy conclusion to the Gatt negotiations, saying he would not be rushed into a bad deal 'by fetishism for dates'. France only agreed in June to accept the oilseeds clauses in Blair House after additional compensation for 'set-aside' had been agreed by EC farm ministers on May 27. Yesterday's move is part of the same decision. Yesterday's Commission proposal would raise the compensation for cereals-producing land which is taken out of production from a rate of Ecu45 to Ecu57 (Dollars 65.55) per tonne, calculated on the previous yield of the land. This would add Ecu352m to the EC's farm budget of more than Ecu36bn, Commission officials said, but the extra cost would not start until 1995. 'Set-aside' is required under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which slashes farm prices severely, compensating farmers for the cuts only if they leave around 15 per cent of their land fallow to rein in over-production - a decision which has caused outrage throughout the French countryside. The French government's formal objection to the Uruguay Round parts of Blair House, recently delivered to the Commission, says the EC could only meet the Gatt commitments in it through further set-aside. 'For France, there would be no question of accepting an increase in set-aside, which has already reached intolerable levels,' the document said. The Commission also moved, in a package designed to make set-aside more flexible, to allow farmers to set aside more land than the statutory minimum, with full compensation. Nobody in Brussels doubts, however, that much bigger instalments of money will be needed for France to accept a Uruguay Round farm settlement, and that this is likely to require a raising of the ceiling on farm spending. Mr Carlos Ferrer, president of the Unice employers federation, said Europe's companies needed 'a positive outcome this year' to the seven-year Gatt negotiations. But the French prime minister indicated the line he will take when he meets Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director general, today in Paris. 'Some say France is risking delaying the end of the Uruguay round negotiations,' Mr Balladur said. 'I will only take this risk seriously when the 54 countries who have not even presented in Geneva their offers on tariffs do so.'</p>

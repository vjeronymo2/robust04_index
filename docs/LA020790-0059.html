			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY TEAMS TO REGAIN PLAYERS LOST TO GRADES  </P> <P> It is unknown whether they give their teams a lift or simply take up space on  the bench, but several players -- albeit rusty -- are expected to return to  their playoff-bound City Section boys' basketball teams in time for today's  games. After today, teams will have one game left in the regular season.  </P> <P> This week marks the beginning of the second semester at City schools, and  players who were academically ineligible in the fall can rejoin their teams if  their grade-point averages meet the minimum 2.0 standard.  </P> <P> For many teams, that could mean the return of impact players. How effective  those players will be is uncertain because City rules prohibit ineligible  players from practicing with their teams. In most cases, the final word on  eligibility is expected today.  </P> <P> In the 4-A Division, Granada Hills is anticipating the return of forward Ryan  Cravens, a 6-foot-1 junior who was a projected starter before becoming  ineligible last fall.  </P> <P> "He could really help us," said Coach Bob Johnson, whose team is tied with  Cleveland for first place in the North Valley League. "He's one of those  hard-nosed, blue-collar inside guys."  </P> <P> Kennedy, another member of the North Valley, is hopeful that center Athesis  Harris will return. Harris (6-4) started last season as a sophomore. "He tells  me he's in good shape (academically)," Coach Yutaka Shimizu said. "We'll see  when the grades get here."  </P> <P> Cleveland is expected to regain senior forward Brandon Battle, who has spent as  much time on the sidelines as he has in uniform since transferring to the  school two years ago. Battle (6-6), the leading scorer at Canoga Park as a  sophomore, feuded last season with former Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell and  played sparingly.  </P> <P> El Camino Real, tied for first with San Fernando in the 3-A West Valley League,  lost starting center Bert Mitchell, who moved to Long Beach last week. That  point became moot when Mitchell (6-2) was ruled ineligible Tuesday, Coach Mike  McNulty said. The team also failed to regain the services of 5-9 senior Lamont  Johnson, a scheduled starter. Johnson's GPA remains under 2.0, McNulty said.  </P> <P> Reseda, tied with North Hollywood in the 3-A Mid-Valley, lost reserve swingman  Jamar Sanders (5-11) to ineligibility.  </P> <P> North Hollywood, Grant, San Fernando, Sylmar and Birmingham, all of which have  clinched or could secure berths in the 3-A playoffs, are not expected to be  impacted by eligibility problems.  </P></p>

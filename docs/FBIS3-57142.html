			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 January -- Today Yegor Gaydar made an  appeal to the participants of an assembly of Moscow's democratic  community for a serious reconstruction of the democratic  movement.    He made a speech in which he explained his reasons for  leaving the government. Yegor Gaydar gave as one of his reasons  for resigning the government's adoption of a decision to  allocate $500 million toward the construction of a new  parliament building. In his words, "To carry out a policy  envisaging the adoption of such decisions is to go beyond the  bounds of morality."    Yegor Gaydar believes that the disagreements that were  clearly visible in the work of the government over the past year  were linked to the fundamental question of "what kind of Russia  we want to have." He explained that the reformers favored a  "cheap and moderately sized state that serves society," and in  particular, reducing the state apparatus and bringing to a  minimum the number of government functionaries. However, there  exists another approach in Russia as well, he said. This is "a  strong, powerful, and expensive state, which will intervene in  all spheres of public life and will have a powerful apparatus of  functionaries merging with a new emerging bourgeoisie."    Nevertheless, Yegor Gaydar said that Russia's Choice was  ready to support any constructive decisions by the government.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the  future work of Anatoliy Chubays in the government, Yegor Gaydar  said that "it will be difficult for Chubays to work." He  explained that "the privatization process has gathered a certain  momentum, and if people begin actively and systematically to  wreck it, it will nevertheless continue until 1 July, when  privatization checks expire." Yegor Gaydar expressed the hope  that Anatoliy Chubays "will do all he can to fulfill our  obligations."    The participants at the assembly supported the creation of a  New Civic Movement. It will be formed on the basis of  Democratic Russia. The adopted manifesto of the New Civic  Movement [Novoye Grazhdanskoye Dvizheniye] proclaims the need  "to build a civic society by peaceful means, improve the  socio-economic situation of working people, and ensure a normal  standard of living for ourselves and our children."    Lev Ponomarev, co-chairman of the Democratic Russia  movement,  said that the movement's founding conference should be held as  early as the beginning of March.</p>

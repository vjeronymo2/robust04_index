			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sarajevo Ultimatum: Paris seeks broader peace mission France yesterday sought to cement its new diplomatic partnership with the US over Bosnia by raising the possibility of an American mediator, and maybe even a Russian one, joining the peace effort. An Elysee spokesman said this idea of enlarging the Owen-Stoltenberg peace mission had been raised at a meeting yesterday between President Francois Mitterrand's chief of staff and Mr Peter Tarnoff, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, and Mr Charles Redman, President Clinton's special envoy on Yugoslavia. The agreed aim, he said, was 'not to launch a big new diplomatic initiative, but to reinvigorate the existing peace process with American help'. Having persuaded Nato to adopt its military ultimatum on Wednesday, France and the US turned their attention yesterday to diplomacy. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, also met the two Americans and said after wards: 'There is now a common Franco-American desire to relaunch a political solution . . . involving maintaining pressure on the Serbs and Croats, and an effort of persuasion on the Moslems.' The US envoys were reported to have promised to discuss with the Moslems the whole of their demands and to see which 'reasonable' demands could be worked into a modified version of the European peace plan. But the US continued to insist that the Serbs must still make most of the concessions and that, if sanctions against Serbia were progressively removed, as the Europeans have suggested, some leverage on Belgrade should be retained until the very end - by, for example, maintaining the freeze on Serb assets abroad. French officials said they largely agreed with these points. In the wake of the Sarajevo ultimatum, the Elysee spokesman said US and French officials confirmed the earlier Nato decision to help peace-keeping forces in Tuzla and Srebrenica, and to examine other areas for similar action, like Mostar or Vitez. Mr Mitterrand and his government were said to favour sending the aircraft carrier Foch to the Adriatic 'because it could be useful if our troops get into difficulty', the spokesman said. But the carrier's dispatch might be delayed for a few more days 'so that it would not be interpreted as a unilateral French act, outside what Nato is doing'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Does Jacques Delors -- who has not reacted yet to  the NATO ultimatum -- agree with NATO's pressure? This is the  European Commission president's response, as recorded by Michel  Barthelemy:    [Begin Delors recording] Given the point reached in the  conflict, I would like to take my responsibility and say yes,  hoping that this pressure would allow the peace process -- which  is close to fruition -- to resume. This involves a 2 percent  readjustment of the Serbian territory in order to allow the  Muslims to have a viable state. The Bosnian Serbs and Croats  have obtained satisfaction. Therefore, this pressure is part of  the peace process.    I regret that a solemn warning had not been given before to  those who have introduced the ideology of death that is ethnic  cleansing. Today, things are what they are. Let us not return  to the past. There is no point in doing so. I hope that this  pressure will make everyone think and realize that they have  more to lose than gain in pursuing the conflict. [end recording]</p>

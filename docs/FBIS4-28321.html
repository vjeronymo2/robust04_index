			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  made some progress in restarted talks on medical equipment on  Wednesday but brushed aside the most fragile issue, a Japanese  official said.    "We discussed objective criteria...mainly on qualitative  criteria," the Finance Ministry official told reporters after  two- day working-level talks on government procurement of  medical equipment.    But he said the two sides avoided discussing quantitative  yardsticks which led to bickering over "numerical targets" and  ruptured the bilateral "framework" talks in February.    "We did not touch on talks that could cause turmoil when  negotiations are to continue," he said, adding that the two  sides agreed not to disclose details.    U.S. officials were not available for comment.    The two sides agreed to continue working-level talks in  mid-June, but further adjustments are needed to decide on the  date and place, either Tokyo or Washington, the Japanese  official said.    Otherwise, "the talks got off to a smooth restart" in an  "extremely good atmosphere," with most of the two days taken up  by the Japanese side explaining and the U.S. side questioning  promises made by Japan in its March market-opening package on  government procurement, he said.    In the package, Japan vowed to widen the scope of products  open to foreign firms, make specifications fairer and simpler,  improve information available on government tenders, beef up the  review of bidding complaints and institute comprehensive bid  evaluations.    Japan also promised to review the progress of foreign goods  procurement under these measures, apparently for use as a  qualitative benchmark.    Japan and the U.S. agreed two weeks ago to restart the  framework talks after reaching common ground on the definition  of objective criteria that it would be both quantitative and  qualitative yardsticks instead of numerical targets for each of  the negotiation sectors.    Government procurement of medical and telecommunications  equipment is one of the three priority areas along with  automobile and auto parts, and insurance business.    Medical equipment is the last on which working-level talks  have restarted. Telecom [telecommunications] talks were held  separately last Friday and Saturday.    After a first round of resumed talks, all the three sectors  made some progress without touching on the crucial issues, and  the two sides agreed to continue talking.</p>

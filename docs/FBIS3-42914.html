			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vener Salimov, chairman of the Committee for </F> State Security of the Republic of Tatarstan, by Raisa  Shcherbakova; place and date not given: "The Time of Vagueness  Has Passed"]    [Text] We had not managed to get used to the renaming  of the KGB as the MB (Ministry of Security) before there was a  new sign change--the president of Russia signed a new edict and  "Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service of the  Russian Federation." The new abbreviation for this stern  department now goes like this--FSK.    Our correspondent met with the chairman of the  Committee for State Security of the Republic of Tatarstan, V.  Salimov.    [Shcherbakova] Vener Asylgareyevich, was anybody left  without  a job after your department was reorganized?    [Salimov] As far as I know there are about five people on  the  staff of the FSK today. And all the rest of us are outside the  staffs.    [Shcherbakova] Excuse me, but where do you personally stand  now? Have you been fired too?    [Salimov] No, we have not been fired. We are working as hard  as ever. But we are all waiting for the time of our appointment  to the appropriate positions. I personally have to present my  vision of the structure of the future organ--my rights are  restricted here. Republic leaders have the right, taking into  account the situation that has developed, to make their own  proposals regarding the formation of the structure, which by no  means has to copy the central apparatus. Future workers will be  appointed by the future manager of the new organ, and as for the  manager himself...everything is in the hands of the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. According to our  Constitution, it determines the list of ministries, departments,  and committees. It also has to decide whether or not our  structure will remain a part of the Cabinet of Ministers and  what it will be called. Possibly the territorial  counterintelligence service. I will not have any objections. As  they say, call us whatever you will...the important thing is the  essence of our activity.    I personally do not like the fact that our department's  tasks  have eroded over the past three years. Some people, including  people's deputies, have had a great desire to direct the efforts  of state security organs almost to carrying out militia tasks.    [Shcherbakova] But you have also had programs in common....    [Salimov] And we still have them. But we take from them for  action those issues that must be decided by Chekists and  counterintelligence workers. With the appearance of the new  statute, everything was put back into place and now our workers  can breathe easy--they will finally be doing what they were  taught to do.    [Shcherbakova] Unfortunately, the statute itself is  classified.    [Salimov] And I do not dare to quote our main tasks from it.  They include disclosure, prevention, and interception of  subversive intelligence activity on the part of foreign special  services and organizations against the Russian Federation. They  include fighting terrorism, corruption, contraband operations,  illegal trade in arms and narcotics, illegal armed formations,  and also illegally created or banned social associations that  encroach on the constitutional structure of the Russian  Federation. They also include providing, within the limits of  our authority, for the protection of the country's state  secrets. And so forth.    In brief, during the process of reorganization subdivisions  are formed that will engage exclusively in professional  activity--based on the tasks I mentioned to you. Fortunately, we  have something to defend.    [Shcherbakova] Yes, just take the military-industrial  complex. It seems that the top departments have not yet been  eliminated anywhere.    [Salimov] Quite right.    [Shcherbakova] But the times of sabotage and terrorist acts  when enemies appeared everywhere seem to have passed....    [Salimov] But take the war in the Caucasus and reports about  important communications being out of commission. I personally  do not participate in the investigation of the events going on  there, they are independent states, but according to the  estimates of our specialists, all the signs of subversive acts  are there.    In our offices we analyze and predict the development of  situations and take preventive measures not to allow such  actions to occur here. Do not forget that we have vital  facilities that are of immense importance! And if the water that  comes into the sinks from immense reservoirs is poisoned or if  during a 40-degree freeze the city ends up without electricity  or heat, it makes no difference to the rank-and-file citizen who  is responsible for the action--whether it was an assignment of a  foreign special service or by the will of a sick person, a  schizophrenic. And we must also predict the social explosions  that could create a threat to the population.    [Shcherbakova] So when it comes to predictions, are you an  unofficial adviser to our president?    [Salimov] No, he has plenty of advisers. But, naturally, I  report my conclusions periodically. And if they are worthy of  attention, the appropriate decisions, as a rule, are made. A  recent example: An edict was adopted declaring it illegal to  create militarized formations on the territory of the republic.  It was partly on our initiative that this edict appeared.    [Shcherbakova] How do you feel about the demands to place  your department under the jurisdiction of Tatarstan?    [Salimov] Today the KGB of the Republic of Tatarstan is  wholly and completely guided by the norms of the law of the  Russian Federation. Today we are no longer a law enforcement  organ, we are purely a special service, counterintelligence.  Training specialists for our service is a very costly matter. If  they were to make an ill-considered decision to transfer us to  the jurisdiction of Tatarstan, this service would be doomed to  complete inaction. And then, since we are physically located in  the center of Russia, whom would we work against?    [Shcherbakova] Do you think that the shakeup of your  department has finally ended and that you will now engage  exclusively in counterintelligence work?    [Salimov] We would like to hope that. The activity of the  FSK  is by no means directed toward encroachment on the legal rights  of citizens as envisioned by the Constitution. At the same time,  it will make it possible to solve basic problems more  efficiently and on a higher professional level. Note that last  year alone several dozen citizens were exposed (including state  bureaucrats--editor's note) who had been recruited by foreign  special services. This shows that subversive counterintelligence  activity has become much more active. The conditions for this  are more favorable than ever before. Many components of the  Russian Federation have been given the right to conduct foreign  economic activity independently. Leaders of joint-stock  companies and retail firms have direct connections with foreign  partners. But they have no experience! The corresponding  legislative base is not in place either. Until recently we did  not even have laws on state secrets or state borders.    [Shcherbakova] But let us say that there were new elections  of parliament and the president, would the situation change....    [Salimov] Let us not guess about the distant future. And  anyway in the near future, in keeping with the new statute on  the Federal Counterintelligence Service...we will be able to  organize our own work. Workers of our department are quite  satisfied: The time of vagueness and the time of doubts has  passed. The tasks have been earmarked. Let us work.</p>

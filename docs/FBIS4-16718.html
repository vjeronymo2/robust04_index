			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Aty-Baty" program] </F>   [Text] Leaflets appeared in the city of Murmansk-150,  which is the home for the first submarine flotilla of the  Northern Fleet. They call on officers and warrant officers to  carry out a joint protest act against the delays of pay and  unsatisfactory supply of clothing and related gear. The  leaflets propose to block the road leading from living quarters  to the submarine base.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>   [Text] Deciding on a capital of KwaZulu Natal has the  potential to become one of the most bitter wrangles in the power  struggle between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC in the  province. Ulundi, Durban and Maritzburg are being considered.    Premier Frank Mdlalose says the members of the provincial  legislature should decide the issue -- but his decision to hold  the next cabinet meeting in Ulundi has been interpreted as  indicating his own preference.    ANC officials have objected to Ulundi, saying they would not  be safe there. ANC provincial cabinet minister S'bu Ndebele  said it would not make sense to travel for six hours to attend  cabinet meetings in Ulundi.    The notorious road and bad phone connections are further  obstacles to making Ulundi the capital, say critics.</p>

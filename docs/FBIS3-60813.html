The Union Defence Ministry, in a recent report sent to  Punjab  Police, has stated that not only were the immigration and custom  authorities at Attari and Bombay careless in their duties, but  frequently accepted bribes. On the basis of the interrogation of  the arrested smugglers and spies the Ministry was able to tell  the exact dates on which such lapses occurred during the past  two years.    Among those interrogated was a Pak spy, Mohammed Sharief,  who  was apprehended in Delhi in June. The MOD [Ministry of Defence]  report states that on one occasion, two Pak smugglers got past  the immigration authorities at Attari by paying Rs [rupees] 200  to the staff at lower level. On another occasion, two smugglers  were allowed to carry 40 kg of paan (betel leaves) to Pakistan  by paying Rs 500 to an immigration official.    Another official gave them the go ahead when they obliged  him  with a walkman. On two other occasions, they managed to get past  the immigration authorities with fake documents and by paying Rs  1000 each to two officials, who also asked for their leather  jackets.    Similarly, in Bombay they were able to enter and leave the  country on fake documents without any difficulty. On one  occasion, a Punjab militant, Manjit Singh. also traveled with  them to Bombay on fake documents. They had procured forged  passports and visa for Rs 2000 each in Delhi.    The report by R.K. Singh, Director in the Ministry of  Defence, mentions the names of guest houses in Delhi, Bombay and  Aligarh, which were frequented by Pak contacts. The report has  underlined the need for proper vetting of immigration and custom  staff. A senior Punjab Police officer told INDIAN EXPRESS, "We  are trying to trace the policemen mentioned in the report, who  will face stringent action."    Meanwhile, the Union Finance Ministry has also taken up the  issue of lack of security at the two vital check points which  could have serious implications on national security. M. R.  Sivaraman, Secretary Department of Revenue in Ministry of  Finance, has written to the Punjab Government last month urging  it to bring the immigration control at Attari railway station  under the overall supervision of a young motivated, gazetted  officer.    The Bombay blasts have confirmed that ISI [Inter-services  Intelligence] was trying to create disturbances in India and  this required strengthening of units at all vital points of  entry and exit, he added. Sivaraman has pointed out that the  Chandigarh office of the Collector of Customs and Central Excise  had reported that immigration checks were not being carried out  with full vigour due to acute shortage of staff.</p>

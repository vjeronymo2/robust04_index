			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HONESTY'S ITS OWN REWARD -- AND MAYBE MORE  </P> <P> Honesty is its own reward, that's true. But for a Torrance resident who turned  over to police more than $24,000 in suspected drug money that he found on the  street, the reward may be a bit more substantial.  </P> <P> Sgt. Ron Traber said Terrance Walker found the money near his car as he was on  his way to work Thursday. He spotted a container, looked inside, found the loot  and notified police.  </P> <P> Traber said police feel there is a "very good likelihood" that the money was  part of a drug deal. "We brought in a dog trained to detect narcotics," he  said, and the dog reacted to the package. "What that suggests to us is, whoever  handled the money also handled drugs."  </P> <P> Asked what would happen to the money, Traber said he would like to see Walker  get it.  </P> <P> "That's fantastic when you have somebody in the community who's honest enough  to turn in a large sum of money," said Traber. "It's unbelievable."  </P> <P> Walker could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Authorities will hang onto the cash for at least 120 days, in case the rightful  owner shows up. But, given suspicions that drugs are involved, Traber said he  did not think the owner would show up any time soon.  </P> <P> "I can't see anybody coming up and saying, 'Oh yes, I'm a dope dealer and  that's my money.' "  </P></p>

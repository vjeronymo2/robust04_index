			<p>Language: <F P=105> Creole </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] National Congress of Democratic Movements  [Conacom] leader Victor Benoit says the small problem of  dissension existing within the National Front for Change and  Democracy [FNCD] is between the president's allies and those who  support him unconditionally. Benoit has presented himself as an  ally of President Aristide, but has condemned the behavior of  certain leaders whose main objective is to (?obtain) the post of  prime minister.    Benoit says that what is going on within the FNCD is normal  because the FNCD is a front that brings together many  organizations with different political views:    [Begin recording] This is normal. It is good that  discussions  are going on within a political group. This shows that there is  no one organization -- I could say -- to have attached its  tentacles...[rephrases] that is setting the tone and making  everybody go along with it. It is normal for people to hold  differing views in a situation of crisis involving several  levels of understanding. [passage omitted] [end recording]    We remind listeners that Conacom supports the new plan set  up  by parliamentarians in Washington, pointing out that this plan  is inspired by the Governors Island agreement, the New York  pact, and the Miami conference. In the opinion of Victor Benoit,  it is therefore a good plan.</p>

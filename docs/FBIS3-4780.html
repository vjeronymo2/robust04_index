			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan Must Not Say Only No"] </F>   [Text] Insensitive to how other nations feel its actions,  Japan aimlessly wastes time without taking necessary steps.  Japan's trade partners then take action out of irritation, and  Japan reacts in excessive surprise. This is a repeat of  Japanese history.    In the 1930's and 1940's, the United States and Europe  frequently issued warnings against Japanese attempts to expand  its influence to the Chinese mainland and Southeast Asia. The  United States frequently sent signals to Japan warning that if  Tokyo sent troops to Indochina, it would cut oil exports to  Japan. For Japan at the time, the United States was its  greatest source of oil.    When the United States decided to ban oil exports to Japan,  the decision took the Foreign Ministry, the Army, and the Navy  by surprise. This is a good example of how Japan was  insensitive to the reactions of foreign nations.    The Nikkei average stock price plunged following the  breakdown of the latest Japan-U.S. summit talks. U.S. sanctions  against Japan are supposed to weaken the yen, but speculation  that the Clinton administration hopes for a strong yen resulted  in a sharp rise in the yen's exchange rate against the dollar,  disrupting the foreign exchange market. This year the United  States will hold an off-year election, and the U.S. Congress is  deluged with bills for retaliation against Japan. President  Clinton, who prefers reality to ideology, is about to lean  toward a policy favored by Congress. Claiming the Japanese  mobile phone market is closed, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor  has already made clear the United States will impose high  tariffs on Japanese manufactured goods.  <H5>  Excessive Reaction Prohibited </H5>   Looking back, there was a time considered to be a watershed  in Japanese history. Japan, which said "no" to U.S. demands for  opening the Japanese market through numerical targets, now  stands at another watershed.    Japan, which said "no" to demands by Europe and the United  States to open China's northeast region (Manchuria), began  following a path of isolation after withdrawing from the League  of Nations. Foreign Minister Matsuoka and the Japanese  delegation which defiantly walked out of the conference room of  the League of Nations received thunderous applause in  nationalism-ridden Japan.    There is no need to take seriously the current trouble  between Japan and the United States because it is within the  framework of security arrangements. But there are fears that  the trouble, though small in stature, will repeat the pattern of  excessive reaction. The fear cannot be ruled out that the  economic friction between the two countries will develop into  political distrust, thus hollowing our alliance.    Japan follows the path of self-reform based on its own  yardstick. At a meeting with President Clinton, Prime Minister  Hosokawa viewed numerical targets as managed trade and rejected  them. He made a correct decision at the meeting. If Japan  accepts numerical targets, it is tantamount to acknowledging  Japan is a special nation where the bureaucracy reigns.    However, the question concerns the course which led up to  the  breakdown of Japan-U.S. framework talks.    First, we believe policymakers and ordinary people were too  insensitive to the existence of $130 billion in Japanese  surplus. The surplus is a transfer of purchasing power. If one  is indifferent to the continuation of the surplus for many  years, he is not believed to have a normal nerve. Ministry of  Finance and other Japanese Government officials who stick to the  "logic of finance" have missed a chance to expand Japan's  domestic demand. Their attitude reminds us of the behavior of  the Japanese Army which stuck to the "defense of Manchuria to  the last."    Second, we wonder whether Japan is qualified to openly  assert  the market economy while opposing managed trade. The number of  bureaucratic regulations shows no signs of shrinking despite  administrative reform. The administration abuses the authority  to issue certifications, licenses, and subsidies to intervene  and threaten local governments as well as the private sector.  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is in a  situation where it asks economic organizations to comment on  this and that.    In the eyes of Americans, Japan is a nation where mammoths  live that cannot be tamed by ordinary rules. The only way to  have the mammoth buy goods is for foreign exporters to become  ordinary animals or use the purchasing power of the mammoth.  The U.S. Government probably feels it has chosen the latter.    The U.S. Government distrusts Japan, saying the mammoth  cannot easily become an ordinary animal and has no intention of  becoming one.    Unfortunately, we feel there is no strong leadership in the  White House nor in Japan. The shortsightedness of staffers  assisting the President is conspicuous. They seek only quick  credit and show no willingness to objectively appraise the  15-trillion-yen stimulus package--the largest ever--on which  Japan has belatedly decided.  <H5>  Stand on Market Mechanism </H5>   To break the deadlock in Japan-U.S. relations, Japan should  endure some pain, establish its own yardstick, and achieve  self-reliance.    Japan can attack other nations with its yardstick because it  is a double-edged sword, and thus can also cut itself in  reaction. If Japan does not accept the U.S. demand for settling  numerical targets, it should make transparent its market  activities at home and abroad, and the bureaucracy's  intervention should be excluded.    If the United States continues to demand managed trade and  imposes a series of sanctions on Japan, we believe Japan needs  to have a firm resolve to counter them. If the United States  imposes sanctions on Japan, Japan should take its case to GATT  and wait for the judgment of international opinion.    In that incidence, the United States would lose the status  of  free trade champion, and Japan may become the champion of free  trade in place of the United States. U.S. sanctions against  Japan could deal a blow to Japanese enterprises, but those who  would ultimately pay the price would be American consumers who  are forced to buy high-priced goods and suffer from a shortage  of goods. A weak dollar would be responsible for increasing the  prices of imported goods and fueling inflation in the United  States.    In the United States, a substantial number of Americans have  criticized the Clinton government for taking a tough trade  stance toward Japan. There is no doubt the more Japan deals  calmly with U.S. trade demands without displaying emotional  reaction, the more the criticism will grow.</p>

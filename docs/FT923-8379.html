			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Tim Waterstone: 'a perfect conclusion' Tim Waterstone, founder of the eponymous bookstore chain which is now controlled by WH Smith, is staying on the board for a further year until May 1994 - after Smiths buys out his remaining shares next May - in order to develop the American market. Alan Giles, yesterday named as Tim Waterstone's successor, joins Waterstones next month, on the tenth anniversary of the opening of the first Old Brompton Road branch, for a period to be spent getting his feet under the table before he takes over officially as chief executive next February. Waterstone, 53, will then move to New York to ensure his name 'is not used in America inaccurately'. The first store, opened in Boston in October, is thriving, and another located by Chicago's Water Tower is the next, set to open in November. 'We are taking it brick by brick,' says Waterstone, who first got to know Smiths from another side of the fence; he was dismissed as head of the group's US operations in 1981. 'That was book distribution,' he points out now, a very difficult and different business. 'Anyway, this is the perfect conclusion to that irony.' Meanwhile, there will be no concessions to American book buying habits. 'Either (the Waterstones style) works or we come home again.' And post 1994? 'I am going to be very busy,' is all he will say. Giles, who is 38 and has been with the W H Smith Group since 1979, is 'very well known in the book trade', according to Waterstone, from his time as general manager of the books and news division of W H Smith books. Just over three years ago, he moved to Do It All - since formed into an as yet not too successful joint venture with Boots' Payless. He was latterly operations and development director.</p>

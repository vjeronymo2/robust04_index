			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Defence Ministry issued a statement  Friday [20 May] night saying that "a group of unidentified  gunmen had tried to seize a strategic facility of the Ukrainian  Anti-Aircraft Defence Force in Sevastopol."    It notes that "properly organized defence of the facility  and  resolute actions by Ukrainian servicemen became obstacles to  criminals."    A well-informed source in the Ukrainian Defence Ministry has  reported to Interfax that ten gunmen attempted to capture the  Ukrainian Anti-aircraft Defence Command Post in Sevastopol on 19  May. The Ukrainian guards on duty at the facility frustrated  their attempt.    The statement stresses that the Crimean parliament's  decision  on army service for Crimeans exclusively in the peninsula "makes  the Ukrainian side weary." "Not only does the document is at  variance with Ukraine's constitution and defence potential  requirements but it builds up tension in society and in the  Army," the statement says.    It underlines that the "Ukrainian Army units deployed in the  Crimea are subordinate to Ukraine's Defence Ministry and carry  out orders from the Ukrainian Supreme Army Commander in the  interests of ensuring the territorial integrity of our state,  its defence potential and inviolable frontiers."    Speaking in parliament in Simferopol Saturday morning, the  Crimean Security Service Chairman Vladimir Lepekhov denied that  the Ukrainian anti-aircraft command post had come under attack  Tuesday night.    Meanwhile, as Interfax has found out from a source close to  Crimean parliament, Ukrainian guards and special troops are  being massed in the peninsula. Some 250 national guards arrived  in Sevastopol Friday night and have set up a camp on the grounds  of the Ukrainian naval academy in the city.    Up to 400 more Ukrainian guards are expected in Sevastopol  shortly.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> MEMORIAL HOSPITAL GETS NEW CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR  </P> <P> Frances Hanckel, a senior vice president for medical care programs at Long  Beach Memorial Medical Center since 1989, has become the hospital's new chief  administrative officer.  </P> <P> As such, she has taken over daily operations of the 998-bed facility from  Michael Jhin, former chief operating officer, who was reassigned to the medical  center's corporate office.  </P> <P> According to hospital spokesman Ron Yukelson, the change is part of a  restructuring of the hospital's senior management team undertaken by Richard T.  Williams, who was named the corporation's chief executive officer in June.  </P> <P> "It has flattened out our management structure and made us more efficient,"  Yukelson said of the reorganization.  </P> <P> Before coming to Memorial, Hanckel was vice president of planning at the  University of Maryland Medical System in Baltimore, and associate hospital  director and chief planning officer at Temple University Hospital in  Philadelphia.  </P></p>

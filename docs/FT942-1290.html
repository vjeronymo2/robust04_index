			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar chases rumours Wild rumours of a cut in German interest rates and concerted central bank intervention to support the dollar bounced the US currency around in narrow trading yesterday, writes Motoko Rich. The dollar rose on early morning rumours that the Bundesbank would reduce the discount rate or set a lower fixed repo rate at its monthly central council meeting. Afternoon talk of a concerted intervention effort spiked up the US currency again, but the central banks did not show their hands before the close in London, where the dollar ended at DM1.6035 from DM1.6006 and Y101.150 from Y100.695. It closed in New York at DM1.6040 and Y101.35. Sterling showed signs of independence from the US currency as it turned in a stronger performance against both the D-Mark and the dollar. Traders were made tentative by speculation that the Bundesbank was about to cut its discount rate or set a lower fixed repo rate. They accordingly gave the dollar a boost towards the DM1.61 level in the morning, as they awaited the results of the Bundesbank's central council meeting. The dollar opened lower in New York against the D-Mark after Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer made the ambiguous remark that 'the Bundesbank is not interested in a falling dollar'. Hopes for a cut in German interest rates were further squashed when Mr Tietmeyer commented on the growth of the M3 money supply. 'We believe the current interest rate structure would contribute to slowing in M3 growth,' he said. The markets grew jittery in the afternoon when rumours of concerted central bank intervention circulated. But the banks stayed out of the ring again, although some said the US Federal Reserve bought some dollars on behalf of the Bank of Japan. Analysts were beginning to doubt the possibility of group action by the central banks to support the dollar. 'I think we have passed the time when the grand slam intervention that the market was afraid of will be needed,' said Mr Michael Feeny, economist at Sumitomo Bank. 'I think the dollar is consolidating.' After the release of figures for US durable goods orders in May, commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown said the numbers were 'a very good sign', indicating continued growth in the US economy with virtually non-existent inflation. US durable goods orders rose by 0.9 per cent, against expectations of a 0.5 per cent increase. In addition, US initial jobless claims last week were at 352,000, up from a revised 349,000 for the previous week. The markets treated the data with indifference, although the figures for durable goods were better than expected. 'Markets tend to react to figures either in a very positive or very negative way only if major figures go their way,' commented Mr Chris Dunis, economist at Chemical Bank. 'Otherwise they tend to disregard the figures as not important.' Sterling rose steadily against the dollar and the D-Mark during the day, escaping from its recent slavish relationship to US currency trends. 'There was institutional buying of pounds,' said Mr Rob Loewy, economist at Midland Global Markets. 'It looked like half-year squaring off. The markets took profits against the first move above Dollars 1.50.' Mr Loewy said an improvement in the UK gilts market also helped the pound. 'The markets have also focused on the government's tough talking on the rail strikes and recent indications that the government is attempting to keep public spending down,' he said. 'All of these things have encouraged sentiment.' In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 700m assistance at established rates after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m. The Bank also supplied late assistance of around Pounds 40m. The Swiss franc remained stable, although slightly lower, against the dollar after the Swiss National Bank said it was not intervening to support the US currency. At its semi-annual news conference in Zurich, Swiss National Bank president Markus Lusser said he had no diff-iculties with the current D-Mark/Swiss franc exchange rate. Mr Lusser also said the exchange rate was not hindering the country's economic recovery, which investors interpreted as a vote of confidence in present interest rates. The European crosses were stable throughout the day, with the lira and the peseta gaining some ground against the D-Mark. The German unit ended in London at L982.6 from L983.3 and at Pta82.98 from Pta83.24. Against the Swiss franc, it finished at SFr0.842 from SFr0.841. It closed unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.422. Bank of Portugal governor Miguel Beleza's resignation did not affect the escudo, which held at Es103.4 per D-Mark. In the futures market, the December short sterling contract saw 26,000 lots traded and settled at 93.85 from 93.74. The December Euromark contract, after 47,000 lots dealt, closed at 94.85 from 94.87.</p>

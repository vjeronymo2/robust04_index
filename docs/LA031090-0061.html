			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINE CITES U.S. CONTACTS ON HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Unofficial American negotiators have had direct contacts with the captors of at  least 16 Westerners believed held in Lebanon and are working on a deal to pay  ransom for the hostages' releases, the leading Lebanese magazine As Shiraa said  Friday.  </P> <P> As Shiraa, which has good contacts among Islamic fundamentalists and is the  magazine that first broke the Iran-Contra scandal story, said Anglican Church  envoy Terry Waite may be the first hostage freed in the proposed deal.  </P> <P> Waite, 50, was abducted Jan. 20, 1987, in Muslim West Beirut while negotiating  the release of Western hostages held by Muslim extremists in secret hideouts in  Lebanon.  </P> <P> The deal would involve all the Western hostages believed held by pro-Iranian  Shiite extremists in Lebanon, including eight Americans, the magazine said.  </P> <P> "U.S. figures with no official capacity have been engaged in direct contacts  with the captors, focusing on a proposed deal to pay some money in exchange for  releasing hostages," As Shiraa said.  </P> <P> In Washington, Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said he was  unaware of any such dealings, but again noted, "There are plenty of people out  there talking," trying to win release of the hostages.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Leadership tries to stop debate on IRA motion The TUC leadership was last night trying to prevent a debate over the IRA ceasefire which it thinks might appear to give support to the terrorist organisation. The National Union of Journalists wants to move an emergency motion that says it 'welcomes' the IRA's declaration of a 'complete cessation of military operations'. TUC leaders oppose this, pointing out that the words go much further than any motion passed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the Irish Republic. The NCU communications union and construction union Ucatt have proposed motions on Ireland that fall short of the NUJ's explicit welcome. Congress organisers have told the three unions to try to work out a composite motion for debate on Thursday, but they oppose any wording that would appear to give open support to the IRA position. Union leaders in the UK have always been sensitive about the impact of the Irish troubles on members. They have both Protestants and Catholics in their Northern Ireland branches and unions in Northern Ireland have managed to stay free of sectarian conflict. Mr John Foster, NUJ general secretary, denied last night that his union's motion in any way suggested support for the IRA. He pointed out that the union had always sought to avoid taking any position that would put its media members in Northern Ireland at risk.</p>

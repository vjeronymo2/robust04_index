			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Personal View: Cuba's switch from state economy In the early 1990s, half of Cuba's formal economy disappeared, according to the Cuban government's own statistics. Export earnings fell by about 60 per cent between 1989 and 1992, while imports fell by about 70 per cent in the same period. When in the spring of 1993 Cuba's sugar harvest output fell by a third compared to the 1992 level, President Fidel Castro knew he had to authorise significant economic changes if he was to reactivate the economy and save his regime. Since the summer of 1993, a series of economic reforms has been promulgated. Their effects are still difficult to gauge, but their design and preliminary results shed light on Cuba's near-term prospects. On July 26, Castro announced his decision to legalise the holding of dollars and other foreign currencies by ordinary Cubans, and their use in retail trade. The aim was to stimulate dollar remittances from Cuban-Americans to friends and relatives in Cuba. Foreign currencies may not be used, though, to pay wages or to stimulate domestic output directly. Under those limitations, the short-term economic and political effects have been problematic for the government. Who had dollars? The answer is those who had obtained them illegally; those who had been perhaps less politically loyal and had retained contacts with their relatives in the US; and those who had enjoyed the privilege of going overseas with Cuban government authorisation. Opening up the use of foreign currencies for purposes other than stimulation of production led to a rush on existing dollar retail stores established to serve tourists and diplomats. To curtail demand in these stores, the government decreed a 50 per cent price increase. The partial currency liberalisation also provided a strong incentive to ordinary Cubans to move out of the formal peso-denominated economy into the illegal economy or into the foreign currency segments of the formal economy. In effect, the government's decision expanded the money supply without increasing output. This created economic and political distress. In August, the government allowed individuals in more than 100 occupations to go into business for themselves (a modification in October excluded medical doctors and teachers). Until then, the only lawful way to contract a plumber or to get a hair-cut was to go to the state enterprise in charge of providing such services. The effects of freeing the market are modest, however, because most services had been freely, though illegally, available. The potential dynamism this measure could impart to the economy is also limited: no one is authorised to hire non-relatives. In September, the partial privatisation of state farms was authorised. Agricultural workers on state farms can now form private co-operatives. There are, though, three limitations. No one but the state can have property title to the land. No one can work by himself or herself; workers must join co-operatives. Moreover, all commercial output must still be sold to the ministry of agriculture. Because of these limitations, the economic results of the measures are modest and are likely to remain so unless additional steps are taken. Some are already in the pipeline. The central bank is considering changing the rigid exchange rate policy, a move which, with the decision to permit circulation of foreign currencies for retail trade, might enable Cuba to qualify to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank some time in 1994. These modest economic reforms have more far-reaching political implications. Above all, the Cuban government has admitted through these decisions that it can no longer govern much of the economy. The weakness of the Cuban state was especially evident in the decree authorising the free contracting of certain services. It says progressive taxation would be the best way to regulate and tax such activities, but then admits the government is incapable of administering such a system. Instead of tax payments relative to the volume of economic activity or to earnings, self-employed persons are to pay a monthly flat fee. Today Cuba has three co-existing economies. One is illegal. Another is legal and operates only in hard-currency. The third is the rapidly shrinking official economy, which operates in pesos through state enterprises. Most of Cuba's commercial transactions now occur in the first two private economies. The Cuban economy's transition from socialism is well under way.

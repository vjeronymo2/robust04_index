			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters' happy returns At last Reuters appears to have devised a commendable solution to its embarrassment of riches. By repurchasing 5.8 per cent of its shares, Reuters can distribute Pounds 350m of cash in a way that is more tax efficient than simply increasing its dividend. But the move will inevitably revive questions about whether its business is now mature. Share buy-back schemes are certainly preferable to one-off dividends in that they contain a greater element of choice. Shareholders may receive different net gains depending on their particular tax regime. Theoretically, at least, those who choose not to tender their shares for repurchase should not be disadvantaged. They should end up with a proportionately bigger shareholding, enhanced earnings and a higher share price. Nevertheless, there tends to be a prejudice - at least in the UK - against companies giving back money. The implication is that if managers cannot spend it sensibly they should be replaced by more imaginative types. Such criticisms chime resonantly in Reuters' case given the doubts about its long-term growth prospects. But Reuters retains the capacity to generate and spend money at a fiendish rate. Its capital spend last year rose 31 per cent to Pounds 194m. Having installed a vast array of terminals, it is now devising ever more means of squeezing revenue from them. Multi-media also offers promising opportunities. Even so, it will not be long before Reuters' free cash-flow of Pounds 200m creates another money mountain. At least, shareholders now have some reason for hope that Reuters is less likely to blow it on something silly. How investors in Boots must wish its management had exercised such restraint.</p>

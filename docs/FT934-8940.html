			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Bell to invest Dollars 16bn in 'super-highway' PACIFIC Bell, the telephone company serving California, yesterday announced plans to spend Dollars 16bn over seven years to create a multi-media communications super-highway across its territory. It also awarded American Telephone &amp; Telegraph a contract estimated at some Dollars 5bn to supply key parts for the system. The project is among the largest network modernisations announced by a local US telecommunications group as both these companies and cable television operators start to pour capital into the creation of inter-active, multi-media communications networks. It is also a coup for AT&amp;T, which will act as systems integrator for the network and supply much of its hardware. Its contract is said by Pacific Bell to be the 'single largest network equipment purchase in telecommunications history'. Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis telecommunications group, said the modernisation programme would begin next year and initially concentrate on the heavily populated centres of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego. More than 1.5m homes would be hooked up to the super-highway by the end of 1996 and more than 5m homes - or 60 per cent of those it now serves  - would be connected by the end of the decade. In addition to advanced telecommunications, Pacific Bell intends to offer video services, bringing it into direct competition with local cable television operators. However, before it can get into the video market it must first overcome a ban on telecommunications companies entering this area, imposed under the 1984 cable act. Another local telecommunications group, Bell Atlantic, has already won this right through court action. The investment is a bold step for Pacific Telesis, which has held back from the US rush into multi-media services and alliances between programme providers and communications distributors. It said yesterday it believed it could obtain programming without taking an equity position in a content provider. The company said it could fund the upgrade by cutting Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn from its cost structure, with no additional expense to rate-payers and no additional debt for now.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries inch forward despite fall in dollar US Treasury bonds inched forward in quiet trading yesterday as traders tried to ignore the plight of the dollar. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 better at 85 5/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.505 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent. Activity was sluggish as most retail accounts chose to remain on the sidelines until stability returned to the foreign exchange markets. Throughout the session, the dollar established a series of record lows against the yen. The election of Mr Tomiichi Murayama as Japanese prime minister appeared to have little impact on sentiment in either the bond or currency markets. There was some expectation that the Federal Reserve and other central banks would attempt to prop up the dollar, but the intervention never materialised. The sense of anticipation, which kept trading to a minimum, also reflected the approach of the Fed's policy-setting meeting next week. Analysts were uncertain if the session would result in the year's fifth rate increase. The day's economic news was surely not favourable for those betting against such a move, but it was probably irrelevant to the Fed's current thinking. In a surprise, the Commerce Department revised its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product from 3.0 per cent to 3.4 per cent. European bond markets moved cautiously higher in thin trade, in spite of further weakness in the US dollar. However, sentiment remained fragile, with attention turning towards next week's Bundesbank, US Federal Open Market Committee and G7 meetings for signs of official intervention to protect the embattled US currency. 'The dollar is having less of an impact on European bond markets than anticipated,' said Mr Kirit Shah, of First Chicago. 'The markets are testing the upside but are encountering resistance, climbing two steps higher then being forced to take one step backwards.' UK gilts resumed the better performance seen earlier in the week, with tentative signs that a more optimistic mood is returning to the market. The Bank of England's auction of Pounds 2bn of floating-rate gilts due 1999 was a success. It was covered 2.72 times, with a lowest accepted price of 99.75 and a tail of 1 basis point - the difference between the average and lowest accepted bid. 'I have some conviction that we have seen the worst of the gilt selling,' said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. 'The success of the auction was a sign that background sentiment is healthy, rather than something which moved the market higher,' he said. 'Gilts have benefited from a variety of players over the last few days,' said Mr Shah, 'such as hedge funds and Japanese buyers, and the findings of the government's white paper on pension reform has helped.' But he doubted whether the bottom of the market had been reached. 'The bears are resting. It is difficult for them to make money at the moment as well,' he said. The market's attention will now be on the release tomorrow of the US June NAPM report. The September long gilt future on Liffe was up  13/16 points in late trading at 101 3/4 . German government bonds lost some of their gains in late trading but remained ahead, helped by firmer US government bonds. The Bundesbank announced that it had allocated 14-day securities repurchase funds at this week's tender at a lowest rate of 4.96 per cent, down from last week's rate of 5 per cent and broadly in line with expectations. There was some disappointment in the market at the outcome of the issue by the Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, of DM2.01bn of 6.375 per cent five-year bonds, with an average yield of 6.46 per cent and a weighted average price of 99.63. The low price and the fact that the Bundesbank withheld DM1.99bn of the total DM4bn issue for market-tending purposes demonstrated that demand is still weak, analysts said. But Mr Huw Roberts, assistant bond strategist at NatWest Markets, said: 'Normally this would have been a bad outcome but it is really quite a success after the recent supply problems.' Bunds rose in early trading due to a technical short squeeze. They came off slightly on the strong US data. 'There are some signs that the market is beginning to bottom,' said Mr Roberts. 'If people had wanted to sell off in the last couple of days then were opportunities for them to do so. It is a favourable sign that they did not.' The German September government bond contract on Liffe was up 0.32 points at 92.84 in late trading.</p>

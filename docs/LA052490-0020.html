			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'HOME CASINO' UNMASKED IN MANHATTAN BEACH RAID  </P> <P> When Billy Ray Meacham moved into the attractive, baby-blue house on Rowell  Avenue in Manhattan Beach around April 1, the neighbors thought he was a nice,  friendly guy.  </P> <P> He told some of them that he and the other men who would be living in the  leased house were constructing ramps for the Century Freeway and wanted to be  close to the job.  </P> <P> "We hoped they'd be nice people," said one neighbor, who asked for anonymity.  </P> <P> But when 24 officers from three police agencies raided the house at 3 a.m. last  Saturday, they didn't find slumbering workmen. Instead, police say, they walked  into a home-style gambling casino offering poker, blackjack, craps and pool to  a thirtyish, working-class crowd. Drinks reportedly were sold from a fully  stocked bar.  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach Police Sgt. Dale Reissig, one of the first officers to enter  the spacious house, said the raid shocked the 38 people inside who were  gambling, drinking and nibbling sandwiches against a subdued background of  stereo music. "There were no happy campers in the bunch" after police arrived,  he said.  </P> <P> Police arrested four people who were allegedly conducting the operation on  gambling charges. A fifth person was arrested on suspicion of cocaine  possession but was not charged, authorities said. The customers were  interviewed, photographed and released.  </P> <P> The discovery also startled residents of the hilly neighborhood of expensive,  well-landscaped homes -- including those who had wondered about the parked cars  and late-night foot traffic to and from the house.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed misdemeanor gambling  charges Tuesday against Meacham, 52, of San Juan Capistrano; William Moritz,  53, of Los Angeles, the other purported operator of the games; Nanci Nowicki,  29, of Torrance, an alleged dealer, and Roxane Elliott, 28, of Hawthorne, who  was allegedly tending bar. Meacham and Moritz were also charged with permitting  gambling in the house.  </P> <P> According to the clerk of the South Bay Municipal Court in Torrance, Meacham,  Moritz and Nowicki are free on their own recognizance and will be arraigned  June 7. Elliott is in custody awaiting a bail hearing, and arraignment has not  been set.  </P> <P> Reissig said the raid by Manhattan Beach and Torrance police and the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department climaxed a monthlong investigation that  began with citizen complaints and anonymous tips and included sending  undercover officers into the house. He said it was the first home casino broken  up in the city in "eight or nine years."  </P> <P> Reissig said the alleged gaming operation, which went undetected for three  weeks before the complaints began, tried to appear like "just another party in  the neighborhood."  </P> <P> Gambling was allegedly conducted Friday and Saturday nights between midnight  and dawn, becoming busiest after bars closed at 2 a.m. Crowds typically ranged  from 20 to 35 people.  </P> <P> Customers were solicited by word of mouth in Lennox and Torrance bars, Reissig  said, and the casino even had a business card advertising unspecified  after-hours games and entertainment.  </P> <P> Reissig said there was "no evidence of heavy betting," judging by the $1, $5  and $10 chips and the confiscation of only $1,000 in cash at the time of the  raid. "This was a bar crowd, regular folks, working people," he said.  </P> <P> Most of the gaming equipment was homemade, police said. The house -- which  included a converted garage, a swimming pool and a pool house -- was decorated  with liquor ads, a framed exotic car poster and pictures of women in bikinis.  Police seized the gaming equipment and a semiautomatic pistol.  </P> <P> Reissig said police were called after neighbors became suspicious when the  "party" went on weekend after weekend. One resident, who requested anonymity,  said the local Neighborhood Watch leader lives next door to the alleged casino  and was angered because noise from the house kept her awake.  </P> <P> The resident said some neighbors thought prostitution was being conducted in  the house. On Mother's Day, starting at 3 a.m., she said, she counted 35 to 50  people going to and from the house over a 3 1/2-hour period, including a man  and a woman who "stood on the walk making out." Parking spilled over into a  four-block area, she said.  </P> <P> "They were idiots to do this," she said of the purported gamblers. "People in  Manhattan Beach are not low-class bimbos. We are aware."  </P> <P> Reissig said the property owner was not involved in the alleged gambling  operation.  </P> <P> Nahid Bani-Hashemi, a Long Beach resident who with her husband owns the Rowell  Avenue house, said a reporter's call was the first knowledge she had of the  alleged gambling operation. She said that on March 26, she leased the house for  a year at $2,250 a month to Meacham and another man whose name she could not  recall. "They said they were freeway construction people," she said.  </P> <P> If some people in the neighborhood were suspicious of goings-on at the house,  many others were not. Les Dergan, who lives around the corner, said his wife  made a $500,000 offer to buy the Rowell Avenue house before it was rented in  March. "I assumed musicians lived there," he said.  </P></p>

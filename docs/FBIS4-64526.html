			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government has lifted  its ban on arms deliveries to Turkey. This was announced in  Bonn today by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.    Kinkel pointed out that the Federal Defense Ministry has  evaluated the photographs given to the Foreign Ministry "as  proof of Turkey's use of weapons and equipment from military aid  programs contrary to the terms of the agreement." The result is  that "use contrary to the terms of the agreement cannot be  proved on the basis of the photographs." The German Government  has therefore decided to resume the deliveries to Turkey as  stipulated in the agreements on NATO defense aid, material aid,  and special arms aid.</p>

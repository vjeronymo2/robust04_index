By now, these documents are in the hands of the  Russian prime minister, who is going to discuss them with a  number of political factions in the State Duma of the Russian  Federation. U. Zamyatalin said that, according to preliminary  information, the majority of Duma deputies view the signing of  the monetary union agreement between the two states with  optimism. "Some disagreements over approaches to the creation  of a single ruble zone are of more political, than economic  character; they are artificially created by those experts who  have been programmed to prevent, at any price, the establishment  of a union of the two countries," said Kebich's press secretary.  Speaking about the actual date of the monetary unification,  Zamyatalin expressed hope that "it will most likely take place  before the end of March."</p>

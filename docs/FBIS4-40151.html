			<p>BFN     [Text] State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin fully shares  President Yeltsin's view that international sanctions against  North Korea should be coordinated with UN members and imposed  gradually. As the chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee,  Sergey Yushenkov, told Interfax, Rybkin expressed this agreement  with Yeltsin's view on Tuesday, when receiving a parliamentary  delegation from Britain.    Led by the chairman of the Standing Commission for Defense  of  the House of Commons, Nicholas Bonsor, the delegation took part  in Tuesday's round-table conference on collective security in  Europe held at the lower chamber of Russia's parliament.    Interfax's correspondent reports that on Wednesday British  MPs intend to visit Russia's Defense Ministry, Institute for  Strategic Studies and a military unit.

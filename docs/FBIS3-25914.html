According to statistics, these zones exported 2.47 billion  U.S. dollars-worth of goods last year, an increase of 78.7  percent over the previous year.    The zones are located in the eight cities of Qingdao,  Yantai,  Weihai, Weifang, Zibo, Rizhao, Jinan and Dongying.    A local official attributed the good result to a positive  expansion of foreign economic cooperation.    In addition to increases in imports and exports, a survey  shows that these open cities, empowered to export their products  by themselves, have absorbed foreign funds, offered labor  service, opened enterprises overseas and conducted international  tourist service.    Aiming for the international market, the peninsula has  combined agriculture with industry and trade to form an  all-embracing export-oriented setup.</p>

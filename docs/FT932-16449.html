			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Single market update How are you coping with the European single market? You can improve your hand by reference to a clutch of new books which provide help and guidance on dealing with the new Europe. The Handbook of European Business Contacts 1993-94 (Colt Books, 226 pages, Pounds 24.50) by Gerard Dawson and the Association of British Chambers of Commerce provides useful lists of hundreds of business support organisations, trade associations and government offices throughout Europe. It gives a brief economic profile of the 12 EC member countries including comprehensive lists of local chambers of commerce - important because of their statutory role in most EC countries where they are the main repositories of business information. One important source of cross-border business is the government contracts which have been opened up by EC public procurement policies. The problem for the smaller business, in particular, is knowing where to go for information. Eurobudget '93 (Fourth Edition. London Chamber of Commerce, 224 pages, Pounds 95) by Michael O'Hagan and others, provides brief explanations of the EC budget process followed by details of all the budget lines open to outside bidders and the officials responsible. This is a handy short-cut to information otherwise only available from a time-consuming study of EC budget documents but would benefit from a less terse introduction. If your business dealings in Europe involve negotiations with a French business, Negotiate in French and English by Pamela Sheppard and Benedicte Lapeyre (Nicholas Brealey, 138 pages, Pounds 9.99) provides a bilingual guide. It explains the French approach to negotiations and the terminology they use in situations ranging from establishing goodwill, through doubts and deadlock to compromise and agreement. Intended for the businessman or woman with a good basic grounding in French, this fascinating book provides, in context, the phrases which cannot be found in general or business dictionaries. For the businessman who wants to start from scratch The Economist Guide to the European Community (Revised edition. Century Business, 262 pages, Pounds 14.99) by Dick Leonard provides an informative overview of the EC's history, role and institutions. This guide covers a lot of ground but retains a lively style.</p>

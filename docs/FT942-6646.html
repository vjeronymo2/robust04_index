			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Looking for trouble on the Yangtze - Despatches The police at the Wuhan ferry terminal were distracted by their boredom. Confronted each day by a swirl of humanity struggling through a small turnstile, they had conceded long ago that they were hardly able to make a difference. They herded passengers into a kind of line, only to see it dissolve moments later. They looked out at a crowd of scruffy peasant boys, of young provincial women with hairstyles that went out of fashion in Beijing last year, and of old men who remained faithful to the Mao tunic. For the police, chaos was commonplace. From Wuhan, on the Yangtze, the ferries head downriver as far as Shanghai and upriver to Chongqing. Beyond the turnstile, it was a sprint down the gangway for the best berth on an overcrowded boat. About half the rushing passengers were bouncing white, rainproof sacks that once held fertiliser, but had a second life as a travel bag. These were farm folk on the way home, probably a long bus ride from the port that was their destination aboard the Jiangyu No 4. The boat had three classes, starting at second class and working down. In between each class, on the stairways and the decks, were clusters of passengers, cracking sunflower seeds with teeth and tongue, and preparing for discomfort that, by Chinese standards, was no great test of endurance or patience. For those with tickets through to Chongqing, it was four days of struggle against the currents, and a deckside seat to an unscheduled, tragic entertainment. After a few hours of gliding through the water, the first of the public announcements came. It was the urging voice of public announcements in China of the past, but was offering something different. None of the harsh rhetoric, just hard sell - tickets for a 'Hong Kong action film with romance'. They showed a few different films but the spiel was much the same: a film made in Hong Kong, with action and romance. There was enough violence off-screen in central China for the taste of most passengers. Urban Chinese worry aloud about their safety outside the security of the big cities. In their afternoon tabloids, they read about marauding gangs and random violence. They talk about the aimless young who have no values and will do anything for a price. To keep the peace on the boat, there are Marine Police. Their green uniform looks a little like that of the Gong An, the real police, but the shoulder patch and the manner are that of an aspiring policeman rejected by a more discerning force. At around midnight, the ferry berthed at Shashi, literally Sand City, once a Japanese treaty port that the other foreign powers did not bother to contest. There was a crowd of young porters, with bamboo poles in hand, hustling for a commission. A few porters apparently tried to jump aboard the boat, and the sounds of a brawl echoed through the cabins. A marine policeman, who claimed that lives were in danger, opened fire. He shot one man in the leg and another in the hand. The shouting stopped for a moment and the recriminations began. A mob gathered on the wharf, and the passengers peered over the guard rails. The rumours multiplied fast. A few men had been killed. The labourers' friends were on their way to ransack the boat. Like so much that happens in China, even for those a few metres from the event, the reality was quickly retranslated and distorted by a dozen dialects. The outcome became obvious when the front lounge-room of the boat was unlocked. In the best Chinese traditions, there was to be a meeting. The boat's crew, the real police, and local port officials were given cups of tea and began attempting to apportion blame in a way that would leave them all blameless. They talked for nine hours, and apparently happy that their duty had been done, there were no arrests. Two police joined the boat, taking a second class cabin for themselves, in the interests of law and order. For the crew, the fear was that word would spread upriver, and there would be trouble at another of the river stops. Each time the boat slid against a wharf, the two real police would stroll off, with hands in pockets, waiting edgily for more violence. At each stop, the passengers in white jogging shoes, increasingly the preferred footwear of rural Chinese, walked off into the day or the night. At one small port, hundreds of grubbied labourers were hauling coal from a heap to a barge, with each of the two baskets on a bamboo pole weighed by a supervisor. It stirred images of the mobilised masses who built Mao's dams and bridges in the 1950s and the Great Wall a few dynasties earlier. Those scenes of toil held nothing for the passengers, who were still being offered Hong Kong films with action and romance. Then, in the final hours of the journey, the loudspeakers turned to pop versions of Cultural Revolution hits about Mao, the Great Helmsman. The revival of these songs, which tell of Mao as the 'Big Red Sun warming us all', is part kitsch and part necessity. They were the songs that people sang, willingly or not, during the 1960s and 1970s, and stuck in the collective memory. Now, they are in karaoke collections. At Chongqing, the private minibus operators were waiting with loudspeakers and tunes of their own. The city, the wartime capital, is still a refuge from some of the wilder parts of the south-west. It is also a place where the rumours gather. One taxi driver told a story about the increasingly potent blend of wealth and violence. On a Chongqing bus, a young woman and man started a typical argument. It could have begun with him stepping on her foot, but the origins are not important, as it quickly became a matter of face. In the usual Chinese way, the insults became cruder and cruder, and neither would give way to the other. The woman dared the man to get off at the next stop, and he did, presuming that their argument would continue. She then walked over to a couple of out-of-town youths, and offered them money to rough up her opponent. They accepted and the argument was ended.</p>

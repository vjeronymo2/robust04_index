			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Improved freights help Lofs to Dollars 1.55m London &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based shipping company ultimately controlled by Iroquois Shipping Corporation of Liberia, reported income before tax of Dollars 1.56m (Pounds 1.02m) for the six months to September 30. The results, compiled under US generally accepted accounting principles, compared with a restated deficit of Dollars 165,000 last time. Net freights and hire amounted to Dollars 10.9m (Dollars 7.54m) reflecting the commencement in July of the five year Chevron charter on the London Pride, increases built into daily rates of similar charters on the London Spirit and London Victory and improved trading conditions for the London Enterprise. Earnings per share emerged at 6.4 cents (losses 1 cent). The company plans an international offering of up to 5m American Depositary Shares at between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17 apiece. Proceeds will be used to finance expansion of its oil tanker fleet. Furman Selz and NatWest Securities are managers and the latter is also sponsoring the offering on the London Stock Exchange.</p>

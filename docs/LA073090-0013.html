Lawrencia Bembenek, 31, a former model and policewoman convicted of murdering  her then-husband's ex-wife in 1981, is believed to have fled with her fiance  after scaling a fence July 15 at a Wisconsin women's prison.  </P> <P> Supporters maintained that Bembenek received an unfair trial and was the victim  of a police setup.  </P> <P> Book Judgment: London judge Michael Wright on Friday temporarily banned author  Malcolm Barker from publishing "Courting Disaster" anywhere in the world  because it reportedly gives intimate details about Britain's royal family. The  judge ordered a delay in enforcing the ban until today pending an appeal. The  book is already on sale in Canada, the United States and Bermuda. Barker was a  clerk in Buckingham Palace.  </P> <P> Adjudged: A former Playboy model was sentenced late last week in Milwaukee to  10 months in prison for evading taxes on $686,000 that an aging millionaire  paid her during a five-year sexual relationship with both the model and her  sister. Lynnette Harris, 35, was convicted in May by a federal jury that did  not accept her claims that the money represented tax-free gifts. Harris  received money from David Kritzik of suburban Shorewood, who died last summer  at age 89. "I got involved in this relationship and it has turned out to be a  nightmare," Harris said.  </P> <P> Another Break-In?: A co-defendant in the drug-trafficking case of former  Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega was arrested at an exclusive home in Miami  once owned by President Richard Nixon.

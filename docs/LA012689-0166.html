			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Students conducted a silent protest at ground-breaking ceremonies at Kent State  University for a scaled-down memorial to students shot by Ohio National  Guardsmen during 1970 anti-war demonstrations. The students held a banner  depicting a peace symbol and a dove to protest as inadequate the $100,000  memorial university trustees unanimously agreed to build. The trustees voted  Nov. 15 to reduce the cost of the memorial from $1.2 million after a  fund-raising campaign netted only $40,000. The ground-breaking took place on a  campus hill near where Guardsmen fired more than 60 shots that hit 13 students  and killed four.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daihatsu Motor forecasts Y5bn pre-tax deficit DAIHATSU Motor, the Japanese commercial vehicle and carmaker, yesterday forecast a pre-tax loss of Y5bn (Dollars 41.8m) for the year to the end of March. It would be the first loss reported by the Toyota Motor-affiliate since it was listed in 1949. The company's plight results from its confidence that the unusually strong car sales growth of the late 1980s would continue into the 1990s. Like other Japanese carmakers, it built a production facility that has been left under-utilised by a downturn in the market. Daihatsu, and the rest of the Japanese car industry, will be under extra pressure because of the yen's recent sharp appreciation. About 23 per cent of Daihatsu's sales come from exports, and the stronger yen is likely to trim export margins and growth. Having specialised in mini-vehicles, cars with engine displacement of a maximum 660cc, Daihatsu has been hurt by a 6.2 per cent first-quarter fall in these models, compared with the same period last year, and a 12.5 per cent slide in the second quarter. Last year, the carmaker reported pre-tax profits of Y4.6bn, down from Y13bn. Yesterday, it said the first-half and full-year loss would be Y5bn. It revised downwards its full-year sales forecast from Y820bn to Y800bn. The company is fortunate to have the backing of Toyota, which has commissioned it to produce compact cars, but Daihatsu still faces a continuing fall in its main market. In August, sales of mini-cars were down 12.3 per cent on the same month last year. Daihatsu has already re-duced executive salaries and transferred administrative staff to the sales force. It announced yesterday that the two-shift operation at its Ikeda plant will be reduced to one shift until the market improves. Japanese carmakers were forced by the turmoil in financial markets to tap cash reserves to fund the construction of new facilities, and Daihatsu's reserves fell by almost two-thirds last year, reducing its interest income this year. Makers of mini-cars say the market has been bruised by tougher parking legislation introduced a year ago to reduce congestion in Tokyo and Osaka. Until then, mini-cars were exempt from a requirement that a new car purchaser have an off-street parking space. The mini-car market was encouraged in 1990 by an expansion of the allowable engine size from 550cc to 660cc, but even then Daihatsu missed a gear change, as the company failed to pick a shift in demand towards luxury mini-cars. Having prepared to cater to that market, the company found it shrinking fast.</p>

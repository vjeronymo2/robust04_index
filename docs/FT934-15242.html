			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Dublin welcomes unionist move THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday welcomed statements from a leading unionist in Northern Ireland that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, might be accepted at the negotiating table. The Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said on Irish radio that if Sinn Fein delivered a genuine cessation of violence the Ulster Unionists would give Sinn Fein 'the recognition that they are a bona fide political party and have a right to take part in a political process, representing those who vote for them'. He also said in an interview with the BBC that Sinn Fein should recognise unionist rights to be part of the UK. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, described Mr Smyth's comments as 'positive and constructive'. He added: 'It has always been my view that a cessation of violence would radically transform the situation.' The Irish government continues to guard its silence however regarding the content of the peace initiative launched two weeks ago by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, and Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. Mr Reynolds was briefed by Mr Hume last week on the initiative. After yesterday's cabinet meeting the Dublin government said that evaluation of the initiative was 'ongoing'. It gave no indication whether any proposals are about to made to the British government. The Hume-Adams initiative appears to be driving a wedge into unionist ranks, with the Democratic Unionist party reacting angrily to the latest UUP position. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said: 'Since Sunningdale (the 1973 conference which established an ill-fated power sharing executive without the DUP), no deeper wound has been inflicted upon unionism than this.' The UUP position was 'an act of monumental folly'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Coordinating Committee of Sandinists for the </F> National Project]    [Text] The holding of the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] Congress scheduled for May 1994 has given rise  to a major controversy within the party that has unfortunately  prompted one of the opposing factions to resort to unfounded  accusations and reprehensible epithets. This in turn has  generated great tensions that endanger the necessary unity of  Sandinists, tensions that could clearly lead to a breakup having  disastrous consequences for members, the party, and the country.  Such a rupture would only reaffirm the current party chiefs'  inability to exercise leadership strong enough to unite members  despite their diversity, a revolutionary trait. It would lead  the FSLN into the same situation in which all parties that have  existed throughout our political history have found themselves  and with the same faults and ills.    The course of internal discussion alarms us as a faction,  just as it alarms all Sandinists. Two phenomena that both  support and complement one another lie at the root of these  confrontations:    1--First of all, bossism has gradually taken root in  Sandinism, replacing the old collective leadership and  attempting to deny any new leadership. This is antidemocratic by  definition and in no way able to support necessary changes  within the party, particularly those having to do with the  deepening of party democracy.    2--In addition, one faction within Sandinism opposes  renewal,  deems violent methods valid, defended "the ticket" at the First  Congress, continues to support democratic centralism--however  obsolete--and provides the fundamental mainstay of bossism.  Discredit and exclusion have been the favorite methods of such  comrades, and anyone who does not think as they do is considered  a traitor to the Sandinist cause.    The latest verbal attacks from members of the faction are  aimed precisely at vetoing any renewal of the party and the  alternative of a new party and national leadership. The approach  constitutes an attack on the necessary unity of Sandinism, which  depends upon the following:    1) that personal aspirations within the party are valid for  all members, not just part of them;    2) that bossism has been extremely detrimental throughout  the  history of Nicaragua, for which reason we must banish it from  the FSLN;    3) that diversity of Sandinist thought is the basis of its  revolutionary principles; and    4) that transparent, high-minded methods are absolutely  necessary and irreplaceable.    We Sandinists for the National Program reaffirm once more  our  commitment to renewal and the democratization of the FSLN.  Consequently, we clearly condemn the verbal attacks launched  against the Sandinist bench and Dr. Sergio Ramirez. We are  issuing an urgent appeal to maintain debate within the confines  of decency, on a high plain, and with respect for personal  dignity and ideas.  <H5>  Sandinists for the National Coordinating Commission Program </H5>   Francisco de Asis Fernandez, Oscar Tellez, Raul Venerio,  Julio Lopez Miranda, Gloria Gabuardi, Orlando Castillo, Antenor  Ferrey, Alfredo Alaniz, Carlos Molina Oliu, and Augusto  Montealegre.</p>

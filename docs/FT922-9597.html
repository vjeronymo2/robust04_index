			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Building a new image in the City: The importance of a seminar with a difference Trafalgar House plans a seminar with a difference for analysts and fund managers next Tuesday. Senior line managers from the construction and engineering division, rarely seen in the City, will take part as it outlines its strategy for the 1990s. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, says: 'We want people to understand us better, particularly the core businesses of construction and engineering. 'This is the division which we will be focusing on for the future.' Most people following the company know that Trafalgar specialises in building roads and bridges, so an announcement, expected today, that the Trafalgar-led Anglo-Japanese consortium has won a HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 583m) contract to build one of the world's biggest suspension bridges will come as no surprise. 'But did you know that 25 per cent of the new pharmaceuticals plants are being built by us?' asks Sir Eric. 'I bet you didn't know we were building any pharmaceuticals plants. That's part of the problem.' Sir Eric hopes those attending next week's meeting will come away with a better appreciation of the group's construction and engineering businesses which he claims are like no other in the UK. 'These are technology-led businesses' he says. Trafalgar will take analysts through the detailed strategy of each business within its core division. This will range from the construction of the first plant in the world producing artificial blood, to the more mundane business of transport and oil and gas. At the end of the presentation Sir Eric hopes it will be clear that Trafalgar is no longer a sprawling conglomerate, but a property, construction and engineering-based company. By using that description he is acknowledging that in the 1990s conglomerates are no longer in fashion. With more than 80 per cent of the group's half-year Pounds 65.8m operating profit related to construction and engineering, compared with a mere 20 per cent in 1989, Trafalgar has changed direction. This is just as much a result of circumstances as it was of planning. The group accepts it became too dependent on property development and some of its acquisitions, such as the ailing shipbuilder Scott Lithgow, could not be described as great buys. A change of direction, however, does not mean the sale of its non-core businesses. Sir Eric is adamant there are no leisure disposals in the pipeline. 'We are not in negotiations to sell anything, nor have there been any decisions to do so, although we are not committed to it forever.' Trafalgar signalled its intention a year ago to leave the hotels business but only at the right price. It does not believe that time has arrived and does not see it arriving for several years. Its fleet of seven ships is also likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. In spite of the disappointing result from property, Trafalgar wants to keep its property and investment division to take advantage of recovery in the UK. In Sir Eric's opinion disposals are not needed to reclassify Trafalgar as a specialised property, construction and engineering company.</p>

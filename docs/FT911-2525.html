			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Five women among new 'working peers' - House of Lords A LIST of 'working peers' announced today breaks with tradition by containing a majority of opposition peers, and including equal numbers of Labour and Tory nomineesfor the first time since 1979. Five women are among the eleven life peers making up Mr John Major's first list of peers expected to make 'regular and distinctive' contributions to the work of the House of Lords. Coming justone year after Mrs Thatcher's last list, Mr Major's move marks a change of attitude from his predecessor. She often resisted pressure for new peers to take part in the daily work of the Lords, and last year's list was the first since 1987. Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, the Labour leader in the Lords, described Mrs Thatcher as 'unreceptive', and expressed his appreciation of Mr Major's 'imaginative' response. He called for annual appointments of working peers, and said it would be reasonable for there to be more Labour than Tory nominees in the next few years, to make up for the increasing imbalance in the parties' respective numbers since 1979. Labour's new baronesses are Miss Ann Mallalieu, a recorder, and Miss Jennifer Hilton, formerly a commander in the Metropolitan police. The party's new barons are Professor Maghnad Desai, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, Mr Clive Hollick, the managing director of MAI plc, and Mr Frank Judd, the director of Oxfam, who was a minister in the 1974-79 Labour government. The Tory baronesses are Mrs Jean Denton, the deputy chairman of the Black Country Development Corporation, and Miss Detta O'Cathain, managing director of the Barbican centre. Tory barons are Mr John Mackay, the former MP and junior Scottish office minister, Professor Andrew Renfrew, professor of Archaeology and Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, andMr Mark Schreiber, a farmer and Westminster lobby correspondent. Miss Sally Hamwee, a Richmond borough councillor, has been nominated by the Liberal Democrats. Lord Waddington, the former Home Secretary now leader of the House of Lords, is believed to favour appointing former Commons ministers to strengthen the government frontbench, and Mr Mackay's elevation may mark the first step of this approach.</p>

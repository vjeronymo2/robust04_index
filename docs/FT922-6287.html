			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (5): Academia's opportunity  -Sendai is the region's hub and an aspiring centre of technology PROFESSOR Jun-ichi Nishizawa, president of Tohoku University, is a famous man in Sendai and is also something of a symbol of the aspirations of this northern city, which serves as the administrative and economic centre of the Tohoku region. Prof Nishizawa founded the Semiconductor Research Institute in Sendai, and conducted pioneering work on the growth of gallium arsenide crystals, which are used by the electronics industry to make advanced semiconductor devices. While the use of innovative technology developed on the campus in private industry may be an ordinary affair in the UK or the US, it is decidedly unusual in Japan, where academic research is vastly underfunded, where genuinely creative scientific discoveries are rare, and where Ministry of Education rules forbid professors to enter into private contracts with industry. It is one of the missions of Prof Nishizawa, a Sendai native whose father also was on the Tohoku University faculty, to break down the barriers between the academy and industry, to encourage Sendai's development into a regional information centre, and to foster the development of new industries. It is a tall order, especially given the arcane government rules that seem designed to make academic work as detached from the real world and irrelevant as possible. But if any city in Japan has a chance to make this dream come true, it is probably Sendai. It has some of the basic ingredients that have led to the growth of technology centres in the west: an excellent university and a pleasant environment, including nearby mountains and the sea. Sendai is an ancient city that was bombed flat during the war. But the city that emerged from the ashes is surprisingly attractive by comparison with the monsters that have grown up in central and western Japan. It could well serve as a model for urban planning in Japan, were it not already too late for most cities. Sendai has wide boulevards lined with tall shady trees. It has covered shopping arcades closed to traffic. If it is not architecturally inspiring, at least it is not as screamingly ugly as much of the urban sprawl in Japan. Indeed, much of the recent construction is pleasant in appearance. In spite of its population of about 930,000, Sendai is one of the few cities in Japan where it is possible to walk comfortably, without having to fight either crowds or traffic. It was fortunate, although perhaps only in retrospect, to have the luxury of growing at a slower pace than the cities of the more heavily industrialised centre. The mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, is still able to contemplate building a series of concentric ring-roads around the city, to draw future development away from the centre into satellites. Carrying out these plans was made vastly easier when, in 1989, Sendai was merged with several smaller neighbouring cities and designated as a major urban centre, giving the city government greater administrative powers. Sendai still has a long way to go before it attains a critical mass as a leading technology centre; none the less, it is beginning to attract the sort of industries that will help this to happen. Motorola, the the US electronics group, for example, opened a semiconductor assembly facility on the outskirts of the city last year, and is planning eventually to install facilities to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices. One attraction was obviously the Shinkansen express train umbilical cord to Tokyo, less than a two-hour ride away. But Motorola's Sendai plant is likely to grow increasingly independent of Tokyo. Motorola was attracted to Sendai partly by the Ultra Clean Technology Laboratory, connected to Tohoku University. The laboratory is developing clean room devices that Motorola hopes eventually to use, and the company has seconded one of its engineers to the laboratory full time to help in the work. Sendai airport has recently begun international flights to Seoul and Singapore. Motorola is now re-routing some of its international shipments to Asia away from congested Narita airport, which serves Tokyo, to Sendai. It will increase these shipments after the airport has increased its customs and freight handling capacity. The airport has been authorised to lengthen its runway to 3,000 metres, which will open the possibility of direct flights to Europe and the US. In that case, Mr Takashi Kitagawa, director and general manager of Motorola's semiconductor manufacturing, envisages US employees arriving in Sendai and attending meetings on the same day, instead of making the tiresome journey through Narita. Perhaps the underlying ambition of Prof Nishizawa and mayor Ishii would be to cut the umbilical cord to Tokyo altogether. This would plainly be unrealistic, and in fact Mayor Ishii is hoping that Sendai may one day take over selected government functions now located in Tokyo. Still, the goal of making Sendai's development less dependent on Tokyo, and establishing itself as a regional centre with strong direct ties to the outside world, looks achievable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Frank Bretschneider, ADN: "Programs for Soldiers </F> Without a Job"]    [Text]  <H5>  North Rhine-Westphalia </H5>   The Cold War is over and the Iron Curtain between the former  power blocs in the East and the West has fallen. Even though  the world has not become more peaceful as a result, as the  conflicts in Bosnia or Korea show, the time of the arms race at  least seems to be over. According to a study by the European  Union [EU], by the year 2000 the arms industry will shrink  world-wide by about 30 percent. What, however, is to happen to  the soldiers, the nuclear scientists, and weapons that are no  longer needed?    This is a problem that will be dealt with by the world's  first Center for Arms Conversion (BICC), which will start work  in Bonn in April. Arms conversion means the conversion of  military facilities for civilian purposes -- a multifaceted  issue: It includes the scrapping of weapons, the "retraining"  of professional soldiers, the new orientation of the armament  industry, as well as the use of the money saved from the defense  budget.    The BICC, which was founded on the initiative of the North  Rhine- Westphalian Land Government, wants to draw up concepts on  these issues: "The work is practically waiting to be tackled,"  said Mr. Wulf, the designated head of the center, when he  presented his future work in Duesseldorf. "We understand  ourselves as a service station for practical peace work."    Arms expert Wulf, who has until now headed the Development  and Peace Institute at Duisburg University and is an adviser to  the UN Disarmament Department, begins his work with 10  employees. Later on, the staff is to be increased to 30. North  Rhine-Westphalia takes over the start-up financing -- 11.7  million German marks [DM] over the next five years. Day-to-day  operations are to be financed by the World Bank, the EU, or  foundations.    The costs of disarmament are becoming a problem for many  countries, Wulf warns. His example is Russia: There 4.5  million people are employed in the arms industry. If these  people cannot find any new work, this could lead to a "social  disaster." In Germany about 280,000 jobs are dependent on arms  production; in addition, there are soldiers and civilian  employees in barracks.    "Of course, we can make only a moderate contribution to  solving the problems," Wulf knows. For this purpose, the BICC  wants, among other things, to advise arms companies and  establish a database, where experiences and concepts are stored  and passed on. So far, there are many individual projects all  over the world, but they are not linked with one another.  Specifically: One country is looking for solutions that may  already have been found elsewhere.    While the new orientation of the employees in the arms  industry and the military gives rise to many problems in view of  the worldwide job crisis, arms conversion meanwhile is making  the most progress in using outdated military facilities and in  scrapping weapons. In the FRG, for instance, universities are  taking over vacant barracks and using them as lecture halls or  want to establish students' hostels there. And the dismantling  of a tank, for instance, costs only DM3,000 now, Wulf says.  Three years ago it cost DM30,000.</p>

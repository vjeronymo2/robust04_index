			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The House, backing President Bush's effort to reward reforms in Eastern Europe,  passed a bill easing trade and investment restrictions for Poland and Hungary.  The measure, passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would drop U.S.  tariffs on some imports from Poland and authorize the Overseas Private  Investment Corp. to guarantee U.S. investments in Poland and Hungary. The  changes are to respond to recent reforms.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Christopher attacks China over human rights China and the US yesterday toughened their war of words on China's human rights record, souring the atmosphere for this week's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Mr Christopher, using his harshest language so far about China, expressed 'strong distaste' over Beijing's recent harassment of dissidents and said the security sweep would have a 'negative effect' on his visit and on the US review of China's favourable trade status. China lashed back at criticism from President Bill Clinton and earlier remarks by Mr Christopher about the arrests of three dissidents and the overnight interrogations of at least 12 more, calling the US complaints 'irresponsible'. Beijing police, only hours later, showed they were not deterred by US criticism by taking away Mr Wang Dan, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, for questioning. He was later released. Asked to comment on Mr Clinton's criticism of the recent detention of leading dissidents, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said: 'No foreign country, organisation or individual has the right to make irresponsible remarks or interfere'. Mr Clinton said last week after China's leading dissident, Mr Wei Jingsheng, was detained that 'we strongly disapprove of what was done and it is obviously not helpful to our relations'. Mr Christopher, who is visiting Australia, has said that human rights issues will top the agenda of his talks in Beijing with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. China last week provoked an international outcry when it began rounding up dissidents including Mr Wei who served more than 14 years in jail for his role in the 'democracy wall' protests of the late 1970s. Mr Christopher's visit to China comes at a delicate moment in Sino-US relations; a decision is pending on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status in the US market. Mr Clinton has demanded 'progress' on human rights before agreeing to renew MFN. A decision is due by June on the lower tariff regime for an estimated 96 per cent of Chinese products entering the US. China has repeatedly denounced attempts to link trade and human rights, and this is certain to be Beijing's prevailing message this weekend. 'Human rights and MFN are completely separate issues. We strongly oppose linking them,' Mr Qian said recently. The authorities seem to fear that dissidents will use the National People's Congress or Mr Christopher's visit to bring their cause to international notice by circulating petitions calling for increased political freedom. The Public Security Bureau, in a rare public statement, denied it was intimidating dissidents. It said Mr Wei and Mr Wang Dan were not in detention. Only Mr Zhou Guogiang (a labour leader and lawyer), Mr Yuan Hongbing (a lawyer), and Mr Wang Jiaqi had been detained and were 'being investigated'.</p>

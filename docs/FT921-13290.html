			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / 'Illiterate and lazy' jibe stokes tension with US THE Japanese government yesterday tried to calm anger in the US over a veteran politician's claim that American workers are lazy and illiterate. It also rebutted US suggestions that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, attempted in a television interview to distance himself from an auto trade agreement he had made with Mr George Bush during the US president's recent visit to Japan. The incidents come at a difficult time in US-Japan relations, with officials and politicians on both sides of the Pacific considering how to deal with US demands for cuts in Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Bush, who is campaigning for re-election this year, has been accused of failing to secure large concessions during his visit and faces mounting political pressure for tough action against Japan. The politician who criticised American workers is Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 79-year-old speaker of the lower house of the Diet. He said in a speech on Sunday in his rural constituency that 'American workers don't work hard enough, yet they demand high pay'. According to Japanese newspaper reports, Mr Sakurauchi also described the US as 'Japan's sub-contractor' and said that 'managers in the US cannot give written orders because about 30 per cent of American workers are illiterate'. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, said yesterday he disagreed with Mr Sakurauchi and that Mr Sakurauchi's comments did not reflect the views of the Japanese people in general. Mr Sakurauchi's post is largely honorary and he has no role in the government. Mr Sakurauchi himself denied describing the US as Japan's sub-contractor or referring to American workers as illiterate. He apologised for making a speech which was 'short of explanation' and 'liable to cause misunderstanding'. But by yesterday, the damage had been done. Mr Sakurauchi's original comments had been widely reported in US newspapers and television. Mr Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers' Union, condemned Mr Sakurauchi's criticisms as 'bigoted'. US tempers were further inflamed by reports of Mr Miyazawa's comments on plans by Japanese motor companies to increase purchases of US components by Dollars 10bn a year by 1994 and to 'expand sales opportunities' for US cars. He said that since Japan was a free market economy the figures should be seen as 'goals which the companies work towards rather than as firm promises'. US officials believe the Japanese car companies' commitments amount to firm pledges. Mr Michael Farren, US under-secretary of commerce for international trade, responded with a sharp warning that Japan would face a 'very negative reaction' should it fail to 'expeditiously move to meet and exceed the goals' set while Mr Bush was in Tokyo. Last night Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said she did not view Mr Miyazawa's remarks as backing off a pledge that Japanese companies would buy more American car parts. She said: 'the commitment is by the auto companies on their own. It is not a government-to-government agreement.'</p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SUSPECT JAILED IN DISCO BOMBING THAT LED TO RETALIATION ON LIBYA  </P> <P> A West German man of Arab origin has been arrested on charges of organizing the  1986 discotheque bombing that led then-President Ronald Reagan to bomb Libya,  authorities announced today.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old suspect was seized at his home on a warrant accusing him of  "preparing and organizing the attack on the La Belle discotheque."  </P> <P> Reagan blamed Libya for the attack, in which two American servicemen and a  Turkish woman died, and he sent U.S. planes to bomb Tripoli in retaliation.  </P> <P> West Berlin Justice Department spokesman Cornel Christoffel said the man, who  denied involvement in the bombing, was arrested when investigators searched six  apartments in West Berlin and a cell in the city's Tegel prison.  </P> <P> "The other five suspects are on the run," he added.  </P> <P> More than 200 people, including many off-duty soldiers, were wounded in the La  Belle bombing, which U.S. intelligence sources said was ordered by the Libyan  Embassy in East Berlin.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: ONCE GRAND, CINEMAS NOW FOCUS ON FUNCTION  </P> <P> There was a time when movie theaters were splendid palaces, grand fantasias  conjuring visions of ancient Egypt or China or Aztec Mexico or Moorish Granada.  </P> <P> Architect S. Charles Lee, in the 1931 Los Angeles Theater on Broadway, created  a dream version of the Palace of Versailles, complete with a tiered lobby  fountain dripping strings of crystal mock water into a mosaic basin guarded by  white marble sea serpents. The ornate darkness of the 2,000-seat auditorium  resounded with the throb of a giant Wurlitzer, which in veteran organist  Gaylord Carter's phrase, "perfumed the air with music."  </P> <P> But that was then; this is now.  </P> <P> And now cinema architecture tends towards the utilitarian, as if watching a  movie in an auditorium offers no more sense of occasion than viewing a cassette  on a home videocassette recorder.  </P> <P> Now we have multiplexes, clusters of small auditoriums, such as the recently  opened AMC Santa Monica Seven on the Third Street Promenade.  </P> <P> A prosaic box, finished in the fashionable Post-Modern mini-mall colors of  peach and bluish-green teal, the Santa Monica Seven divides its total 2,500  audience capacity among seven cinemas ranging in size from 200 to 465 seats.  </P> <P> Designed by Hemet-based architects Salts Troutman Kaneshiro Inc., the Santa  Monica Seven's main aim is, says partner Kevin Troutman, "to be compatible with  the traditional aesthetic of the pedestrian mall's Neo-Classical and Art Deco  architecture."  </P> <P> To achieve this compatibility, Troutman chose to design a facade that is almost  anonymous. A wide, recessed archway housing the ticket booth is the Seven's one  gesture toward grandness, in a plain stucco promenade frontage.  </P> <P> A narrow, soft drink bar with outdoor tables, titled Critic's Corner Cafe,  occupies the intersection with Arizona Avenue.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Seven's stripped simplicity continues in the lobbies of the  three-story multiplex.  </P> <P> The theater lobbies are little more than corridors lined with the inevitable  counters, serving the the appetites of a legion of munching popcornoids.  </P> <P> On the Arizona Street facade, a tall window lets light into the space occupied  by a series of escalators to carry patrons up to the second floor or down into  the basement-level cinemas.  </P> <P> The auditoriums seem spacious for their modest sizes. Comfortable seats, fitted  with AMC's trademark built-in cup holders, are upholstered to match the aisle  carpets. Completing the simple scenario are plain peach walls, black-painted  ceilings and red concrete floors designed for the easy cleaning of spilled  popcorn and soft drink slop.  </P> <P> The luxuries of advanced technologies mitigate some of the architectural  bareness of the multiplex auditoriums.  </P> <P> The ample cinema screens are curved vertically and horizontally to "provide  enhanced image clarity, a brighter picture and even illumination," said AMC  regional director Sam Giordano. The visual quality is backed by a High Impact  Theatre System that provides crisp sound.  </P> <P> "The design intends to generate a lively, fresh and light atmosphere in which  the experience of watching the movie is paramount," Troutman explained. "AMC  operates within tight building budgets in an architectural formula that is  carefully considered."  </P> <P> The AMC architectural formula has proven successful in several local  multiplexes, including Burbank's AMC 10 and Century City's Century 14.  </P> <P> In Burbank, AMC followed the inspiration of the local Golden Mall by creating a  giant box that looks like a suburban shopping plaza filled with small cinemas.  Clad in rough, gray, concrete block, capped with red-metal edging and isolated  in a sea of parking Tarmac, the AMC 10 is a bare bones building as minimal as  its surroundings.  </P> <P> The Century 14 complex is, for AMC, an upscale design. Here the lobbies are  more spacious, the finishes a trifle glitzier, the shopping mall ambience muted  to match the sensibilities of a supposedly more sophisticated Westside  clientele.  </P> <P> The relative design sophistication of AMC's Century 14 is matched by the  Universal City complex of its major rival, the Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon.  With 5,940 seats in 18 auditoriums, Cineplex Odeon's Universal City aimed "to  bring majesty back into the viewing of movies," said then chairman Garth  Drabinsky when the multiplex was opened in 1987. "If the setting in which you  actually see a film turns out to be a let-down," Drabinsky added, "the whole  complicated enterprise has failed."  </P> <P> Recognizing that the grandeur of the lobby plays a main role in creating a  sense of cinematic majesty, Drabinsky lavished marble floors and grand curving  stairways in a double-height volume flanked by an illuminated garden. The  ubiquitous concession counters, whose pungent popcorn odors grab you  immediately upon entry to the AMC multiplexes, are discreetly relegated to the  side areas close to the auditoriums.  </P> <P> Kansas City-based American Multi-Cinema Entertainment Inc., which claims to  have invented the multiple-cinema concept in its hometown back in 1963,  operates close to 1,500 screens in 270 sites nationwide. Cineplex Odeon, AMC's  main multiplex competitor, runs an even larger number of outlets in the U.S.  and Canada.  </P> <P> Cineplex Odeon first revolutionized Toronto's theater-going experience in the  late 1970s by converting the ground floor of an office building into a series  of matchbox-sized auditoriums showing small-scale movies, many of them foreign  art films whose potential audiences were as limited as the size of the Cineplex  screens.  </P> <P> Like the Beverly Center multiplex, Cineplex Odeon's first major Los Angeles  multiple cinema complex, the Toronto auditoriums were crude little chambers  with uncomfortable seats and fuzzy projection no better than that of a home  projection TV.  </P> <P> But Cineplex Odeon proved capable of better things.  </P> <P> In its conversion of two 1930s L.A. movie houses, the Fairfax on Beverly  Boulevard and the Showcase -- previously the Gordon Theater -- on La Brea  Avenue, Drabinsky's in-house architects honored the Art Deco flavor of the  decor while renovating the spaces and updating the technologies.  </P> <P> The Broadway, a new Cineplex Odeon two blocks south of the Santa Monica Seven  on the Third Street Promenade, continues this conscientious pattern.  </P> <P> Designed by Toronto architect David K. Mesbur in collaboration with Santa  Monica-based Solberg &amp; Lowe Architects, the Broadway's Art Deco frontage is  skillfully integrated into the new Janss Court mixed-use office and condominium  complex that surrounds it. The sleek 1930s style, which seems so apt for  movie-going, still pervades the lobby and auditoriums.  </P> <P> The Broadway and the Santa Monica Seven will soon be joined by another  multiplex on the Third Street Promenade.  </P> <P> Mann Theater's Criterion, a 1,500-seat six-cinema complex designed by Jeff  Cooper Architects in the renovated shell of a 1920s shop and office building,  is under construction across the Promenade from AMC's Seven.  </P> <P> When the Criterion opens later this year, the Promenade will offer the public  about 5,000 new cinema seats.  </P> <P> Given this great expansion of cinema space, it seems a pity to many designers  that the architecture of the new multiplexes is usually so commonplace and  uninspired.  </P> <P> It may never again happen that multitudes of patrons will wander downtown on  Broadway admiring the glories of the Million Dollar, Los Angeles, Palace,  Orpheum, United Artists, Tower, Cameo or Roxie, or parade on Hollywood  Boulevard as they did in the 1920s and '30s.  </P> <P> But the lack of a distinctive design style in most new multiplexes does not  mean that fine or fantastic architecture is no longer possible in modern movie  houses.  </P> <P> San Francisco's 1984 Galaxy Theater, designed by Kaplan McLaughlin and Diaz, is  a glittering neon-outlined, Post-Modern Art Deco glass cube-and-tower that  flashes enticement to passing traffic on busy Van Ness Avenue.  </P> <P> Eschewing fake nostalgia, crudity or condescension, the Galaxy demonstrates  that cinema design can still create an urbane and glamorous mise en scene even  in this more modest movie era.  </P></p>

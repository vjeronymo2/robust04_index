			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / EC puts 10% dumping duty on chips from South Korea THE European Commission said yesterday it was imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty of 10.1 per cent on memory chips from manufacturers in South Korea. This follows a complaint from the European Electronic Component Manufacturers' Association, acting on behalf of Motorola's UK subsidiary, Siemens of Germany and SGS-Thomson of Italy. Charges were brought against Samsung, Hyundai and Goldstar. The Commission says its two-year-long investigations showed substantial dumping margins varying between 18 per cent and 120 per cent of the EC border price. The memory chip prices investigated were for DRAMs, volatile memories used in most kinds of electronic equipment including computers and telecommunications systems. DRAMs are an important technology driver and have significant strategic importance for the European electronics industry. According to the Commission, Korean imports of DRAMs into the EC rose 23 times between 1986 and 1990, reaching a 25 per cent market share - or 37m megabytes of storage - by 1990. During the period, the Commission said, Korean producers substantially undercut the prices of Community producers. While European producers will be relieved by the Commission's decision, there is concern that the Commission's guidelines on anti-dumping are out of date and inappropriate.</p>

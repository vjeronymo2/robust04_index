			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interventions which should be evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing firearm injuries are listed below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;firearm design modifications to reduce the lethality of firearms and ammunition, loading indicators, and safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;statutory interventions (e.g., prohibiting carrying firearms in public, increasing sentences for felony gun use, or owner liability for firearm injury);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;imposing waiting periods and limits on the number of guns which can be purchased within a specified time period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;taxing firearm and/or ammunition purchases;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;increased gun dealer fees and restrictions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;metal detectors in schools;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;firearm licensure system (e.g., restricting youth access to firearms, owner-registration regulations, etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;storage containers which limit unauthorized access to weapons and ammunition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;disrupting illegal gun markets through localized street-level tactics currently used against illegal drug markets, and neighborhood-oriented police coordination with residents and community-based organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;public education campaigns to change weapon storage practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of interpersonal youth violence interventions which deserve further evaluation include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;mentoring programs which provide positive adult role models for high-risk youth;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;public information campaigns which dramatize the unacceptability and enormous social and economic cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violence, while promoting alternatives to violence as a means of conflict resolution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;environmental changes such as improved lighting, protective landscaping, or closed-circuit television monitoring;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;legal sanctions restricting youth access to alcohol;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;job training and work experiences;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;sports and recreational activities which offer young people opportunities to spend time in a structured and purposeful environment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;parent training to increase parental support for non-violent behavior by youths.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Identifying modifiable risk factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In epidemiology,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> there is programmatic interest in analytic research that identifies mechanisms, causes, or risks of injury which might lead to new or more effective interventions against the four types of violence highlighted in this announcement.

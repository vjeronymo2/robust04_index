			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Meridien Biao plans African expansion South Africa's transition to democracy is encouraging at least one pan-African banking network to expand its business through the continent. Mr Andrew Sardanis, chairman of the Luxembourg-based Meridien Biao, yesterday established a commercial holding company in the US as a vehicle for raising additional capital to extend his chain of commercial banks and insurance companies in Africa. The holding company, Meridien Corporation of the USA, is capitalised at Dollars 50m. 'We are hoping to attract new shareholders to Meridien Corporation at some future date,' Mr Sardanis said yesterday in Nairobi. Mr Sardanis is enthusiastic about the potential expansion of regional trade following South Africa's multi-racial elections. He hopes his network of banks in 20 African countries will act as co-respondents for South African banks in financing the expected increase in trade. In the future he says, he may apply for a banking licence in South Africa. For many years, the Cypriot-born businessman was banned from entering South Africa for being a Zambian citizen and a one-time member of former president Kenneth Kaunda's government, which actively supported the African National Congress. Meridien Biao is a newcomer to the African banking scene. The banking group is the result of a merger in 1991 of Meridien banks in anglophone countries and much of the Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidental, a troubled network of banks in francophone Africa. Its assets, following the devaluation of the CFA franc in January, are valued at Dollars 950m, down from Dollars 1.45bn before the devaluation. Net income in the year ending September 1993 was a meagre Dollars 3.3m, which the chairman attributes to reorganisation costs. The establishment of the Meridien Corporation holding company has effectively separated Mr Sardanis' banking interests from the mining, trading and construction companies grouped under ITM international. 'After the BCCI affair,' says Mr Sardanis, 'I decided it was important to separate the banking operations from the rest of the group in the interests of greater transparency.' To date, however, neither British nor French banking regulators have granted Meridien Biao a banking licence. 'Most OECD countries are reluctant to undertake supervision of a large network such as ours; they are concerned at the remoteness of the continent and have adverse perceptions of Africa,' Mr Sardanis wrote in his annual report. However, he hopes this state of affairs might be redressed by seeking a listing for Meridien Corporation in one of the US stock exchanges, bringing his group of companies under the Securities Exchange Commission rules.</p>

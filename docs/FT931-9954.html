			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / New rescue plan for threatened pits: Draft white paper would avoid legislation - MPs' recommendations sidestepped THE DRAFT white paper on the future of Britain's threatened coal industry has passed over most of the main recommendations of the Commons trade and industry committee in favour of an alternative plan to expand the market without new legislation. The government hopes its four-pronged approach will create an extra market of, on average, about 12m tonnes a year for domestic deep-mined coal. This could be higher in the first year and the package would save about a dozen of the 31 mines threatened with closure. The plan would also pave the way for the government to press ahead with privatisation of the industry next year. The draft under discussion envisages expanding the market for deep-mined coal by: blocking imports of orimulsion - a bitumen-based fuel; slowing the planned rundown of coal stocks; cutting output from open-cast mines; using subsidies to halt growth in coal imports. The draft avoids the committee's more radical proposals - halting purchases of nuclear-generated electricity from France, cutting the Pounds 1.2bn domestic nuclear levy and postponing electricity market liberalisation. All these measures would require legislation. The committee's recommendations would result in an additional market of at least 16m tonnes a year, implying more than half the threatened pits could be rescued. In an unusual move, Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, plans to tell a press conference today that its proposals could be implemented for much less than the Pounds 500m originally stated. A recent FT survey of the Conservative MPs most likely to rebel over coal indicated that proposals to save between 12 and 14 pits would safeguard the government's Commons majority. But the rescue plan hinges on cajoling National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity generators for England and Wales, into signing new five-year coal contracts. These would be over and above the 40m tonnes next year and 30m tonnes in the subsequent four years that they have tentatively agreed to buy. Senior ministers are relying on the combination of a direct Treasury subsidy and the implicit threat of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the power industry to secure a deal. They want the two generators, in which the government retains a 40 per cent interest, to sign a 'heads of agreement' by the end of this month. While ministers acknowledge they are meeting resistance from the generators, which are not legally obliged to buy any coal, they think the promise of five years of stability in the industry will persuade them to back down. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has concluded that fresh legislation would threaten lengthy rows at Westminster and provoke a backlash from the generators' non-coal suppliers. He has been advised that the government's plan would not fall foul of the European Commission or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If agreement is reached, he will present the package to MPs as a strictly limited programme to phase out existing coal subsidies, emphasising that present arrangements for the electricity market involve an implicit subsidy for coal of around Pounds 1bn a year. This would be reduced to Pounds 350m or less next year and to nothing by 1998. Spreading the rundown of stocks over five years rather than the expected two would have the most significant early impact, making room for more than 6.5m tonnes of additional consumption in both 1993-94 and 1994-95. Pegging coal imports at current levels and effectively banning orimulsion could each expand the annual market for domestic deep-mined coal by 3m tonnes by 1995-96. Cutting open-cast output to 10m tonnes a year could in time lift demand by a further 4m tonnes. But excessive coal stocks and the availability of cheap imports have helped to strengthen the generators' bargaining position: they could in theory avoid buying any British coal at all in 1993-94, as the select committee report acknowledged. Michael Smith adds: Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, last night expressed strong reservations about the white paper's expected contents, saying failure to postpone electricity market liberalisation would leave British Coal 'prey to the market power of its principal customers'.

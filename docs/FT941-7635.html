			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Envoy backs reforms in Mexico Mr Manuel Camacho, the presidential peace envoy in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas, has linked the resolution of the 54-day peasant uprising there to national democratic reforms, in an apparent switch in strategy. After publicly insisting that negotiations with the Zapatista rebels must focus on economic and social problems in Chiapas, Mr Camacho seemed to join with the rebels after the second day of talks in criticising Mexico's political system. He agreed that democracy must play a part in a solution to the uprising. 'Many of us want changes in the country. We want more democracy, more freedoms and advances in justice,' he said 'The solution is a new treatment for all indigenous communities in the country and a commitment to democracy in Mexico.' Mr Camacho, known for his negotiating skills, may have changed his tone to gain the trust and confidence of the Zapatistas before seeking concessions from them. Alternatively he could be acting on behalf of President Carlos Salinas, who in the past has used Mr Camacho to prepare public opinion for democratic changes. However, Mr Camacho is known to believe privately that electoral reform is an essential condition for an agreement with the Zapatistas. Discussions between the government and the opposition parties on democratic reforms have recently stalled, and Mr Camacho may have been trying to press on the governing party the importance of making the necessary political concessions if it wants to solve the conflict in Chiapas. Speculation has risen Mr Camacho is using the peace talks to lay out his own agenda for democracy and establish his independence from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Mr Camacho failed to win the party's presidential nomination for this year's election, but is still thought to have presidential ambitions. The rebel spokesman sub-commander Marcos warned that if negotiations broke down the Zapatistas would return to war. 'If peace is not dignified and true, who will deny us the sacred right of living and dying like dignified men and women? Who will impede us returning back to war and death?' he said.</p>

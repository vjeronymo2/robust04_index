			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Despatches: The case of the discourteous cockroach - Singapore / Kieran Cooke discovers an intruder in a society where everyone observes the litter of the law I AM SITTING in an old corner coffee shop in Singapore. A cockroach has just walked past my chair. I almost fall to the floor in shock. Singapore is possibly the cleanest place on earth; there is not even any bird muck about. Every car looks sparklingly new. Cockroaches mean dirt - and dirt is not allowed in Singapore. That cockroach must be punished. There are societies where rules are flouted. People cross roads on red lights, sit on lawns beside 'Do not walk on the grass' signs or insist, quirkily, on the right to light up giant stogies in no smoking areas. Then there are societies like Singapore, where rules are meant to be obeyed strictly. None more so than the cleanliness laws. The Singapore authorities wage a relentless campaign against dirt creators. People can be fined up to SDollars 1,000 (Pounds 420) for not flushing public toilets. Smoke in an indoor public place or give a careless spit and bang goes another hefty wad of dollars. Carry chewing gum into the country at your peril. Since last year, the evil stuff has been banned. It is dirty and has been known to mess up the operation of the doors on Singapore's pristine underground system. The authorities go to considerable lengths to catch litterbugs. Recently, closed-circuit TV cameras were installed at a housing estate to try to catch people throwing rubbish out of windows. Being caught discarding a sweet wrapper or cigarette packet risks not only a fine but public humiliation as well. Recently, the government cornered 10 litter louts and the media was called in. These social deviants were lined up for punishment, forced to wear neon-green 'Corrective Work Order' vests and set to work picking up rubbish. For an hour, they were paraded before jeering onlookers and television crews. There were front-page pictures in the newspapers. Some have said the government is going too far in its anti-litter campaign: one MP drew a parallel with the activities of the Red Guards during China's cultural revolution of the late 1960 when alleged counter-revolutionariees were subjected to similar public humiliation. But most Singaporeans have come to accept the finger-wagging ways of their government. In any case, most are campaign drunk, anyway. Scarcely a month goes by without a new campaign being launched. There is the anti-smoking campaign (with the papers carrying a daily picture of a healthy non-smoker), the anti-road bully campaign, the speak Mandarin campaign. Then there was a birth control campaign for families to 'stop at two.' Now, faced with a rapidly-ageing population, the government is changing tack. Educated women, especially, are being encouraged to have more children. The government is waging a campaign to make people more entrepreneurial. There are even suggestions of a campaign to make Singaporeans more spontaneous. Meanwhile, a courtesy campaign has been going on for 15 years. This year, the government - under the auspices of the recently formed Courtesy Council - has decided to spread its campaigning wings and the target is 'ugly Singaporeans' misbehaving abroad. The local newspapers have been full of stories about such people. Apparently, Singaporeans have a vacuum cleaner approach to buffet meals, piling up their plates and shovelling excess food into carrier bags. They use calculators when looking at menus. They grab any free gift going, steal hotel towels and are constantly on the look-out for free lavatories. They take pictures when not allowed. These anti-social traits are by no means exclusive to Singaporeans; many people from other countries have similar, or even nastier, habits. But Singapore's motto is: never let a chance for another campaign go by. Come July 1, the foreign minister is due to fire the first shots against the ugly Singaporean abroad. Tourists, business people and students will all be under scrutiny. A search is on for the politest Singaporeans overseas - the so-called 'courtesy ambassadors.' An official involved in the campaign says one effect will be to make Singaporeans overseas feel wanted. 'It will boost their morale, as many feel neglected and left out of what happens in Singapore.' But my cockroach does not look neglected. It is looking fat and content as it strolls around in the dirt. Probably a smoker and gum-chewer to boot. Never flushes toilets. Must be a visitor from overseas.</p>

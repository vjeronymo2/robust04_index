			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 71m Avonmouth development A joint venture between BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING and BIRTLEY ENGINEERING, the Taylor Woodrow materials handling specialist, has been awarded the Pounds 71m design and construct contract, by National Power, for the bulk handling facility, as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the Royal Portbury Dock near Bristol. The total package comprises an offloading facility at the Royal Portbury Dock and a train loading facility at Avonmouth. The work entails installation of continuous ship unloaders and a conveyor system from the ships and quayside to a stockyard. These will be linked, via a tunnel, to the other side of the River Avon estuary where the Avonmouth railhead is located by a series of conveyor and transfer stations. Two 2,600 tonne bunkers are to be built at the railhead with facilities for loading and dispatching of trains each carrying 1,500 tonnes in total weight at hourly intervals. Prior to works operation, part of the Portbury Dock will need to be deepened by the dredging of 200,000 cu metres of material in order to accommodate bulk carrier ships up to 120,000 dwt. Another aspect of the contract involves extending and upgrading the existing quay structure at the Royal Portbury Dock. This is to facilitate the two continuous ship unloaders, which stand 40 metres high, weigh 1,200 tonnes and are capable of unloading material at 1,750 tonnes per hour. The 3.35 metre internal diameter tunnel is to be constructed using a full face Lovat tunnel boring machine, which has to go through varying strata from soft silt and clay to very hard conglomerate rock. Work has already commenced and the project is intended to be fully operational by July 1993.</p>

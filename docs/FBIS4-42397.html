			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- At the annual meeting of the German  Industry Federation (BDI) in Bonn on 31 May, Federal Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt warned about the transfer of more and  more jobs to low-wage countries. He said that this could  jeopardize Germany as a production center. In the service  sector, too, jobs could be irrevocably lost as a result.  Economics policymakers and trade unions should counteract this  by improving production conditions in Germany.    At the BDI congress Rudolf Scharping, chancellor candidate  of  the Social Democratic Party [SPD], called for modernization of  the national economy. "We are a long way away from a true  recovery," Scharping said. The increasing export demand should  not lead to the "fatal impression" that "we have done our job,  and now things can continue as before."    BDI President Tyll Necker said that increasing international  competition for the best production and financial center  required basic structural change in industry and society. There  were "no easy and pleasant formulas" in this respect. He  appealed to all citizens to take part in the European  Parliamentary elections. In this way, a free and peaceful  Europe would be strengthened.</p>

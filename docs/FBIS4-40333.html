			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Security and Defense Committee of the  Kazakh parliament believes it premature to consider deploying a  Kazakh peace-keeping battalion in Tajikistan.    The committee's chairman, Toktar Aubakirov, linked it with  the Kazakh government's failure to develop a statute for  peace-keeping forces. In an interview with INTERFAX Wednesday  [15 June], he said the statute should stipulate the rights,  duties and privileges of these units as well as every individual  soldier. "Each soldier of this battalion must serve on a  contract basis," he pointed out.    Aubakirov himself was ambiguous about sending a  peace-keeping  battalion to Tajikistan. On the one hand, Kazakhstan must  comply with its obligations under the treaty on the joint  guarding of CIS borders. "On the other hand, as a father I do  not want my son to be killed in an alien country," he said.  Aubakirov believes that the Tajik people should settle their  issues themselves. In his opinion the peace-keeping forces  "imposed their order on Tajikistan in a violent way."    Kazakh Deputy Defense Minister Alibek Kasymov told INTERFAX  Wednesday that his republic was ready to fulfill its obligations  to guard the Tajik borders. He said that a Kazakh battalion  numbering 500 servicemen had been stationed in Tajikistan since  1993. "The peace-keeping battalion is waiting for its turn to be  deployed. If the Supreme Soviet ratifies the treaty, we will  deploy it," he said.</p>

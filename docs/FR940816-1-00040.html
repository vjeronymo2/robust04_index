			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once moderate areas are subsequently reclassified as serious, the affected States must ensure that adequate contingency measures, as described above, are in place for such areas. This is explicitly required under the statute. Section 189(b)(1) requires areas reclassified as serious to submit ``an implementation plan.'' Under section 172(c), in turn, ``plan provisions'' required under part D must provide for the implementation of contingency measures. Accordingly, for those moderate areas reclassified as serious, if all or part of the moderate area plan contingency measures become part of the required serious area control measures (i.e., BACM), then additional contingency measures must be submitted whether or not the previously submitted contingency measures had already been implemented. Further, the affected States must ensure that serious areas have adequate contingency measures considering, among other things, new information about the potential attainment shortfall for the newly reclassified serious area. The States must submit contingency measures for serious areas or otherwise demonstrate that adequate measures are in place within 3 years of reclassification. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 41  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Air Act does not prescribe when States containing serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas shall submit section 172(c)(9) contingency measures (or otherwise demonstrate that adequate contingency measures are already in place). However, section 172(b) of the Act directs the Administrator to establish a schedule for submittal of the plan items in section 172(c) at the time the Administrator designates an area as nonattainment. Such schedule is to include a date or dates ``extending no later than 3 years from the date of the nonattainment designation'' (see section 172(b)). By analogy, EPA concludes it is reasonable to establish that the formal deadline for the submittal of section 172(c)(9) contingency measures (or a demonstration that adequate contingency measures are in place) by States containing serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas is no later than 3 years from the date of the serious area reclassification ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;45 (1984)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

General Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP's must include quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable date (see section 189(c) of the amended Act). Section 171(1) of the Act defines RFP as ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part (part D) or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable national ambient air quality standard by the applicable date.'' A discussion of these requirements follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Reasonable Further Progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, for some pollutants, RFP has been met by showing annual incremental emission reductions sufficient generally to maintain at least linear progress toward attainment by the specified deadline. Requiring linear progress reductions in emissions to maintain RFP may be appropriate in four situations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. When pollutants are emitted by numerous and diverse sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Where the relationship between any individual source and the overall air quality is not explicitly quantified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Where a chemical transformation is involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Where the emission reductions necessary to attain the standard are inventory-wide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in those areas where the nonattainment problem is attributed to area type sources (e.g., fugitive dust, residential wood combustion, etc.), RFP should be met by showing annual incremental emission reductions sufficient generally to maintain linear progress towards attainment. Total PM&hyph;10 emissions should not remain constant or increase from 1 year to the next in such an area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring linear progress reductions in emissions to maintain RFP is less appropriate:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Where there are a limited number of sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Galina Grigorenko: "An Unexpected Finale"] </F>   [Text] A press conference took place yesterday in Kazan,  at which five recent candidates for deputy of the State Duma  took part. The candidates came from two electoral  districts--Moscow District No. 24 and Volga District No. 27.    Yuriy Voronin spoke first at the press conference, telling  of  crafty maneuvers that affected the outcome of the election in  the Moscow district. In the first place, the number of ballots  arriving at the polling stations did not coincide with the  number issued to the voters and canceled--there was a difference  of about 7,000. Secondly, ballots from portable ballot boxes  were often dumped into the common "kettle" without drawing up  separate official documentation. Thirdly, hardly any of the  authorized candidates for deputy were present for the tallying  of the vote. Fourthly, only following intervention on the part  of the Central Electoral Committee did the district commission  permit the former contenders for a deputy seat to familiarize  themselves with the control documents.    Each of the press conference participants added his own  contribution to the overall picture of the election just held.  Vladimir Belyayev, for example, reported that according to  information from observers from the Accord movement, from 40 to  80 percent of city-precinct voters voted for him, but the  official statistics show somewhere around one-third. Mars  Rameyev shared his impressions from meetings with rural  residents, who were given a "directive" to show preference to  Oleg Morozov.    Volga District No. 27 was no different in this respect,  judging from the comments of its two candidates. As Aleksandr  Sapiy related, data from the district commission and 18 precinct  commissions did not coincide, and a mysterious "juggling"  occurred at eight precincts, as a result of which 500 votes were  "pulled away" from the candidacy of the leader of Tatarstan's  Communist Party. But perhaps most categorical of all was the  assessment of Munavir Murtazin (who is, incidentally, senior  assistant to the procurator for military matters), who stated  that the procuracy must institute criminal proceedings with  respect to the facts uncovered in accordance with Article 133 of  the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which envisages serious  punishment for those who participate in the forgery of election  documents.    The candidates for deputy participating in the press  conference believe it would be advisable to establish a  commission that would carefully examine all the "delicate"  aspects of the present election campaign and subsequently  publish the results. In addition, the intention to apply to the  procuracy was also clearly stated.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN hits the target It must be pretty galling for Westland to be shot down only hours before a government minister announces that some long-awaited reinforcements may be about to arrive. Still, assuming that GKN's bid goes unconditional, Westland's new owners will be happy that tenders for the RAF's support helicopters are now being invited. Despite GKN's scepticism during the bid, if a price can be agreed with the Ministry of Defence, Westland stands a good chance of turning some of those possible orders into real work. The incident highlights the difficulty facing those large institutions that have so far resisted GKN's advances. GKN has a controlling stake in Westland, yet the price does not reflect the highest hopes for the company's prospects. Holders now have to choose between the unpalatable acceptance of a price they consider inadequate and the uncomfortable existence of a minority shareholder. If enough hold out, however, and four institutions speak for more than 30 per cent of the shares, GKN will not be able to use Westland's earnings to relieve its tax problems. Staying in for a year or two in the hope of more may not be, in this case, a road to nowhere. Unless remaining institutions put up vigorous objections, however, Westland's management may feel it has little choice but to recommend the offer. Canny and more adventurous shareholders may mitigate their disappointment by opting for less cash now and money from settled litigation later. The flip side of the institutions' reluctance is that GKN has bought Westland's potential at a very reasonable price. All it has to do now is hang on to the management which has made Westland worth buying.</p>

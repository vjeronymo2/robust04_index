			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Embattled ICD loses Pounds 4.9m INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company, yesterday showed the impact of its recent reorganisation reporting pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.92m for the 15 months to May 31 compared with profits of Pounds 1.13m for the previous year, writes Catherine Milton. The board does not recommend a dividend and says it will 'strongly resist' resolutions to be put to shareholders at a special meeting requisitioned by a boarding party representing 12 per cent of the shares. The resolutions propose the removal from the board of Mr David Cicurel, chairman, Mr Ralph Elman, finance director, and Mr Daniel Unger, a non-executive. The three would be replaced by nominees of the boarding party grouped within PSB, a direct marketing company. ICD made exceptional debits of Pounds 4.14m in provisions against trade debtors. ICD also booked a write-down on assets and wrote off Pounds 993,378 in goodwill following the sale of its interest in Database Group. Sales rose to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9.59m). Losses per share were 8.51p compared with earnings of 2.12p.</p>

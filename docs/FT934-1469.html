			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Lack of offers from origins pushed prices for white pepper higher in the latter part of this week, reports Man Producten. The next crop in Indonesia  -the largest supplier of white pepper - is not due until July/August and the existing stock is tightly controlled. So further price rises for whites are likely. Imports into the US are running behind both 1992 and 1991. Muntok whites traded at Dollars 2,700 a tonne for January delivery, while in New York the ex-warehouse price was Dollars 3,100 a tonne. Brazilian supplies were offered at about Dollars 2,600 a tonne, fob The black pepper market reflected the steadiness of the whites. Brazilian prices were stronger, with the limited quantities offered all absorbed. Renewed Russian interest in India pepper has brightened the prospects for the new crop. The harvest in Kerala is said to be delayed.</p>

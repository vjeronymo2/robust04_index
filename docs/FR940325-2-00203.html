(``University'') 4464 Alvarado Canyon Road, San Diego, California 92120, has filed an application for an order declaring it not to be an electric utility company under section 2(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> University is a California corporation and is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing, owning, operating and maintaining, either directly or indirectly, industrial energy projects that are qualifying facilities (``QFs'') as defined by the Public Utility Policies Act of 1978. University wholly owns the Chula Vista Cogeneration Project (``Project'') located at Rohr Industries in Chula Vista, California. In addition to owning the Project, University serves as general partner in two California limited partnerships, each of which owns a QF in California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Project is a 9 megawatt, combined-cycle, gas-fired facility and is currently operated as a QF. Rohr Industries (``Rohr'') serves as the steam host for the Project and purchases approximately 90% of the electric output from the Project. The remainder of the output is sold to the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company. It is stated that gross annual sales from the Project were $4,031,852 in 1991, were $3,571,584 in 1992, and will be approximately $2,891,000 in 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> University states that Rohr, the steam host for the Project, has recently decreased its steam requirements, thereby placing the Project's QF status at risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

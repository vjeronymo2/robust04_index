			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antoine Constantine from Beirut] </F>   [Text] Eyes turned to Damascus today, where Lebanese  President Ilyas al-Hirawi has arrived for a summit with his  Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad. Beirut observers await with  extreme interest the practical results of this summit, on more  than one level. Regionally, the Syrian-Lebanese summit comes  before U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's expected  visit to the Middle East and before the new round of bilateral  talks between the Arabs and Israel. On internal Lebanese  levels, the Syrian-Lebanese summit follows important  developments in the Lebanese arena. The most important of these  developments was the crime of blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church and the subsequent political decisions, media and  security measures, and the launching of legal cases, the most  recent of which is the decision to try two Iraqis accused of  killing an Iraqi oppositionist in Beirut.    At a time when the Lebanese Government is encountering  opposition to its decision preventing electronic media from  transmitting news, and preventing the General Federation of  Trade Unions from staging demonstrations, the newspaper AL-DIYAR  cited unnamed sources as saying President al-Hirawi's stand is  in complete harmony with the Damascus position. He wants news  and freedom of the press to be restored following his return to  Beirut. Here, there is a difference between his stand and that  of Prime Minister Rafiq al- Hariri. The same sources told  AL-DIYAR that President al-Hirawi is not happy with the  government as it is, taking into consideration Prime Minister  al-Hariri's overwhelming majority in it.    At any rate, this is not the first time there has been talk  about a cabinet reshuffle. Despite the talk about difference  and alliances within the Council of Ministers, concerning major  decisions the Lebanese Government has proved its consolidation.  Its rejection of the expected workers' demonstration proves  this.</p>

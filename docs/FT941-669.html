			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland The bid for Westland has always felt a bit rum. Given that the companies know each other well, have apparently got on well in the past, and agree that the dispute is over price, this is an issue which should be settled around a negotiating table. That it hasn't been perhaps reflects the large gap between what GKN is happy to pay and what Westland thinks it is worth. Still, having pursued an aggressive route, it is now decision day for Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman. Practical considerations mean that he must launch any revised bid by Thursday morning. If Sir David pays up enough he might be able to buy enough shares in the market and have control by lunchtime. If he shoots low, he risks getting no acceptances at all. He then has to wait until 1995, when his stake will have been diluted down to 40 per cent and more Westland orders may have materialised. How much GKN is prepared to improve its offer depends on its assessment of profits in 1996-97, rather than Westland's 1994 forecast. GKN may be mean given how hard it has been to sweat profits from its engineering business in recent years. GKN's corporate financiers are doubtless devising ways of fiddling with any settlement of Westland's long-running legal dispute to sweeten its bid. After all the rhetoric, however, it would be surprising if GKN offered much more than 320p against the 290p opener. Shareholders may put the potential for orders and profits higher. GKN's large stake makes the issue finely balanced. But without a bigger improvement, the chances are that everyone will be back to do it all again next year.</p>

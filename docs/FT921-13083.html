			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Appointments: Kicking the habit Alan Dunstan, who has spent 23 years at Abbey National, is kicking the habit to join management consultants Oasis as head of the marketing and sales management division. Dunstan, who is 43, was sales director at Abbey for the last year, and marketing director for the previous seven. He says that while the building society had been through a vast upheaval during its metamorphosis into a public company, he was worried that it was now entering a period of stagnation - or worse. 'People were genuinely concerned about it becoming another TSB.' Unwilling to hang on for several years of potential frustration, he decided to accept the approach from Oasis, an outfit which had impressed him three years ago when he employed it to help Abbey develop its data base. He reckons his experience with Abbey's shift from a product-to a customer-driven business will have all sorts of applications among Oasis' clients, which include other building societies as well as insurance companies. ***** Sir Alistair Frame is to become a public champion of Britain's manufacturing sector, following his appointment as chairman of the National Manufacturing Council of the CBI. The Council was set up last year to help implement a strategy for strengthening Britain's manufacturing base, following criticism of the CBI for neglecting the needs of the manufacturing sector. Sir Alistair, who is non-executive chairman of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, was until last year the chairman of RTZ Corporation. He is to become chairman of British Steel in July and will head the CBI body for two years. *****- Salomon Brothers has appointed Steven Tye, currently head of Eurobond trading, as head of the fixed income syndicate, replacing Simon Meadows who left the company earlier this month.</p>

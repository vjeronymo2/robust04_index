			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: House prices still falling House prices in the UK fell by 1.2 per cent in January, after a 1.3 per cent fall the month before, according to the house price index produced by Halifax, Britain's largest lender. The average price of a house last month, at Pounds 64,470, was 3.6 per cent less than in January last year. The annual fall in the average price of a new house was even greater, at 4.6 per cent. The south east has suffered the largest falls. January's figure is disappointing since it follows a series of measures aimed at reviving the market, including the government's decision to abolish temporarily stamp duty on houses purchases up to Pounds 250,000 and to convert mortgages into rent. In addition, the largest building societies announced unprompted half percentage point mortgage rate cuts. However, Halifax has reported that these measures have prompted greater activity, with mortgage applications increasing by 50 per cent in the seven days after its mortgage rate reduction.</p>

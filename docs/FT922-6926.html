			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Basis of a deal on radical CAP reform in sight THE fifth attempt this year to synthesize the vested interests of the EC farm sector around a genuinely radical reform of the creaking Common Agricultural Policy was finalised early yesterday morning, giving the basis for a deal. Although it festoons most member states with sweeteners to help them digest severe cuts in subsidised prices, the structure of the European Commission's bold attempt to overhaul the CAP is still intact. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner who has cajoled, bludgeoned, and horse-traded with the 12 farm ministers for 18 months to bring them this far, said yesterday: 'What we're involved in here is a totally different philosophy to what has existed for 30 years.' Agreement is now in view - and as ministers settled into their second consecutive night of negotiations, there was hope for a deal either today or tomorrow. Yet despite general conviction that the fifth compromise paper presented by the Portuguese presidency constituted the basis for settlement, a major North-South row over plans to concede more milk quotas to Spain, Italy and Greece gathered pace through the day and could delay the denouement. The central element in the overnight compromise was the cereals price. Mr MacSharry persuaded the Portuguese presidency to retrace its steps and deepen the planned cut in subsidised grain prices to 29 per cent. The Commission had wanted to drop the cereals price by 35 per cent, from Ecu155 per tonne now to Ecu100, though it drew its public line at Ecu105, with the tacit understanding that Ecu108 a tonne was its limit. Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese farm minister, had tried to break the logjam by moving towards Germany, which insisted on settling as near as possible to the 20 per cent cut in domestic subsidies demanded by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round. Mr Cunha last month proposed Ecu112 per tonne, and received an unprecedented and public rebuff from Mr MacSharry. On Tuesday they split the difference and settled at Ecu110 - a 29 per cent cut close to the 30 per cent the Commission had always set out to achieve, with a 1 per cent psychological sweetener to enable Germany to feel it was in the '20s'. The compromise on cereals looked set to harden into a deal acceptable to the Twelve last night, opening the way to agreement on the rest of the reform structure for which it is the foundation. It will enable a market with a production overhang of around 20m tonnes (as well as similar amounts in intervention stockpiles) to come back into balance. It will make EC grains competitive, without the need to dump abroad, and should all but eliminate cereal export subsidies - the real rock on which the Uruguay Round is foundering. Within the CAP reform structure itself, it will enable significant price cuts in the livestock and dairy sectors, which will be part compensated by lower cereal feedstock prices. The Commission also won back its own compromise position on how the scheme is to operate. In essence, the reform moves away from price support towards direct payments to farmers. All farmers will get a full refund of the price cuts paid directly to them, contingent for all but small farmers to their taking 15 per cent of their land out of production. All farmers will also get compensation for this 'set-aside', whereas the Commission had wanted to bite further into overproduction by excluding the biggest farms. Ministers had also rejected the Commission's plan to monitor set-aside by individual farms, which Mr MacSharry and his colleagues insist is the only way of making farmers take responsibility for their production. The presidency opted instead for county-size regional units  - but on Tuesday the Commission got the individual farm unit reinstated. Senior officials say farmers will eventually bridle if they are penalised as a region because some farmers within it flout the land in production limits. These officials believe they have established a transitional regime to the effective controls they were seeking. Against this, scattered over the compromise are concessions for dried fodder and cereals grown for silage; for France's maize growers and the South's hard wheat growers; for tobacco producers and hill sheep farmers. Germany, which is likely to be allowed to pay a one-off national subsidy to its farmers this year, has also been granted special treatment for the eastern Laender. Some formula of future yield will be the yardstick for compensation for price cuts there, against fixed, past production reference periods for the rest of the EC - another critical weapon in the fight against oversupply. Ireland has scored a signal victory with an easing of what was to have been a very severe contraction of the intervention regime, which currently absorbs about four fifths of its beef produce. The compromise recognises the fact that Irish (and French) farmers slaughter their herds later in the year, and ensures they do not lose out in case those who slaughter earlier get into what will be finite stockpiles first. The UK, which at times over the last 18 months has suggested MacSharry was trying to refashion EC agriculture on a backward Irish model, was said by Irish farm minister Joe Walsh to be seeking the same regime for Northern Ireland. A British special case - providing half-subsidy for sheep farmers in disadvantaged areas over the 1,000 per flock limit - was also in the compromise, although British ministers were fighting for more. But the extra milk quota for Italy, Spain and Greece remained a big stumbling block, opposed by the UK, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Luxembourg. This was enough to block the concession, but as the evening wore on, it seemed likely that all but the three recipients would come out against it. 'It's going to be very hard to get round that one,' predicted Mr David Curry, the UK deputy agriculture minister. The three countries have applied the milk quota regime only loosely, and are looking for extra quotas to soak up some of their existing excess production. The Commission reasons that this is a worthwhile price if these countries are now obliged to implement and monitor quotas. There were few signs last night that such reasoning was percolating through the rest of the Council.</p>

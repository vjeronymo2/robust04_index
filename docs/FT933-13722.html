			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: European decline leaves Multitone lower at Pounds 1.6m HIT BY the downturn in the German economy, Multitone Electronics reported a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 1.62m for the year ended April 30. 'In Europe, which accounts for nearly 90 per cent of our sales, trading cond-itions continued to be difficult and caused pressure on margins,' said Mr Ian Karten, chairman. The group manufactures and supplies specialised radio communication systems, and developed the world's first paging system in 1956. An increase from 3p to 3.5p in dividend (the final is 2p) for the year failed to offset the trading statement, and the shares closed down 8p at 119p. Business, particularly in Germany, began to weaken last autumn when many customers started postponing capital spending. Although those markets were unlikely to pick up quickly this year, the company said it was well placed to increase its market share. In the UK more customers were hiring in preference to buying paging equipment, leading to continuing rather than one-off payments to Multitone. The results included a first time contribution of Pounds 415,000 from Paging Systems and Pounds 174,000 from settlement of litigation, offset by Pounds 285,000 of costs relating to new busin-ess. Turnover came to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 23.2m). Earnings per share were 7.17p (8.33p).</p>

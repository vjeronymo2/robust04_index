"Tomorrow will be a very tense day" and it is necessary for  the president to be in Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters upon  arrival to St. Petersburg on Thursday. He did not elaborate.    Initially the president planned to stay two days in St.  Petersburg and to visit the fortress of Kronshtadt where an  anti-Bolshevik uprising took place in 1921 and was drowned in  blood.    Yeltsin has recently rehabilitated the victims of the  uprising.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Northern Electric Northern Electric's first letter to shareholders gives little sense of a defensive strategy against the Trafalgar House bid. But Northern can afford to take its time. A government special share and a restriction on ownership of more than 15 per cent of a regional electricity company should both be removed by early April. But referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission could frustrate the battle. The current share price, 4 per cent below the cash offer, suggests expectations of a referral. This might be impossible to pursue on commercial grounds, but the justification of 'public interest' provides sufficient breadth to squeeze through a referral. A desire to establish a framework before a likely glut of other bids, together with pressure from politicians, could mean a decision which is clearly against the interests of shareholders in both companies. Even so, the bid would be unlikely to be blocked. And referral could give Northern six months to sharpen its defences, before predators returned. As one regional electricity company is very much like another, the defence will have to bring out the attractions of the sector as a whole. However Northern will also have to emphasise its individual allure, and this will probably be done through hard cash. It has next to no debt, and could well afford to reward loyal shareholders with special dividends. Referral talk has depressed Northern's share price, but it still remains in play. Shareholders should be patient.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / US follows the EC towards discrimination MR MICKEY KANTOR, US trade representative, has hailed the controversial side-agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement, announced earlier this month, as 'historic'. He was right to do so. The revised agreement covers economies that contain 370m people and generate output worth Dollars 6,500bn (Pounds 4,360bn). Its inclusion of workers' 'rights' and the environment marks an important precedent. As significantly, US acceptance marks a further jump towards discriminatory trade policies. The US is a latecomer to use of discrimination as a positive tool in trade policy. The latest Gatt report on EC trade policy* shows who has been the leader. EC discrimination starts with community preference, the central element in its trade policy. As the chart shows, between 1961 and 1991 the 12 current members of the EC increased their exports to one another from 43 per cent of total exports to 62 per cent. In the 1980s, the divergence between the increase in trade within the EC and that with the rest of the world became particularly marked. Meanwhile, the share of intra-EC trade in world exports rose from 15 per cent in 1961 to 24 per cent in 1991. Over the same period, the share of EC exports to third markets in world exports fell from 20 to 15 per cent. Gatt's first article calls for non-discriminatory treatment, with all members supposed to benefit from 'most-favoured nation' (MFN) tariffs. In fact, the EC offers strict MFN treatment only to the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The economic weight of these five countries and limits on the coverage of EC preferential schemes ensure that 60 per cent of EC external imports do receive mfn tariff treatment. Nevertheless, EC trade policy is riddled with preferences. In 1991, for example, preferentially treated imports from members of the European Free Trade Association accounted for 22.4 per cent of EC external imports; from Mediterranean countries, they accounted for 7.1 per cent of its imports; from Lome member countries, they accounted for 3.9 per cent; and from other developing countries under the generalised system of preferences, they accounted for 6.2 per cent. Recently completed agreements with eastern European countries must be added to the list. The EC sits at the centre of a spider's web of discrimination, discriminating itself and a source of discrimination in others. How far is the US going to follow the EC down this road? If it does go much further, will other leading economic powers - Japan, for example - follow? Most important of all, does a worldwide embrace of discrimination make sense? The main motivation for preferences is political, rather than economic. It is a questionable policy, however, because every country benefited by a preference is matched by another which is hurt. But there is also an economic dimension. Economists ask of preferential trade agreements whether they create trade or divert it. Another way of making the distinction is to ask whether preferences are a way of meeting the global competition or of running away from it. Judged by their trade and economic performance, EC members are too often taking in one another's high-cost washing, while failing to sustain their global competitiveness. The same may also happen to the US. Countries that would rather trade preferentially than meet global competition may compound their economic faults thereby, rather than remedy them. Mr Kantor sees no such dilemma. He claims of Nafta that 'the growth that will come from creating such a large market enhances our ability to compete with Japan and the European Community'. This ignores the possibility that participation in a protected North American market will reduce, not enhance, US ability to compete globally. Mr Kantor might do better to recall the fundamental insight of the Gatt's founders: the largest of all possible markets is the world market. *Trade Policy Review Mechanism: European Communities, report by the Gatt Secretariat, April 19 1993, C/RM/S/36A.</p>

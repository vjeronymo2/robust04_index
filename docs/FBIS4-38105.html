			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 27 (AFP) -- The US navy recently  discovered two Egyptian ships in the Red Sea carrying Saudi  weapons to south Yemen, an Egyptian journalist has charged.  Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal said in a lecture at Cairo University:  "The US navy in the Red Sea recently intercepted and  requisitioned two Egyptian boats transporting Saudi arms to  south Yemen."    AFP obtained Monday [27 June] a copy of Haykal's lecture,  given Wednesday 22 June]. But the US naval command centre based  in Florida, covering the Middle East, told AFP they were unaware  of any incident and had not received any internal report on the  matter. Haykal was close to former Egyptian President Jamal  'Abd al-Nasir, and has many Arab and western contacts.    An Egyptian source, who asked not to be named, said he could  not confirm or deny the claim. "Egypt's position in principle is  not to contribute to any effort to supply arms to either of the  Yemeni parties," he said.    Opposition newspaper AL-'ARABI said Monday the two boats  intercepted by the US navy returned to Egypt with their cargo.    Egypt's President Husni Mubarak recently criticised northern  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih for his "insistence" on  trying to maintain unity, saying it could not be achieved by  force. But Cairo has not recognised the breakaway Yemen  Democratic Republic, declared by the south on May 21.    War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his  southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.</p>

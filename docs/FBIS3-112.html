Professor Naomi Chazan, a member of  the delegation, told Emeka Onwachukwu that one of the reasons  for their visit was to (?intimate) the Nigerian Government on  the peace process in the Middle East.    [Begin recording] [Chazan] I and my delegation were sent by  the foreign minister of Israel, Mr. Shim'on Peres, to the  government of Nigeria to do two things: Number one, to explain  the progress on the peace process, autonomy for the  Palestinians, and also on the subject of negotiations with  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; and number two, to bring together  Israel and Nigeria more closely to examine possibilities for  cooperation and for mutual enrichment.    [Onwachukwu] Now, you have just alluded to the fact that  your trip here is to acquaint Nigerians of what has been going  on in respect of the peace process between the PLO and the  Israeli Government. Now, what is the present situation about  the negotiations?    [Chazan] There has been a fair amount of progress in the  last few weeks. About two weeks ago, Israel and the PLO  initialed the Cairo Agreement, which deals with most of the  security issues that had been outstanding, and in the past two  weeks, there has been substantial progress on almost all other  things in our negotiations with the Palestinians. We anticipate  if the progress continues, as it has in recent weeks, then  within one month to six weeks' time, we will begin  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal. [end recording]</p>

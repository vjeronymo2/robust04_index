			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bibby falls Pounds 10.7m into the red J Bibby &amp; Sons, the conglomerate, yesterday reported a tumble into pre-tax losses for the year to September 24, after exceptional charges. However, the shares rose 10p to 70p as operating profits rose from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 29.6m. Bibby, which is 79 per cent owned by Barlow of South Africa, announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 7.07m profits) on turnover down at Pounds 764.6m, compared with Pounds 791.5m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 30.6m, relating to the Pounds 41.7m disposal in May of the agricultural feeds business to Associated British Foods, and the cost of restructuring what is now the industrial division. The feeds business contributed turnover of Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.39m), and there were losses of Pounds 20.4m from its disposal, the closure of operations and goodwill. Within continuing operations, there were losses of Pounds 6.72m from disposals, closures and goodwill and other restructuring costs of Pounds 3.48m. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said: 'The restructuring of the group is mostly done and we have fully provided for everything we can think of.' Interest charges were reduced to Pounds 10m (Pounds 14.1m). Borrowings fell to Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 122.8m) after the sale of the feeds business and a building in Spain. Lower rates, especially in Spain, also helped. Behind the operating profits rise, lay a sharp reduction in losses from capital equipment to Pounds 865,000 (Pounds 7.15m) and a rise in the industrial division to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 9.05m). The agricultural business made profits of Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.2m) and materials handling, Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 16.1m). Losses per share emerged at 11.99p (earnings of 2.26p) and the total dividend is lifted to 3p (2p) via a final of 2p. A special dividend of 2p was also paid following the disposal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 4 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Miguel Martinez,  charge d'affaires of the Cuban Embassy, stated today that the  document on which a legislator based his accusation that Fidel  Castro's government is meddling in Panama's domestic affairs is  counterfeit.    The Cuban diplomat, who is his government's top  representative in Panama, stated at a news conference that the  document on which legislator Leo Gonzalez based his charges is  "counterfeit, spurious, and prefabricated."    Martinez noted that the bogus document, which reached the  Cuban Embassy through "a friendly Panamanian," was delivered by  him on 25 April to Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos  Cordero. He warned Cordero about the possibility that it might  be used as part of "a disinformation campaign."    The document links ranking members of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD) and members of the Papa Egoro Movement  with operations to exchange drugs for weapons in Cuba,  legislator Gonzalez revealed.    Spokesmen for both parties noted that Gonzalez's charges are  the result of his low vote expectations in the upcoming  election, in which he is up for reelection and, according to  political polls, could very well lose.    The Cuban charge d'affaires noted today that the document  features forged signatures of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina; Panamanian Consul Robert Infante; and Hector Hernandez  Pardo, director of the Superior Institute of Foreign Relations  of Cuba.    To enable reporters to confirm the forged signatures, he  showed them official Foreign Ministry documents with the  signatures of the officials, which were different from those  contained in the controversial document.    "They do not match. They have been altered and forged,"  Martinez said, insisting that the Cuban Embassy "wants to  resolve this matter."    "We have been and will continue to be objective, and we do  not meddle in Panama's domestic affairs," the diplomat stated,  describing as "irresponsible" the manipulation of such an  "extremely delicate" issue that could affect relations between  two states.    Miguel Martinez explained that the "counterfeit documents"  were available months ago in the Panamanian capital, and he  added that people whose identity he did not know were asking up  to $20,000 to sell them.    Since the U.S. Army invasion on 20 December 1989, relations  between Cuba and Panama have been maintained at a nominal level  without any diplomatic representative at embassy level.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD PUTS BRAKES ON BIG OIL  </P> <P> The city of Carlsbad put out the unwelcome mat Tuesday for the oil industry in  the form of an ordinance that will make it nearly impossible for businesses  related to offshore oil drilling to locate there.  </P> <P> The Carlsbad prohibition on on-shore oil- and natural gas-support facilities  differs from similar measures enacted by San Diego County and the cities of San  Diego and Oceanside in that it is not an outright ban. On the advice of the  city attorney, the Carlsbad ordinance seeks to protect itself from legal action  by oil companies by leaving oil-related businesses a slim possibility of  establishing themselves in the city.  </P> <P> The action was sparked by the federal government's moves last year to open up  Lease Sale 95 off the North County coast for oil drilling. In July, Congress  approved a one-year moratorium on drilling off of much of the U.S. coastline,  including a moratorium in California on any "pre-leasing" activities leading up  to the sale of oil drilling leases until Oct. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressure on President  </P> <P> Carlsbad city officials, along with representatives of many other coastal  cities, have traveled to Washington to urge the President to make the ban  permanent. But, if and when the moratorium is called off, Carlsbad intends to  be ready to make the city inhospitable to oil companies.  </P> <P> Among the restricted businesses are oil- and gas-processing plants, refineries,  storage facilities, transfer stations, pipelines, warehouses, offices, tanker  terminals and helicopter pads. No such facilities now exist in Carlsbad.  </P> <P> "We realize there is not much we can do about offshore drilling besides lobby  Washington," Councilman Eric Larson said before Tuesday's council meeting. "So  we've decided the part we can play in this is by banning those on-shore  facilities that would make drilling possible."  </P> <P> "We wanted to make it as strong as we possibly could, but we also wanted to  make it lawful," Councilwoman Ann Kulchin added. "It does no good to have an  ordinance full of flowery prose if it can't stand up in court. The way it's  written, it's tough, it's tight, and we won't get sued."  </P> <P> The ordinance, unanimously approved by the council at Tuesday's meeting, amends  six local coastal plans and Carlsbad's General Plan and zoning codes. Under the  law, oil- and gas-support facilities will be permitted only if the council  makes six findings in favor of the proposed business:  </P> <P> * That it will pose no danger to the life and property of the city's residents.  </P> <P> * That it will not pose a potential threat of damage or injuries to the  residents.  </P> <P> * That the benefits of the proposed project clearly outweigh the possible  adverse environmental effects.  </P> <P> * That there are no feasible alternatives.  </P> <P> * That the location of the facilities at the particular location clearly  outweigh any potential harm to public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort  and general welfare of people residing or working in the community, and will  not be detrimental to property or the general welfare of the city.  </P> <P> * The facility must be located only in zones specifically designated for  industrial use.  </P> <P> With those conditions in place, the current strong anti-oil drilling sentiment  among the council members and the fact that very little of the city is zoned  for industrial use make it all but impossible for any oil-supporting facility  to successfully locate in Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Oceanside and San Diego city and county, which enacted total bans on on-shore  oil facilities, were sued by the Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. in 1987. The  lawsuit, brought against 13 cities and counties in California, claimed that the  municipalities' laws banning on-shore oil facilities violates the supremacy of  the federal government embodied in the U. S. Constitution and threatens the  nation's energy security.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was partially resolved in favor of the cities last year when a  federal judge ruled that there was no basis to the oil industry claims that the  local ordinances violate federal supremacy. U.S. District Judge Consuelo B.  Marshall said the majority of the ordinances might cause oil companies  additional expense and inconvenience, but are not "true obstacles to the  accomplishment of the federal purpose."  </P> <P> However, Marshall said it is possible that the ordinances in San Diego,  Oceanside and San Diego County might violate the commerce clause of the U. S.  Constitution. The case is being appealed.  </P> <P> Carlsbad City Atty. Vincent Biondo said he will be watching the court's  decision, and, if the cities prevail, he will recommend that Carlsbad amend its  law to impose a total ban of on-shore oil support facilities. Meanwhile, Biondo  expects the oil companies not to bother to attack Carlsbad for its watered-down  version. "We would hope they would continue to pursue the existing cases as the  best and most expeditious way of determining what cities can and can't do,"  Biondo said.  </P> <P> "But," he added, "if the oil companies want to litigate, I suppose that's what  we'll have to do. The protection of our citizens is our first concern."  </P> <P> Robert Kallman, executive director of the President's task force on oil  drilling, said Tuesday that the city of Carlsbad is within its jurisdiction to  enact the ordinance. "I recognize the concerns of local government, and it's  certainly their prerogative to do that," he said in an interview from his  Washington office.  </P> <P> Nine public forums conducted in recent months by task force members throughout  the state "have already exposed us to the overwhelming negative feeling of the  public on this issue," Kallman said.  </P> <P> But the actions of local governments that ban on-shore oil facilities will have  no effect on the task force's recommendations to President Bush, due Jan. 1, on  the feasibility of drilling off the California coast, he said. "We're not  looking at the industry viewpoint, we're looking at the environmental  consequences," Kallman said.  </P></p>

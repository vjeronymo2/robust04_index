			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cuts, dollar and Wall Street lift bourses BOURSES rose on interest rate cuts and a higher dollar, moving into an exciting afternoon as Wall Street threatened its all-time highs, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT built on the American post-bourse buying which lifted it on Thursday afternoon. The DAX index rose 31.48 to a new closing high of 2,066.17, up 2.5 per cent on the week, gained more lift from Wall Street and closed the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,083.62. Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM11bn. Volkswagen soared through a key chart point, rose DM11 to DM389.80 on the session, and piled on another DM6.20 to DM396 in the post bourse for a 4.5 per cent gain on the day. Allianz, the insurer, classed as a beta stock on its ability to outperform the market, rose DM63 to DM2,832, and by another DM28 after hours. Thyssen, the steelmaker, consolidated Thursday afternoon's gains, rising DM8 to DM226. PARIS set a new closing high with investors encouraged by the 30 basis point cut in the intervention rate at the start of business. The CAC-40 index added 32.14 or 1.5 per cent to 2,231.86, more than 4 per cent up on the week. The banking sector was firmer overall. However, Hoare Govett recommended an underweight position in this sector, on the basis that 'current ratings appear already to be fully discounting a full earnings recovery in 1995 without giving due weight to the difficulties (such as property-related loans) which will continue to beset the sector for at least the next 12 months.' MADRID posted early gains on an intervention rate cut, and extended them to close with the general index 5.10 higher at 310.28, up 3.9 per cent on the week. Banks joined utilities as the buyers' choice, Popular gaining Pta700 to Pta17,500. Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel noted that Popular had been touring the UK this week. ADR stocks were also strong with Repsol gaining Pta100 at Pta4,065. ZURICH concentrated on cyclicals and dollar-sensitive shares, such as Brown Boveri, SFr14 higher at SFr1,004, and Ciba-Geigy, up SFr7 at SFr745, as the SMI index rose another 11.7 to a new high of 2,701.6, up 3.4 per cent on the week. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index finished up 1.4 at 137.1, a week's rise of nearly 5 per cent. Nedlloyd was suspended for a short period before announcing a further stage in its divestment programme to concentrate on core interests. The shares fell back Fl 1.00 at Fl 52.60, but up 12 per cent over the week. MILAN lagged behind, the Comit index gaining 4.03 to 593.76 for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week. Fiat put on L22 to L3,863 on news that it had been asked by the French authorities to be a core shareholder of Rhone-Poulenc when it is privatised. COPENHAGEN was lifted to a further closing high after the cut in interest rates with the KFX index adding 1.10 to 103.05, for a gain of 3.2 per cent over the week. HELSINKI put on 2.9 per cent, the Hex index closing 43.4 higher at 1,559.6. Banks gained 5 per cent on news that the Savings Bank of Finland was up for sale; Nokia climbed FM20 to FM320 on a better than expected interim report. ISTANBUL fell back by more than 3 per cent after the constitutional court halted the planned privatisation of the state telecommunications group. The composite index shed 505.9 to 14,320.9.

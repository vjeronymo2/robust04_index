			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Some BCCI creditors want more: Richard Donkin on a group resisting the planned settlement A HIGH Court hearing today may shed some light on one of the more puzzling aspects of the BCCI affair - why a group of creditors is continuing to resist the compensation agreement negotiated by the liquidator and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross chief liquidator of the bank, appears to have a powerful case for settling with Abu Dhabi. He says he has negotiated the best deal available - a Dollars 1.7bn contribution from the emirate and a payout for creditors of 30p to 40p in the pound. He came close to despair last month when three BCCI creditors filed an appeal against the Luxembourg court approval of the agreement. The most prominent of the appellants is Mr Adil Elias, a 40-year-old engineering consultant who lives in Orlando, Florida, where his company, Ronical International, is based. Since 1975, when he gained a doctorate in mechanical engineering at the University of London, he has specialised in the study of air pollution and alternative fuels. Mr Elias and his family lost more than Dollars 1m at the Edgware Road, London, branch of BCCI, which he used because of the bank's branch network in the Middle East. Almost a month before the BCCI closedown, the controversy surrounding the bank led him to instruct his branch to move his assets to Barclays. 'Stupidly I allowed them (BCCI) to stop the instructions,' he said. Since the BCCI collapse in July 1991 he has devoted much of his time to the liquidation. In July he sold his home to help finance legal action. 'I will sell my new home, too, if I have to,' he said. As chairman of the BCCI Depositors Protection Association, he is at the forefront of a campaign against the compensation agreement. Mr Elias says 'more than hundreds' of BCCI depositors feel the same way about the agreement. The liquidators point to a Luxembourg court consultation among depositors - 21,000 replied, 94 per cent in favour. That apparent endorsement may have influenced the UK liquidator to seek court directions on whether to call a creditors' meeting to elect a liquidation committee for BCCI SA. Mr Elias, a member of the two current creditors' committees, believes that the liquidator are hoping that such a meeting would not elect him to a new committee, effectively reducing his influence. There seems little doubt that the liquidators view him as a thorn in their side. Both he and they insist they want the best deal possible for creditors, but they diverge on strategy. Mr Elias believes Abu Dhabi is being too cosily accommodated in the liquidation. He says the emirate could be forced to pay a larger contribution were it sued in the US under punitive civil laws that provide for triple damages. Mr Smouha believes that civil action against Abu Dhabi would be lengthy, costly and too much of a gamble. Mr Elias's hand would be strengthened if indictments were issued in the US against any member of the Abu Dhabi administration.</p>

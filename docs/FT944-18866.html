			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / History is not bunk: Washington's elite has beaten the hoi polloi and Disney Image is everything,' says Andre Agassi, batting tennis balls off mountains and the Queen of England in a TV commercial for a Japanese camera. It is a contemporary truism with which this week the Walt Disney Company, creator of images beyond number and phenomenally conscious of its own, could only ruefully agree - after pulling the plug on its latest grand project. In Washington, where most business is politics, there has not been a local story for years quite like Disney's aborted history theme park next to a civil war battlefield 35 miles outside the nation's capital. In comparison, the ups and downs of presidents, senators, governors and mayors have seemed almost trivial. The park has pitted the elite against the hoi polloi, the horsey set against the bus rider, environmentalists against advocates of economic growth, historians against historians, even government against government. It began last November when Disney announced it had taken an option to buy 3,000 acres of land just outside the small town of Haymarket in Prince William County, Virginia, close to the killing fields of Manassas, as the site for a 'historic theme park'. In January, it fleshed out the project, envisaging 2,300 houses, 1,300 hotel rooms, and nearly 2m square feet of retail space, to cater for 5m-6m visitors a year when it opened in 1998. The price tag would be about Dollars 650m for the park, and Dollars 1bn for everything. Disney wanted state and county financial help - and got it. George Allen, the newly installed Republican governor of Virginia, saw the project as the leitmotif of his pro-business administration. In March, he rammed through the state legislature Dollars 163m in grants. A week ago, Dollars 130m in new road spending was authorised by county and state officials. The federal government, however, was looking increasingly askance at issues under its jurisdiction, including air and water quality and the widening of interstate roads. Benjamin Forgey, the Washington Post's influential architectural critic, also kept chipping in with pungent articles on the dangers of urban sprawl. But Disney still believed it would win the bureaucratic wars. It was the image war that felled it. Haymarket is a modest town, near Highway 66. But it is a gateway to the rolling Virginia Piedmont valleys that contain some of the finest horse country estates in the east - filled with weekend retreats for Washington's powerful. These include the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Jack Kent Cooke, who owns the Washington Redskins football team, Pamela Harriman, US ambassador to France, Senator John Warner of Virginia, once married to Elizabeth Taylor, Alice Marriott of the hotel family, the Graham family of the Washington Post, and media glitterati by the dozen. Their mood was exquisitely captured in a Washington Post article in April headlined; ' Eeeeek] A Mouse] Step on it]' But these influential and sophisticated people - some of whom listened to the populist talk shows favouring the Disney plan - knew they needed better arguments than the preservation of their comfortable lifestyles from hordes of Coke-swilling, shorts-wearing tourists in buses and rental cars. They got them from the guardians of America's heritage. A Who's Who of US historians, many hardened by the bitter battles of academe, leapt into the fray. The most prominent included David McCullough (Harry Truman and the Panama Canal and president of the Society of American Historians), Arthur Schlesinger Jr (THE authority on presidents), James McPherson, C Vann Woodward and Shelby Foote (all doyens of the civil war and the south). Disney mustered a couple of tame historians of its own, but they were outnumbered and outclassed. They were also hampered by the fact that it was never exactly clear how the company intended to depict 'history' in its theme park, beyond the idea of a 'water ride' in the manner of Lewis and Clark, the early American explorers. The anti-Disney historians, calling themselves Project Historic America, focused their fire on two fronts. For a start, they could not see the point of locating the project within an hour's drive of 16 civil war battlesites, 13 historic towns and 17 historic districts, most of which have indeed been lovingly preserved, including Manassas itself. The second string to their bow might have been borrowed from the French, always ranting on about American cultural imperialism. As David McCullough put it: 'We have so little left that is authentic and real. To replace what we have with plastic, contrived history, mechanical history, is almost sacrilege.' When Congress finally got into the act with hearings in June, this was the message they heard - that US history was too important to be left to Disney to reinterpret. Disney executives, Governor Allen and county officials all weighed in with counter-arguments, but the public relations war among the opinion makers was one-sided. Even so, the idea that Disney gave up simply to avoid the disastrous image of historians and socialites lying before its tractors stretches credulity - even for a company known above all for its lovable Mouse, Duck, Snow White and Lion King. However the battle to overcome such opposition is not what a stretched Disney management, weakened by death, illness and resignation, needs at present. With attendance flat or down at all of its theme parks except Tokyo (where the Japanese have no problems with American history), but its animated film division on a huge roll, the company is casting around for new directions - most likely into commercial television. So it has folded its Haymarket tent. Local businessmen said yesterday they were sad, but in the Piedmont valleys the white wine spritzers will be flowing freely this weekend.</p>

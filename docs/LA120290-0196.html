			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YULE TREE MAGNATE MEANS BUSINESS;  </P> <P> COMPETITION: CRITICS SAY STU MILLER, WHO HAS BUILT AN EVERGREEN EMPIRE, IS A  GOLIATH TRYING TO SQUASH RIVALS. MILLER SAYS HE JUST DEMANDS FAIR PLAY.  </P> <P> Christmas tree magnate Stu Miller -- who turned a $4,000 savings into one of  the largest Christmas tree retailing businesses in the state -- didn't build  his evergreen empire by being a nice guy.  </P> <P> "Christmas trees are nothing more than a commodity," said Miller, whose company  now operates about 50 lots around the state, including eight in the San  Fernando Valley and 13 elsewhere in Los Angeles. "Nobody has ever applied good  business practices to the Christmas tree business before."  </P> <P> To help his enterprise take root and grow over the last decade, Miller has sued  competitors and violated a promise with a Christian organization not to sell on  their property on Sundays, court records show. People who live near his main  lot say he has bullied them when they complain about traffic and late-night  work on the property.  </P> <P> Most recently, Miller filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Community College  District to try to stop farmer Joe Cicero from selling trees from his fruit and  vegetable stand at Pierce College, which is across the street from a Miller and  Sons lot.  </P> <P> But Miller, 48, an affable man who opened his first lot in Granada Hills as a  teen-ager in 1961, resents the characterization that he is a Goliath cruelly  strong-arming tiny competitors.  </P> <P> All he wants, he said, is fair play. And he is willing to go to court to ensure  that.  </P> <P> "They have to abide by the same fair-business practices that we have to," he  said, shaking his fist for emphasis.  </P> <P> Miller denies that he deliberately violated his contract with Valley Cathedral,  a Christian counseling organization whose parking lot he rented to sell trees  during the 1985 season.  </P> <P> In the contract, Miller agreed not to conduct business on the ministry property  on Sundays. But for two consecutive Sundays, the lot was open for tree sales.  </P> <P> Dr. James Coppedge, Valley Cathedral minister, said in a court affidavit that  Miller's son admitted he knew the lease prohibited any Sunday sales but said  his father ordered him to sell anyway.  </P> <P> Valley Cathedral won a temporary restraining order prohibiting further Sunday  transactions, but by the time it was granted, only one Sunday remained until  the holiday.  </P> <P> After Christmas, Coppedge asked Miller why he had broken his promise.  </P> <P> "He thought the Lord wanted him to succeed in business, and I got the  impression that he thought that whatever he had to do to do that, that's what  his duty was," Coppedge said. "Break a contract if you need to, but sell those  trees -- that's what his philosophy was."  </P> <P> Miller maintains, however, that he misunderstood the contract and thought the  prohibition applied only to Sunday mornings. He said he never would have rented  a lot that forbade all business all day Sundays because 65% of Christmas tree  sales occur on weekends, he said.  </P> <P> "He's a very smart businessman and he understands the court system and  litigation," William Norland, vice president of academic affairs at Pierce  College, said of Miller.  </P> <P> Pierce administrators first dealt with Miller in 1985, when he sold Christmas  trees wholesale to the Pierce College Associated Students Organization.  </P> <P> The problem was, Norland said, Miller sold the trees to the students at close  to the retail price -- and the stands were sold at the exact retail price -- so  the campus made only $1,500 to $1,800 in profit.  </P> <P> Miller refused to disclose any information about his finances. However, when  Cicero sold trees at the site last year, he earned $22,000 in profits.  </P> <P> "We'd never done anything like this before, and we didn't know if it was a good  price or a bad price," Norland said. "It's hard for me to say he took advantage  of us. Had we been highly efficient and understood the Christmas tree operation  better, we probably could have done better."  </P> <P> This year, Norland said, Miller filed a lawsuit against the community college  district to force school administrators to order Joe Cicero -- who farms 15  acres of Pierce land -- to stop selling Christmas trees.  </P> <P> Cicero and the college have developed a mutually beneficial relationship over  the years, with Cicero providing technical support and equipment for the  school's agriculture program, Norland said, and tree sales helped him keep his  little farming operation viable.  </P> <P> But Miller's lawsuit charged that the district should have taken public bids  for the right to sell trees on the property.  </P> <P> To avoid a protracted legal battle with Miller, the district prohibited Cicero  from selling trees on the site this year, Norland said. Now, however, the  college is engaged in a legal battle with Cicero, who began tree sales this  weekend.  </P> <P> Without Miller's lawsuit, the college would probably have allowed Cicero to  sell the trees, Norland said.  </P> <P> Miller defended his action against the college district, saying that if the  college wasn't willing to open the process to a public bid, then it wasn't fair  for anyone to sell trees there.  </P> <P> Miller made a similar argument to California State University Northridge  officials in 1985, which Oregon farmer Jack Price said resulted in his eviction  from the Devonshire Downs fairgrounds on campus, where he and his family had  been selling trees for six years.  </P> <P> Price, who now peddles his trees on the Woodland Hills Little League field,  said that after Miller kicked up a fuss, the university kicked him off the land  but out of courtesy did not allow any other tree sales there.  </P> <P> If Miller had won the right to use the site, Price said, "he would have gotten  all our customers."  </P> <P> Miller said he believes his portrayal by competitors as a mean-spirited  Christmas Scrooge stems from resentment over his success.  </P> <P> "It's getting hard to be successful in this country anymore," he said. "America  is turning away from people becoming successful. There is a widening gap  between rich and poor these days, and when you are successful, you are looked  upon differently."  </P> <P> According to court records, Miller filed a slander suit against Price after  Price allegedly suggested in a 1981 meeting of Christmas tree growers that  Miller had bribed a district official in order to obtain a lease on some  government land in the Valley.  </P> <P> The suit claimed that Price had slandered him because he was "greatly angered  by the competition" and "harbored ill-will" toward Miller. The suit, which was  dismissed by a Van Nuys Superior Court judge in 1988, sought $750,000 in  damages.  </P> <P> Miller said he does not remember the suit.  </P> <P> "I have gotten this far by hard work. We were very small, too, once, and we  were subjected to the same bidding process," he said.  </P> <P> Miller's venture into the Christmas tree business began when he helped out a  few friends at their father's lot during the 1960 Christmas season. At the end  of the season, he received $400.  </P> <P> The next year he invested his $4,000 savings in his first lot at Devonshire  Street and Zelzah Avenue in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> Until 1980, Miller never operated more than five lots in a season, and the  company was just a "mom and pop operation that gave us extra money." He bought  his trees wholesale in downtown Los Angeles, and most of his income came from  his work as a carpenter and from his television rental business.  </P> <P> But, in the 1982 season, Miller opened his first three "volume lots" -- lots  with low prices that did not provide extensive customer services. It proved to  be a successful formula. This year the company expects to sell half a million  trees on 50 lots around the state.  </P> <P> Miller also owns nearly 3,000 acres of Oregon Christmas tree farmland. One day,  he said, he hopes to have 200 "Stu Miller Price-Is-Right" lots in California.  </P> <P> In addition to his tree lots, which he expects will move half a million trees  this season, Miller owns a development company, which is building seven luxury  houses in Malibu. He also started a production company and owns a chain of  television rental stores.  </P> <P> Miller admits that in the process of making his tree business thrive, he has  sometimes done things that others have not liked.  </P> <P> For example, last year, Miller and Sons employees stood near Joe Cicero's tree  stand at Pierce College and passed out flyers advertising their own lot across  the street. Miller said he felt that potential customers mistakenly thought  they were supporting the college by buying a tree there.  </P> <P> Residents who live next to Miller's lot at Parthenia Street and Balboa  Boulevard complain that employees work there flocking trees very late into the  night and in the wee hours of the morning. And traffic generated by the lot has  sometimes made it virtually impossible for them to reach their own houses, they  said.  </P> <P> When homeowners have tried to discuss the problems with Miller, however, he  brushed off their concerns, said one neighbor who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> Miller, however, said the homeowners were just unhappy because they oppose any  tree lot and the commotion it generates near their houses.  </P> <P> "There is an old saying in business: We don't know the total answer for  success, but we do know the answer for failure -- trying to please everyone,"  he said. "You can't please everyone."  </P></p>

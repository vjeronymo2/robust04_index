			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Sacrifice in the name of security: British business and unions are showing increasing willingness to forgo higher pay in order to retain their jobs The 20,000 employees of Sheffield City Council and the 750 staff of John Brown Engineers and Constructors in Portsmouth are exceptional groups of workers: both have accepted pay cuts for all to prevent job losses for some. British workers and employers, unlike their American or Japanese counterparts, have rarely been inclined to apply the trade-off between pay restraint and job security, either at national or plant level. But if the slight fall in February's unemployment, reported last month, proves an exception - as expected - interest in the link between jobs and pay is likely to increase. Both business and union leaders are breaking with tradition and, tentatively, putting the idea of trading higher pay for job security on the agenda. The Trades Union Congress has said that there is 'some scope' for the trade-off in the public sector. More specifically, Mr Howard Davies, the innovative new head of the Confederation of British Industry, said recently that the pain of recession had been borne very unevenly, warning that social stability in Britain could be threatened if pay increases take priority over jobs when recovery gets under way. At first sight it is curious that pay levels should be singled out for attention. Few people blame pay directly for the recession or believe it to be an obstacle to recovery. 'Pay is now a second order problem,' according to Dr Walter Eltis, economic adviser to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The figures appear to support this view: the absolute levels of settlements and earnings increases are now at the lowest level for decades, pay freezes are once again on the increase, and in January manufacturing unit labour costs (pay per unit of output) fell by 2.2 per cent compared with January 1992. But Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, an independent research body, says that such statistics disguise the anti-employment bias behind Britain's pay system, a bias which becomes especially marked in recession. 'To put it in a rather stylised way, there are companies where half the workers are losing their jobs and the other half are virtually doubling their pay. That is bad for employment and bad for the economy as a whole,' says Mr Trinder. The reality is not quite that bad, but it is true that real earnings growth for those in work has been greater in this recession than in the previous two, while the fall in employment has also been greater. Last year, average UK earnings grew at 6.1 per cent, almost double the inflation rate of 3.7 per cent. In 1981, in the middle of the last recession, average earnings of 12.9 per cent were only one percentage point above inflation of 11.9 per cent. Similarly, in the first two years of the current recession employment fell by more than 2m compared with 1.5m in the early 1980s. The increased earnings in this recession have often been the result of efficiency deals which helped manufacturing productivity to rise by a healthy 6.4 per cent in the quarter to the end of January. But, economists say, that usually means producing the same amount with fewer workers rather than producing more with the same number. The result is that unit labour costs are heading down but joblessness heading up. And while earnings for those in work rise, personal disposable income in the economy as a whole fell in the last quarter of 1992, thanks to the sharp fall in income experienced by the rising number of the unemployed. This undermines expansion. But from the viewpoint of individual companies the high pay/low employment trade-off makes sense. Indeed, in big companies, the system encourages it: shareholders like to be told that the corporate 'headcount' is falling and managers and unions have an interest in pleasing the workers who remain. ICI, for example, this year began paying 14.5 per cent productivity-linked pay rises to most of its 20,000 hourly-paid workers. It has also announced that more than 10,000 jobs will be cut in the UK over the next year. Mr David Thomas, of the ICI planning department, says that 95 per cent of the job losses have nothing to do with the pay increase, but he does concede that lower pay rises might have allowed the company to recruit more new workers. According to UBS, the stockbrokers, employment in the UK chemical industry between 1981 and 1992 fell by about 25 per cent, a much higher drop than in Germany, France, America and Japan, but wage costs rose by 160 per cent compared with about 60 per cent in the other countries. In other sectors privatisation has recently been exacerbating this trend. This is the first post-privatisation recession and the combination of government sell-offs and the efficiency drive in the public services has undermined the stabilising effect on employment formerly played by the public sector. BT is a good example. The telecommunications company employed 238,000 people before privatisation in 1984; the figure is now 165,000 and by 1997 it could be down to 100,000. Other privatised utilities have adopted similar policies, although none has gone as far as BT. British Gas employed 90,000 just before privatisation 1986 and is now down to about 79,000, while the electricity industry in England and Wales employed 131,398 before privatisation in 1990 and now employs about 115,000. Those who remain in the privatised companies are generally reaping substantial rewards for improved productivity. At National Grid, for example, which runs the electricity network in England and Wales, employment has fallen from 6,500 to 5,500 over the past two years and most workers this year will receive a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. A once-and-for-all shake-out of labour may be desireable, and unavoidable, in the privatised utilities, and few want to return to the inefficiency of the nationalised industries. But Mr Trinder argues that it is bad timing for the government to be seeking heavy job cuts in the public services when unemployment is rising. He argues that the cost in extra welfare benefits and the dent to consumer confidence outweigh the benefits of greater efficiency, which can still be achieved at a later date. Costs, he adds, can be held down by extending the current public sector pay limit for another year. But, he believes, such a limit should be linked to a guarantee of job security, thus making it more palatable and preserving hundreds of thousands of jobs. Increased staff productivity should still be encouraged but would be expressed in better services rather than fewer employees. Many commentators remain sceptical about establishing a new trade-off between pay and jobs, especially in the private sector. Mr Esmond Lindop, of pay analysts Incomes Data Services, says that the trade-off only works over short periods to cover emergencies. He also points out that short-time working, where companies cut the working week and pay-packets but keep the workforce together, has never been very popular even in tough times. Some economists such as Mr Kevin Gardiner, at S G Warburg, believe, more fundamentally, that employment is much less responsive to changes in wage levels than to consumer demand for particular products. Even some supporters of a more employment-friendly trade-off are pessimistic about how it can be made to work, especially in an upturn, without national level deals between unions and employers, something increasingly rare in British industrial relations. But there is no logical reason why the trade-off cannot be made at the level of the individual factory or office. Indeed some economists stress that the trade-off is easier to apply at that level, rather than sector or company-wide, because it is more tangible for the people involved and runs with the recent trend of decentralised pay bargaining. There is evidence that managers at local level are finally heeding the advice of Mr Davies of the CBI to push down harder on pay to preserve employment. Few of the current pay freezes are explicitly linked to job security, like that at Rolls Royce Aerospace last year. But Mr Tony de Launay, of the Engineering Employers Federation, reports that such freezes in the engineering sector often involve an informal trade-off with job security. Whether such deals will prosper in more buoyant times is more doubtful.</p>

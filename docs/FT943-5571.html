			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bidders line up for Canadian insurance unit Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Great-West Life are believed top contenders for Confederation Life's domestic group life and health business. The successful bidder was expected to be announced by Confederation's liquidator Peat Marwick Thorne. Confederation's domestic group business generated premium income of CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700) last year and could fetch up to CDollars 100m. Metropolitan Life was also a bidder, but industry sources said it was not likely to win. Great-West, controlled by Power Corp of Canada, bought Confederation's US group business just after Confederation was seized by federation regulators on August 11.</p>

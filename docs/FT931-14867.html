			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: FedEx ballot PILOTS at Memphis-based Federal Express, the US overnight package delivery group, have elected to become unionised, and to be represented by the Air Line Pilots' Association (ALPA), writes Nikki Tait. But within hours of the ballot results being announced, the company filed objections with the National Mediation Board, the federal agency which oversees labour disputes in the rail and air industries. It alleged the unions involved in the ballot had misrepresented certain issues and requested a re-run of the process.</p>

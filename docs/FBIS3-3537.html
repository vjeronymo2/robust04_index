The other track will be restored early tomorrow morning,  railway officials said.    The line was blocked by a huge pile of earth, whose movement  was caused by heavy rain.    Sources said that by 21:00 hours (Beijing time) today  traffic  had resumed on the Shenzhen-Guangzhou track. The  Guangzhou-Shenzhen track is expected to be back in operation  tomorrow morning at 6:00.    The slide happened at 22:54 hours on Monday [14 March], when  the driver of a goods train, going at 45 km per hour, spotted a  moving fog-like object. He made an emergency stop and found a  10- meter-high mass of earth was rolling down, covering the  whole locomotive. The driver crawled out and found an even  bigger pile of mud in front of the train. No-one was hurt.    More than 1,000 people equipped with earth-moving machinery  were immediately dispatched to the site to remove the blockage,  according to the sources.    Officials said that at least 30 passenger trains and 26  goods  trains in each direction were canceled.</p>

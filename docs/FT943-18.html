			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies (55): Deficit overshadows prospects - Canada / Bernard Simon finds the outlook disturbing Canada's economic prospects look good, bad or middling, depending from which angle one chooses to view them. The news could hardly be better on the inflation front. The consumer price index has settled on a plateau, and is expected to rise by no more than 2-3 per cent in 1995. Much of the credit goes to tight monetary policies pursued by the Bank of Canada between 1988 and 1991, which took the wind out of domestic demand. The latest brake on prices is a steep fall in tobacco taxes, designed to stamp out cigarette smuggling across the US-Canada border. Wage settlements are at their lowest level in decades. Workers have considered themselves lucky these days to get any wage increase at all, although there are signs that a strengthening economy is starting to loosen employers' purse-strings. Meanwhile, double-digit unemployment has helped many companies introduce more flexible work practices. Productivity has soared. A weakening currency has further reinforced Canadian companies' competitiveness. With the help of stronger metal and forest-products prices, exports rose to a record CDollars 18.2bn in June 1994. Bank of Nova Scotia forecasts that the trade surplus will climb from CDollars 9.5bn in 1993 to CDollars 14bn this year and CDollars 17.5bn in 1995. But seen from another angle, Canada's economic outlook is disturbing. The federal government has failed over the past decade to meet its budget deficit targets. The shortfall for the year to March 31, 1994 was a record CDollars 45.7bn, or 6.4 per cent of gross domestic product. The 10 provinces, which piled up a combined debt of about CDollars 230bn, are also battling to rein in their spending. Of the 10, Alberta has made the most progress, confidently forecasting a balanced budget by 1997. Its reward has been a credit rating matched only by fast-growing British Columbia. Finance minister Paul Martin pledged last February to trim the federal deficit to CDollars 39.7bn in the current fiscal year, and to 3 per cent of GDP by 1997-98. But he faces an uphill struggle. Interest rates, and thus debt-service charges, have been higher than forecast this year. Ottawa is also moving more slowly than expected on social-security reforms, which are essential for any meaningful, long-term dent in government outlays. The heavy debt burden casts a long shadow over Canada's prospects. Bank of Nova Scotia warned in late August that 'nothing short of a tripling in the merchandise trade surplus would stem the erosion in Canada's external balance sheet, let alone begin to play down record foreign obligations.' Nervousness about the future of Quebec is the other cloud over the economy. Although the victory of the separatist Parti Quebecois in the francophone province's election will not necessarily lead to independence, the run-up to a referendum which the PQ has promised to hold in 1995 could unsettle many domestic and foreign investors. The PQ has threatened not to co-operate with the federal government's drive to overhaul the unemployment insurance and welfare systems. Within Quebec, it generally favours more government involvement in the economy, including higher taxes. 'If there was no political uncertainty, our forecast of growth would be higher, and our interest rates would be lower,' says John McCallum, Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist. On balance, however, Mr McCallum and most other economists predict that positive forces will outweigh negative ones over the next few years. The Conference Board of Canada forecasts that real GDP growth will accelerate moderately from 2.7 per cent in 1993 to 3.3 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in 1995. There could be sharp regional variations within these national averages. Royal Bank expects that British Columbia will enjoy a growth rate of more than 4 per cent next year, thanks to a continuing influx of migrants and strong pulp and paper prices. At the other end of the country, the collapse of the Atlantic fishery will hold Newfoundland's growth to less than 2 per cent, with one out of five people remaining out of work. The growth numbers could hinge heavily on whether markets are more impressed by Canada's improved inflation and productivity performance, or by political upheavals. Early this year, the gap between US and Canadian interest rates narrowed to its smallest in almost two decades. Canadian banks' prime lending rates were down to 5.5 per cent from a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990. But as Quebec election jitters grew, the spread once again widened. By late June, Canadian banks had raised their prime rate to 8 per cent and economists had begun to lower their 1994 and 1995 growth forecasts. Interest rates have subsequently moved lower again, but some strong and unpredictable gyrations could lie ahead.</p>

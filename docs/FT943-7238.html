			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Unidanmark tumbles to DKr207m Unidanmark Group, Denmark's second biggest bank, yesterday reported a fall in interim net profits to DKr207m (Dollars 34m) from DKr483m as the value of its securities portfolio slid. The value of securities holdings fell by DKr252m during the first half of the year. Last year in the same period the comparable figure rose by DKr533m. Under Danish banking law the difference in the value of the securities portfolio during the accounting period is entered directly into the profit and loss account. Reflecting improved economic conditions, the group said that its bad loss provisions fell to DKr950m in the first half compared with DKr2.34bn in the same period last year. The bank reported a 10.7 per cent growth in net interest and fee income to DKr4.8bn from DKr4.3bn, while expenses were reduced by DKr68m to DKr2.97bn. The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the second half was 13.4 per cent compared with 11.8 per cent at the end of last year.</p>

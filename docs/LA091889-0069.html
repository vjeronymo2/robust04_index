			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORM, YES, BUT CAN HE DO MIRACLES?  </P> <P> The debate about Mikhail Gorbachev's motives and intentions has been narrowed  by the changes that have already occurred this year in the Soviet Union, Poland  and Hungary. So far the changes are in policy rather than in personnel.  </P> <P> The pace and scope of change have surprised almost everyone. No one expected  that contested elections would be held in which Communist candidates would be  overwhelmingly defeated. But it happened. No one expected that the Soviet  government would acknowledge the Secret Protocol of the Nazi-Soviet pact, which  now delegitimizes the Soviet incorporation of the Baltic states. No one  expected that the Soviet government would acknowledge the Soviet role in the  massacre of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. No one believed that strikes  in a basic industry would be tolerated or permitted to spread. But it all  happened.  </P> <P> And it is now obvious that Mikhail S. Gorbachev not only wants to rule the  Soviet Union and to enhance its international power -- but also he seriously  seeks broad reform of his own society.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is, manifestly, a man with a vision of a different kind of socialism  -- more successful, less coercive, more participatory. He calls it "Socialist  pluralism." If he succeeds, we will speak henceforth of  Marxism-Leninism-Gorbachevism. What his success or failure will mean to the  United States and the rest of the West is still an open question.  </P> <P> Success, of course, is not assured. The experience of the past year has  illustrated how difficult it is to change a great bureaucratic society in which  everyone works for the government. Each aspect of the system reinforces the  rest. Centralized political power reinforces the centralization of economic  power and vice versa.  </P> <P> So entrenched is state ownership that it is extremely complicated to privatize  anything. The stagnation of the economy prevents the production of goods that  could serve as an incentive to increased production. For 70 years, private  initiative and private enterprise have been discouraged at best or punished  severely.  </P> <P> Le Monde correspondent Bernard Guetta has said the prerequisite for progress in  the Soviet Union is for its citizens to believe in the possibility and  durability of change.  </P> <P> Perhaps they are beginning to. The Soviet people have been quick to seize the  opportunities for greater expression offered them in the past two years.  Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians did not hesitate to vote for Baltic  nationalists in local elections. They have not hesitated to oppose government  policies and advocate independence. Elsewhere, Soviet citizens have voted  overwhelmingly against Communist Party leaders and officeholders -- showing  little reticence about their opposition.  </P> <P> Indeed the Baltic independence movement and the unpopularity of Communist Party  candidates have become major problems for Gorbachev. So strong are both that in  dealing with domestic affairs, Gorbachev is caught in a double bind: He  believes more freedom is necessary for a more successful communist society --  but when he grants more freedom, the people reject communism and Soviet rule  entirely.  </P> <P> How can socialism be reformed, yet remain Socialist? How can Gorbachev limit  the Communist Party's monopoly of power, yet maintain it in power? How can he  weaken the party, yet consolidate his own power? How can he grant free speech  and prevent the conquered peoples of the Soviet Union from demanding  independence?  </P> <P> As if that were not bad enough, Gorbachev confronts a similar double bind in  foreign affairs.  </P> <P> His success is in large measure a consequence of persuading Europeans, Chinese,  Americans and assorted others that "there is no Soviet threat."  </P> <P> He has sworn that the use of force by the Soviet Union against a fellow  socialist state, or by any European state against another, is "unthinkable." He  has strongly implied that every Warsaw Pact country is free to choose its own  allies and map its own future. Already the people of Hungary, Poland and East  Germany have made clear that given a choice they prefer a non-communist future.  </P> <P> If Gorbachev accepts the progressive independence they seek, the Warsaw Pact  dissolves. If he holds them by force, he revives the Soviet threat -- in  technicolor.  </P> <P> His situation is extremely difficult. His problems are probably insoluble.  Socialism is not a successful economic system, anywhere.  </P> <P> And it is probably impossible today to hold on to an empire except by force.  </P> <P> Will Mikhail Gorbachev be in power a year from now? Personally, I hope so. But  don't bet on it.  </P></p>

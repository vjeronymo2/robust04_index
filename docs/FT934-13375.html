			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Nato set to expand, Aspin believes NATO recognises that it is on the way towards enlargement to include former members of the Warsaw Pact, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said yesterday. 'We know that there's going to be an expanding membership,' he said. He went further in his prediction than did Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, who earlier described enlargement as an 'option'. Mr Aspin was speaking after presenting proposals at the Nato defence ministers' meeting in Travemunde for a series of limited defence agreements between Nato and individual eastern European countries. This 'partnership for peace' proposal, which received unanimous support at the meeting, is open to all former Warsaw Pact countries as well as neutral European states. Mr Aspin would not say how many of these countries could be accommodated later as members, or when they might join. But most Nato ministers at the meeting thought enlargement would come 'sooner rather than later', he said. The proposed agreements would enable Nato to call on additional military resources for operations such as peacekeeping, Mr Aspin said. They would also provide 'military groundwork' that would be valuable when those countries joined the alliance. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the proposed agreements could be seen as advancing countries 'on the way towards membership'. But admission would not be automatic.</p>

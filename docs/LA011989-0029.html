			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: LESS IS MORE FOR TASTIER TREATS  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Please determine whether this recipe can be adjusted to lower the  fat and cholesterol levels. It's delicious but dangerous.  </P> <P>  -- VIRGINIA, Kenmore, N.Y.  </P> <P> SPINACH SQUARES  </P> <P> 1 cup flour  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup milk  </P> <P> 1/2 cup margarine, melted  </P> <P> 2 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> 1 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 10 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded  </P> <P> 10 ounces cooked spinach, drained thoroughly  </P> <P> Combine flour, salt, baking powder, milk, margarine, eggs, onion, Cheddar  cheese and spinach. Place in greased 9-inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees 30  minutes. Cut into squares. Makes 8 servings.  </P> <P> Note: May be baked 1 day ahead and reheated.  </P> <P> DEAR VIRGINIA: This is a perfect example of when less is more. By simply  reducing the problem ingredients in the recipe, you end up with a finished  product that is more enjoyable from both a health and taste standpoint.  </P> <P> The margarine was easily reduced by half and egg substitute worked beautifully  in place of the eggs, so the fat and cholesterol are greatly reduced. I have  found that low-fat Cheddar cheese is always appropriate as a substitute for the  traditional high-fat variety, and I was able to reduce the amount of cheese  called for without missing it.  </P> <P> I think you will agree that this recipe gives more of everything you want from  food by using less of the things you don't really need.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> REVISED SPINACH SQUARES  </P> <P> 1 cup unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup nonfat milk  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine, melted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup liquid egg substitute  </P> <P> 1 cup minced onion  </P> <P> 6 ounces 20 % fat-reduced Cheddar cheese, shredded  </P> <P> 1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, cooked and well drained or 3/4 pound fresh  spinach, chopped, steamed 2 minutes and well drained  </P> <P> Combine flour, salt, baking powder, milk, margarine, egg substitute, onion,  Cheddar cheese and spinach.

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: DG Bank to restructure overseas operations DEUTSCHE Genossen-schaftsbank, the central bank for Germany's co-operative banks, is restructuring its overseas operations. After rationalising its domestic activities, the financially-stretched bank has decided to close DG Finance in Paris, DG Investment Bank in London and New York, and a securities interest in Singapore. Buyers will be sought for two other operations, one in London and another in Amsterdam. In future, securities business will be managed from the bank's Frankfurt headquarters. Together with other rationalisation in commercial banking, these closures are likely to lead to the loss of around 180 jobs out of the 780 currently filled in 14 overseas centres. This will contribute to the total 800 job cuts the bank wants to make within the next five years. To build up its commercial banking operations overseas, the bank intends to open representative offices in Madrid, Milan and Paris. It also plans to intensify its business in eastern Europe and Turkey with its existing joint venture partners in the region; representative offices are likely to be opened in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest. The person behind moves to tighten the overseas network is Mr Bernd Thiemann, chief executive since early 1991, who outlined his plans in October. Under his predecessor, the bank became involved in a complicated dispute over bond and sale agreements with French banks, leading to heavy write-downs. In October DG Bank announced a DM1.4bn cash injection.</p>

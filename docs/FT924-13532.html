			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Output fall disappoints Treasury BRITISH industrial production continued to 'bump along the bottom' in August as short-time working in the car industry caused manufacturing output to fall by 0.2 per cent compared with July. According to seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office (CSO), output of the production industries, which include energy as well as manufacturing, fell by 0.3 per cent in the month and was barely changed from the level in August last year. The Treasury said August's fall in overall industrial production was 'obviously disappointing' but followed a sharp rise of 1 per cent in the output of the production industries in July. The August fall in manufacturing production was 'more than accounted for by a very sharp drop in car production', it said. Figures for both the manufacturing and production industries showed a rise in output of only 0.1 per cent in the three months to the end of August compared with the March-to-May period. The latest three months' figures showed a 0.8 per cent drop in manufacturing production and a 1.4 per cent fall in output of the production industries, compared with the three months to the end of August last year. UK manufacturing output has moved in a narrow range over the past six months, prompting the CSO to estimate that its present annual 'trend' rate of growth is 0.5 per cent. Some city analysts expect overall industrial production to fall over the rest of the year, as a result of cuts in output, lack of confidence and the large-scale cuts in the coal industry announced this week. Although the August figures matched City expectations they did nothing to lighten the gloom caused by the recent wave of redundancies and the planned pit closures. The figures put the drop in car output at nearly 10 per cent in August, reflecting short-time working at some of Ford's UK plants. The statistics also showed a fall in coal and coke production of 5.2 per cent in the three months to August compared with the three months to the end of May, and a drop of 9.3 per cent compared with the June-to-August period last year. Output of the metals and chemicals industries also fell in the three months to August. Among the strongest performers were the brewing and soft-drink industries, reflecting a hot spell in June, and the paper, printing and publishing industries.</p>

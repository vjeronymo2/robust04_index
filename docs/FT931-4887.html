			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Additional Pounds 1bn of government services face market tests A FURTHER Pounds 1bn of government work could be opened up to competition from the private sector, under an initiative from Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister. Sir Peter Levene, head of the prime minister's efficiency unit, has begun talks with officials over the new tranche of market-testing which is set to affect public bodies in addition to Whitehall departments. The new round will include quangos - public bodies which are separate from Whitehall. 'This goes right the way through government,' one official said yesterday. Executive agencies, which operate at arm's length from departments, and the departments themselves, are already subject to market-testing. Officials will discuss whether areas such as legal or accounting services currently carried out by their own departments or by their departments' quangos could be done better or more cheaply by the private sector. Mr Waldegrave hopes to make an announcement in the autumn. Last October, Mr Waldegrave announced that about Pounds 1.5bn of services would be tested against the private sector this year, and his department is aiming for Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn worth to be tested next year. Despite complications that have arisen in some areas of contracted out services, because of EC legislation designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and mergers, ministers are determined to press ahead with the programme. While Mr Waldegrave is heading the initiative, the Treasury is also involved, seeing it as a way of improving value for money, and thus part of the fundamental review of public spending announced last month. In particular, the Treasury will press for testing to be extended in areas where the private sector can definitely compete, rather than areas where there is no real market or expertise outside government. Among the quangos already moving down this route is the Housing Corporation, which administers government funds for housing associations. Jail tender delay, Page 6</p>

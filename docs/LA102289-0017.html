			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LEGENDS, LIES &amp; CHERISHED MYTHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY BY  RICHARD SHENKMAN (HARPER &amp; ROW: $7.95)  </P> <P> Richard Shenkman is so eager to debunk popular beliefs, he wastes a great deal  of effort setting up straw men, just so he can knock them down. His research is  derived entirely from secondary sources, and his "revelations" often amount to  restatements of the obvious, e.g., machines credited to single inventors are  actually refined versions of earlier prototypes. He also fails to consider the  significance of the myths he discredits. Andrew Johnson may have been the only  President born into poverty (a term Shenkman fails to define adequately), but  why do Americans like to think of their leaders as men who rose from rags to  riches? The chapter deriding popular nostalgia for the pre-World War I era  contains outrageous, unsupported pronouncements about pollution and poverty.  Shenkman's assertion, "Nothing we have today compares with the horrible  conditions of tenement life in the Gilded Age," might come as a revelation to  thousands of families living in slums, cars and cardboard boxes.  </P></p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Portillo moves to calm Tory fears on looming defence cuts Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday sought to defuse a row over defence cuts by insisting that Conservative backbench fears about the effectiveness of the armed forces were misplaced. Amid concern that the issue could develop into another political embarrassment for the government, senior ministers said reports that substantial savings have been identified by 33 defence ministry working groups were 'broadly correct'. Decisions on which proposed cuts will be implemented are unlikely to be taken until shortly before the annual defence white paper in July, after the local elections on May 5 and the European poll on June 9. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is likely to face awkward questions in the Commons today after the expected release of the defence estimates, although details of the proposed cuts are likely to be excluded. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the government had 'not the slightest intention of sanctioning any proposal that would reduce the fighting capability' of the forces. 'What I am anxious to do is find sufficient savings where defence expenditure can be switched from support to the front line to actually enhance the capability of our fighting forces,' he said. But the most significant intervention came from Mr Portillo, who let it be known that he was seeking improved efficiency rather than across-the-board cuts. His aides said Mr Rifkind would be allowed to plough back into the front-line forces any savings achieved by the rationalisation programme. In the past the Treasury has sought to claw back savings made from defence cuts, but the aides pointed to a key passage in a speech by Mr Portillo last week in which he stressed the increasing demands on the military. 'To respond to this new world, our forces need to be flexible and battle-ready. They must not be hampered by bureaucracy, their budgets must be spent efficiently and intelligently. Every effort must be focused on the front line,' Mr Portillo said. The cuts identified by the working parties are understood to include up to 20,000 jobs, mergers of headquarters organisations, property sales and vehicle leasing. The naval base at Rosyth, Fife, may also be closed. Election reports, Page 9</p>

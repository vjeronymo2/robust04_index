			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed J-LO: "CSV To Hold Coalition Negotiations </F> With the LSAP Following the Parliamentary Elections on 12 June  -- Party Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker Heads the CSV's  Eight-Strong Coalition Delegation"]    [Excerpts] After nearly three hours of consultations at an  extraordinary meeting in the metropolitan "Carrefour" [episcopal  conference center], the national council of the Christian Social  People's Party (CSV) resolved yesterday evening, with an  overwhelming majority (there were only two abstentions, made for  constitutional and tactical reasons), to enter into coalition  negotiations with the Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg  (LSAP) with a view to forming the next government. [passage  omitted]    Tomorrow, Friday [17 June], Prime Minister Jacques Santer,  in  his capacity as the person responsible for forming the  government, will submit an interim report to the grand duke on  the political development following the elections on 12 June,  after which the first coalition negotiations are likely to take  place as early as Saturday morning, the day after tomorrow.  They will be conducted swiftly and completed toward the middle  of July. To this end, and in order to prevent any delays,  working groups are to be used to deal with various matters if no  ordinary meetings can take place next week because of the  national holiday in Luxembourg and the European summit meeting  on 24 and 25 June on the island of Corfu in which both Prime  Minister Jacques Santer and Foreign Minister Jacques Poos will  take part.

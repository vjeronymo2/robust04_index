			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Letter: Banking - selective advertising and setting traps (1) Sir, The animal-based emotive advertisements used by the Co-operative Bank ('Profits and the white-collar conscience', March 25) show it to be a highly selective institution. For instance, the term 'blood sports' has a clear meaning to most people (vide OED) but it is not that of the Co-op. For the Co-op fox hunting is bad, but shooting for 'sport' is not; its response to my enquiry was: 'We do not have a definitive policy on shooting'. But if you only read its literature you would not know this. After all if those advertisements showed a jolly hunter with gun, dead deer and pheasant with the text saying 'I did it all with my Co-op Bank loan', it would not attract the depositors in the same way. But it would be just as true a portrayal of its ethical stance based on its moral judgments. What can be seen as particularly hypocritical is that CWS Agriculture (part of the bank's parent) not only runs pheasant shoots with gun dogs on its own land, but actually rears the pheasants for the annual sporting kill] It is difficult not to be cynical when one also finds out that the ethical stance was created from 'the views of our own customers'. It is good that people want to know the value-added contribution to society that a company makes. Is the Co-op Bank really trying to do that, or is it just trying to generate deposits?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today joined the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in calling for  an immediate cease-fire in Yemen and adherence to all provisions  of U.N. Security Council Resolution 924.    The GCC issued a statement on June 4, expressing its support  for the Resolution 924, which seeks an end to the crisis in  Yemen.    The United States welcomed the statement and agreed with the  GCC that Yemen's problem cannot be solved through military  means, State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told  reporters at a regular news briefing.    "The United States looks to the GCC to continue its positive  role in the Yemen crisis," shelly said.    "The U.S. strongly believes that all parties in Yemen must  begin to work together to achieve reconciliation, without which  peace and stability in Yemen are not possible," she said.    "We continue to call on both parties to halt the fighting  immediately and to agree to resume their political dialogue,  representing all Yemenis, which we believe can begin the process  of reconciliation," she added.    The United States also urged both sides in Yemen to  facilitate the efforts of the U.N. secretary general's  fact-finding mission to Yemen.</p>

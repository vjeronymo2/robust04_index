			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 23 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Some 3,000  Guatemalan Government employees have blocked access to the  National Palace, where they gathered today to demand that  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio agree to personally negotiate a  40 percent salary increase.    About 30 labor leaders have entered the Presidential Palace  in hope of seeing De Leon, whom they have asked to meet with  them to discuss the two-week-old conflict involving some 200,000  government employees. Meanwhile, another group of workers has  peacefully occupied the building that houses the Central  American Parliament to request that organization's mediation in  seeking a resolution to the labor conflict that has entered its  third week.    Armando Sanchez, secretary of the National Federation of  State Workers Unions (Fenasteg) who is inside the palace, told  the press he will not leave until he receives an answer from the  president. The police have not intervened, but several units  have been deployed to control the demonstrators who marched  earlier through several streets in Guatemala City.    Government employees have partially paralyzed several state  services, including health services, by staging intermittent  work stoppages since the beginning of the month to demand a 40  percent pay raise and to demand the abolition of plans to  privatize certain state-owned companies and services.    Labor leaders headed by Armando Sanchez have detained  several  government employees, among them National Police Director Mario  Cifuentes. The labor leaders are not allowing anyone, including  reporters, to enter or leave the palace, and dozens of reporters  have surrounded the building.    Cifuentes told the press that the removal of the labor  leaders is being considered, but he is awaiting orders from  ranking government authorities. Meanwhile, Sanchez warned, "We  will not leave until we receive a positive answer to our just  demands or until the president promises to hold a direct  dialogue."    Hector Luna, secretary general of the Presidency, met with a  commission of union workers to hear to their opinions, and he  told them that De Leon is not in Guatemala City.    According to Sanchez, the measures are intended to press for  a 40 percent salary increase and to reject a government-offered  bonus of 360 quetzales a year (approximately $62) -- a bonus  Sanchez calls an "affront" to the workers.    Nery Barrios, one of the top leaders of Labor and Popular  Action Union (UASP), told ACAN-EFE that the organization decided  to take to the streets and occupy these offices to support the  demands of the government workers in light of the government's  "hardening" position. According to Barrios, UASP, which belongs  to Fenasteg, and the Union of State Workers support the  government workers and remain committed to the call for a  nationwide strike.    During the demonstration, the workers accused President de  Leon Carpio of being "subservient and taking up arms," as well  as having "betrayed" the trust given to him when he took office  in June 1993.    "As long as there is social injustice, the people will be in  the streets. Ramiro de Leon, you will be leading the people to  their graves," shouted workers in front of the palace where they  are demanding the president's resignation.    Barrios explained that in addition to a 40 percent salary  increase, the forceful measures are intended to oppose  government-announced sales of state-owned assets. The strike  has paralyzed 95 percent of the public administration, according  to the leader of UASP, an organization that claims 1 million  members.    "We will not end the strike as long as our demands are not  met, because the people are starving to death," Barrios insisted.    Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ana de Molina reiterated today  that the government is willing to hold talks, but she clarified  that the government does not have funds to meet the demands for  salary hikes.</p>

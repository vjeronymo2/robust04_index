			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Derwent Valley rises to Pounds 3.8m An exceptional profit of Pounds 1.58m from associates enabled Derwent Valley Holdings, the property group, to hoist pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 3.77m in the first half of 1994. Net rental income, benefiting from recent acquisitions, grew 45 per cent to Pounds 4.65m (Pounds 3.22m). The exceptional credit arose from settlement of the residual liability in Dorrington Derwent Investments, following the disposal of that company's investment properties in 1993. Adjusted earnings per share were 6.46p (4.78p). The interim dividend is 1.58p (adjusted 1.525p) on increased capital.</p>

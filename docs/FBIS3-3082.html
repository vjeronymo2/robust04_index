"To reach this goal, Taiwan should allow mainland Chinese to  receive professional training here," said CEPD Vice Chairman  Hsueh Chi.    Hsueh quoted a survey by the Japanese branch of the US-based  consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. as finding that many foreign  companies have faced language barriers and other cultural  problems while developing mainland markets.    As Taiwan and Mainland China share a similar cultural  background and use same language, hsueh said foreign companies  can use Taiwan as bridgehead for mainland investment.    "Foreign enterprises can employ Taiwan market research  experts and managers to help collect business information and  handle investment affairs on the mainland," Hsueh noted. They  can also send their mainland employees to their Taiwan  headquarters for professional training, he added.    Mainland residents are still not allowed to receive training  in Taiwan. Hsueh said the government should consider lifting  the ban as soon as possible in order to improve Taiwan's  prospects of becoming an Asia-Pacific regional operations center.    "Continued growth in economic exchanges across the Taiwan  Strait is important to our bid to lure more foreign enterprises  to set up regional operation bases on the island," he stressed.</p>

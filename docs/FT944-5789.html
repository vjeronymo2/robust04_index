			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (11): Speed is essential - Ease of use for small businesses / Claire Gooding finds that moving rapidly from pub to pub poses accounting problems for Adams Inns A small family business run from home, Adams Inns specialises in being a 'locum' for the pub trade. The quick turnover of pubs brings some specific accounting problems. Adams specialises in running pubs, most of them from the Tetley Brewery, taking over the administration between long-term tenants. One of its tasks as a 'locum' is often to build up the trade of a pub that has become run down or neglected, although it also runs two long-term leases at present. Its tally of pubs fluctuates - it currently has six - and for every pub it takes on, it has to set up accounting details and administration, providing full accounts when it hands it back to the brewery or on to new tenants. In a constant state of data take-on, there are few software products that would not present headaches. 'We have to be able to set up very rapidly. We looked at Pegasus Opera, and found it very powerful, but a lot of these packages need a PhD to run them,' says Ian Napier, development manager of Adams Inns. 'We found it was taking two days to set up the nominals for each individual cost centre.' A chance encounter with the managing director of a software house led to led to a free trial of a package called WinAccs. Mr Napier had previously used the WinBuild property development accounting package from the same stable, FCG, and was delighted to find the same ease of use in its general-purpose offshoot, WinAccs, using Windows. 'With WinAccs it takes 15 seconds to set up the nominals. We didn't need training because of the incredibly friendly front end. We bought the package and had the entire lot loaded in two days,' Mr Napier explains. Once the coding structure was set up using an external consultant, Adams had a 'skeleton' that could be applied to every pub. The reporting structures were also tailored to provide the required management information. With WinAccs Mr Napier found an easy solution to the problem of folio numbers for tracking invoices, (which would have needed a costly Pounds 2,500 conversion on the previous package), and also found a speedy response from FCG when he had a printer problem - the kind that dogs all SoHo (small office home office) sites. 'It took two calls, one to report it, one to fix it. 'One of the best things about FCG is its fantastic support. You can talk straight to the developers if you need to, but we've had no reliability problems. Upgrades arrive like clockwork, and they are easy to install. 'If there are any disadvantages, it is that because it is so invitingly easy to use, we made some mistakes in the initial analysis of the sub-schedules. We should have had a professional accountant in earlier, to help us set up some of the postings and allocations.' Adams is now an enthusiastic user of the FCG integrated modules for payroll and job costing, all run on one Fujistu 486 PC (with optical drive), which also supports another home-based business. The total cost of all the software modules was Pounds 700, a special trade-in price for Pegasus Opera, plus a year's maintenance.

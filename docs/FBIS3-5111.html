Following is the full text of the statement:    As already made public, four immediate steps of simultaneous  action for a package solution of the nuclear issue were agreed  upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York on February 25.    These steps cover the questions of discontinuing "Team  Spirit  94" joint military exercises, resuming inter-Korean  working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys and  starting inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency  for the continuity of safeguards, and the question of holding  the third round of DPRK-USA talks in Geneva from March 21.    Most of the agreed steps have already entered into a stage  of  practical implementation.    Thus, new prospects have opened for bringing the process of  a  peaceful solution of the nuclear issue which had been derailed  temporarily back to its original track.    It is lucky, indeed, that although it seems belatedly, both  sides in the agreement confirmed again their stand to seek a  negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the principles of  the DPRK-USA joint statement and decided upon concrete steps and  timetable of action.    The agreement on the steps of simultaneous action, however,  has not been reached through a smooth process.    In the past, we have advanced reasonable proposals for a  solution of the nuclear problem and made all sincere efforts to  carry them into effect and shown a flexibility.    Since the second round of DPRK-USA talks we have fulfilled  the obligations we assumed voluntarily, as far as we could, in  the matter of negotiation with the IAEA and in the matter of  North-South dialogue. It is well worth noting that, with a view  to removing obstacles in the way of the talks, we put forth a  new proposal that the nuclear issue be solved completely in a  package deal based on the principle of simultaneous action by  both sides.    If a solution of the nuclear issue had been promoted as  proposed by us from the very outset, it would not have undergone  such serious twists and turns in its course, and it would not  have taken such a long time to reach a basic agreement on the  steps of simultaneous action.    In fact, when we take into consideration the fact that half  a  century long history of confrontation and distrust has lasted  between the DPRK and the United States, it is self-evident that  either of them is not in a position to urge the other to show  confidence first.    That is why we have held that if the sides wanted to find a  reasonable solution to the problem on an equal and fair basis,  they should not urge the other to move first but act  simultaneously, and so, have repeatedly urged the U.S. side to  respond to simultaneous action in this direction.    In the past, however, the U.S. side, far from sincerely  accepting our just demand, raised unreasonable preconditions and  resorted to delaying tactics, trying to force us to accept its  unilateral demand and constantly seeking insidious political  aims.    As is known, since it accepted our proposal regarding the  steps of simultaneously action at the 18th DPRK-USA contact at  the end of December last year and arrived at an agreement in  principle, the United States openly came out in defence of the  IAEA Secretariat which demanded we accept inspection equivalent  to routine and ad hoc inspections pursuant to the safeguards  agreement. Only recently, it tried to solve the problem by  pressure after setting a deadline identical with the February  meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors.    Such arbitrary and faithless stance of the other side toward  the dialogue whipped all our people into fury, and we could not  but make a legitimate self-defensive decision.    We expressed our firm will to take the road of our own  choice, not bound to the promise with the United States, if it  persisted in its policy aimed at stifling our Republic,  reversing the spirit of agreement with us.    The United States requested resuming the New York contact  before we carried this will into action. This was a good thing  not only for a solution of the nuclear issue but for peace and  security in the region around the Korean peninsula, we may say.    But the United States created new difficulties in the  working  out of the agreement, making it conditional on the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South of Korea, an  internal affair of our nation, even after the scope of  inspection for the continuity of safeguards was agreed upon  between the DPRK and the IAEA.    We have rejected such persevering argument of our dialogue  partner and warned them not to miss the opportunity of saving  the dialogue from a crisis. When they withdrew the precondition  and said yes to the text of agreement, we appreciated it  deservedly.    The agreed conclusions on the steps of simultaneous action  between the DPRK and the United States this time has created a  favorable condition for the third round of talks and a package  solution of the nuclear issue.    The DPRK and the United States, according to the formula of  package deal agreed upon between them, must now take steps for a  fundamental solution to the nuclear issue such as the  termination of the U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy  against the DPRK, the introduction of light water reactors, the  improvement of bilateral relations, the resumption of the IAEA's  routine and ad hoc inspections of the DPRK's nuclear facilities,  and put them into effect.    The package deal based on simultaneous action is the only  practical and reasonable way for both sides to resolve the  nuclear issue through dialogue on a completely equal footing,  not through confrontation.    This has been clearly proved by the whole course of the  DPRK-U.S. talks, especially by the latest contact in which the  sides agreed on simultaneous action.    If the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is resolved in  a  package deal, it would be decisively conducive to ensuring peace  and security in the whole of the Asia-pacific region.    We will honestly implement the steps for simultaneous action  agreed on recently and make every possible effort to solve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a package deal.    The solution of the issue now depends on how sincerely the  United States, a dialogue partner, works to fulfil its promise.    It is only too clear that, no matter what reasonable  solution  may be adopted, if a party obliged to implement it has no  willingness to solve the issue, it is impossible to expect any  substantial results.    Though just a few days have passed since the publication of  the conclusions on simultaneous action reached between the DPRK  and the United States in New York, ill-boding moves have been  reported one after another, giving rise to doubt about the  willingness of the United States to implement the conclusions.    The U.S. side made an official announcement that the  exchange of special envoys between the North and the South and  the IAEA's inspection are preconditions for the suspension of  the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and the opening of  the third-stage talks between the DPRK and the United States    On March 3, it expressed full support for the decision of  the  South Korean authorities not to stage the "Team Spirit 94"  conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the two  halves of Korea.    All these are dangerous acts to endanger the implementation  of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, which can never be justified.    As everyone knows, the DPRK and the United States set no  precondition in agreeing on the steps for simultaneous action.    The conclusions reached at the New York contact only  mentioned the resumption of the working contact for the exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South as a step for  simultaneous action. But it did not touch on the fulfilment of  the exchange.    As for the exchange of special envoys, the DPRK was the  first  to propose it, motivated by a noble intention to put an end to  the tragedy of national division and realise the fellow  countrymen's desire for reunification. To make it a success is  our consistent position.    The exchange of special envoys has not been carried out,  however, because the South Korean authorities have distorted the  significance of the exchange by contending that it is aimed only  at the solution of the nuclear issue, and tried to balk at the  DPRK-U.S. talks through it and exacerbate the North-South  confrontation blaring that they "will not rule out even a  military action."    Only when the South Korean authorities stop such  unreasonable  acts as impudently poking their nose into the discussion of the  nuclear issue without their own political view or authority to  discuss the matter and make a clear turnabout towards seeking  national reunification, the exchange of special envoys between  the North and the South will be realised.    We are also willing to sincerely implement the agreement on  the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards.    A group of inspectors of the IAEA began its activities on  March 1 and the competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a  proper cooperation in its activities.    At a time when the agreement has entered the stage of  implementation, however, the U.S. side has brought forward again  the unreasonable preconditions which it had failed to include in  the conclusions, while fully supporting the conditions raised by  the South Korean authorities. All this cannot be construed  otherwise than factors which may lead to collapse the full  implementation of the conclusions.    We take a serious view of the fact that the United States  has  set inter-Korean exchange of special envoys and the inspection  by IAEA as preconditions for the renunciation of the "Team  Spirit 94" and the opening of the third round of talks, because  it will obviously result in reversing again the agreed  conclusions on steps for simultaneous action.    Worse still, if those preconditions are accepted, it will  cause the grave consequence that the right of decision at the  DPRK-U.S. talks would pass to some seditious forces which hate  it.    As prescribed in the agreed conclusions, unless all the  steps  of simultaneous action are implemented fully, all the agreed  points will automatically go amiss.    We have agreed to the inspection by IAEA and the resumption  of inter-Korean working contact on the premise that the agency  will not take an unreasonable attitude in the course of the  inspection for the continuity of the safeguards and the South  Korean side will not abuse the exchange of special envoys for  such insidious purposes as putting brakes on the DPRK-U.S.  talks.    It is clear that, if the agency and the South Korean  authorities bring forward complicated matters contrary to this  and the United States gives up halfway the decision to renounce  the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and delay the  opening of the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks under an absurd  pretext, we can not satisfactorily ensure the IAEA's inspection  that has already begun, nor can pin any more hope on the  DPRK-U.S. talks itself.    It is high time that the DPRK and the U.S. faithfully  implemented the agreed conclusions on steps for simultaneous  action published a few days ago, conscious of their  responsibilities and obligations in the solution to the nuclear  issue.    We will watch the future acts of the dialogue partner.</p>

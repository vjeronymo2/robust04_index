			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Gardening: The Internet enters life at the Old Rectory - Robin Lane Fox checks up on the Sloane Wallys The wallflowers are already flowering in the herbaceous borders and there are dozens of buds on the Pink Perpetue rose up the main front of the house. Can it really be another Christmas in the Sussex Old Rectory to which Julian committed Veronica Sloane Wally from their home in London's Onslow Gardens eight years ago? For those coming up the drive, it could be nothing else, thanks to Veronica's recent whiting and lighting. An old Sloane friend, Annabel, taught her last year how to spray her Christmas tree with white washing powder, wet-mixed for needle application. This year, she has tried it on the contrasting group of Leylandii cypress and gold-variegated eleagnus which she and Julian planted as the ink dried on the Old Rectory contract in 1986. Not every visitor has been as whole-hearted about this combination. The cypresses are more than 20ft high, and Veronica jammed her Killa-spray while trying to cover them with bio-degradable whiteness before draping them with fairy lights. When nature is refusing to bring Christmas outdoors, it takes a Sloane Wally to do it instead. While Veronica has been simulating on her step-ladder, Julian has come round to some simulation of his own after thinking through the problem of her melancholia. Thanks to last year's City bonuses, properties in Onslow Gardens are still sky-high; thanks to the market for private clients, the price differential between Onslow Gardens and the Old Rectory is much too wide to consider returning in style to London. Every year, the dull, wet days of November do little for Veronica's nostalgia. This year, daughter Victoria has done even less. It is amazing what a second-class degree in Communication Studies now commands as a London starting salary. Sloane Wallys always like to see enterprise rewarded, but Julian and Veronica were not exactly expecting their newly-employed daughter to declare seasonal war on Sussex and decamp with an office bonus, an office partner and a free fortnight on Air Miles to Colombia until the new year. Discussing things with friends at the office, Julian began to see how to make virtuality out of necessity. For weeks, Victoria has been talking impenetrably about Internet surfing, the sky highway and CD-Rom simulation. Two weeks ago, the topics came up again over lunch with his old school friend, Jeremy. Several of Jeremy's contemporaries have been hit badly again by Lloyd's and, this year, they have been forced under the hammer. Two of them are much less bothered about losing the house than losing the garden: window boxes in Pimlico are no compensation. So, they have teamed up in adversity and come up with tomorrow's alternative. Inter-Dig, or global network horticulture, aims to bring the experience, but not the reality, of English country gardening to the house-bound, the bankrupt, and corporate lawyers on postings to the Gulf. In winter, Veronica's code name for the pony paddock has always been Siberia. Until Jeremy spelt the address, Julian thought he was joking when he told him to go down to Soho, find Charlotte Street and key in for a session at Cyberia, London's latest state-of-the-computer-art. Not only did they offer him some excellent slices of chocolate cake. For Pounds 2.50, they made Julian the first Sloane Wally to sit at a keyboard and join the Internet, bombarding him with a choice of bulletin boards from Bill Clinton's Christmas message on screen to the CIA files on third world agriculture. Julian had no idea what possibilities were open to today's gardeners. At cross-terminals, he found himself linked up with Duke in California, who was sharing his experiences with crops of sun-dried tomatoes among ceanothus, while an earth group of live-in feminist gardeners was advertising to swap seeds of Jack-goes-naked for lady's smock. Thanks to Cyberia, Julian no longer thinks of the information highway as one more billeting about traffic jams on the M25. In half an hour he had girdled the earth without digging it, and he felt himself to be part of a green skyway far above the ground elder in his own camomile lawn. Every winter, Veronica becomes wistful when the rain sweeps in from Horsham. Why not Internet her for Christmas: wire her up and let her enjoy the appearance without the experience, as Jeremy put it, cryptically? At a touch on the keyboard, she could garden vicariously while surfing above Sussex on the new computer networks in the sky. Here is how to do it. For Christmas, Julian has bought her a year's link-up with the Internet, focused specially on gardening and green issues, and helmet membership of Inter-Dig, which aims to simulate any experience from Sittinghurst to an evening with Penelope Hobhouse as soon as you plug it in. (Perhaps Inter-Sloane would have been even more effective but, until Onslow Gardens is Internetted, too, a day of apparent weeding without worms or any pain in the hips will do something to take the edge off January outside London). There is one minor uncertainty. Sloane Wallys are emphatically in favour of the free market, but Julian did learn at Cyberia that access to the Internet is sans frontieres, totally free and unrestrictable. It is not only that the CIA file on third world agriculture contains some astonishing statistics about the scale of coca plantations in Colombia and a fact-file on the coca plant's requirements, all of which would have been met admirably by this year's very dry summer in the Old Rectory's paddock. Worse, recipients can net in, swap details and surf off to the sky with anyone who makes key contact and takes their fancy. Even on his trial run, Julian Internetted with a girl in dungarees on an allotment who gave a new meaning to the idea of a Green Goddess. What, he wondered, if Veronica became locked in with some urban soul-mate on a computer latitude far from the home counties? While it might work wonders for the winter blues, Julian did spend last night, before wrapping up the gift, reading the instructions to see if access could be controlled at the giver's discretion.</p>

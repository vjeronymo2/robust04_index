			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Observer: Universal type To anyone working outside the financial sector, job-titles in the City of London can often be not only bemusing but awe-some. Where else, for instance, could people be arrogant enough to style themselves 'heads of global custody'? So it's comforting to learn from Day Associates' latest pay-survey of London banks that the Square Mile still harbours one type of employee who can be found existing, as distinct from working, in organisations of all sorts throughout the world - the 'position-keeper'. To the City's credit, such people seem unusually rare there. Only 25 of the 111 banks surveyed employed them. Moreover, with an average salary of Pounds 13,468, they look to be less well paid just for being there than are their counter-parts in other fields of work.</p>

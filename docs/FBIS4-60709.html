			<p>BFN     [Text] Following today's meeting between the presidents of  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkmenistan, a joint  communique was issued this evening. Part of the communique  says: The presidents of the two countries held negotiations in  a climate full of friendship, fraternity, and understanding,  which is indicative of the good neighborly relations between the  two countries. They exchanged views on political, economic, and  cultural issues of mutual interest. Both sides have expressed  their satisfaction at the agreements reached.    Cooperation in the oil and gas sector was high on the agenda  of these talks. Both sides emphasized their support for the  implementation of the project to transport gas from Turkmenistan  to Europe via the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Both sides regarded cooperation in the field of transport as  the main axis for the expansion of economic and trade relations  between the countries. Expressing happiness at the move toward  implementation of the Mashhad-Sarakhs railway line and the roads  linking Quchan-Imamqoli, Dar-e Gaz-Imamqoli-Bajgiran, and  Artiq-Lotfabad, the two sides called for the speeding up and  completion of these projects.    Both sides also stressed the need to activate banking  relations, establish agency [kargozary] relations, and to  inaugurate a special account [hesab-e makhsus].

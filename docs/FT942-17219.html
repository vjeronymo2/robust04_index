			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Observer: Sales update Here's one for the pension buffs - a one-day conference on personal pensions scheduled for June 1. Although star billing is being given to Securities and Investments Board chief executive John Young, the cognoscenti will be more interested in the man from the Norwich Union, the insurance giant which announced last week that it was taking its entire life and pensions salesforce off the road for a month for retraining. Make way please for Norwich Union's Malcolm Small who will address the nation on 'Measures required to improve standards and prevent future abuse - the life office perspective'.</p>

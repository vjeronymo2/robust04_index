"Triangular debts", Mr. Zhou said, reflected the shortage of  circulating capital in enterprises resulting from the failure of  utilization of investment in fixed assets and products failing  to meet market demands.    The key to solving such debts, he said, lay in restricting  overgrowth of investment in fixed assets and the speeding up of  the transferring of enterprises' operating mechanism. There was  also a need for adjustment of product structure and an  improvement in economic efficiency.    The People's Bank of China, Mr. Zhou said, would strictly  control the total amount of credit this year. A new increase of  RMB [renminbi] 470 billion for bank loans had been decided based  on an increase of nine percent for the national economy this  year.    The restriction on the total amount of credit did not mean  tightening the money supply but indicating support for key  industries. Funds for agricultural production and the purchase  of farming and sideline products as well as loans for  infrastructural construction for energy, transport and raw and  finished materials would be guaranteed, he said. Circulating  capital would also be offered to enterprises in cases where what  they produced could find markets.    Mr. Zhou said that more than 90 percent of money offered by  the state for key construction had been made available.  "Triangular debts" were the result of some enterprises failing  to raise enough funds for themselves, resulting in a funding  shortage.    Mr. Zhou reiterated that three principles set out in Premier  Li Peng's government work report had to be carried out in order  to control the scale of fixed assets investments. First, a  certain proportion of the capital on hand should be guaranteed  for new infrastructural construction products. Second, the  banks should strengthen their supervision and administration in  order to see that there was no embezzling of circulating funds  for investment. Third, basic circulating capital should be  guaranteed for production purposes.</p>

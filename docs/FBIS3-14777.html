			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anca Florea report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] A group of 40 international observers representing  the Council of Europe and the CSCE, in the Republic of Moldova  to monitor the early parliamentary elections, visited Tiraspol  today. The group of observers, of which nine are Romanian  parliamentarians, met with Igor Smirnov, president of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic.    To begin with, Smirnov presented a brief report on the  socioeconomic conditions in the area, after which he answered  questions asked by the observers.    Among the issues discussed were Dniester citizenship, which,  I would like to point out, the separatist authorities attempt to  force on the residents on the left bank of the Dniester River,  and the use of the Romanian language as a state language; in  this connection, I have to remind you of the pressure to which  the three Romanian schools in Dniester are subjected -- in the  past weeks they have been obliged to return to the Cyrillic  alphabet. And, of course, the main thing, the Ilascu case.    From the international observers we learned that Igor  Smirnov  said that Ilascu is, quote, a bandit, unquote, a terrorist about  whom our state's laws have made a decision and no one may  interfere or disregard the people's will. He also affirmed that  due to contradictions between the legislation of the Republic of  Moldova and that of the so-called Dniester Republic, Ilie  Ilascu's possible election to the Parliament of the Republic of  Moldova will not be respected.    According to the same sources, Igor Smirnov's attitude  toward  the observers representing the CSCE and the Council of Europe  was one of detachment and indifference.    Also today, the same group of observers visited polling  station No. 1 in Varnita, which is located on the right side of  the Dniester River, where from 21 February to this afternoon at  1600 more than 2,000 residents from the other bank, the left  bank of the Dniester River, had cast their vote.</p>

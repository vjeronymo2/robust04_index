			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: The burning question The government's partial climbdown over pit closures may prove to be the worst possible outcome for electricity companies. On the surface it looks as if the generators and the regional electricity companies (RECs) will get the coal supply contracts the market was hoping for. Simply slowing the rate of pit closures, though, may not stop rebel Tory MPs voting against the government. Even assuming victory tomorrow, there is a lingering suspicion that Mr Heseltine will use the breathing space to look for ways to shovel more British coal over to the electricity industry. Offer, the electricity regulator, could create some slack if it can show that the RECs breached their duty to purchase power at the most economical rate in buying from independent gas-fired generators. Shares in Norweb and Southern, which have the heaviest involvement in gas-fired generation, fell sharply yesterday ahead of Mr Heseltine's statement. But the regulator was happy to promote gas-fired generation in the name of wider competition. The RECs will have every right to feel aggrieved if he forces them to cancel projects which were contracted when gas was the cheapest energy source available. The government may be inclined to trim nuclear generation, especially since the privatisation of Nuclear Electric is a distant prospect. Decommissioning aged Magnox reactors would certainly leave room for more coal. The costs, though, are deeply uncertain. National Power and PowerGen might still be coerced into taking more British coal under the veiled threat of a monopolies inquiry. Without back-to-back contracts with the RECs, their margins would be squeezed. With dividends covered over three times by earnings and forecast earnings growth well into double digits, the generators certainly have an embarrassment of riches. A bigger danger then for shareholders would be that they call the government's bluff and find themselves taken to the MMC.</p>

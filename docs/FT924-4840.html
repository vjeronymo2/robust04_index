			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Atlas Copco buys back Craelius ATLAS Copco, the Swedish tool manufacturing group, is acquiring Craelius, one of the world's leading manufacturers of equipment for core drilling, grouting and trenchless pipe-laying. It said it was re-buying a company it originally sold in 1979 because it felt there was now a wider range of applications for its products. Craelius, being bought from the Belgian company Diamant Bart on undisclosed terms, has annual turnover of SKr300m (Dollars 44.06m), with sales in more than 100 countries.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> TRAILING, 2-0, KINGS HAVE NOT LOST HOPE  </P> <P> Which was worse? Losing Game 1 in overtime, 4-3, after sitting on a lead? Or  getting blown out in the opening minutes of Game 2 and letting frustrations  turn to fisticuffs in an 8-3 defeat?  </P> <P> "Neither one is worse than the other," said captain Dave Taylor as the Kings  were packing up to leave the Saddledome, down two games to none to the Calgary  Flames in their best-of-seven Smythe Division playoff series.  </P> <P> "A loss is a loss, whether you lose by one or by five."  </P> <P> King goalie Kelly Hrudey was even able to manage a smile as he said: "How can  we come back? It's easy. We're professionals. We regroup. We're in the National  Hockey League now and we're not going to pack it in after two games of a  seven-game series."  </P> <P> The Kings were able to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the semifinal series  against Edmonton by sweeping the last three games.  </P> <P> To win this series, the Kings will have to win four of five. Game 3 is at the  Forum tonight and Game 4 at the Forum Monday night.  </P> <P> The Kings did not practice Friday after flying from Calgary by charter after  the game.  </P> <P> A day off was needed.  </P> <P> As for the effect of such a resounding defeat, Taylor said, "Maybe it will  serve as a slap in the face."  </P> <P> Although the Kings have talked about the intimidation factor and have talked  about being willing to "push back" during the playoffs, they had not been  involved in any real nasty exchanges before Thursday night.  </P> <P> Lanny McDonald of the Flames made this observation Thursday night: "If that's  the way they want to play, no problem. I think they tried it before and it  hasn't worked before. And I can't see it working again."  </P> <P> The Calgary trainer who was on the ice tending to downed goalie Mike Vernon  while the Flames were scoring their fourth goal, Jim (Bearcat) Murray, made an  amazingly quick trip from the bench to the crease. Most trainers wait for a  skater to give them a tow. Not Murray, who has small spikes on his shoes to  allow him to run on the ice.  </P> <P> He's noted for it. A Calgary official said: "Bear's ability to react instantly  to on-ice injuries is well documented. Many times he has reached an injured  Flame player before play has stopped. He is the only trainer in the NHL with  his own fan club."  </P> <P> None of the Kings had had a game misconduct before Thursday night. But by the  time the third-period fight had ended, Marty McSorley, Jay Miller and Jim  Wiemer all had game misconducts. However, since the cumulative count for these  types of penalties starts over in the playoffs, none of them will have to sit  out the next game.  </P> <P> Taylor stayed on the ice after the game to ask the referee why McSorley had  been assessed a game misconduct. The referee cited rule 54 (f): "A game  misconduct shall be imposed on any player who is assessed a major penalty for  fighting following the original altercation . . . at the discretion of the  referee the automatic game misconduct penalty may be waived for a player in the  altercation, if the opposing player was clearly the instigator of the  altercation."  </P> <P> McNall's pilot, Steve Purwin, has been sticking decals on the Jetstar for every  playoff victory. He has four Oiler stickers on the nose of the plane, and he  has Flames stickers at the ready.  </P> <P> The Kings-Flames playoff game at the Forum at 7:30 tonight will be televised  live by Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570).  </P></p>

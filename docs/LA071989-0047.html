			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNSEALED TUNNEL LEAKS 640,000 GALLONS OF OIL  </P> <P> An unsealed tunnel leading from a storage tank leaked up to 640,000 gallons of  oil Tuesday, and nearly 300 gallons spilled into a waterway that leads to the  Atlantic, officials said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't sealed and why it wasn't sealed is something we are looking into,"  Coast Guard Capt. Robert C. North said.  </P> <P> Between 420,000 and 640,000 gallons of oil poured from the tank, but most of it  was contained on land by a system of earthen dikes, the Coast Guard and the  state Department of Environmental Protection reported.  </P> <P> "There's no threat to people," North said. "We're concerned about the  environment if the tank should rupture."  </P> <P> Department spokesman Gary Allen said the oil in the water was confined to a  20-foot-by-80-foot area and was no more then 10 feet out to sea.  </P> <P> Workers were vacuuming the oil from the Arthur Kill, the narrow waterway  separating New Jersey from the New York City borough of Staten Island, using  absorbent booms.  </P> <P> "It is free-flowing oil, so it should not take more then a day to clean up,"  Allen said. He said the oil was fuel oil No. 6.  </P> <P> The spill was reported at a tank owned by Northville Industries. The tank is  one of four near the edge of the Arthur Kill.  </P></p>

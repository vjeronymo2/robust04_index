			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Controversial demolition work almost finished The demolition of one of London's landmarks, the building at No 1 Poultry - opposite the Bank of England - which included the former Mappin &amp; Webb store, is virtually complete. A controversial development, criticised by conservationists and likened by Prince Charles to a 1930s wireless, is to be built in its place. The scheme, designed by Sir James Stirling, is a joint venture by Lord Palumbo, former chair-man of the Arts Council, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier and joint chief executive of Lonrho. It took 35 years and two public inquiries before Lord Palumbo won planning permission in 1989 to redevelop the site. The project has involved the demolition of eight former listed properties including the 125-year-old Mappin &amp; Webb store. Construction is due to be finished by autumn 1996. John Laing construction group is the main contractor for the project. The 110-ft development on six storeys will comprise 125,000 sq ft of offices and 25,000 sq ft of shopping with a 150-seat rooftop restaurant and public gardens. The site is rich in history and is expected to yield significant finds when an archaeological dig starts this autumn.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: GUILT COULD MAKE SELF ORGASM A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> Q. I am a 35-year-old woman, happily married for seven years. Our sex life is  OK, but I am seldom orgasmic unless I masturbate. My problem is that I get a  terrible headache right after reaching orgasm through masturbation. My  gynecologist says there is no medical reason for this. If masturbation is  supposed to be normal, why am I having this problem? And what can I do about  it?  </P> <P> A. It is not possible to answer this with so little information. If I had you  here in my office, I would ask many questions. You might be suffering from  guilt because you believe, deep down, that masturbation is sinful or wrong. I  cannot determine this is your problem, however, simply from reading a brief  letter.  </P> <P> Does your husband ever masturbate you to orgasm? And if he does, do you still  get headaches? If the answer is "no," I am inclined to believe you have a  psychological, not a physical, problem.  </P> <P> But still, I am worried that you might have a medical problem your gynecologist  is missing -- perhaps because you did not present the facts clearly to him. Try  again. If there is absolutely no medical problem, see a psychotherapist.  </P> <P> Q. I am a 25-year-old woman. My husband had an affair while I was pregnant with  our first child. He apologized and wept. I forgave him. Now I've had the baby,  a beautiful boy. He is 6 months old. We are having sex again, but I am not  enjoying it. I want to know if it is common for women not to enjoy sex for a  long time after childbirth. Or, am I not able to let myself go with him in bed  because of the affair?  </P> <P> A. While some women eagerly anticipate resuming sexual relations, others do  need more time after childbirth before they are ready to engage in sex again.  That may be true for you.  </P> <P> However, I suspect your situation is compounded by the affair. Some people,  both men and women, find it hard to have good sexual relations with a partner  who has cheated on them -- even though they have "forgiven" the partner.  </P> <P> Suppressed anger may periodically surface in you for some time to come.  Unfortunately, you are taking that anger out on yourself. You are having sex,  but not letting yourself enjoy it.  </P> <P> You must go talk to a psychotherapist right away. You need to identify your  feelings and talk about them. Your husband's tearful repentance may have made  it difficult for you to express your own sadness and anger.  </P></p>

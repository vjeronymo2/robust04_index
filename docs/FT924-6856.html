			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Dalgety settles succession - picks Clothier Dalgety has named Richard Clothier (right), a 15-year veteran of the food group, to succeed Maurice Warren, who retires next June at the company's standard retirement age of 60. There will be a six-month handover period; Clothier, 47, becomes chief executive designate in January. In his four years at the top of Dalgety, Warren has effected a fundamental restructuring. This involved a series of disposals, including the commodity business Gill &amp; Duffus as well as the Australian agricultural interests; installing a younger management team; and generally winning the confidence of the City. Under John West, who became non-executive chairman in September, the company searched both externally and internally for Warren's successor. Of the two other internal candidates, one is assumed to have been Hugh Thomas, who joined from Nestle in 1990 and is in charge of the consumer food business, and had, at least from outside, for a while been perceived as the most likely new boss. The other was Paul Kirk, chief executive of Dalgety Agriculture, who joined the board this April, as did Clothier. 'We are all the same age, but with quite different experience and I do hope we can continue to work well together,' says Clothier. Clothier, who was born in Rhodesia and took a degree in agriculture at the University of Natal, joined Dalgety Agriculture in 1977 after seven years with the Milk Marketing Board. He has been in charge of The Pig Improvement Company since 1988, currently the fastest growing part of the group, with turnover doubled and profits more than tripled under his watch. But it is Thomas's area, consumer foods, that probably offers the most growth potential, according to Clothier. If analysts perceive any weakness in Clothier it is that he, in common with Warren, has no direct experience of consumer branding. 'It is quite understandable if they do,' Clothier says philosophically, 'but we have very strong people who do understand that sector.' One of those is Jack Rowell, 56, who runs Golden Wonder snacks, the largest individual business within the consumer food division, and who is now appointed to the main board. Meanwhile, Warren says he will not be retiring from the business and says he has 'another appointment waiting in the wings, out of the sector' but will not be drawn further.</p>

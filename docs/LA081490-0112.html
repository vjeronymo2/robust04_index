			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANELS OK FULL BAN ON SMOKING IN RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: COMMITTEES DELAY PUTTING PROPOSAL BEFORE COUNCIL FOR FOUR WEEKS TO  GIVE OPPONENTS TIME TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES.  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles City Council committees, after hearing two hours of vigorous  debate, approved a controversial ordinance Monday to ban smoking in the city's  8,600 restaurants.  </P> <P> However, the committees also voted to put off submitting the ordinance for  consideration by the full council for at least four weeks to give opponents  time to propose possible amendments that may lead to a less-restrictive law.  </P> <P> Typically, ordinances adopted by committee are forwarded to the full council  within two weeks.  </P> <P> In a special joint session, the council's Environmental Quality and Waste  Management Committee and the Arts, Health and Humanities Committee approved the  ban over the strenuous objections of restaurant owners and business groups.  </P> <P> During the hearing, council members Marvin Braude, who sponsored the ordinance,  Ruth Galanter and Joel Wachs heard from about two dozen opponents and  supporters of the proposed ban, including Patrick Reynolds, the grandson of  tobacco company magnate R. J. Reynolds.  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, who abstained from voting, said he needed to see more  evidence before he could believe either side's claims.  </P> <P> "I'm no more able to make a decision on this now than I was before the  hearing," he said.  </P> <P> After Braude agreed to delay a council hearing, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter  voted for the proposal.  </P> <P> "A number of issues have been raised that I would like to grapple with," said  Galanter, who has supported Braude's past anti-smoking efforts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles has ordinances -- all authored by Braude -- barring smoking in  grocery stores, elevators and rooms where public meetings are being conducted,  and requiring restaurants with seating for 50 or more people to set aside at  least half the tables for nonsmokers.  </P> <P> Restaurateurs based their opposition to the latest proposal on the claim that  smokers would not go out to eat if they could not also smoke. Several cited the  experience of Beverly Hills, which enacted a complete ban on restaurant smoking  when Los Angeles adopted its current law, only to rescind the measure when  patronage fell sharply.  </P> <P> "I am concerned with the economic future of our institution," said Michael  Taix, part owner of the venerable Les Freres Taix restaurant on Sunset  Boulevard.  </P> <P> "The Beverly Hills experiment should illustrate how lethal this ban can be to  our marginally profitable business," he said.  </P> <P> Rudy Cole of Restaurants for a Sensible Voluntary Policy, a coalition claiming  200 member restaurants in Los Angeles, said the adequacy of the current law is  demonstrated by the lack of public complaint.  </P> <P> But Braude and other supporters of the measure said their position had little  to do with diners' comfort.  </P> <P> "Tobacco smoke is a deadly carcinogen," Braude said. "It kills both smokers and  nonsmokers."  </P> <P> While the surgeon general estimates that tobacco kills 395,000 users a year,  Braude said, "recent scientific disclosures indicate that at least 35,000  nonsmoking Americans also die each year as a result of other people's smoking."  </P> <P> The risk of lung cancer is 30 times as high for people highly exposed to  second-hand smoke as for the nonsmoking general public, according to Dr. Wilbur  Hallett of the USC Medical School and the American Lung Assn.  </P> <P> But Wachs said he was not convinced of the significance of smoke exposure from  spending a few hours at a restaurant.  </P></p>

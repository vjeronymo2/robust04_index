			<p>Transport   <F P=102>   94WS0364B Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT in German 19 May 94 p 9 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0364B </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> CSO     [Text] Frankfurt. The Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center has  developed a micropump whose central element is a thin diaphragm  made of polyimide. The approximately one-micrometer-thick film  is stabile up to 400C. In the various chambers of the pump  housing made by means of injection molding from the chemically  unreactive material polysulfone, the plastic film is the  diaphragm for the pump as well as the diaphragm for the passive  inlet and outlet valves. A 0.25-micrometer copper heating spiral  positioned on the diaphragm by means of thin film technology and  photolithography heats up a gas or liquid in the pump chamber.  The medium which is to be delivered [by the pump] is transported  along by means of the heat expansion, according to the Karlsruhe  Nuclear Research Center GmbH (Coordination and Technology  Transfer, P.O. Box 3640, 76021 Karlsruhe: Telephone 07 247-82 55  80). The pump allegedly produces a pressure of 130 mbar. It can  transport up to 0.2 milliliter per minute at a pump frequency of  30 hertz. The 7 x 10 millimeter pump can be operated by battery.</p>

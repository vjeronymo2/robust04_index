			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: For the chattering classes - Television On Friday ITV began its six-part Fay Weldon serial Growing Rich, about three girls from a small town in East Anglia and their involvement with the devil. Tomorrow Channel 4 begins its adaptation of Mary Wesley's novel The Camomile Lawn with a two-hour episode which will be followed by three more, each of 60 minutes, telling the story of three generations of a family, between 1939 and 1984. These are both 'prestige' productions, which is to say that well known people are involved, they were expensive to create, the makers will hope for fairly large audiences, the chattering classes are expected to chatter, and there are good prospects of international sales. Having watched three episodes of Growing Rich and the whole of The Camomile Lawn I can report that both also offer a high level of entertainment. As we have come to expect from Fay Weldon, certainly since Life And Loves Of A She Devil and The Cloning Of Joanna May but, to some extent, even before that, much of the pleasure comes from the combination of, and the contrast between, television's familiar naturalism and frequent blasts of the supernatural. The devil, known as The Driver, is chauffeur to Sir Bernard Bellamy (John Stride) the local Mr Big who, we suspect, must have some sort of Faustian bargain in his background. Since the three girls fail their exams The Driver seems their best bet for getting out of dreary Fenedge, though it is only Carmen, the best looking of the trio, who really deals with him. When thwarted he acts rather pettily, sending swarms of bees to chase the girls and raising great geysers of fire in Carmen's kitchen. Even in a good mood his tricks seem trivial: the head on a door knocker suddenly grows horns, and when Carmen is trying on a revealing dress he enlarges her bust and narrows her waist until she becomes a parody of the voluptuous female. There are beautifully observed moments, as in this week's episode when the girls go to Sir Bernard's new hotel for job interviews and enter through the front door. Snooty Mrs Haverill, the housekeeper, tells them to use the staff entrance, but Carmen, who noticed Sir Bernard ogling her at the school prize giving, flounces over to a chair and flops down, hoisting her skirt to reveal a lot of leg to Sir B. The short scene that follows, between these three and Sir B's Sloane Ranger fiancee, provides a guided tour of the English class system in about 90 seconds. There are other pleasures. Martin Kemp who plays The Driver tends to deliver his lines as though he has just learned them, a trait which, if deliberate, is baffling in its intention, but, that aside, the acting is as consistently splendid as we now expect in all of Britain's television drama. We seems to have a bottomless supply of wonderful young actresses, and the three girls here are played by three more virtual unknowns (Rosalind Bennett as Carmen, Claire Hackett as Annie, and Caroline Harker as Laura) who not only give good performances individually, but are also completely convincing as one of those irritating schoolgirl trios that you find in bus queues, talking in code and oblivious to the rest of the world. Moreover the series is continually good to look at, especially in those sections shot in New Zealand where we follow what happens to Annie. Having said all that, is this anything more than a rather fancy woman's magazine story? Given that one of the central characters is the devil, does it have anything to tell us about good and evil? The narrative is entertaining enough; at least we seem to have left behind those dreary dramas of the 1960s and '70s whose makers appeared to regard story telling as beneath their dignity. But beyond the obvious storyline of Growing Rich is there any sort of comment about what it means to be human in 1992? This week it becomes clear that whereas Carmen's brother is assumed by his parents to need an education she is expected to get through life on her looks. This could lead to interesting thoughts about the luck of pretty girls who can choose looks or work as a means of advancement while boys are limited to work - but instead we are left with the familiar tang of feminist dogma. Whatever the quality of Mary Wesley's novel, Channel 4's dramatisation of The Camomile Lawn puts you in mind of an up-market version of one of those Andrea Newman serials in which the main concern, in the end, is how many more sexual pairings can be arranged without credibility disappearing entirely. Will Polly sleep with both the twins? Simultaneously? Will it be Oliver or Tony for whom Calypso first removes her camiknickers? The story is of a family, consisting largely of cousins, who meet as usual for a summer holiday in Cornwall in 1939 at the house with the camomile lawn planted by Aunt Helena (Felicity Kendal). Many of the younger characters then join the armed forces and most of the rest of the action takes place in London during the second world war. It is compelling, almost addictive stuff: after the first hour or so you really do want to know what happens next to these people  - Coronation Street for Volvo drivers. After the last 25 years of British television drama it would, I suppose, be quite impossible now to produce anything set in the 1940s which did not feature scrupulously authentic steam trains, vintage motors, enamel hoardings for Players Navy Cut, and Fair Isle pullovers. They are here in the usual quantities, and, under Peter Hall's direction, it was found necessary to fit anti-shatter tape on the windows of not just one house but an entire terrace, so that those white diamonds could be seen in the background of tracking shots. Would that the same dedication had gone into illustrating the way in which the war altered people. True, the bonk rate gets very high, with affairs arranged rather as they are in the cricket World Cup so that everyone is eventually paired with everyone else. There is not merely the usual bonking in the bedroom but also bonking on the train, bonking on the sofa, bonking in the front hall and even bonking on the camomile. This makes it much more fun than the usual war story in which people are forever being sickeningly violent, but there is precious little attempt to move beyond the exigencies of the plot to make any sort of observation about war or ageing or love or marriage, even though these are the threads on which the tapestry is supposed to be woven. There are interesting twists: Calypso marries for money, but falls in love with her husband; generations of girls discover that good old Uncle Richard has been putting his hand up their skirts but conclude this isn't 'terrible' as one says but boring; and it turns out that even concentration camp survivors can be rather unpleasant people. But without crying out for the over-arching human understanding of a Tolstoy, one is surely entitled to expect something more than such little twists after five hours of drama. It is entertaining, it really is, both these serials are, but we know that television is capable of more. Once again the lit. crit. brigade will smile pityingly and say that mere television can never explore the human mind nor illustrate the human condition with the subtlety, expressiveness, or precision of print. But those of us who watched Dennis Potter's Singing Detective know that television can, indeed, penetrate and map that internal landscape of the mind which was once sole territory of the novel. And anyone who saw the whole of Kieslowski's marvellous Ten Commandments realises that television can talk to us with tremendous power about the human condition. Growing Rich and The Camomile Lawn are two highly entertaining serials but it is surely not unreasonable to ask for a little more ambition from television drama departments.</p>

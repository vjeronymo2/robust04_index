Rodriguez] </F>   [Excerpts] Chilpancingo, Guerrero, 20 April--"Luis Donaldo  Colosio Murrieta's assassination did not originate in any  national conspiracy involving very powerful groups or  politicians." This assertion was made here today by Rafael  Aguilar Talamantes, candidate for the presidency of the republic  from the Party of the Cardenist Front for National  Reconstruction (PFCRN).    He added: "Colosio's sacrifice was due to regional interests  of drug trafficking Mafias which, finding their financial income  impaired, took revenge on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari by  killing his favorite political son. They realized that they  would be striking him where it hurt most." [passage omitted]    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes remarked that, during the Salinas  de Gortari regime, a strenuous battle was waged (and is still  being waged) throughout the national territory to take  prosecutory action against the interests of the Mafias engaged  in drug growing and trafficking. No such battle ever occurred  during any other six-year term, he noted, adding that this meant  that "those hurt would take revenge on someone whose death would  grieve the president, and that person was, indisputably, Colosio  Murrieta."    He commented: "By killing Colosio, they knew that they would  deal a severe moral and political blow to his benefactor, his  political father." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: German insurer to raise holding in AGF to 5% AMB, the German insurance group, is planning to raise its stake in Assurances Generales de France to 5 per cent and become part of a group of stable shareholders when the French insurer is privatised, writes John Ridding. The German company, which currently holds 2.57 per cent of AGF, intends to raise its stake by the end of June next year even if its French partner has still to be privatised at that date. AGF is slated for sale by the French government. Its privatisation, originally expected last autumn, has been delayed by the depressed state of the bond market which has significantly reduced the company's value. In addition to AMB, other likely core investors include Societe Generale and Paribas, the French banking groups.</p>

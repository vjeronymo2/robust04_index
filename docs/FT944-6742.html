			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (4): Alienation tends to breed violence - Political power has been retained in the hands of an elite group of families Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader, show no sign of relenting in the bitter feud which has poisoned Pakistani politics for the past five years. To the dismay of Pakistanis concerned about the quality of the country's democracy and about its international image, the consequences of the two leaders' bad-tempered rivalry were recently put on display in the National Assembly building. Addressing a joint meeting of the assembly and the senate, Mr Farooq Leghari, the president, was barely able to deliver an important policy speech, as government and opposition members pushed each other about and exchanged insults at the foot of his podium. 'Leghari thief] Leghari go,' opposition members shouted throughout the speech. Banners were draped around the hall condemning the government for alleged corruption. Later, an opposition member was taken to hospital after being beaten by student supporters of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. Afterwards, Ms Bhutto blamed the opposition for starting the row. Mr Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League party retorted that the government had provoked the attack by arresting Mr Mohammed Sharif, the opposition leader's 75-year-old father only a day earlier on charges of fraud, forgery and tax evasion. The roots of the quarrel go back to the conflict between Ms Bhutto's father, Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former prime minister, and General Zia-ul-Haq, the late dictator, who in 1977 imposed military rule and later ordered Mr Bhutto's execution. After General Zia's death in 1988, democracy was restored and Ms Bhutto came to power. But it was only 20 months before the army and bureaucracy chased her out of office and installed Mr Nawaz Sharif, a protege of General Zia. However, last year Mr Nawaz Sharif overplayed his hand by provoking rows with the army, over the appointment of a new chief of staff, and with the president, Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, over a plan to curb the presidency's powers. After months of turmoil, Ms Bhutto was returned to office in a general election which was widely seen as the fairest ever held in Pakistan. But fair elections have not brought political peace. Ms Bhutto is pursuing a wide-ranging corruption inquiry into the business interests of the Sharif family, especially its rapid growth during Mr Nawaz Sharif's periods in office, first as chief minister in Punjab, the largest of Pakistan's four provinces, in the 1980s and later as prime minister. Mr Nawaz Sharif has responded with allegations of corruption against Mr Asif Zardari, Ms Bhutto's husband and a leading businessman. Among the banners paraded during the stormy demonstration in the National Assembly this month was one declaring: 'Pakistan for Sale. Contact Zardari and Associates.' Mr Nawaz Sharif wants Ms Bhutto's resignation and an early general election  -'she has lost all legitimacy,' he says. Ms Bhutto insists that despite the confrontation, the corruption charges and even the scuffles in Parliament, democracy is thriving in Pakistan. Italy and Japan have also seen parliamentary storms, yet no-one questions their democratic credentials, she says. Certainly, the battles are being fought within constitutional norms and, the army has stayed out of the fray unlike in some previous episodes in Pakistani history. Moreover, the two main parties have few disagreements on policy - whether it is over the economy, defence or international relations. The feud does Pakistan considerable harm, however: first, the leaders set a poor example for other Pakistanis, some of whom need little encouragement to try to take the law into their own hands. Next, it harms the country's international image. Finally, it distracts attention from the country's deeper political difficulties. The most immediate need is to deal with the threats to law and order, especially in Karachi, (as described in a separate article on this page), and in the tribal areas in the north, where many have died in an insurgency in Malakand district this year. The supply of guns and ammunition left over from the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan and the spread of the drug trade have put considerable power into the hands of armed groups. Young men with automatic weapons are almost every day turning conflicts over religion, politics and crime into vicious gun-fights. Deploying the police, paramilitary rangers and the army is only part of the answer. Without economic, social and political initiatives, the roots of violence will sink deeper into Pakistani soil. Ms Bhutto's government is pledged to improve social and economic conditions through its Social Action Programme, which involves increasing social spending. But the crux of the matter is that too few Pakistanis are involved in the running of their country and so feel alienated from authority. The nation is ruled by an elite of Sindhi and Punjabi feudal landlords, whose sons (apart from Ms Bhutto, few women are active in public life) fill the national and provincial assemblies and the upper echelons of the bureaucracy and army. Over half National Assembly members are rural landowners. Mr Altaf Gauhar, a veteran political and economic commentator, estimates that just 500 families rule Pakistan. The only politician who managed to reach out beyond the land-based elite was Ms Bhutto's father, Mr Zulfikar Bhutto, a populist who won support from the urban crowds of Karachi and Lahore. Even though his daughter has claimed Mr Bhutto's mantle, she has failed to reach the hearts of ordinary Pakistanis in the same way. With domination of a small elite, has come the transformation of public life into the personal fiefdom of a few wealthy families. Corruption and patronage have become endemic and the law has been turned into a tool of political manipulation. To her credit, Ms Bhutto is aware of the challenges involved in making Pakistan a more just society. Her government has strengthened anti-corruption laws, tax collection measures and controls to prevent the powerful extracting excessive loans from banks. But it is not yet clear that Ms Bhutto has the will to persuade her class to share at least some of its privileges. As Mr Gauhar says: 'The only way this problem will be solved is if the poor gang together. Then the elite will have to change.'</p>

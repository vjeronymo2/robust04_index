			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A story Thursday on San Gabriel City Councilman Frank Blaszcak's call for an  investigation of city "irregularities," said that part of a lot owned by former  Planning Commissioner James Dickson was used for a gas station owned by Fred  Paine. The gas station is owned by Dickson. The story also erroneously said  that Paine had subdivided a property into six lots. The correct number is five.  It was also reported that Blaszcak had sued 11 current or former city officials  for libel. Six of those being sued are civic leaders, not city officials.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Slower decline seen in eastern European economies this year THE ECONOMIES of eastern Europe shrank by almost 9 per cent last year, according to International Monetary Fund estimates. The fund's World Economic Outlook forecasts that real gross domestic product will fall again this year, but more modestly: by 1.5 per cent against 8.6 per cent in 1990. Growth in the region - Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia - should then resume as the private sector expands and efficiency continues to improve. Growth is estimated at a 2.8 per cent rate in 1992 and an average 4.4 per cent from 1993-96. If the Soviet Union is included, the regional economy shrank 3.8 per cent this year. It is forecast to decline 4.2 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent next. Growth will average 1.2 per cent from 1993-96. According to IMF staff projections, the combined current account deficit of the region, excluding the Soviet Union, will rise to about Dollars 10bn this year and Dollars 11bn next. This will reflect the widening of external deficits with the traditional convertible currency area and deteriorating trade balances with the Soviet Union, with which they now trade in hard currency.  --------------------------------------------------------------------          HIGHLIGHTS OF IMF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Output (real GDP) annual % change       1990       1991       1992 World                                    2.1        1.2        2.9 Industrial countries                     2.5        1.3        2.8 Developing countries                     0.6        0.8        3.4 US                                       1.0        0.2        2.7 Japan                                    5.6        3.6        3.9 W Germany                                4.5        2.8        1.9 UK                                       0.6       -2.1        1.9 E.

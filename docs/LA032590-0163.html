			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RETIREE'S TICKET  </P> <P> Disbelief and then anger was my response as I read "Retiree Gets a Ticket for  Picking Up Trash" (March 13).  </P> <P> As an Irvine taxpayer for 10 years, I wonder if the Irvine Police Department is  overstaffed or is undertrained in recognizing criminal behavior.  </P> <P> Nick Grinenko's caring, smiling face greeted my walking partners and me every  morning for the two years I lived in Northwood. He walked the same route every  morning. He prided himself on collecting cans and bottles from the trash cans  at the two parks and then giving the proceeds to charity.  </P> <P> Keep up the good work, Nick. I am relieved my current tax dollars didn't  underwrite this incident!  </P> <P> GWEN BYRD  </P> <P> Aliso Viejo  </P></p>

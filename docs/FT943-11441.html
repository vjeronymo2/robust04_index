			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / US growth 3.7% in 2nd quarter: GDP now 10 per cent higher than at the trough of recession The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent between April and June, partly because companies built up inventories faster than in previous quarters, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Bonds and shares rose sharply on Wall Street - the Dow Jones industrial average jumping 33.67 to 3,764.5 - as traders interpreted the rise in inventories as a sign that growth would slow in the second half, reducing the need for further interest rates rises. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1.2 per cent, a third the pace in previous quarters. Many economists, however, played down the significance of higher inventories and predicted a rebound in consumer spending later this year. The second quarter gain in output was the 13th consecutive quarter of economic growth following a mild recession in 1990-91. GDP is now nearly 10 per cent higher in real terms than at the trough of the recession. Data revisions showed growth at annualised rates of 6.3 per cent and 3.3 per cent in the fourth and first quarters respectively, against previous estimates of 7.0 per cent and 3.4 per cent. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York brokerage, predicted growth in excess of 3 per cent at an annual rate in the second half, reflecting a rebound in consumer spending and in exports, and a further rise in inventories. The Federal Reserve was likely to raise rates by another percentage point to about 5.25 per cent by the end of the year, he said. Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, said the figures were consistent with her projections of a 3 per cent rise in both growth and inflation this year. The gain in inventories was mostly a voluntary adjustment by companies to faster growth. Inflation was under control, she said. The 'fixed price' GDP deflator - a broad gauge of inflation - rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the second quarter, down from 3.1 per cent in the first three months.</p>

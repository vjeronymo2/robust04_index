			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``70 Research Achievements of </F> Institute 13 under Ministry of Electronics Industry Pass Formal  Appraisal'']    [Summary] At a formal technical appraisal held 23-25  December 1993, 70 research achievements of MEI's Institute 13,  located in Shijiazhuang, were certified. Technical details are  as follows:    1. Silicon Microwave Devices    Breakthroughs in 1993 were realized in development of  broadband high-power devices such as the WD942 silicon broadband  microwave pulsed power transistor, which in the 0.96-1.215-GHz  range has a pulsed output power of 100 W and a pulse width of 10  s, and the WD95I device, which in the 2.25-2.55-GHz range  has  a pulsed output power of 50 W and pulse width of 65 s.    2. Optoelectronic Devices    Advances have been made in research on high-power  quantum-well laser diodes especially applicable to domestic  all-solid-state lasers. Last year, the institute developed  AlGaAs and InGaAs quantum-well laser diodes for solid-state  laser pump sources--an achievement closely tracking the world  state-of-the-art.    3. Micropackaging, Microassemblies/Micromodules    In development of micropackaged devices, microassemblies and  micromodules, the institute has made advances meeting early-9Os  international standards. The HE48I-487 miniature VCO IC meets  late-80s international standards.    4. Process Technologies    In 1993 the institute undertook 10 military-product  early-phase research projects, among which outstanding  achievements were development of an all-planar process for  fabricating the model E/D 2000-gate GaAs gate-array device and  development of performance evaluation theory and methods for  hardening and ruggedizing devices.</p>

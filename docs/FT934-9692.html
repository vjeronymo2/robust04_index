			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (10): Space: the final frontier to cross - Airline comfort ANYONE LOOKING at a photograph of airliner cabins in the old days might be forgiven for thinking that life had improved little. When the Boeing 314 flying boat was in its heyday, passengers ate at dining tables and could stand up without hitting their heads on overhead luggage bins. Today, business class passengers on short-haul flights are likely to find themselves crammed into space more normally associated with public buses. Even on long-haul flights, buyers of tickets that cost thousands of pounds are forced to catnap in seats that seem to be designed so that only one position is comfortable. No wonder that British Airways' new arrivals lounge at Heathrow - where incoming travellers can have their clothes pressed - is so popular. The days of cruise liner service and space may have gone. But there are still some real differences in cabin comfort to be found between airlines. Regular surveys of business travellers by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) show that what passengers really want is space. Some airlines have taken rapid advantage of this. Virgin, Continental of the US and Eva Air of Taiwan already make a selling point out of offering more leg-room. Virgin and Continental have fitted first-class seats but sold them at business class prices. They recoup some of the lost revenue by dispensing with the more overt luxuries that other carriers give to first-class passengers: there are no second helpings of Beluga caviar or Chateau Mouton-Rothschild on Virgin or Continental. Eva has extended this principle to the economy passengers, who have the kind of extending leg-rests that other carriers fit only in business and first class. But there is a limit to what manufacturers can do within the dimensions of a single aircraft type. Aircraft manufacturers recognise this, and the launch of a new model gives them an opportunity to add space as well as increase range and fuel efficiency. The likes of Airbus and Boeing have introduced models which are simply bigger than their older rivals. The Airbus A320 competes directly with the Boeing 737 for short-haul markets such as Western Europe, south-east Asia and domestic US. Designed in the 1980s, the A320's passenger cabin is 25 centimetres wider than the 737's and 9cm higher. This allows airlines to carry the same number of passengers but to put them in wider seats with more headroom. It is one of the factors behind the success of Airbus and hence Boeing's Dollars 1.5bn plan to upgrade the 737. But Boeing's main hope for the 1990s is the long-haul 777, scheduled to enter service in 1995. The 777 will be able to carry over 300 passengers - less than the 747 but more than the 767. It will be a twin-engined alternative to the new four-engined Airbus A340. Boeing has made passenger comfort a big selling point for the 777 as it tries to persuade cash-strapped airlines to commit themselves to buying the new model. One significant change is that the cabin floor is lower in the fuselage than previous models. This has two effects on passenger space: window-seat passengers have more headroom because the ceiling begins to curve over their heads at a greater height above the seat, while aisle passengers have more headroom because the stowage bins are set higher. Boeing argues that extra headroom all-round also gives passengers the impression that there is more seat room in the 777 than there is in a 747 Jumbo jet, even though there is not. Impressions are important in attracting the business traveller. And that most elusive of incentives to fly with a particular airline - the feeling of a pleasant surprise - should be at the top of the list of priorities when airlines serve the jaded business class passenger, says Mr Chris Lane, chairman of airline consultancy, TMI. He attacks the thinking behind the technological tricks now on offer. Seatback videos are already spilling from first into business class cabins. There are satellite links for telephones and faxes on Singapore Airlines, live broadcasts from BBC world service radio on Cathay Pacific, with the promise of live television to come. Next year should see video screen with computer keyboards attached. Virgin Atlantic, having already offered a masseuse to business class passengers, says it now wants to introduce gambling in the skies. The carriers' idea is not only to take away the tedium of flying, but also to distinguish it from its rivals. But these changes at best satisfy the business passenger and rarely delight them, argues Mr Lane. What is innovative now can be humdrum in six months' time. Airlines may be beginning to recognise this. Three years ago, Japan Air Lines set its engineers the task of dreaming about a future aircraft cabin. The result was a series of proposed engineering marvels including adjustable headrests with built-in speakers, seats that could be adjusted vertically and width-wise, computerised ordering of drinks ('enhanced with photographs') from the seat and even videos of soothing landscapes. Now the scheme, called Romantech for romantic technology, has been shelved indefinitely. JAL is not alone in reconsidering heavy investment in passenger gadgetry, given the questions being asked by airlines executives. Can such discretionary spending be justified during the airline industry's biggest recession for almost 50 years? Is it clear which of the changes would pay back the investment through a greater number of passengers paying higher ticket prices? Perhaps most importantly: why not eliminate risk by waiting to see which innovations work for a rival and then simply copy them? And therein lies the attraction of newer models of aircraft such as the A320 and Boeing 777. Not only do business passengers value the extra space, but aircraft purchase programmes cannot be undertaken as lightly as a cabin refurbishment: it can take years, and billions of dollars, for a competitor to catch up. Of course, buying a new model of aircraft is an expensive way of creating a better product. But it is a step that can be taken by large and relatively financially healthy carriers that are already winning the race for the business traveller's heart and wallet.</p>

Therefore, the Iraqi people have the right to use every way  their enlightened political leadership believes to be right to  confront the mysteries of the political conspiracy against them  in order to lift the blockade, to reassess all the positions  that have led to the continued blockade, and to create the right  opportunity and take the right position and step to save Iraq's  people from the injustice it is facing as a result of the damned  blockade.</p>

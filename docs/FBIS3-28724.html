PNG Radio said the first clash occurred when  the BRA attacked the government station at Boku in Southeast  Bougainville yesterday morning. The radio said one of the  rebels was killed in an exchange of fire with troops guarding  the station. In the second clash, three civilians, including a  senior public servant, were wounded when rebels ambushed two  government vehicles travelling from Sovele to (?Koto).

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Deregulation row casts doubts over Dairy Crest flotation The Milk Marketing Board yesterday appeared to rule out an early flotation of its Dairy Crest subsidiary. Speaking after Thursday's talks with the government on the industry's deregulation, Mr Andrew Dare, MMB chief executive, said he thought that floating the dairy foods arm before November would mean working towards an extremely tight timetable. There had until recently been hopes that a sale could be achieved by November 1, when the deregulation of the industry is due to be effected. However, the row over deregulation has convinced many within the industry that a flotation is unlikely this year and may not happen at all. Some analysts believe that the uncertainty and the rise in prices that the Dairy Trades Federation is protesting about will increase the chances of a management buy-out at Dairy Crest, valued by some analysts at more than Pounds 250m. However, a likely fall in profits this year - last year it made Pounds 39.8m at the operating level - will depress the potential proceeds if a flotation is made in the near future. Thursday's government talks between the Dairy Trades Federation and the MMB, soon to be replaced by a voluntary co-operative of dairy producers called Milk Marque, ended with Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, promising to consult with his ministerial colleagues. The DTF has threatened to take the government to court over the deregulation and Mr Waldegrave has said a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission cannot be ruled out.</p>

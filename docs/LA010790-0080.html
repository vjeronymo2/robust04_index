			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MACLEOD'S DECISION ONE OF KEYS TO KNICKS' SUCCESS  </P> <P> The editors of The Sporting News choose the NBA's executive of the year, and  thus far, they have not asked for help. It's obvious, however, that there is  only one choice:  </P> <P> John MacLeod.  </P> <P> Admittedly, MacLeod is without a job, and he has never been an executive. But  as far as Knick fans are concerned, he made a very important executive decision  when he rejected Al Bianchi's overtures last summer. Bianchi wanted MacLeod,  his good friend and boss in Phoenix for 12 seasons, to become the Knicks' head  coach. MacLeod refused.  </P> <P> Bianchi then promoted Stu Jackson to head coach, and Jackson responded by  putting the best Knick product on the floor since the Knicks' glory years in  the early '70s. MacLeod, therefore, is largely responsible for the Knicks'  success. And because he already has been fired by the Mavericks, MacLeod  deserves some form of compensation.  </P> <P> MacLeod's decision to not take the Knicks' job may be the smartest thing  Bianchi has ever done. And although there has been much talk about Patrick  Ewing's bid to become the first MVP from the Knicks since Willis Reed in 1970,  it is important to remember that it is Jackson's system that has allowed Ewing  to flourish. Perhaps it is time to begin focusing on Jackson as a potential  award-winner.  </P> <P> Ewing was capable of dominating last season. But he did what he was told, which  was shoot about 16 times a game. During last season, Ewing attempted only 135  more field goals than the Knicks attempted three-point shots. Ewing and the  three-pointer were almost equal options.  </P> <P> This season, however, Ewing has attempted 570 field goals -- about 20 per game  -- and the Knicks have attempted 270 three-pointers. Ewing now is more than  twice as important as the three-point shot. It's a question of focus, and the  Knicks unquestionably are better focused than they were last season.  </P> <P> For that, Jackson must receive credit.  </P> <P> "It's early," Bianchi said, "but I think the things that we thought about him  have come true. We knew he would be able to work with people, and he has. He's  handled the Mark Jackson-Rod Strickland situation well. It is evident that  Kenny Walker needed to be treated with tender loving care, and Stu's done that.  And Patrick's playing better than he ever has because Stu has given him the  chance."  </P> <P> When the Knicks hired Jackson, then 33, it was suggested here that no rookie  coach could win a championship. That was wrong. Jackson hasn't won it yet, but  it seems obvious now that if he doesn't, it won't be because he's a rookie  coach. Some team simply will play better than the Knicks.  </P> <P> As it stands now, Jackson will make his imprint on Knick history. The Knicks'  nine-game winning streak ended Tuesday when they lost to the Suns, which gave  the Knicks a 20-8 record. If they continue winning at their present pace, they  will end the season 59-23. Only the 1969-70 Knicks championship team (60-22)  had a better record.  </P> <P> Jackson also could become the third Knick coach -- Joe Lapchick and Red Holzman  are the others -- to coach in the All-Star Game. If the Knicks have the best  record in the East on Jan. 28, Jackson will be the Eastern coach, and benefit  from the accompanying publicity.  </P> <P> And perhaps at some point he will thank MacLeod, because by not coming to New  York, MacLeod has enabled Jackson to become perhaps the No. 1 contender for the  coach of the year award.  </P> <P> The Magic may be an expansion team, but their clock crew apparently is familiar  with some old tricks. In the Pistons' 115-113 victory in Orlando Tuesday, Magic  guard Nick Anderson missed a free throw with 2.7 seconds left. Dennis Rodman  got the rebound, turned to his left and attempted to throw the ball to the  other end of the court. Anderson, however, intercepted the pass and launched a  desperation 40-foot, three-point shot. The problem, as the Pistons saw it, was  that when Anderson attempted the last shot, 2.2 seconds were left on the clock.  "Dangerous," Coach Chuck Daly said. "I'm not sure the clock started."  </P> <P> "The clock didn't even move," Bill Laimbeer said. "There's no excuse for that.  It's bad for the NBA when stuff like that happens."  </P> <P> OK, Bill. You want to talk about what's bad for the NBA? The first release of  Eastern Conference All-Star voting totals has Laimbeer trailing Ewing by only  363 votes in balloting for the starting center position. Not only that, but  Mark Aguirre is second among forwards. Obviously there have been a lot of votes  submitted from Detroit, where the fans are very loyal but not real bright. How  could anyone vote for Laimbeer instead of Ewing, no matter where they are from?  Anyway, Ewing will win when the votes from some of the more intelligent fans  around the league are counted.  </P> <P> So far, various experts have credited the Spurs' turnaround to David Robinson,  Larry Brown and-or Terry Cummings. Now former Spur Greg Anderson, who was  traded to Milwaukee with Alvin Robertson for Cummings, says Maurice Cheeks is  the difference.  </P> <P> "When Alvin and I were there, they never really had a point guard," Anderson  said. "They always had a 2-guard they tried to use as a point. That makes it  hard. Maurice is the difference for them."  </P> <P> Anderson, of course, was reluctant to credit Cummings. "I think if Alvin and I  were there, things would be about the same," Anderson sniffed.  </P> <P> Anyone interested in wasting money and time should immediately call  1-900-872-6847. For he rather lofty price of $1.49 a minute, you can hear the  hotline of Hornet guard Tyrone "Muggsy" Bogues -- "You know me," the tape  begins, "smallest guy in the NBA."  </P> <P> Wednesday, the hotline featured Muggsy talking about upcoming Hornets games,  taking a look at the NBA, some personal information, why things are going the  Hornets' way (?), whether Hornets fans should boo Kelly Tripucka, Muggsy's  reaction to Hornet GM Carl Scheer, who said the Hornets were "weak and limited"  at point guard, and information on a free trip to Hawaii. But a personal  favorite was the revelation by the 5-3 Bogues that the toughest guy in the NBA  for him to guard is 6-9 Magic Johnson. Thank you, Muggsy. That was money well  spent. And, by the way, for those who can't remember the number, simply dial  1-900-USA-MUGS.  </P> <P> Reports from Miami indicate that in a recent game, Park Avenue Pat Cummings,  the former Knick, completed a behind-the-back pass to a teammate for a layup.  That sounds about as appealing to watch as Refrigerator Perry attempting a  leaping high-five.  </P> <P> Magic guard Scott Skiles was a little dubious when a young fan recently  approached and asked Skiles to autograph a Scott Skiles poster. Skiles being  Skiles, he knew he didn't have a poster. The kid produced a poster of Michael  Jordan, who was dunking over a helpless Skiles. Skiles laughed and autographed  the poster. "I should have asked for royalties," he said.  </P></p>

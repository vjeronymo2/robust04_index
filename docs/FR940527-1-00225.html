			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;Changes in alternative price proxies for moveable equipment, although not as close as those for building and fixed equipment, are nevertheless nearly coincidental for much of the historical period (Table 3 and Figure 8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in our September 1, 1992 final rule, one basic criterion for accepting price proxies is public availability of documentation on data sources and methodology (57 FR 40018&hyph;40019). Despite repeated efforts, neither we nor Data Resources Inc. have been able to obtain documentation on the moveable price proxy recommended by ProPAC that explains how it is derived and what sampling frame and sampling error attach to the estimates. In the absence of such information we cannot adopt the ProPAC alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA's assumption is that prices for hospital moveable equipment change at about the same rate as general prices for all machinery and equipment. This assumption is justified in part by the fact that not all moveable equipment purchased by hospitals is medical equipment: it stands to reason that the prices for non-medical equipment purchased by hospitals would change at the same rate as prices for all machinery and equipment. To examine this assumption further, we measured the rate of change in the HCFA moveable price proxy relative to prices for medical equipment only by preparing a composite index of medical prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index (PPI) for two commodity categories_medical instruments/equipment and X-ray/electro-medical equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The two PPI commodity indexes were then merged using their respective PPI weights. Price change trends for the period for which information is available are shown in Table 3 and Figure 8 (Inset). Price changes for this index are not available for years prior to 1984. Annual price changes for medical equipment were less than the annual HCFA price proxy in all but the most recent 2 years and were about the same as the ProPAC price proxy in the last 2 years. The medical equipment price was substantially less than the ProPAC index for most of the historical period. We will continue to monitor trends in these indexes to ensure that appropriate price proxies are incorporated in the CIPI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Interest  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ProPAC has proposed to project annual interest rates to future periods and then to decide whether to allow an add-on to the Federal capital rate depending on the magnitude of the projection. ProPAC has presented no objective criteria for determining when an interest adjustment is appropriate. We previously noted that a single-year projection for interest rates is conceptually inappropriate since interest costs must be vintage-weighted. In addition to this conceptual problem, the ProPAC approach is impractical because future annual interest rates are volatile, vulnerable to unpredictable market forces, and subject to exogenous influences (such as Federal Reserve Board decisions) that are difficult to anticipate. Thus, any projection of future interest rates is likely to be inaccurate, resulting in underpayment or overpayment of the Federal capital rate relative to the capital-related expenses that the rate is supposed to compensate. The resulting uncertainty in payments under future Federal capital rates further complicates future capital expenditure decisions by hospitals. On the other hand, the projected HCFA CIPI interest component for the target year is the weighted average change over 22 years of interest rate history, of which 20 years experience is historical. The projected experience in the HCFA index for the most recent 2 years may be as inaccurate as any ProPAC projection, but any error will have minimal effects on Federal rates due to the appropriately weighted effect of the historical data in the HCFA CIPI. This stability in the interest rate component of the HCFA CIPI provides hospital planners with a degree of certainty about future Federal rate payments, other things remaining equal. Annual and weighted annual rates of change are compared in Table 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 4. The Composite HCFA CIPI  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Annual percentage changes in the historical and projected HCFA and ProPAC CIPIs differ markedly (Figure 9). The ProPAC CIPI is much more volatile than the HCFA CIPI in the historical period through 1993 because it has no vintage-weighted capital input price factors for depreciation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=2 --> BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d305 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=2 --> E:GRAPHICSEP27MY94.006 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=2 --> BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;C <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

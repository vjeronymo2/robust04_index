			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Frei reshuffles Chile cabinet after criticism After only six months in office, President Eduardo Frei of Chile has reshuffled his cabinet, promising a new 'urgency' to his government programme and an 'accelerated implementation of our priorities'. The move comes in response to criticism that the new administration has succumbed to inertia, and to suggestions that the president has failed to stamp his authority on government policy. The fresh appointments are, however, unlikely to change the general thrust of the administration's programme. 'My government has finished one phase and begun another,' said Mr Frei in announcing the changes on Tuesday. 'In the first phase, we have established our priorities. . . We now need to concentrate on the tasks of education, infrastructure and increasing production.' Prime casualty in the reshuffle was Mr German Correa, the Socialist interior minister, whose removal weakens the position of the Socialist party within the Christian Democrat-dominated coalition. Mr Correa was replaced by Christian Democrat Mr Carlos Figueroa, previously foreign minister, who is more closely aligned politically with the president. The sacking of Mr Correa - although partly offset by the appointment of fellow Socialist Jose Miguel Insulza - is likely to put some strain on party relations within the Concertacion coalition. Socialists, the second biggest force within the coalition, admitted they were 'very surprised' by a move they considered 'unjustified'. Another important casualty was Mr Ernesto Schiefelbein, minister of education, who was regarded as lacking the political astuteness to engineer much-needed reforms to the educational system. Mr Schiefelbein, an independent academic, had already lost the good will of teachers by failing to consult them over reform. Mr Sergio Molina, a Christian Democrat, takes over what is likely to become the high-profile education portfolio. President Frei has promised to devote far greater resources to the sector.</p>

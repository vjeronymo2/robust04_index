			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff correspondent Ma Ling (7456 3781): "Deng Xiaoping </F> on Zhang Baifa--"The Captain? He Will Do"]    [Text] In March 1990, six months before the Asian Games was  due to open in Beijing, the Asian Games Village then under  construction was taking shape. Deng Xiaoping, who had been  following the village and the entire games project with keen  interest, suggested a visit to the capital, stating also that he  did not want the tour to be guided by municipal leaders because  he was only a common person and an official-conducted tour would  not be appropriate. An idea flashed through the mind of his  secretary, who said: "Then let Zhang Baifa accompany you." At  that Deng Xiaoping said crisply and without hesitation: "The  captain? He will do."    We need to know that in 1958 Zhang Baifa, together with  others, had once briefed Deng Xiaoping on his work in the  capacity of a national model laborer and captain of an elite  worker contingent. On that occasion Deng stressed to them the  necessity of being versatile workers. The "captain" in Deng's  mind was naturally a memory from that occasion. However,  although Zhang Baifa has risen through the hierarchy to his  current position, he still retains the "demeanor of an ordinary  citizen," which was probably why Deng Xiaoping remarked that "he  will do."    Deng Xiaoping was also very much interested in Beijing's  architecture; and through his appreciation and concern for the  municipality's buildings, he came to understand Zhang Baifa  better. In 1979, Deng Xiaoping told Zhang Baifa and other people  on a tour of residential buildings on the Qianmen thoroughfare:  "The ceiling of each storey need not be too high. This is not  because I am short; if I am going to spend the same amount of  money, I would rather make the room bigger than increase its  headroom. There should also be a shower and other installations  for daily use."    Deng Xiaoping made another "foray" on 31 October 1993 to  take  a look at the municipality. "Captain" Zhang Baifa again acted  as an escort. The ordinary-looking minibus Deng Xiaoping and  his entourage traveled in crisscrossed Beijing's heavy traffic.  In the car were also his family and personal guards. Along the  way Zhang Baifa explained to Deng Xiaoping the capital's latest  buildings and talked with him on the level of moderate  prosperity people enjoyed.    During last year's autumn excursion to the capital, Deng  said  that he intended to invite the "captain" to accompany him on  another tour of the capital's latest modern shopping malls in  1994. Zhang Baifa is prepared for that.</p>

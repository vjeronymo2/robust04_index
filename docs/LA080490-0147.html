			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SURF GUITAR CZAR DICK DALE STILL WEARS THE CROWN AROUND HERE;  </P> <P> HE CAN BE UNEVEN, BUT HIS RAUCOUS PERFORMANCE AT THE COACH HOUSE THURSDAY  PROVES HE'S STILL ONE OF ORANGE COUNTY'S TRUE MUSICAL GEMS.  </P> <P> Talking to Dick Dale can sometimes leave one with the impression that, along  with creating surf music on the first day, the King of the Surf Guitar was also  responsible for the rest of creation. But for all his proclamations of having  taught Hendrix how to play, having single-handedly made the unknown sport of  surfing a national craze, ad infinitum, it's doubtful that Dale seriously  maintains any notions of deity.  </P> <P> Performing as tremendously as he did at the Coach House on Thursday, though, he  would be entirely justified in claiming the surf-god throne in any  self-respecting Valhalla. From the reverberated froth issuing from his aged  Fender equipment, Dale did indeed form a crashing universe of sound.  </P> <P> Since Dale has been an Orange County staple for decades (he recently moved to  the desert near Twentynine Palms but still performs here regularly), it's easy  to take him for granted, particularly when some of his performances are  godawful. As recently as a few months ago, he turned in a Coach House show that  was so offhanded and full of dead air that it recalled the Reno-revue-like Dale  shows of a decade ago.  </P> <P> Perhaps playing surf guitar is rather like surfing: Either you're riding atop  the wave or you're flailing around in the spume. On Thursday, Dale was in  perfect form, bringing all the power and elemental fury to his guitar playing  that made him a Southern California sensation 30 years ago.  </P> <P> Palpable might be the best word to describe his guitar work. From his  machine-gun staccato picking and upside-down left-handed way of playing --  making the bass strings particularly handy -- to his super-heavy strings (too  much for the "puny little fingers" of other players, he recently claimed),  splashy reverb effects and loud, heavy-duty Fender Showman amps (essentially  created for Dale's punishing attack), everything in Dale's arsenal aimed toward  making an overwhelming sound that one could most definitely feel.  </P> <P> Drawing inspiration from the sensation of catching a wave, Dale was a pioneer  in expanding the vocabulary of the guitar, and his mastery of the instrument  showed Thursday. Along with the incredible speed and precision of his picking  (which literally causes his picks to melt), he used his amped-up Stratocaster  to create amusical sounds -- deep, insane rumbles and high, keening wails  somewhere between a police siren and a pterodactyl shriek.  </P> <P> Dale performed with his "power trio" version of the Del-Tones, with longtime  drummer Steve Aschoff and bassist Ron Eglit of Orange County's Gyromatics. The  pair provided a muscular backing, with the alertness necessary to work with a  leader who often lurched without notice from one song to another. Dale may have  performed 29 selections; it was hard to tell with all the seamless segues.  </P> <P> Dale had his long black hair pulled back in a ponytail, avoiding the  unfortunate Morticia-meets-Uncle-Fester look he's affected at recent  performances. An audience of old fans, as well as kids who weren't even born  within 12 years of Dale's first Balboa twangings, crowded to dance in front of  the stage as he pummelled through such Del-Tone classics as "The Wedge," "Death  of a Gremmie," "The Long Ride," "Let's Go Trippin' " and "Miserlou."  </P> <P> On the rocking "Jessie Pearl," he played with his fretting hand angled above  the neck, like Jeff Healy's difficult technique. On that and his other vocal  numbers, he displayed a rough voice that sounded like Barry McGuire on the  morning after the "Eve of Destruction," but it got the job done. He also  delivered some surprisingly hot tenor-sax honking on the R&amp;B oldie "Cherry  Pie."  </P> <P> Dale was born in Beirut, and there's a good deal of Middle Eastern influence  mixed in with his California beach music. His speed picking is reminiscent of  oud playing, and his most melodic playing, as on "The Victor," is based on  Middle Eastern modalities.  </P> <P> As usual, Dale didn't work from a set list, and he wound up playing some  numbers twice. They were worth the reprise: After offering a hot double-picked  version of the Chantays' "Pipeline" early in the set, he repeated it near the  end but played it with a ferocity, speed and power that even the most  aggressive punk outfit couldn't have matched.  </P> <P> Dale is a true phenomenon, one of the few Orange County can boast of, and he  should be seen while he's still around. Like Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis,  his performances can be uneven and unpredictable, but -- also like them -- he's  an American originator, and there's no one else like him.  </P></p>

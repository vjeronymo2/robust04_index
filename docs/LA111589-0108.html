			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A TEST FOR YOUR VIEWS ON FITNESS  </P> <P> Are you a fitness buff? How much do you know about exercise -- what it will and  won't do for you? Here's a chance to test your views with those of some  experts.  </P> <P> 1) The more you exercise the healthier you'll be and the better your sex life  will be. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> 2) Those who start regular aerobic exercise programs usually stick with it  because they enjoy it so much. T( ) FALSE( )  </P> <P> 3) Most of your close friends, your lover or your spouse can be expected to  support your exercise program wholeheartedly. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> 4) There's a hormonal link between exercise and sexual desire. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> 5) Older people who exercise regularly have no better sex life than the couch  potatoes who don't. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> 6) There are no cases of people being addicted to exercise. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> 7) People in low-level jobs don't need exercise programs as much as executives  because they have less stress at work. T( ) F( )  </P> <P> Answers:  </P> <P> 1) False. There's a limit to everything, and moderation is the key. For both  men and women, extremely rigorous exercise diminishes sexual desire. If you  constantly exhaust yourself, you simply don't have the energy for sex.  </P> <P> 2) False. While most people seem to enjoy aerobic exercise, half of those who  start such a regimen drop out within the first six months.  </P> <P> 3) False. Surprisingly, this isn't always the case, according to psychologist  Kenneth Matheny who found that the inactive partner often sets up subtle  roadblocks or creates situations in which the partner must choose between the  relationship and exercise. Some friends, lovers and spouses are threatened by  exercisers' improved appearance and self-confidence.  </P> <P> 4) False. This hasn't been proven. Psychosocial factors are probably much more  important. When people feel better about themselves, when their self-esteem and  self-confidence grows, so does their libido.  </P> <P> 5) False. A study of swimmers conducted by anthropologist Phillip Whitten  revealed that those in their 60s were nearly as sexually active as those in  their 40s, and those in their 40s had intercourse about as often as those in  their 20s and 30s.  </P> <P> 6) False. Apparently, some people do become addicted to exercise, especially to  running. As with other addicts, they begin to use exercise as a way to escape  all their problems.  </P> <P> 7) False. They probably need exercise even more than high-level workers because  they have more stress on the job. Those who have less control at work seem to  suffer from stress more and may be more susceptible to heart disease as a  result.  </P></p>

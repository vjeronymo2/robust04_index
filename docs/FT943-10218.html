			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Storing nuclear waste The deep store route would involve gouging out caverns in the rock half a mile below the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. This store would be for intermediate-level waste. There are no current plans for a repository for high-level waste because it will be several decades before this waste is cool enough to store. Nirex, the industry-owned agency charged with the task, has just lodged an application with the local council to build a 'rock lab' - an experimental underground laboratory which, if successful, would enable construction of the repository itself to start in 1998-99, for completion in 2010. Yesterday's paper says, however, that money could be saved by delaying the store for 25 to 50 years until enough waste has been generated to fill it. The Pounds 1bn Nirex project would consist of a row of parallel chambers connected to the surface by a five-mile spiral access tunnel with a railway. The waste would be stored in special canisters and as the chambers were filled, they would be packed with cement and sealed for good. The store has been designed with a capacity of 400,000 cu m - enough for 50 years of waste materials. Its lifetime operating costs would be about Pounds 1bn.</p>

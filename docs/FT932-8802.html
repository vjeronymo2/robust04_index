			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Parmalat package to raise L427bn PARMALAT, the acquisitive Italian dairy products group, is raising L427bn (Dollars 290m) through a rights issue to buy out the controlling Tanzi family's minority stake in its main operating subsidiary and create funds for growth. The rights issue will be preceded by a share split which will reduce nominal value to L1,000 and raise the number of ordinary shares to 712m. Parmalat will then make a one-for-10 rights issue at L1,000 a share. Shareholders taking up their rights will be offered two free warrants for every six new shares subscribed. Each warrant will give holders the right to buy one new ordinary share at L1,000 between 1997 and 1999. About half the funds from the rights issue will be used to buy out the 22 per cent outstanding stake in the Parmalat operating company not held by Parmalat Finanziaria, the stock market-listed holding company. This stake is almost all held by members of the Tanzi family, which used to be the group's sole owner. Parmalat adopted a holding company structure in 1990, when it was restructured in its present form. The Tanzis gave up control of the parent company, but took a 51 per cent stake in Parmalat Finanziaria through the family's Coloniale holding company. The pricing formula for the acquisition of their stake is complex. However, the purchase will cost Parmalat Finanziaria an estimated L240bn. Meanwhile, the Tanzis will subscribe to the rights issue, with Coloniale buying just over 50 per cent of the shares on offer at a cost of L213.7bn. The remaining funds from the rights issue will be used to finance expansion. Parmalat has grown rapidly in recent years and this year expects sales to rise to about L2,800bn from L1,636bn in 1992. Although it has given no indication of imminent takeover targets, it is known to be bidding for the milk and tinned vegetable interests of the state-owned SME foods group currently being privatised.</p>

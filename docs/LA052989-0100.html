			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP WEEKEND;  </P> <P> NORTHERN BENEFIT, SOUTHERN COMFORT AND A ZYDECO STEW;  </P> <P> SUCCESSOR TO CLIFTON CHENIER REMAINS AT ISSUE AFTER SPICY CAJUN FESTIVAL  </P> <P> It's always tempting to scour the horizons of any musical genre for future  figureheads -- especially when the old leader has stepped out of the spotlight.  That's why any hot young metal band is met with a tag of "the next Zeppelin,"  reggae performers contend with the moniker of "the next Bob Marley" and  singer-songwriters continue to face the onus of being tabbed "the next Dylan."  </P> <P> In the world of zydeco -- the enticing, rhythmically effervescent branch of  Cajun music -- the throne that belonged for years to Clifton Chenier remains  vacant, though there is certainly no shortage of contenders for the crown.  </P> <P> So the drama at Saturday's opening half of the 3rd annual Los Angeles Cajun and  Zydeco Festival should have been the face-off between two of zydeco's  new-generation contenders.  </P> <P> In one corner was C.J. Chenier who, upon his father's death in 1987, was  bequeathed Clifton's accordion and his Red Hot Louisiana Band; in the other was  Nathan Williams, another favorite son from Lafayette, La., making his first  West Coast appearance.  </P> <P> The non-contest that unfolded pointed up the folly of searching for dramatics  at what is primarily a gigantic back-yard barbecue, an event where the spirit  in the dancing and the spiciness of the home-cooked jambalaya mattered most.  </P> <P> At the end of the show -- held as it was last year in the Olympic Velodrome at  Cal State Dominguez Hill -- it was neither Chenier nor Williams and his Zydeco  Cha-Chas band -- each of whom turned in thoroughly danceable though  unremarkable sets -- but the ever-dependable Beausoleil band that emerged as  pick of the litter.  </P> <P> This was because of Beausoleil's seamless fusing of traditional Cajun folk with  the more muscular zydeco, stitched together with threads of hot-jazz and  country-blues instrumental licks.  </P> <P> Those interested in crowning a new king of zydeco will have to keep looking --  or keep waiting, while Williams and Chenier undergo more seasoning.  </P> <P> Williams has received some glowing praise from Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural,  himself a front-runner as Clifton's spiritual successor. Indeed, he had plenty  of folks up and dancing at the front of the stage at one end of the unusual but  highly serviceable Velodrome setting.  </P> <P> But beneath his wide-brimmed cowboy hat and behind those impenetrable dark  sunglasses, whatever personality Williams may possess remained hidden. He has  an engaging voice that can summon up the grace of Jimmy Cliff's, though his  riff-heavy music (more of a bar-band-blues-reggae-R&amp;B stew than pure  zydeco) does not leave that voice much room to express itself.  </P> <P> Tellingly, near the end of his set, he offered Hank Williams' "Jambalaya" -- a  song with an unmistakeable melody -- and the energy level jumped with  Richter-scale force.  </P> <P> With his less-than-dynamic stage presence and accomplished-but-unspectacular  musicianship, Williams is more promising than impressive. But keep in mind that  he is still in his mid-20s; be prepared to reassess the evaluation when he has  a few more years under his accordion straps.  </P> <P> C.J. Chenier has grown markedly as an accordionist since strapping it on about  2 years ago, though he too suffered a charisma shortage in the always-difficult  outdoor, daytime setting. More disturbing, though, he succumbed to star-making  mannerisms you would expect from a Las Vegas lounge singer.  </P> <P> Introducing him while the Red Hot band played a number of its own, a band mate  hawked the crowd: "Are you ready for star time? Are you ready for show time?"  </P> <P> Like Williams, Chenier opted for pumped-up blues-boogie before turning to  zydeco. When he did take on the style that made his father's son famous, it was  with tempos that seemed accelerated artificially to generate more excitement.  </P> <P> Ironically, veteran Cajun fiddler Dewey Balfa outpunched the two upstarts in  his early-afternoon set, helped along with the addition of electric bass and  drums to his typically acoustic lineup. Balfa, looking like everyone's favorite  uncle with his white hair, pharmacist's spectacles, slight paunch and  beneficent, unassuming grin, subtly proved that some old dogs can indeed learn  new tricks. The new dogs should take notice.  </P> <P> As for the couple of thousand Cajun-zydeco fans who attended, most seemed  completely content to soak up the sun and suds, offer their own pagan dance  ritual around a watermelon and dance their soles away.  </P> <P> The lineup for Day 2 of the festival on Sunday was scheduled to include  headliner Queen Ida Guillory (who may prove that in the quest for someone to  fill Clifton's shoes, the best man for the job is a woman), the Louisiana Cajun  Trio and the Crawfish Wranglers, as well as return performances by Beausoleil,  Balfa and Nathan &amp; the Zydeco Cha-Chas.  </P></p>

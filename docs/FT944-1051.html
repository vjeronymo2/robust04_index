			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Observer: Shivering timbers Don't fancy John Olsen's chances of remaining at the helm of Cunard, Trafalgar House's ritzy shipping company. The bungled refit of Cunard's QE2, flagship of Britain's merchant navy, has tarnished the image of the world's greatest liner and also raised serious questions about the competence of Trafalgar House's new top team. It's no use blaming seasick plumbers for the delays. Refurbishing an elderly liner is just as tricky as renovating a stately home - you don't know what the problems are until you start taking it to bits. Cunard's original timetable was far too tight and its response to the inevitable public relations' crisis far too slow. The fiasco is particularly embarrassing for Trafalgar House, which wants to take over Northern Electric and which it says it can run more efficiently while encouraging an 'increasingly commercial culture'. Tell that to the QE2 passengers left behind. Nor has Nigel Rich, Trafalgar House's new chief executive, set much of an example. He didn't start work until mid-August - 10 months after being selected. Such a lengthy management hand-over may be acceptable in a smoothly functioning corporation - but not in a company with Trafalgar's problems. Olsen, an airline man who jetted in to Trafalgar House from Cathay Pacific after a brief stop-over at Dan Air, was one of the first board appointments made by Trafalgar House's new chairman, Simon Keswick. His new boys would be better advised to put their own house in order before they start telling others how to run a business.</p>

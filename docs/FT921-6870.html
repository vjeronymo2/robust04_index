			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Calls for interest rates cut THE Bank of Japan yesterday faced renewed calls for a cut in interest rates following the publication of a government report acknowledging a further deterioration in the state of the economy. The government's Economic Planning Agency dropped the word 'expansion' from its monthly report to the cabinet for the first time since the economic upturn in early 1987. Instead of saying that the economy was 'expanding at a slower pace' - the favourite phrase of recent months - the agency said the economic slow down was spreading to a wider range of sectors. The agency's report echoed recent commentaries by private sector economists who have almost all taken a more pessimistic view of the economy than the government. For the current financial year, ending next month, economists expect a growth rate of about 3.5 per cent against the government forecast of about 3.7 per cent. For next year, private sector predictions mostly range 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent against a government target of 3.5 per cent. Ruling party politicians, with an eye on an election to the Diet's (parliament's) upper house this summer, would like to see measures to stimulate growth, including further cuts in interest rates. Mr Kozo Watanabe, the minister for international trade and industry, yesterday called for a cut in the official discount rate to follow the last reduction in December when the ODR was reduced to 4.5 per cent. The central bank's position is that it is still examining the effects of the last reduction and of two previous cuts. However, pressure for further reductions grows almost daily, not least from industrialists anxious about weakening demand, particularly for capital goods.</p>

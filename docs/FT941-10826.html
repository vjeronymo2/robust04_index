			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / N Sea pipeline deal elusive The UK and Norway signalled yesterday that they are still some way from ratifying an agreement to extend use of the Frigg pipeline to transport additional North Sea gas to the UK. Mr Tim Eggar, UK energy minister, and Mr Jens Stoltenberg, his Norwegian counterpart, were unable to complete the negotiations, which have lasted for nearly two years. The Norwegians want to extend use of the pipeline, which already pipes gas from the Frigg field to Scotland, to cover other Norwegian fields. The UK wants the new agreement to cover wider issues of trade in oil and gas between the two countries. A number of major gas deals depend on successful completion of the negotiations, the largest involving National Power, the electricity generator, buying 2.2bn cu m of gas from GFU, Norway's gas negotiating committee. The deal would run over 15 years, starting in the mid-1990s. The two ministers said yesterday that they were committed to exploring further ways of reaching an agreement. But they warned that no conclusion of the talks was expected in the near future.</p>

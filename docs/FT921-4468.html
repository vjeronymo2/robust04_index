			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: Feeling blue and seeing red - In A Nutshell The Conservative Party is regarded as the party which would be best for business by just over half of small firms, according to a survey* by researchers at Kingston Polytechnic. The conservatives won the backing of 52 per cent of businesses, followed by Labour with just 11 per cent and the Liberal Democrats with 4 per cent. Despite the large conservative lead, the poll suggests a fall in conservative support compared with previous elections. In 1983, 71 per cent of people engaged in small-scale economic activity voted conservative. Asked about the banks, almost a quarter of businesses polled said relations had worsened during 1991 while 19 per cent said they had improved. The remainder thought relations had stayed the same. In 1990, more than 70 per cent said relations were good or satisfactory. The researchers first interviewed 350 small businesses in 1990, but by February 1992, 16 per cent had ceased to trade or were untraceable. *Small Business Survey.

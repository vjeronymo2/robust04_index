			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Thrashing out a high-tech funding policy: Louise Kehoe reports on a new US partnership FEELING their way towards a new collaborative relationship between government and industry, senior Clinton administration officials and Silicon Valley high-tech executives gathered in California last week for a 'Technology Summit'. This first-of-its-kind event 'could not have happened under any previous US administration,' said Mr Ronald Brown, the US commerce secretary. 'We have wasted three decades on ideological debate about the appropriate role of government (in commerce) while our international competitors figured that out a long time ago.' The emerging US flavour of industrial policy is, however, quite distinct from that in Europe and Asia, with their large-scale, government-directed technology projects. 'Technology is the engine of economic growth. It is the private sector that fuels the engine that pulls the train,' Mr Brown said. However, the US government had a new role to play by creating an environment for international competitiveness and priming the pumps with research funds aimed at accelerating development and commercialisation of promising, high-risk technologies likely to spur US growth. In the past, US government technology spending was primarily defined by military goals, said Mr Stephen Cohen, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, the influential think tank that organised the technology summit. 'In the post-Cold War era,' he said, 'the US faces the challenge of realigning government research and development spending to support economic goals.' About 41 per cent of the US government's Dollars 76bn research and development budget is spent on civilian or dual-use projects, with the majority going to defence-related research. President Bill Clinton aims to balance the research budget more evenly between defence and industry. 'We can no longer rely on serendipitous spin-offs from defence spending to spawn innovation in the commercial sector,' said Mr John Gibbons, the White House science and technology adviser. Yet even as US government spending on commercial research and development programmes is increasing, practical questions remain about how to implement this new 'partnership' between the US public and private sectors. 'As soon as you start shifting funds from defence research to commercially relevant projects, two questions arise,' said Mr John Young, retired chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. 'What are you going to fund, and who is going to be accountable? How are we going to measure results to ensure that the American people are getting good value?' The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is operating a programme of commercial research and development matching grants, will concentrate funding on strategic areas identified by industry groups, said Ms Arati Prabhaker, the institute's director. Last week, the institute disbursed most of its Dollars 68m funds to 29 companies and corporate alliances. Next year, the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) will have Dollars 200m to spend, and President Clinton aims to raise funding to Dollars 750m by 1997. Identifying areas of technology that will be critical to the future competitiveness of US high technology industries has not been difficult. Several industry groups have drawn up lists of technology areas they consider critical to competitiveness. Yet, in such fast changing fields, it may prove hard to ensure that the focus of government-funded research remains current and that government programmes keep pace with changing industry views, Mr Young warned. A big concern is that the ATP will become a high-tech pork barrel programme, says Ms Prabhaker. To avoid this, she is establishing a review system that mirrors the peer-review process of academic research. A committee of private sector experts will review grant proposals for technical and commercial feasibility. Other industry speakers at the summit expressed concern that the Clinton administration's efforts to move research spending closer to the commercial sector might disrupt the funding of university research. 'We have a university research system that is the envy of the world. Don't screw it up]' warned Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel, the big US semiconductor manufacturer. Despite their words of caution, industry executives were generally impressed with the new 'Tech Team' from Washington, who showed a thorough knowledge of industry issues. 'This is a far cry from the Bush administration that saw no difference between potato chips and computer chips,' one industry representative said.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Nadir theft charges rejected: Former Polly Peck chief faces 20 further counts A HIGH COURT judge yesterday dismissed 46 charges of theft, involving Pounds 119.5m, against Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit to electronics group. Mr Nadir, who was present at the hearing at Birmingham Crown Court, still faces a further 20 charges of theft and false accounting, involving some Pounds 30m. After the hearing, his solicitor, Mr Peter Lakin of Pannone March Pearson, the Manchester law firm, said Mr Nadir was delighted by the outcome. 'This is one of the best Monday mornings we have had for some time,' Mr Lakin said. Last night, the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the charges, said it was considering its position. Whether the charges were reinstated at a later date would depend on an appeal in another case on a similar point, a spokeswoman said. That case is due to be heard by the Law Lords in July. Yesterday's decision followed an application by Mr Nadir last month to have charges under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 dismissed. The charges alleged theft by transfer of funds from PPI's bank accounts to the account of a wholly owned subsidiary, Unipac, held at the National Westminster Bank in Jersey, or to the Midland International account of the Industrial Bank of Kibris, a bank in Northern Cyprus owned by Mr Nadir. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC for Mr Nadir said there was no evidence of any 'appropriation' of the funds as required under the terms of the Theft Act. He said there was no assumption by Mr Nadir of PPI's rights because, in transferring the assets to other bank accounts, Mr Nadir was doing something he was authorised to do. Mr Justice Tucker, the judge assigned to Mr Nadir's case, said there was no doubt that Mr Nadir was authorised by PPI to make transfers. However, the question was whether this authorisation was subject to the proviso that transfers had to be for the legitimate business purposes of PPI. The prosecution alleged Mr Nadir had no authority to transfer assets other than for legitimate business purposes and that the transfers to Unipac and IBK were fraudulent and dishonest. They alleged that Unipac and IBK were used as conduits for Mr Nadir's personal objectives. The judge said the prosecution's argument entailed the proposition that if Mr Nadir had changed his mind after transferring the assets and had applied them for the company's proper purposes he would still - his initial dishonest intention having been proved - have been guilty of theft. But that could not be right, the judge said. The transfers were merely preparatory acts. 'I take the view that no appropriation (or more accurately, misappropriation) took place when the defendant transferred the sums of money from the PPI bank account to the accounts of Unipac and IBK. 'But there is clear prima facie evidence that the withdrawal of assets from the Unipac and IBK accounts immediately afterwards was unauthorised and that there was an appropriation at that stage,' he said. The judge added that the wording of the charges might have been enough to cover this situation, but it was clear that the prosecution intended them to cover only the early stage of the transactions. Mr Nadir's trial is not expected to begin before March next year.</p>

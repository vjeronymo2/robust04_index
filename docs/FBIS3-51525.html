Robaina will  also meet with Cuban officials and doctors working in Namibia.  There are 64 Cuban health collaborators in Namibia, most of  whom are in Windhoek and surrounding areas. On 21 January,  Robaina will meet with President Sam Nujoma and Trade and  Industry Minister Hidipo Hamutenya. On 19 January, Foreign  Minister Robaina signed an agreement eliminating all visa  requirements for the citizens of the two countries.    On arrival in Windhoek, reporters asked Robaina about the  objectives of his tour of Africa. He told them that it is part  of a diplomatic offensive launched by Cuba. The foreign  minister added that the so-called Dark Continent is a priority  in this offensive because of the cultural and historic ties that  link Cuba to the area.</p>

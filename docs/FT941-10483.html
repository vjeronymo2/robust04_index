			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Asian markets fail to rebound Equity markets around the world responded positively to Monday's recovery on Wall Street, although the shock of Friday's 96-point drop in the Dow left most of them short of recouping their losses. In Asia and the Pacific Basin, none of Monday's big losers recovered much ground. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained just 0.35 per cent after Monday's 6.1 per cent slide. Thai equities rose 1.6 per cent after a 6.8 per cent drop, and their Malaysian counterparts by 1.3 per cent after a 4.6 per cent downswing the day before. In Japan, the Nikkei average, which lost only 1.4 per cent on Monday, recovered virtually all of that ground with a 1.2 per cent improvement. Japanese equities then showed further strength in London dealings, inspired by the government's economic stimulus package. Continental Europe's bourses started well, but slipped back after mild weakness in US equities in the American mid-morning. Rate cuts were rewarded by a new high in Belgium's Bel-20 index and, in anticipation, by an above-average 2.2 per cent gain in Norway. Wall Street started well but profit-taking was keeping a lid on the market by mid-session, amid further weakness in the bond market and lingering concern over the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy. European government bond markets failed to hold on to early gains after an indirect signal from the German Bundesbank that it had no immediate plans to lower German interest rates. Investors interpreted the central bank's decision to set its 14-day repurchase agreements at an unchanged fixed rate of 6 per cent as a sign that it was unlikely to cut interest rates before March. In the wake of the UK interest rate cut, other leading currencies took a back-seat. The dollar was slightly firmer against both the D-Mark and the Yen.

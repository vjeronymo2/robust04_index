			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Recovery plans are based upon a store of loyalty - The efforts of Upton &amp; Southern to return to its retailing roots and profits SIXTY YEARS OLD and now the newest store in town, trumpets the advertisement for Uptons department store in Redcar, which reopens its doors today after refurbishment. Uptons' canny shoppers will find the keenly-priced offers they expect. They may also notice a few things are missing, like the drips of rain which used to seep through the store's roof. Customers at the three Teesside department stores of Upton &amp; Southern Holdings have proved loyal through bad times. Last year the company reached near-bankruptcy with debts to the Bank of Scotland of Pounds 5.9m and a net asset deficiency of more than Pounds 1.7m. It was rescued by financial restructuring and management changes approved in January. These brought in Mr Jim Hodkinson, international development director at Kingfisher and past B&amp;Q deputy chairman and chief executive, and Mr Jeffrey Gould, a founder and later managing director of John Kent, who has nearly 30 years retail experience. The challenge now for Mr Hodkinson, non-executive chairman, and Mr Gould, chief executive, is to retain customer loyalty while raising margins, sharpening buying policies and wooing younger shoppers. 'We have a very solid client base, I'm very conscious of not losing what we've got,' says Mr Gould. The restructuring raised Pounds 1m in new equity. Mr Hodkinson and Mr Gould each put in Pounds 25,000. Debt was tackled by the sale for Pounds 3m and leaseback of Uptons main retail properties, the issue to the Bank of Scotland of 750,000 convertible Pounds 1 preference shares for Pounds 1.5m, and the granting of a five-year secured Pounds 800,000 loan. First priority was refocusing the business on its department stores in Middlesbrough, which is also its headquarters, Redcar and Stockton-on-Tees and extricating it from the loss-making property and other interests which stemmed from the 1986 merger of Uptons, a family business founded in 1869, and Southern and City Properties. 'The rationale at the time was that we had assets and not much profit and they had profit and not many assets. That came unstuck in a very big way,' says Mr John Upton, great grandson of Uptons founder and now managing director of the group's retail subsidiary, E Upton and Sons. Some property interests in the portfolio, which is spread nationally, have been sold this year. The rest will go when the time is right. The group's stake in a satellite tracking company is being disposed of, its shipbuilding investment has gone. Its Rotherham store and warehouse have been closed, the Teesside warehousing reorganised and six TV and audio shops, a 1980s acquisition, rationalised. The Teesside department stores' main customers are families of manual workers who are in employment and enjoy spending money while keeping a keen eye on prices. 'We aren't a discount operation, we're a value operation,' says Mr Gould. His new slogan is 'Uptons, always a better deal'. He and Mr Hodkinson are impressed by Teessiders' propensity to spend, despite high unemployment. 'It's a much tougher environment, but there's a lot of money up here,' says Mr Hodkinson. Even in Upton &amp; Southern's darkest days the stores showed a trading profit. Yet they too had suffered from lost focus. 'Because sales were very difficult to achieve they bought with a scatter gun,' says Mr Hodkinson. They were also overstocked. In February 1992 stock at cost totalled Pounds 1.85m. It is now Pounds 970,000. Mr Gould's target gross profit margin is 38 per cent, against 29.76 before his arrival. The stores are currently on 36 per cent. The product range is being nudged slightly upmarket, while keeping value as the prime objective. Mr Gould has initiated strong buying and financial controls, sourcing direct from manufacturers where possible to hold down prices. 'I've been very nervous not to create a perception that prices are going up,' he admits. Under-investment had left the stores looking shabby; the Redcar refit for a frugal Pounds 150,000 will be followed by Stockton and Middlesbrough next year. 'It's very much down to the detail in this business,' says Mr Hodkinson. After Kingfisher board meetings where the talk is in millions of pounds, he finds it salutary to get back to basics at Uptons. 'Jeffrey would be saying, this is going to cost us Pounds 467.50. In a big company you don't look at that detail enough.' Upton &amp; Southern's turnover in 1993-4 will be below Pounds 10m (Pounds 10.64m) because of shop closures but a return to profit is expected. The 1992-3 pre-tax loss was Pounds 635,426. While there is still some way to go, says Mr Gould, the company has been 'substantially turned around'. He and Mr Hodkinson are now seeking retail acquisitions for Uptons in the Midlands or North of England. But this time, they insist, expansion must strengthen Uptons focus, not dilute it.</p>

It has working sessions with officials of the State  Bank and the Commercial Bank of Vietnam during which the two  sides affirmed their determination to continue broadening their  cooperation and exchanging experience in the field of banking  activities in each country in order to effectively implement the  agreements between the two countries signed during Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to Cuba last year. Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet hailed the results of the two sides' working  sessions as a new manifestation of the friendly and cooperative  relations between the fraternal and reliable peoples of Cuba and  Vietnam. He said the friendship, cooperation and mutual  assistance between the two countries were elements of important  significance to the national construction and defence of each  country in that cause and would learn much from Cuba's valuable  experience.    Vice President O.F. Torres highly appreciated the  achievements recorded by the Vietnamese people in the renovation  process which he said would be an encouragement to the Cuban  people in its struggle to overcome immediate difficulties and  firmly safeguard its revolutionary gains in a new stage.    Yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet also  received  an Austrian trade mission led by Leopold Maderthaner, president  of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber, and representatives of  45 Austrian major companies who arrived here on Feb. 23. While  here, the Austrian mission compared notes with Doan Duy Thanh,  president of the Vietnam Commerce and Industry Chamber, and  other ministries and branches concerned on possibilities of  expansion of economic and commercial cooperation between the two  countries.    At this reception, Mr Maderthaner stressed that the  cooperation development between Austria and Vietnam was in the  right direction. Besides expanding trade ties, his country would  assist and cooperate with Vietnam in manufacture of machines in  service of agriculture and water resources, equipment for water  supply, and training personnel for economic management.    Mr. Maderthaner informed Prime Minister Kiet of his  government's decision to sponsor a seminar on economy to be held  in Vietnam and to finance a feasibility study in manufacturing  machines. Speaking to his guests, the Vietnamese prime minister  said that Vietnam welcomes and is ready to create favourable  conditions for Austrian businessmen to come to inquire into  possibilities and carry out investment projects in the interest  of the two countries.

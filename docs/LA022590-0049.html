			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX EDUCATION DEPENDS ON SPECIFICS  </P> <P> Dr. Neil Solomon's column on Jan. 26 was a demonstration of how physician  unresponsiveness contributes to the spread of the AIDS virus and other sexually  transmitted diseases (and pregnancies).  </P> <P> A writer asked Dr. Solomon for specifics on safe sex for a 14-year-old.  </P> <P> Instead of giving the information that was requested, he replied that  abstinence was appropriate and "a 14-year-old should not have to struggle with  the erroneous assumption that it's normal to have sex."  </P> <P> No information was given about condoms and spermicides. No referral was given  to a local AIDS agency. He merely added that adolescents "should know the facts  about sex, contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy." The  writer had complained about prior vague comments and requested specific advice.  None was given.  </P> <P> Instead, Dr. Solomon ignored the fact that some 14-year-olds do have sex.  Further, he confirmed that many physicians demonstrate no responsibility to  provide specific information on low risk sex for those who do decide to become  sexually active.  </P> <P> No wonder our teen-agers remain at high risk.  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SCHRAM, AIDS Committee, Los Angeles County Medical Assn.  </P></p>

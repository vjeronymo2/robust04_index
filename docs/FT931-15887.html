			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Actors behind the camera - Nigel Andrews tries out a new phenomenon, the laser disc / Video HAVE YOU the stomach for another technological revolution? These are trying times, I know. One audio-visual breakthrough treads on another's heels like shoppers at a January sale. Who could have foreseen that by 1993 the videocassette, once the wonder of the home-viewing age, would seem as old and demode as Aunt Edith's aspidistra? The new phenomenon is the laser disc. If you have not yet experienced these, you should know what you are missing. Their main advantages over cassettes are better picture quality, greater fidelity to original formats (Cinemascope, Panavision and Co) and larger possibilities to scan, search and study. Of the two types of disc on sale, CLV offers a basic range of improvements, including the division of movies into 'chapters' to aid scene or picture search. The more densely programmed CAV discs, though shorter in duration, allow the viewer to activate additional aids like subtitling and commentary. The prices of movies on disc are chilling but not prohibitive. Moderate treats like The Addams Family (Columbia TriStar) or Air America (Pioneer) will set you back Pounds 25 pounds, while all-singing all-dancing blockbusters - Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (Columbia TriStar), Lawrence Of Arabia (Columbia TriStar) and Terminator 2 (Pioneer) - come in at Pounds 35 pounds. The only Pounds 40 one is Kevin Costner's Dances With Wolves. But then if you are mad enough to like that calendar-art sermon on racial accord, you are probably mad enough to pay the price. I have not yet plunged into purchasing a disc-player. When not sallying forth to richer friends' homes, I do my viewing on the steam-powered VCR. Here one has a wider range of movies to choose from, including samples of that startling trend - thank you for the cue, Mr Costner - whereby actors are turning into directors. This month alone brings three films never before exposed on British screens: Diane Keaton's Wildflower (High Fliers), Arnold Schwarzenegger's Christmas In Connecticut (First Independent) and Lou Diamond Phillips's Ambition (Columbia TriStar). Phillips wrote, directed and stars in his film, as a would-be crime writer who employs a paroled murderer as research material. Minor but well-crafted. Schwarzenegger's offering originated as a TV special. Packed with slightly shopworn stars - Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson, Tony Curtis - it is festive-spirited enough to be viewed in the undemanding aftermath of Christmas. Of the three thespians turning directors, Keaton most looks as if she is going places. Having directed a kooky vox-pop documentary called Heaven, screened at Cannes some years ago, she grooms her talent further in Wildflower. Like Arnie's film, this was made for TV. But Keaton, also an acclaimed photographer, takes a threateningly mawkish tale about an epileptic girl (Rosanna Arquette) rescued from a brutal stepfather by two brothers and brings it alive with lighting and camera movement. Coming from a front-of-camera career, she also knows how to wake up actors. Arquette is superb, so is Beau Bridges as the boys' father. What else have we for you? Not a lot, I fear. The video industry assumes a state of paralysis in the wake of Yuletide and the New Year, so you must make do with such fare as Star Trek VI (CIC), Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (Braveworld) and Stop] Or My Mom Will Shoot (CIC). You might, though, try two well-penned films about showbiz. The Player (Fox), scripted by Michael Tolkin and directed by Robert Altman, is an exuberantly scurrilous portrait of Hollywood life. And Peter Bogdanovich's film of Michael Frayn's Noises Off, hated by those who had seen the play, was guffawed over by everyone who had not, including me. Happy new year.</p>

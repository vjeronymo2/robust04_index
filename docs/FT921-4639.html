			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Misery Index cheers Major The Misery Index, which adds the unemployment rate, expressed in percentage terms, to the rate of inflation, fell steadily last year, aided primarily by a fall in inflation from 9 per cent in January to 4.5 per cent in December 1991. The index is now on the rise as unemployment is growing. Some commentators view the Misery Index as a guide to the election prospects of the party in government. On this basis, the index bodes well for John Major, since despite being on the rise it is still lower than in June 1987, the time of the last election. Inflation then was 4.2 per cent and unemployment, 10.1 per cent.</p>

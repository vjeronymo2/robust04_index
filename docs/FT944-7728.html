			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting sustains recovery at OMV OMV, the Austrian integrated petroleum and chemicals group, reported a Sch123m (Dollars 11.2m) pre-tax profit in the third quarter, as its recovery from two years of losses continued, driven mainly by cost-cutting. The company recorded losses of Sch190m for the same period last year. Sales at the partially-privatised group rose 8.6 per cent to Sch21.07bn, reflecting 'slightly improved' overall market conditions. However, the exploration and production sector remained in loss due to low crude oil prices and a weak dollar. The directors said they remained confident the group would achieve a profit in the full year. The gas division was once again the largest contributor to earnings, with third-quarter pre-tax profit almost unchanged at Sch320m. Turnover was up 10 per cent to Sch1.74bn. The refining division saw its lowest margins since 1989, with sales down 1.5 per cent to Sch11.7bn, mainly because of lower prices for oil products. The division posted profit of Sch70m profit, 12.5 per cent lower than in the third quarter of 1993. Profit in the marketing division was down nearly 20 per cent to Sch130m.</p>

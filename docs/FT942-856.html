			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (9): Remarkable progress and transition / Profile of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin After 18 months in power, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin has succeeded in becoming the second most powerful man in the country and has remained the most elusive. The Russian premier, appointed in December 1992 when pressure from the then Congress of People's Deputies forced Mr Yegor Gaidar from his role as acting prime minister, has apparently changed greatly while appearing exactly the same. His first year was hard. He took over a cabinet which may have been shorn of Gaidar but still had many 'Gaidarites' in it, in the key economic posts, whose contacts with the western financial institutions and advisers were much better than his and whose distrust of him was manifest. These ministers still had the president's ear and were thus able at times to circumvent their ostensible boss. Moreover, he stumbled badly on his first appearance as prime minister - calling for price controls and then being forced to back down after an outcry from his own ministers. He was close to the powerful industrialists' lobby headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, and as a former chairman of the gas monopoly Gasprom and an energy minister in both the Soviet and Russian governments, he knew and shared many of their concerns. He clearly opposed many of the measures and proposals of his ministers - siding with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the Russian central bank, and protecting him from presidential dismissal in favour of Mr Boris Fyodorov, then finance minister; calling the privatisation programme akin to Stalinist collectivisation; and agreeing with Mr Gerashchenko to scrap pre-1993 banknotes in a currency reform which took place while Mr Fyodorov was out of the country and without his knowledge. It became accepted - since it was promulgated by the radicals and to a degree confirmed by the prime minister's actions - that he was at best a reluctant reformer, one whose instincts remained with Soviet industry and with at least a corporate if not a command economy. Uneasy before most audiences, he tended to reiterate the need for hard work as an antidote to the country's evils. It was the clash between the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet, culminating in the latter's suppression by force last October, which revealed how far Mr Chernomyrdin had succeeded in creating a position for himself independent of both Mr Yeltsin and his cabinet colleagues and with its own power and influence. He remained silent for some days after Mr Yeltsin banned the Supreme Soviet in September - then came out with an expression of solid support which clearly carried weight and which appeared to speak for a body of centrist opinion of the kind the radicals could not reach. Mr Chernomyrdin it was who went with Mr Yeltsin to the Ministry of Defence in the early hours of October 4 last year, after the pro-parliamentary forces had attacked the mayoral offices and the TV centre, to argue the generals into giving the order to their nearest troops to come to the defence of the capital - and of the executive power. Mr Yeltsin's own account - in his memoirs The View from the Kremlin - has Mr Chernomyrdin directly challenging the defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to take upon himself the responsibility of ordering in the tanks. Mr Yeltsin's appreciation of him is generous, befitting someone who has shown conspicuous loyalty to his president - 'the prime minister brought a refreshing note into the atmosphere of market reforms, which in fact continued. It was an accent on reliability, permanence, stability. . . The political pressure on the government lifted dramatically. . . The hard, authoritative prime minister created a bulwark for the president's policies, a second centre of power that cemented together all the different government groupings.' With the apparently unassailable support of the president behind him, Mr Chernomyrdin positioned himself well before the parliamentary elections last December. In contrast to many of his ministers - including Yegor Gaidar, by that time returned to the cabinet as his first deputy - he was not seeking office: instead he received the endorsements of a number of his cabinet members to continue as premier whoever won. When the result turned out to be a swing to the right and left extremes, with no one group in the ascendancy, Mr Chernomyrdin benefited hugely. The radicals, after a brief struggle, left the cabinet - with the sole exception of Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister. Mr Chernomyrdin, with his own choice as first deputy in Mr Oleg Soskovets, a similarly taciturn workaholic, had for the first time his own government. It was widely assumed he would bring in a different programme: after all, he had commented immediately following the election that there must be 'an end to market romanticism.' But what followed that remark was an extraordinary turnaround: to date, Mr Chernomyrdin has not only refrained from diluting the radicals' programme, he has actually advanced it - retaining a tight squeeze on credit, keeping down inflation, forcing the central bank to impose more discipline and keep real interest rates high, approving (in Russian conditions) a very tight budget with low expenditure on the military and protecting the remaining reformists in the government. This 'new' Mr Chernomyrdin - his supporters would say it was always there - took some time to be obvious, but impressed when it did. It was enough to convince Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to go to Moscow in March and after talks - and a hunting expedition - with the prime minister, to extend to his government a Dollars 1.5bn loan. In an article written for the Financial Times last month, Mr Chernomyrdin revealed himself not just as a man determined to carry on reforms, but as one who took pleasure from the commercialisation of the cities, privatisation of businesses, and the signs of enterprise among his fellow citizens. If he is still presenting a false reformist image, he is doing it very well, and keeping it up for a long time. He has clearly conceived a taste for the power he could not have expected would be his: and he may join the other combatants for the president's chair when it becomes vacant in two years time at the end of Mr Yeltsin's term. He does not enjoy high popularity ratings - he is too much associated with hard economic times - but he may be able to succeed to the rather tattered mantle of Yeltsin and pose as a centrist able to unite the nation. It has been a remarkable progress and a remarkable transition - and Mr Chernomyrdin appears to have a way to run yet.</p>

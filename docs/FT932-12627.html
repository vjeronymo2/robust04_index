			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / BASF plans new plant in Belgium BASF, the German chemicals group, is to build a new DM350m (Dollars 217m) acrylic acid plant in Antwerp, Belgium, in a move which may spell the end of one of the three similar facilities at its main base in Ludwigshafen. The new plant will have a capacity of 160,000 tonnes a year and is expected to start production in July 1995. BASF currently produces acrylic acid, used in paints, super-absorbers for hygiene products and sewage treatment, at three facilities in Ludwigshafen and one in Freeport in the US. The moves underline a growing tendency among German chemicals companies to try to counter structural disadvantages, most notably high domestic wage costs, by moving capacity out of the country, concentrating on further processing of base chemicals, or simply closing uneconomic capacity.</p>

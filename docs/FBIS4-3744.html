			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ye Jundong (0673 0193 2639)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou City  Copyrights Bureau destroyed in public 63,000 pirated compact  discs [CD's], laser discs, and video cassettes on 21 April.    According to an official in charge of the Guangdong  Provincial Copyrights Bureau, a joint campaign--launched by  local copyright bureaus in cooperation with public security,  industrial and commercial administration, press and publication  administration, radio and television, and cultural departments  -- targetting pirated CD's in Guangdong got underway at 1300 on  19 April. Thanks to careful preparations, the operation was  successful. According to incomplete statistics, as of 1200 on  20 April, 1,657 vendors across the province were inspected, and  140,000 illegal CDs, 1,322 illegal laser discs, and 85,000  illegal video cassettes were seized. The campaign was launched  with greater momentum in such prime target areas as Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In connection with the operation,  Guangzhou unfolded a city-wide campaign named "Action Week for  Implementing the Copyright Law and Protecting Intellectual  Property" on 19 April.    The official said: Since joining the "Berne Convention for  the Protection of Literary and Artistic works," the "Universal  Copyright Convention," and the "Convention for the Protection of  Phonograms," China has brought its copyright protection in line  with the international copyrights protection system. The  departments concerned in Guangdong take the protection of  intellectual property rights seriously. Last year they launched  six raids against illegal publications. They also unfolded a  concentrated campaign to crack down on illegal audio-visual  products toward the end of last year.    At present, localities in Guangdong are continuing the  crackdown in light of their respective local conditions.  Relevant provincial authorities are formulating a series of  measures to improve regular administration over the processing,  duplication, wholesale, and marketing of audio-visual products.  It has been learned that Guangdong will reorganize the 16 CD  manufacturers in the province and place them under the  jurisdiction of press and publication departments. The  provincial copyrights bureau has formulated procedures for  copyrights examination and registration in the manufacture of  CDs. In the future, a system of "certificate first and license  later" -- that is, an operation permit from relevant authorities  must be obtained before a business license can be issued--will  be introduced in the wholesaling and retailing of audio- visual  products. Customs will also crack down harder on smuggling of  audio-visual products to stop illegal products from entering  China.</p>

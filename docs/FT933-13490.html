			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Arts: Adam and Eve in the Garden of Lenin - Avignon Festival ONE OF the most interesting productions of this year's Avignon Festival, which continues until August 2, is a French version of Mikhail Bulgakov's play, Adam and Eve. It is performed in the courtyard of Sainte-Marthe Hospital by a company from Nancy Lorraine under their director, Charles Tordjman. The play was written in 1931 when Bulgakov, aged 40, supposedly still under the protection of Stalin, was having his work shelved by the various state theatre companies to which he was attached. Commissioned as a play about a future war, Adam and Eve was never produced during the author's lifetime. Seeing it more than half a century later, one can understand why. The play predicts the complete collapse of the communist system and looks to an era when co-operation with the West and shared scientific knowledge is the only road to survival. The piece begins conventionally enough in a communal apartment in Leningrad where a young engineer, Adam, is celebrating his marriage to Eve, a foreign language student. Their honeymoon proves short-lived, as the apartment is invaded by a distraught professor of chemistry, who is fleeing from a young thug who has set upon him in the street. He turns up too, and is soon joined by a fighter-pilot, who is a dedicated communist, and by a hack novelist. As they all quarrel angrily, it seems as if we are in for a comedy about shared domestic space under communism, one of Bulgakov's favourite themes. But there is a more sinister undertone: the scientist is behaving very oddly, even for an absent-minded professor. He carries a curious-looking camera with which he photographs the married couple, enveloping them in a sinister green glow, and he mutters incoherently about the danger of poison gas causing universal disaster. Puffing furiously at his cigarette, the French actor, Daniel Martin, captures brilliantly the attitude of a man forgetful of his present situation but deeply concerned about the long-term one. Hardly are the words out of his mouth, when what he has prophesised comes to pass. A wave of poison gas fumes - shades of Chernobyl] - sweeps across the city, then the entire country, and everyone - well, almost everyone - is destroyed. This catastrophe is represented on stage by an instant change of scene in which the apartment building collapses and we are confronted by one of the main shopping streets, strewn with rubble and corpses, wreathed in smoke. Luckily, Adam and Eve have survived to inhabit a world like that after Hiroshima, and so has the professor. His camera was really a secret weapon with which he could close up the cells of the body and make them impervious to the noxious gas. Thanks to a series of fortunate accidents, all the other main characters we met in the first act remain alive, if not exactly well. From here, the piece becomes an exploration of the strategy of survival, well acted all round, the company seizing the comedy as well as the pathos. I was reminded at times of Shaw and also of The Admirable Crichton, as the absent-minded professor turned into the strong man who keeps the group together and wins the love of the most earnest, feminist Eve (Aude Briant) during a sequence of stimulating discussions. I would have been content to leave it there, with Eve replacing the professor's dog, who has been killed in the holocaust, as his love object, and the professor replacing Adam as hers - a conclusion prefiguring Bulgakov's major novel, The Master and the Margarita. But the director seemed to think that the work needed updating and encouraged the translator, Bernard Noel, who does a fine job in that role, to write an epilogue that was performed immediately after the author's text. Here, the maid, who died, is reincarnated as the professor's animal friend (an idea borrowed from Bulgakov's satirical story, Heart of a Dog). This seemed an unnecessary extra course to the meal. Without it, the evening was complete and admirably adventurous, much in line with the general policy of Bernard Faivre d'Arcier, who has been reappointed as the Festival's artistic director in succession to Alain Crombecque. D'Arcier believes that the Festival should take the initiative in promoting productions that extend the boundaries of theatre and dance as art-forms. In a period of tightening purse-strings for the Festival, he has set aside a fund of FFr3m for this purpose. Other efforts in this direction include a collaboration between a number of groups from all over the world, including Britain, under the heading Dark/Noir. They are all to be seen in the Aubanel Gymnasium, where presentations at different levels of the building explore the world from the point of view of the sightless and the partially sighted. As Michel Reilhac, the overall director of the project, explains, the audience is deprived of the tyranny of sight - blind people act as guides at one stage - in order that it may achieve a renewed mastery over its perceptions. Also running throughout the whole Festival is a tour de force in the Cloister of the Carmelites, by Philippe Caubert, who worked with Ariane Mnouchkine for a number of years, telling the story of his life in fictional form on stage as Le Roman d'un Acteur through improvised dialogue and exaggerated mime. Thus, in spite of a falling number of visitors, a wobbly franc and an aggressive mistral, the Avignon Festival still flourishes as it moves inexorably towards its 50th birthday.</p>

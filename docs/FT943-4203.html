			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Rumours spur Sao Paulo Brazil Sao Paulo closed 5.68 per cent higher, propelled by rumours that a new opinion poll expected later that day would show Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the ruling party candidate, maintaining his lead in the presidential race. The Bovespa index of the 55 most active shares added 2,834 at 52,721 and turnover totalled RDollars 355.3m (Dollars 404.2m). Brokers reported only slow foreign activity, saying that most deals were concentrated in day-trade operations by domestic investors. Foreigners, they added, were staying on the sidelines, waiting for new presidential election developments. Mexico Shares continued the rally that began late on Tuesday, after the two weeks of declines which had followed the elections on August 21. The IPC index finished 23.24, or 0.85 per cent, up at 2,762.16. At the end of 1993 the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Traders said local investors warmed to the upward movement of Mexican blue chips on Wall Street.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SDC: "Netherlands Air Force Trains for </F> Attacks on Bosnia"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] The Hague, 9 Feb (ANP) -- F-16 pilots from the  Netherlands Air Force are to begin exercises -- with real bombs  -- on Monday [7 February] on the island of Vlieland for two  weeks. The pilots will soon be serving over Bosnia.    During the exercises, the pilots will drop a total of 30  500-  pound bombs. Beginning on 1 April the pilots will be flying out  of the Villafranca base in Italy for missions over Bosnia.    The NATO operation over Bosnia is intended to maintain the  no- fly zone over the war zone by giving air support to the UN  ground troops and, perhaps, by carrying out air strikes. These  kinds of offensive actions will be the subject of in-depth talks  today and Wednesday within NATO as a means of breaking the siege  of Sarajevo.    Regular exercises with real bombs are very controversial for  the population of the islands of Vlieland and Texel due to the  noise and damage to the environment and houses. For that  reason, the Defense Ministry has decided that the exercises will  be restricted to just half an hour twice a day and not at all on  the weekends. On both islands there are measuring posts for  establishing the noise and vibrations caused by the explosions.  If there is demonstrable damage then the exercise is suspended.  The same also happens if weather conditions are unfavorable.</p>

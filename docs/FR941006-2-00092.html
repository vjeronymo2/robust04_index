(PECo, the licensees), is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;44, which authorizes operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2. The license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now and hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBAPS, Unit 2, facility consists of a boiling water reactor located in York County, Pennsylvania. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its letter dated May 13, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the Commission's regulations. The subject exemption is from a requirement in Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 that a set of three Type A tests (Containment Integrated Leak Rate Tests (CILRTs)) be performed, at approximately equal intervals, during each 10-year service period. The exemption applies to the second 10-year service period; subsequent service periods are not changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The type A test is defined in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section II.F, as ``tests intended to measure the primary reactor containment overall integrated leakage rate (1) After the containment has been completed and is ready for operation, and (2) at periodic intervals thereafter.'' The 10-year service period begins with the inservice date. The request for a one-time exemption would allow an extension of the second 10-year Type A service period and would allow the performance of the three Type A tests in the second 10-year service period at intervals that are not approximately equal. It does not affect the third 10-year service period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, would require performing a Type A test during Unit 2's refueling outage 10 scheduled for September 1994 in order to comply with the requirement to perform three Type A tests within the current 10-year service period. Furthermore, 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, would also require a Type A test to be performed during the next refueling outage (Unit 2 refueling outage 11 scheduled for September 1996) in order to coincide with the end of the current 10-year plant inservice inspection (ISI) interval. The current 10-year ISI period ends in November 1997 and current ISI inspections are scheduled for September 1996. Therefore, to fully comply with Appendix J, the licensee would have to perform CILRTs during the tenth and eleventh refueling outages for Unit 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee stated that the first and second CILRTs of the set of three tests for the second 10-year service period for PBAPS were conducted in February 1989 and April 1991. Thus, the first CILRT testing interval of the second 10-year service period was approximately 44 months, and the second CILRT testing interval was approximately 27 months. The time interval between CILRTs should be about 40 months based on performing three such tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period. The third of the second set of three CILRTs will be scheduled for Refueling Outage 11, projected to start in September 1996, pending approval of the exemption request. Issuance of this exemption would allow the extension of the second 10-year service period such that the next CILRT would be performed during Refueling Outage 11, approximately 66 months after the April 1991 CILRT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee performed a review of the history of the PBAPS Unit 2 CILRT results to evaluate the risk of activity-based and time-based degradation. This review identified only one activity-based component failure detected during past CILRTs. The measured mass point and total time leakage rates measured for the June 1985 CILRT stabilized at approximately 0.70% wt/day, which failed to meet the TS and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J criterion of less than 0.375% wt/day (0.75 La). Following the completion of repairs, the CILRT was repeated with an as-left leakage of 0.0156% wt/day. After this failure, the licensee modified the plant so that a similar failure, in the future, would be detected by a local leak rate test (LLRT). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

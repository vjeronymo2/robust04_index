			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland in receivership as debts total Pounds 17m Swithland Group, the new and used car dealership, has shocked the City by going into receivership with debts of about Pounds 17m less than two weeks since it failed to float on the Stock Exchange. Directors of the Leicester-based company had forecast in the prospectus pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.69m shortly before the October 31 year-end. The last audited accounts available, provided up to June 30 this year, were unqualified by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Shares were priced at 81p each and had the float gone ahead the company would have been valued at about Pounds 21m. The placing, sponsored by Ionian Corporate Finance and not underwritten, attracted some adverse press comment. Ionian, a small City firm, said: 'We were shocked when we were informed that receivers had been appointed.' City concern about Swithland, where the first 50 of 330 employees have been made redundant, appeared to increase following reports about its brushes with the Office of Fair Trading on questions of consumer credit regulation and other matters. But institutions were also said to have been worried by net cash outflows before financing in 1990, 1992 and the eight months to June 30 as well as increase in debtors. A pre-financing net cash outflow of Pounds 3.16m is recorded for the eight months ended June 30. The issue lapsed when brokers to the placing, Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks, were unable to place an agreed minimum of 48 per cent of 18.5m shares, or 67 per cent of the 26.4m total share capital, by November 12. The receiver, Mr Myles Halley, an accountant with KPMG in Leicester, said he had been appointed on Thursday afternoon with the agreement of all its financial backers which include Lloyds Bank, County NatWest and the Bank of Wales. He said: 'Following on so soon from a possible flotation, a company going into receivership means secured and unsecured creditors will require a full investigation to be completed on how the company ended up in receivership in such a short period of time.' He added that the company had been 'very highly geared' and that following the failure to float, creditors had experienced a 'major loss of confidence' and increased pressure on the company. He said it was difficult to assess the precise extent of the company's liabilities accurately but these were roughly Pounds 17m. In the prospectus net secured debt was put at Pounds 12m on September 24. The receivers are offering all 16 sites for sale.</p>

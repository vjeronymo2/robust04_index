			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bombay tax row near end A DISPUTE between Bombay stock brokers and the Indian income tax department which halted trading on big bourses for three days is on the verge of resolution. The tax authorities agreed yesterday after extended talks over two days to unfreeze parcels of shares issued by nine companies, including Reliance Industries and ACC, the country's largest cement producer. Tax inspectors last month froze dealings in the share parcels during an investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal. The Bombay Stock Exchange, which accounts for two-thirds of trading in India, was closed after brokers went on strike on Wednesday in protest at the disruptive effect of the investigation. Last year's scandal erupted when evidence emerged that money was being illegally siphoned out of banks into the stock market. Resumption of normal trading on Monday will depend on fulfilment of legal formalities. The scandal cases are being heard by a special court, which has to give permission for trading in the stock involved. Mr AN Kolhatkar, executive director of the exchange, said there would be no hitch in restarting trading once the special court granted permission.</p>

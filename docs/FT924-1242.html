			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Short Bros in link with French airframes group SHORT BROTHERS, the Belfast aerospace company owned by Bombardier of Canada, yesterday forged a strategic alliance with Hurel-Dubois of France to develop, produce and market engine nacelles to aircraft and aero-engine manufacturers. The companies have formed a jointly-owned company called International Nacelle Systems (INS), which will be based in Paris. The alliance, which the two companies say will strengthen significantly their position in the nacelle market, reflects the increasing trend of international collaboration and concentration in the aerospace industry. This trend is expected to intensify as the industry continues to restructure itself in the face of the post cold war decline in the defence sector and the recession in the civil aircraft sector. Shorts has already collaborated closely with Hurel-Dubois, a manufacturer of lightweight airframe structures as well as nacelles and engine thrust reversers controlled by the French Compagnie de Navigation Mixte conglomerate.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FERGUSON BACKS CABLE OPERATORS IN BATTLE AGAINST TAX INCREASES  </P> <P> Assemblymen Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has taken up the cause of cable TV  operators, calling on colleagues in the state Legislature to "move immediately  to quash" industry tax increases imposed this year by Orange County Assessor  Bradley L. Jacobs.  </P> <P> In a news release circulated Thursday by a public relations consultant for  cable operators, Ferguson criticized Jacobs for "attempting to make an end run  around Proposition 13." On Wednesday, county officials criticized cable  representatives for privately lobbying county supervisors in an attempt to  enlist them in their campaign against Jacobs.  </P> <P> Outraged by recent tax increases of as much as 400%,  </P> <P> cable operators have launched an expensive campaign -- running full-page  newspaper advertisements and threatening to sue the county -- over a new  assessment method used this year by Jacobs. Orange County is one of several  jurisdictions around the state to now take into account a cable operator's  intangible assets, such as the value of an exclusive franchise, in computing  its tax bill.  </P> <P> Ferguson could not be reached for comment Thursday. But according to his  statement, he will try to tack a rider on some pending bill that would prevent  an assessor from applying such a method to cable operators and other businesses  that have not been taxed this way in the past.  </P> <P> "It's the consumer who subscribes to cable services who will actually end up  paying for this gigantic tax increase," Ferguson said in the statement. "Unless  we act now, counties up and down the state will pounce on this, and the  consumer will suffer a new form of taxation."  </P> <P> Jacobs could not be reached for comment, but Deputy Assessor Ronald G. Cooper  dismissed the criticism that his office is violating Proposition 13.  </P> <P> "If, in fact, what we're doing is wrong under existing law, why is new  legislation needed to stop it?" Cooper asked rhetorically. Cooper said the  higher cable assessments simply reflect higher market values more accurately.  </P> <P> "When Orange County real estate that used to sell for $100,000 is selling at  $250,000, the assessments are going to go up," Cooper said. "When the market  changes such that properties become two or three or four times more valuable,  the assessments are going to go up."  </P> <P> Cooper said earlier this week that Jacobs' office has received about 50 letters  that are overwhelmingly "anti-cable." But on Thursday, Cooper refused to make  the letters public.  </P> <P> Ferguson's support of the cable operators "was something that caught us by  surprise," said Harvey Englander, a public relations consultant representing  the cable firms. "Obviously, we're extremely pleased."  </P> <P> Englander said while he and other cable representatives have met individually  with county supervisors over the past two weeks, no one in the Orange County  group ever discussed the issue with Ferguson.  </P> <P> Englander said he received the written announcement from Ferguson's office  earlier this week and decided to circulate it Thursday, after two supervisors  criticized the cable operators' lobbying attempts.  </P> <P> In a series of private meetings over the past two weeks, cable industry  officials told the supervisors they plan to sue Jacobs and urged them to  question the assessor before entering what they predict will be a protracted  legal battle that could prove costly to taxpayers.  </P></p>

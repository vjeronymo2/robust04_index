			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE IGNORES CALL FOR BOYCOTTING CONVENTION CENTER  </P> <P> The National Urban League will ignore a local black activist's call for a  boycott of San Diego and hold its 1992 national convention in the San Diego  Convention Center, a spokeswoman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The prominent black organization is reserving the right to change its plans  between now and its July, 1992, annual meeting, but "at the present time, our  plans are to hold our convention in San Diego as scheduled," said Janet  Stewart, an Urban League spokeswoman in New York.  </P> <P> The decision appeared to be a blow to the Rev. George Stevens' call for a  boycott of the city and the convention center in the wake of the San Diego  Unified Port District commissioners' Feb. 21 refusal to name the $160-million  bayfront edifice for the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> However, an 85,000-member black fraternity has agreed to withdraw San Diego  from consideration for its 1993 annual convention as a direct result of  Stevens' call for a boycott. The organization, Kappa Alpha Psi, holds an annual  national meeting that attracts about 5,000 people, said Randall Bacon, its  immediate past president.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is that San Diego is just not giving appropriate consideration to  (a tribute) in memory of Dr. King," said Bacon, a Los Angeles city official who  until four months ago was a deputy chief administrative officer for San Diego  County.  </P> <P> Bacon said the group's Western region will vote this month to nominate Seattle  instead of San Diego for the 1993 national convention. That year's convention  is likely to be held in a Western city, he said.  </P> <P> Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) launched his "Tell a Friend"  campaign the day after the Port District vote, urging people not to vacation or  book conventions here until the convention center is named for King. He  appeared on radio talk shows in several cities and contacted the Urban League  about boycotting San Diego. However, no other San Diego black leader has  publicly joined the effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Bookings Canceled  </P> <P> None of the 344 organizations with conventions tentatively or definitively  scheduled for the convention center from 1990 through 2012 has canceled because  of Stevens' call for a boycott. Only one organization has a formal contract,  which is usually signed within 12 months of the date desired.  </P> <P> The Port District declined to vote on the tribute to King, instead deciding to  convert the building's bayfront terrace into an "Avenue of Honors," whose first  inductee would be the slain civil rights leader.  </P> <P> That decision must now be reviewed by the San  </P> <P> Diego City Council, which had supported the name change. Rudy Cervantes, an  aide to Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said the Port District's suggestion probably  will come before the full council during the third week in April. Both panels  must agree on a tribute for it to become official.  </P> <P> Stevens termed the Urban League decision "unfortunate," but said his campaign  has attracted the support of the fraternity and the Unitarian Universalist  Assn., along with local minority groups, which he declined to name.  </P> <P> "I think that's unfortunate, because (the Urban League) of all people should be  sympathetic to the problem that we're having in San Diego, and, as a national  Afro-American organization, they should be supportive even when others are not  supportive."  </P> <P> Erv Miller, a member of the board of trustees of the Unitarian Universalist  Assn., said his 200,000-member organization has a policy forbidding conventions  anywhere that discrimination is evident based on race, age, gender, disability  or "affectional orientation."  </P> <P> "I can't say for sure that they would not go there, but I know they would look  very carefully at something like that," Miller said from Rochester, Minn.  Miller said he was contacted by his daughter, who he said is a Bates staff  member. She was not available for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> Al Reese, spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau,  welcomed the Urban League's commitment, which he estimated will mean $3.78  million in income to the city. Stewart said that convention will draw 4,000  delegates from across the United States and 12,000 others who would be on hand  for daily events.  </P> <P> "We are, of course, glad that they will be coming here," Reese said. "We put  quite a little effort into getting them to bring the convention here, so we're  naturally glad that they're going to be coming."  </P> <P> San Diego City Councilman Wes Pratt, who opposes an economic boycott, also  endorsed the Urban League's decision.  </P> <P> "I think San Diego has to come to grips with the fact that it should provide an  appropriate tribute to Dr. King, but an economic boycott only exacerbates an  already difficult situation," Pratt said.  </P> <P> However, Pratt said the Urban League decision should not be viewed "as an  indication that it's all right not to name the convention center" for Dr. King,  noting that plans for national conventions are made years in advance and are  difficult to cancel.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 26 (XINHUA) -- More and more Chinese  university students are now taking part-time jobs to earn extra  pocket money and to test their wings in the larger social arena.    In Tianjin, the north China's biggest industrial city, the  number of college students who have taken part-time jobs is  estimated at more than 50 percent.    Many of the students are likely to take part-time jobs on  campus, as laboratory and library assistants or as tutors,  receptionists, door keepers and porters.    Tan Huijun, a senior student of the Management Department of  Nankai University, has netted a monthly pay of 100 yuan offering  a daily two-hour service at a roller-skating court. Wei  Shangfeng, a sophomore of the Thermal Energy Department of the  Tianjin University, gets a monthly pay of 50 yuan by doing  cleaning in the campus.    A student affairs official with Tianjin University said  great  changes have taken place among today's students. More and more  students believe that they should try their best to support  themselves through their own labor, he said, adding that they  are not willing to rely on their parents entirely.    To encourage students to work hard on their subjects while  taking part-time jobs, the authorities of Tianjin universities  and colleges have formulated relevant regulations governing  part-time work.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Observer: Red carpet for the poor The only sort of tourists most cities seem to go out of their way to welcome are rich ones. But Paris, to its honour, is bucking the trend. The city hall, ministry of tourism and holiday operators are gearing up to welcome at least a million impoverished east Europeans over the next few weeks. Having been taken aback 12 months ago when the lifting of visa restrictions suddenly brought a huge influx, especially of Czechs and Poles, they're determined not to be caught again. Being too poor to afford hotels and restaurants, many of last year's eastern visitors ended up sleeping and grabbing the odd meal in vans and buses. On some August days, more than 1,200 such vehicles from various sources were parked in central Paris, often hampering access to the most popular sites. Other visitors, still poorer, just pitched a tent wherever they could. As a result, Mayor Jacques Chirac complained to the head of the Paris police about hundreds of illegal campers regularly staying by the Eiffel tower. To help those arriving this time, the city tourism office is ready to hand out lists of cheap hotels, restaurants and camp-sites specially printed in Hungarian and Russian as well as Polish, Czech and Slovak. It has also produced 10,000 Paris guides in the last three of those languages for distribution to tour operators in the east. True, the expected 1992 influx is unlikely to have much to spend either. Nor, even without them, would France go short of its vital tourist trade. In all, visitors last year almost matched the country's 56.5m population - there were 52m of them, nearly a sixth of them going to Paris. But the city is looking ahead. If east Europeans see a red carpet awaiting them as they are now, it believes, they'll return when they're richer in future years.</p>

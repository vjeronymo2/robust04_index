			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Bulgaria attempts to bridge credibility gap: The country's new government will have to reassure the west THREE weeks after his resignation triggered the collapse of Bulgaria's first post-communist government, Mr Philip Dimitrov, the outgoing prime minister, has been asked by President Zhelyu Zhelev to try to form another government. A rapid end to the government crisis now seems likely, an outcome which would be much welcomed by the western banks and institutions for whom the crisis meant unwanted delays for Bulgarian plans to re-negotiate its Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.9bn) foreign debt, arrange a new loan from the International Monetary fund and sign an association agreement with the European Community. Mr Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the country's leading political movement, is trying to form a new coalition, including the party representing ethnic Turks. One of its main aims will be to reassure Bulgarians and western financial institutions that reform is still on track. Mr Ivan Kostov, the finance minister, returned from Frankfurt earlier this month with the news that debt rescheduling talks with the 300 commercial banks, which hold more than 80 per cent of the country's debt, had progressed in spite of western concern over the political situation. For Mr Kostov's team, the political crisis came at a sensitive time. The former socialist government which succeeded communist dictator Todor Zhivkov had broken previous commitments by declaring a debt moratorium in March 1990. But in September, Bulgaria resumed partial repayment of interest on its debt, hoping to re-open a dialogue with the country's creditors. Bulgaria also hoped to sign its first three-year extended agreement with the IMF next month, following two standby arrangements. Progress on both fronts depends largely on the formation of a credible government in Sofia. Hopes remain high because, with IMF and World Bank support, Bulgaria has already implemented successful monetary reforms. Inflation has dropped from more than 400 per cent in 1991 to 61 per cent so far this year. Before the present crisis, the leva, the national currency, had stabilised while the central bank's base rate has dropped from over 60 per cent to 41 per cent in the past six months. Foreign reserves have risen from virtually zero to around Dollars 1bn. An IMF agreement and resolution of the debt problem are crucial for further progress. The country needs foreign financing to undertake structural reforms and privatisation. Industry, which is still more than 90 per cent state-owned, has registered a 60 per cent drop in output since 1989, while the country lacks an infrastructure capable of servicing a market economy. So far Bulgaria, a small Balkan country of 8.5m, has attracted little foreign investment and no significant inflow of private capital is expected until the country repairs its relationship with western financiers. The UDF's main political rivals, the Socialist (reformed communist) party, and the Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF), the ethnic Turk party, do not question the need for reform. But they criticise the UDF, the country's first non-communist rulers in 45 years, for what they perceive as a haphazard approach to structural reform. They believe that one year of UDF rule produced few positive results but many social costs, notably unemployment, which affects over 12 per cent of the workforce and is still rising. The MRF, which represents the country's 1m ethnic Turks, the country's poorest social group, cited social concerns for withdrawing its support from the last government. The MRF has only 10 per cent of the seats in parliament but holds the balance between the UDF and the Socialist party, which are almost evenly matched. The two parties also criticise the UDF for its confrontational style. The UDF's anti-communism has led it to attack the old power elite, but, in some cases, the party has appointed supporters to key positions with scant regard for professional ability. In addition, the UDF has not communicated its policies clearly enough, leading the UDF into conflict with many of its original backers within the trade unions, the church, the fledgling private sector and even Bulgaria's president, Mr Zhelev. 'The former government had coherent strategies but the country did not always know about them,' says Mr John Wilton, the World Bank's resident representative. Mr Zhelev, a former dissident, says: 'The UDF made political mistakes which led it into conflict with civil society. Rather than rallying the country's resources, it repulsed them.' In spite of these shortcomings, however, the UDF is expected to form a new government with the ethnic Turks, largely because the Socialists are unwilling to take over. The party has purged itself and supports market-led reform, but says it does not have enough support in the country to govern. At the same time, no group wants fresh elections, believing that another political shake-up would only delay reform against the popular will. 'Dissatisfaction in the country is not caused by reform but by reform being carried out too slowly,' says the president. Mr Zhelev believes the way out of Bulgaria's current difficulties is for the UDF to adopt a policy of 'national reconciliation'. He stresses the importance of internal unity, given the war in the neighbouring former Yugoslav republics and fears that Bulgaria will be drawn into the conflict. The Bulgarian business community believes that the country's proximity to the fighting has already been enough to deter some potential investors. There are also fears in Sofia that any prolongation of the current political problems would be a further blow to the country's credibility.</p>

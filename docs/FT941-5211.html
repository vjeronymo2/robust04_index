			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Seaside break or whale watching at Cape Cod - Saga holidays Four decades ago, a Kent hotelier called Mr Sidney De Haan decided the way to fill rooms in the off-season was to offer cheap holidays to retired people. From this idea grew Saga, a group with a turnover in 1992-93 of Pounds 130m, offering holidays, financial services and magazines to the over-60s. Saga understood that the special needs of older customers could be a market opportunity rather than a deterrent. Other hoteliers also struggled in the off-season and they were prepared to offer Saga cheap rates for the package holidays it began to sell. On the customer side, no one was looking at what retired people needed on holiday. They did not want to climb steep hills to get to their hotels and they wanted someone to carry their suitcases. Mr Roger De Haan, the founder's son, started out in the business carrying older guests' luggage to their rooms at his father's hotel. He is now chairman of the company. Retired people are far wealthier than when the company started, he says. They are also more experienced travellers. Saga still offers one-week holidays at UK seaside resorts for as little as Pounds 100. But it also now sells trekking holidays in the foothills of the Himalayas, whale watching from Cape Cod and round-the-world cruises. Its most expensive round the world trips sell for Pounds 30,000. Saga has a holiday business in the US, as well as the UK. American over-60s are richer than their UK counterparts and prefer to stay in hotels whose names they know, such as Hilton and Holiday Inn. Older British travellers prefer local hotels, Mr De Haan says. The group tried to offer Australian over-60s similar holidays, but that venture failed. The Australian population is too small to support a mass senior travellers' business. Northern Europe is a better prospect, Mr De Haan says. Saga is in discussions which could lead to it offering its services on the Continent. Saga's offerings now include financial services as well. It acts as an insurance broker, finding motor, home and health insurance for the over-60s. It is not often realised older people are a lower risk for insurers, Mr De Haan says. They drive fewer miles and have fewer accidents. Because they are at home more, they are less likely to be burgled. And when they make insurance claims, they are usually more honest than young people, he says. About half the 750 staff at the group's Folkstone's headquarters now work on the financial services side. Recession has had little effect on business. A more serious threat is low interest rates, hitting the bank and building society income of retired people. Saga says sales of its low-cost UK holidays have been most affected. The over-60s who go on expensive trips around the world still appear to have money to spend.</p>

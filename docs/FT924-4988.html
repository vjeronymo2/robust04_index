			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Gardening: How to turn prose into a good mulch - A new textbook for gardening makes grandiose claims. Robin Lane Fox finds one good use for it EVERY SO often, gardeners sneak off to a work of reference. It may be a good nurseryman's catalogue; it may be an informative issue of Gardening Which? or the excellent volumes from Reader's Digest, published in the 1970s. In my case, it is usually an earth-stained title by Arthur Hellyer, of which my favourite is his small Pocket Guide, published under the aegis of Amateur Gardening. This year, we have another choice: the Royal Horticultural Society's Encyclopaedia of Gardening (Pounds 29.95, Dorling Kindersley). The editor is Christopher Brickell, a director of Royal Horticultural gardens at Wisley, Surrey. If I say that the many contributors include Hellyer, the alpinist Jack Elliott, the tireless Roy Cheek and the rosarian Michael Gibson, you will see that the enterprise is heavily armoured. The publishers clearly believe that this is a knock-out blow. 'For amateur and professional alike,' they tell us, it is 'the one and only practical guide you'll ever need to own . . . all you need to know about every facet of practical gardening . . .' It is the encyclopaedia to end all encyclopaedia. But on the shelves my old and trusted guides are still smiling. The new encyclopaedia has a wet layer of eco-speak, nouns piled up like adjectives, gaps, inconsequential bossiness and photographic oddities. In the old days, Amateur Gardening was a magazine written in good English; societies of specialist gardeners had members who knew how to use words. Recently, I nodded with pleasure when the king of our travel writers, Norman Lewis, recalled that his short list of formative reading included the bulletins of the Alpine Garden Society. This encyclopaedia is horribly written. Nouns are strung together like birdscarers on a line of polythene; trees are 'design elements'; we are not designing gardens or views, but we are 'designing with bulbs' or 'designing with trees'. One of the main features - which the editor might call a design consideration - is called Creating The Garden. Where Genesis was reticent, the RHS jumps in. It tells us to be 'creative', an idiotic word: heaven help us if we choose the wrong 'cultivar'. After hard days in the flowerbed, I sometimes picture the Young Cultivar, riding south in some Border Botanical Ballad with universal pansies knotted in his locks of chopped bark. Do readers and gardeners have to flannel around with this awful word, invented by botanists who had problems about classification? The encyclopaedia has more than 3,000 photographs and I must say how much I have enjoyed them. 'High brick wall supports magnificent purple swathe of a clematis', but the wall is at Sissinghurst, Kent, (unacknowledged) and so I happen to know that the clematis is the sky blue perle d'Azur and is only purple because this ultimate encyclopaedia has printed a photograph which is over-exposed. 'A mature rambler rose in full, glorious bloom', transforms a 'trelliswork arbour' but I happen to recognise the arbour because it is my eldest brother's (unacknowledged) and so I know that the rose is actually New Dawn. When 'designing with trees', we are told to avoid flowering prunus if we want to underplant it: at the bottom of the page, the photo and caption applaud an 'informal walkway' of flowering cherries which 'draw attention up and away from the borders which will in turn fill out and become the centre of interest as the blossom fades.' What are we to believe: text or photograph? Sometimes, neither. We are shown how an upright conifer forms a 'tableau' beside the blazing red leaves on a tree in late autumn: 'richly coloured rose blooms' complement the 'golden tones of gravel' I'm glad I did not pose for the snap showing how to dig with a straight back. Many of the photographs and almost all the sketches of suggested colour schemes have the look which appeal to the management at Wisley, but not to the great amateur gardeners whom history will remember for their artistry. 'To display dwarf conifers to their best advantage, add heathers to the planting scheme for bright splashes of year-round colour.' If this encyclopaedia is all we need, it ought to mention more things which we need most in the 1990s. Protection in winter is discussed and illustrated, but there is no mention of Fibre Fleece at this point, although this water-permeable blanket has changed the game for amateurs. 'Whether it is a pot, tub or windowbox, any container is a potential focal point in the garden', but why is there not a word about water-retaining crystals which have transformed the 'maintenance consideration' of these popular features? Throughout, there runs a seam of airy bossiness. The section on vegetables is the best and some (not all) of the basic techniques are clearly illustrated and described. However, about a fifth of this book is a painful statement of the obvious, often in the passive voice, leading up to cheery imperatives which command the self-evident. 'Tulips and daffodils are highly valued for the bold splashes of colour they bring to the garden in spring.' Or 'containerised trees are long term features, so use containers that are durable and attractive.' Some suggestions seem odd. We are invited to plant a honeysuckle up a Clematis armandii, although honeysuckle will try to throttle it; we are advised to plant mixed hedges of different species but 'species used must have similar rates of growth if over-vigorous species are not to dominate.' Why not tell us which species grow at a similar rate? I am tempted to quote the ultimate encyclopaedia on cottage gardens, but the section on Restoring Old Historic Gardens seems more apt for authors or readers who fear they may need no other book. 'If renovating or restoring an old and historic garden the work will vary widely . . . as well as surveying the site and assessing the condition of the main features (see 'Appraising the site' page 15) try to research the history and development of the garden . . . clearing paths, steps and other hard elements may also be helpful . . . unusual plants may have survived such as rhododendron cultivars . . . if trees are diseased or dangerous they should be removed (see 'Cutting down a tree' page 45) . . . lawns and other turfed areas may not be beyond restoration. . . .' To be fair, this modern reference book does omit one valued technique: shredding the experts. If the creative aspect sections are disbound, waxed paper can be laid horizontally on bare earth surfaces with fixatives and will decompose as a mulch alternative to chopped bark (see 'Mulches as Weed suppressants' page 574). You never know: your cultivars might love it.</p>

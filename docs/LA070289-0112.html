			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTAL GUIDANCE;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS TEAM UP IN NAME OF EDUCATION  </P> <P> Maria Ruvalcaba believes in a good education for her children. But as a working  mother raising a family in San Ysidro, that belief has often been hard to put  into action, especially after her oldest son, Miguel, dropped out of high  school temporarily a couple of years back.  </P> <P> So despite her minimal free time, Ruvalcaba said yes to Frank and Margarita  Vargas, who also live in the 400-unit Villa Nueva apartment complex, when they  approached her almost two years ago for help in organizing ways to motivate the  project's many children to study harder and consider college.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids here don't have enough space (in the apartments) to study, and  many parents don't have a high level of education to be able to help with  homework," Ruvalcaba said in explaining why she joined with other adults  recruited by the Vargases. "The kids need a place to study, to have people they  can ask questions of on homework."  </P> <P> Today, the parents of Villa Nueva can point proudly to a special study lounge  -- nicely carpeted and with tables, chairs, a computer and wall maps -- set up  in the complex's community center as a result of numerous fund-raisers and  volunteer work.  </P> <P> Their group, the Pro-Education Coalition, has established ties with local  school administrators and San Diego State University students and officials,  who provide tutors, equipment and counseling for the children, both to improve  their secondary school performance and to cajole them into thinking about  higher education.  </P> <P> And on Friday, the parents announced their first scholarships, presenting $150  awards to eight students at a special ceremony and banquet. Included among the  recipients was Miguel Ruvalcaba, who, after returning to high school, graduated  last month and will attend Southwestern College in September.  </P> <P> "This is a terrific project and it has really blossomed," said George  Hutchinson, director of student outreach at SDSU, a department whose programs  encourage minority students to go to college. "The fact that parents and  students have organized where they live makes a big difference . . . and by us  setting up shop in the complex rather than just doing it at a school, it is a  real expansion of traditional outreach."  </P> <P> Hutchinson learned of Villa Nueva's efforts by chance during a meeting with  educators in the South Bay over how to reach more students.  </P> <P> "It impressed me that San Diego State came to us, responding to the initiative  of the parents," said Father John Blethen, director of social services at Villa  Nueva. (The 19-year-old complex is owned and operated by the Catholic  Augustinian order, which also operates St. Augustine High School in San Diego.)  </P> <P> "We've been delighted to see the grass-roots activity of the parents. . . . The  successes, while perhaps still small, result from their own work and  enthusiasm, and not from anyone patronizing them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents Often Intimidated  </P> <P> John Gugerty, principal of San Ysidro Middle School -- which is attended by  almost all of the junior-high age students in Villa Nueva -- said the idea of  taking outreach to the complex makes it easier to involve parents. Too often,  parents fail to come to school-based programs, partly because many work during  school hours and partly because many -- especially if new to the United States  -- feel intimidated, he said.  </P> <P> "San Diego State has made a major commitment to work in the community with its  people," Gugerty said, "whereas so often you have people come in and come out,  who you can't get hold of a week later for follow-up information or to be  available later to talk with parents."  </P> <P> Both Gugerty and the parents reserve special praise for Ernesto Corrales, a San  Ysidro-born graduate of SDSU who now works as a counselor at the community's  mental health clinic. Corrales lived at Villa Nueva when it was first built,  and he graduated from nearby Southwest High School.  </P> <P> Corrales has arranged for regular tutors, works with parents on new programs  such as summer field trips, and spends a lot of time buttonholing students with  information about how they can attend college.  </P> <P> "He really talks to us about education," said Pancho Salazar, a Villa Nueva  resident entering his senior year at Mar Vista High, who concedes that he has  been less than enthusiastic at times about school. "He's shown me all the  courses in auto mechanics I can take at Southwestern, and even took me there to  visit. . . . My parents are telling me, 'Finish high school!' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Energized Our Staff'  </P> <P> "Corrales has energized our staff (at the middle school) as well," Gugerty  said. "Four times a year now, our teachers get together with those at the high  school level, they tell us how our graduates have been doing, and we talk about  new students we are sending up, doing more than just sending up test scores.  </P> <P> "And to show how the overall relationship has been building, we put together  some money, along with Montgomery High, this year for some scholarships to  students, one of whom was a former San Ysidro Middle School graduate."  </P> <P> But everyone gives the major credit to the cadre of Villa Nueva parents who  stuck together in the beginning when things looked bleak.  </P> <P> "We had a number of meetings at the start but there was a lot of apathy," Frank  Vargas said. "A lot of things sound great, but in practice they are very, very  hard to carry out."  </P> <P> About 10 parents stayed active, Vargas said, and gradually the contacts with  SDSU brought computers, counselors and support for the study room.  </P> <P> "We see peer pressure all the time on kids to do bad, but now we'd like to use  some of that pressure for them to do well. . . . That's part of the reason  behind the scholarships."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proven Popular  </P> <P> "I want our young people to be helped, not to lose school but stick with it and  maybe someday have something for themselves," said Fidel Arce, who, along with  his wife, Maria, is among the original nucleus of parents who planned dances,  food sales and car washes to raise funds.  </P> <P> The study center has proven so popular that its use has been divided into two  time periods: a 3:30-5 p.m. session for elementary school students, and a 5-8  p.m. session for secondary and college students.  </P> <P> "My dad has been very active, and I heard about the center through him," said  Imelda Jaramillo, a graduate of Chula Vista High who plans to attend  Southwestern this fall, along with her brother Mario.  </P> <P> Griselda Villa Nueva will be a ninth-grader at Mar Vista High in the fall.  Already, she has benefited from being tutored in reading and math by Claudia  Alvarez, a San Diego State senior engineering major who also grew up in San  Ysidro.  </P> <P> Both Raquel Marquez, a Mar Vista graduate attending Southwestern, and Ricardo  Sepulveda, a Montgomery High graduate who will enter SDSU this fall, have  helped younger students at the center.  </P> <P> "The parents asked me to come, and at first I didn't want to . . . but now I  see how much it can help the kids, and at 3:30 they are at the door, waiting  for us to open the room," Marquez said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breaking Stereotypes  </P> <P> Sepulveda said the parents have spurred San Ysidro students such as himself to  motivate each other to graduate and go on to college, a sentiment strongly  echoed by Miguel Ruvalcaba.  </P> <P> "I want to break stereotypes," Ruvalcaba said. "Some of my friends have asked  me why I am doing so well now , and maybe my experience can help inspire  others. But there are others who don't want to change, too."  </P> <P> The program is always in need of more tutors. Alvarez has received a part-time  job at TRW in Rancho Bernardo and will be leaving the program soon. Many  children still are hesitant to use the study room, Corrales said, because they  don't believe deep down that education will benefit them.  </P> <P> "Some still think they can drop out and still get a decent living by working in  construction," Corrales said. "They don't yet understand the benefits overall  to having a good education."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Father Blethen is optimistic. "When we opened Villa Nueva, only  three or four kids went beyond high school at all, just a handful. Now the  numbers have grown tremendously."  </P> <P> Hutchinson said that SDSU is now considering requests from other housing  projects in San Ysidro and Southeast San Diego for assistance similar to that  given Villa Nueva. Ruvalcaba said that students from other apartment complexes  occasionally come to Villa Nueva's study center for tutoring.  </P> <P> "I want to create a network to help anyone with the willingness to do what the  parents are doing there," Hutchinson said.  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades three Japanese banks MOODY'S Investor Service yesterday lowered the senior debt ratings of three Japanese trust banks, Mitsubishi Trust, Sumitomo Trust and Toyo Trust, and placed under review the rating of a fourth, Yasuda Trust and Banking. It said that Japanese trust banks were under 'greater than average pressures' from financial liberalisation in Japan, and suggested that the banks' exposure to real estate developers is 'significant.' Mitsubishi Trust and Sumitomo Trust were downgraded from A1 to Aa2, while Toyo Trust was downgraded from A1 to Aa3, because, the agency said, the banks' trust activities are 'vulnerable both to intensifying competition and to a volatile market'. The agency said that the three banks' capital adequacy ratios could fall, but emphasised that all three 'remain strong' and have 'a loyal base of customers'. Moodys also downgraded the senior debt ratings of the banks guaranteed subsidiaries, Mitsubishi Trust Finance (Asia), Mitsubishi Trust Australia, Sumitomo Trust Finance (HK) and Toyo Trust (Australia). Yasuda Trusts' A1 rating was placed under review, the agency said, because of a slowdown in 'earnings momentum' and 'banks' vulnerability to deterioration in the domestic and overseas real estate markets'. Japanese trust banks reported significant losses on stock holdings with the plunge in the Tokyo market last year, and were hurt by the surge in interest rates and a weak bond market. The leading trust banks are expected to report 50 per cent falls in operating profit in the year to end March.</p>

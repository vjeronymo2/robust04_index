			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Errors in tax codings Many employees are getting wrong tax codings because of changes to car and personal benefits, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue, said this week that mistakes were made in 9 per cent of all dealings with pay-as-you-earn employees. About 15m codes are being sent out compared with 8m last year, mainly because of the restriction of the married couple's allowance to 20 per cent instead of the taxpayer's marginal rate. The allowance is Pounds 1,720 for those under 65 and, from April 6, it will be worth only Pounds 344 instead of Pounds 430 to a basic-rate taxpayer, or Pounds 688 to a higher-rate payer. The most common coding problems are: Company cars. The system for assessing benefits will change from April 6 but Andrew Shaw, tax partner at City accountant Kingston Smith, says: 'All the codes I have seen so far have used the old 1993/94 scale benefit.' The new scheme will be based on the original list price of the car instead of scale charges. The Revenue says that if the word 'new' in brackets does not appear, it is probable the old system has been used. Cars more than four years old in 1994/95 qualify for a one-third reduction in the taxable benefit but, often, this is not reflected in the codes. The married couple's allowance. The only way the Paye system can deal with this year's change is to restrict the allowance, according to Martin Donn, of chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg. 'The Revenue has had to guess whether an individual will be paying tax for 1994/95 at 20, 25 or 40 per cent in order to include the correct 'allowance restriction',' he says. 'Very strange numbers have been appearing in coding notices as a result.' Under or overpayment of tax. The Revenue will adjust codes to reflect either case. Often, this can often lead to errors. 'Other' benefits. Shaw says deductions for 1994/95 are based on 1992/93 benefits provided by the employer but these have changed in many cases.</p>

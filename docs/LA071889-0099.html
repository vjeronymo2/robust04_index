			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY DEALS SETBACK TO MARKETS  </P> <P> The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Monday decided to allow two  futures-type financial instruments to be traded outside organized exchanges,  dealing a setback for the futures industry based in Chicago.  </P> <P> In a ruling sought by many banks and businesses, the agency that regulates the  nation's futures exchanges voted to exclude the burgeoning, billion-dollar swap  markets from its control.  </P> <P> And, in a defeat for the exchanges, the commission cleared the way for firms to  issue directly to the public some over-the-counter instruments that resemble  options.  </P> <P> The commission approved a statement saying swap transactions will not be  regulated as futures or commodity options.  </P></p>

Gavrileva, in Kiev and </F> Simferopol; date not given: "I See Three Moves Ahead...."]    [Text] Kiev-Simferopol -- The president of Ukraine has not  paid an official visit to the Republic of Crimea for quite some  time, and it is not often that Crimean journalists are in Kiev,  and it is even less often that they are received by the top  leader of the state. Half an hour had been allotted for the  interview with KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA, and not a minute more, but  the conversation with the president lasted 45 minutes and was  broken off on account of his tight schedule. We regard this as a  sign of the Ukrainian leadership's special attention to Crimean  problems.    [Gavrileva] Several years ago Ukraine opted for the path of  the building of its own statehood based on the national idea.  But nationalism has always led either to war or to  destitution--there is no other way. Ukraine has managed to take  the less painful second path. But it is time to extricate  ourselves from the destitution also....    [Kravchuk] It is an illusion that things are going badly for  Ukraine because it is pursuing some national policy: Things are  going badly for everyone, and this is natural; I would like this  understood. There has been no instance in history of the  collapse of one system and the building of another occurring  simultaneously with an increase in production and economic  prosperity.    It is not a question of Kravchuk's national policy here, but  of the difficulty of this transition. I put down to our  credit--not that of myself, but of all of us--the fact that with  such difficulties, such a structure, and such a character of our  state, we are tackling all questions in peace. We must all  extricate ourselves from the destitution, this including Russia,  which is the point of yearning for Crimea, where the illusion  has been created that, should it become a part of Russia, things  would immediately be easier for everyone.    But we watch Ostankino (even if doctored): Production there  is coming to a halt, wages have not been paid for three months,  and in the heartland there is simply nothing other than  potatoes--what, then, is the issue? Russia is a most wealthy  state selling timber, oil, and gas, and we purchase these! So  the judgments and the speculation on this basis should not be so  superficial.    I understand Crimea's gravitation toward Russia, but it is  not all of Crimea that aspires to this, which the voting showed,  incidentally. Some 1.8 million Russians--it was they, by and  large, who voted for such a policy. But others also live in  Crimea: 600,000 Ukrainians, 250,000 Crimean Tatars; God willing,  this will come to nearly 1 million. Crimea cannot be perceived  as uniform and as supporting only the policy that has been  proposed by its present leadership.    Russia has its interests in Crimea, and it will not renounce  them, but let us see how to adjust and mate these interests. If  some politicians from Crimea believe that it is possible to  cross over to Russia immediately by having learned the opinion  of part of the population, this is a profound delusion. This is  a subject for discussion by the whole Ukrainian people: When a  divorce is under way, it is not only the wishes of one party in  a family that are taken into consideration. Somebody holding  someone back is not the issue here. Go ahead! The husband, if he  is noble, leaves the refrigerator, the bed, the land, the house,  and walks away. We do not object.    What kind of policy is Russia pursuing today? We in the  upper echelons of power, they say, will not interfere but will  with the middle strata (the deputies and such) inflame the  situation, and then Crimea will itself by the revolutionary  path, creating tension within, gradually, given certain  political circumstances, come over to Russia.    Ukraine's strategy: We say that we will not consent to any  negotiations concerning borders, territorial integrity, or  sovereignty. And the world is backing us at this time--I say  this without exaggeration. The UN Security Council's response to  Russia's Sevastopol decision is a clear example of this. In  addition, Yeltsin and I signed the corresponding agreement. The  Europeans do not understand what is happening here. Surely we  understand that it is impossible today to carve up borders--the  holy of holies, the pillars of European security! This is why we  say: It cannot be done!    But considering the special status, history, and population  of Crimea, we agree to grant it economic independence just as  far as this is possible--but with the political status quo!  These are not just words. Yu. Meshkov was sitting next to me,  and we reached an agreement: The budget--let us do as you wish,  let us balance its revenue and expenditure sides. Everything  will now depend on actual work. If Crimea takes care of its  revenue side itself, it will look after all its expenditures;  we, on the other hand, will help the Crimean Tatar population....    [Gavrileva] In what way?    [Kravchuk] We will allocate additional money from the  Ukrainian budget. You will have complete economic freedom,  complete independence.    [Gavrileva] We have a new deputy prime minister.... What is  being decided, incidentally, on the question of his citizenship?    [Kravchuk] It will be resolved, this is not a problem....    [Gavrileva] What do you think, what that is new will Ye.  Saburov bring to the development of Crimea's economy and the  relations of Kiev and Simferopol?    [Kravchuk] From what I have heard and read, I understand  that  he is a rational person capable of seeing the goal. He is  capable of a great deal and probably understands that he can do  nothing without Ukraine.    One simple thing needs to be understood: There is in the  world one state--Ukraine--and no one knows of such a state as  Crimea. Neither the president nor the prime minister of any  European state will ever meet either with Meshkov or with  Saburov. If problems are to be resolved with the aid of the  attraction of foreign capital (and they will not otherwise be  resolved today), this can be done only via Ukraine, of which  Crimea is a part, and we are prepared for this, and I will do  everything to ensure that this be done.    But on one condition: Let us get down to business. If there  are to be referenda, slogans--to whom does Crimea belong--it  will be difficult for us. I do not wish to discuss political  questions in respect to Crimea today, therefore, I wish to  discuss only economic matters--and here I will even go above and  beyond the limit.    [Gavrileva] The following question is appropriate here: What  is your attitude toward a possible ruble zone in Crimea?    [Kravchuk] Only a person who (excuse me, I do not wish to  give offense) who has not on these matters made a thorough study  of everything or who has been misinformed could talk about this.  There cannot be two currency zones in one state. Note the  independent state of Belarus (and the leadership of Crimea  favors Crimea as an independent state--this is, I believe, the  main goal? Drift toward Russia is the second stage).    I am an economist by education, and for this reason I say  that unless it has its own currency, no state can exist  independently, this is precluded. Belarus is moving into the  ruble zone, but Russia has set the condition of conversion of  the Belorusian bank into a branch of the Russian bank, and we  know under whose jurisdiction a branch comes! So why deceive the  Crimeans?    Very well, let us assume that there is to be the ruble in  Crimea. But who will supply it? Russia? The ruble is a material  value. How many rubles would Crimea need, add it up? Would  Russia supply them?    Very well, let us assume even this: Crimea has the ruble.  But  it is an open border, and the ruble is of greater value than the  karbovanets, and tomorrow these rubles would be in Kherson and  Nikolayev and would reach Kiev--in any event, they would be  laundered from Crimea like lightning. And would Russia agree to  Ukraine pumping rubles via Crimea? Would Ukraine here want to  convert its state bank into a branch of the Russian bank and to  have all political and economic problems decided in Moscow, not  in Kiev and Simferopol?    People are unaware of these details. It is said that people  would come on vacation here and spend rubles. But would there be  that many of these rubles? People would immediately come to  Crimea from all the adjacent oblasts and sell the vacationers  products that are not available in Crimea and would take away  these rubles, and Crimea would get nothing. These are elementary  axioms. How much is a health center pass?    [Gavrileva] A lot. Millions.    [Kravchuk] And who would come? Working people? Crimea would  become a Mecca for the rich. And what kind of price list would  there be in the stores, what kind of exchange rate? This is all  based on childish naivete.    [Gavrileva] Leonid Makarovich, do you have a strategy for  the  development of the economy in Ukraine? The title "open economy  regime" has at least crystallized out in Crimea (it is not  entirely clear what this means, it is true), but Ukraine does  not have even this....    [Kravchuk] Stop at the stores on Kreshchatik, look at the  choice of items. A year ago, when Mr. Kuchma was in charge, so  to speak, the stores were absolutely bare. Now they are full--no  money.    [Gavrileva] This is abnormal also!    [Kravchuk] But this is easier: If there is no money, it has  to be earned.    [Gavrileva] Excuse me, but we would not get very far: The  journalist here and the journalist in the United States receive  totally different pay for their work....    [Kravchuk] I would respond that 80 percent of the newspapers  in the United States are private. It is the founder who should  pay the wages you deserve.    [Gavrileva] All right, score one to you. Nonetheless, is  there a strategy for development of the Ukrainian economy?    [Kravchuk] There is only one path--the path of reforms.    [Gavrileva] What is needed for their implementation?    [Kravchuk] Work to be done locally. I was talking just  yesterday with five oblasts: Why is privatization with you not  progressing? They replied: We are thinking, we are  considering.... You understand, if I (the state) can supply an  enterprise with raw material and wages, I keep it. If I cannot,  I let it go. Who today in Crimea, for example, is impeding  privatization? Myself?    [Gavrileva] We are speaking of the local authorities, hence,  it is time to speak about the local councils....    [Kravchuk] ....and the representatives of the president.    [Gavrileva] This institution will be abolished in Ukraine  following the elections, incidentally, and the Supreme Council  of Ukraine has begun to speak once again of its introduction in  Crimea....    [Kravchuk] It is not a question of a representative of the  president, but of representation of Ukraine in Crimea. This is  what the law says! Crimea has its representation in Kiev--and we  should have ours in Crimea, and this is all being cranked up  specially.    [Gavrileva] And N. Bagrov had to explain the situation even  in this connection in our newspaper.... And how did you  personally evaluate the decision of the Supreme Council of  Crimea on the undesirability of elections to the local councils  in the summer?  Perhaps Crimea has shown all of Ukraine the right way?    [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you  select your people?    [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and  ability to function in an extreme environment.    [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an  individual "from outside," someone from another country no  less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe  personnel shortage?    [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside."  He is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even  referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by  the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the  borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a  natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective  economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is  nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything  rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a  norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the  Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of  specialists in the class, on the level and with the  qualifications of Mr. Saburov.    [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance  between the two of you...    [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any  resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of  deputy prime minister. That is a fact.    [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him?    [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and  in this place to improve the economic situation.    [Moroz] How do you assess this situation?    [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow  and blue.    [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with  respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A  cleaning lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er"  [Commonwealth of Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of  R40,000 per day for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a  month. A civil aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in  pension. The Crimean president himself, I was told by one of  his aides, receives a salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite  the large number of zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the  moment of my departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is  reduced still more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling  and falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return  Crimea to the ruble zone.    [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more  acceptable means of payment, since our main flow of  tourists--people who spend money in Crimea--are citizens of  Russia. To provide them normal services, if you will, is one of  the most important tasks of our oblast economy, and we will  accomplish this task.    [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine.  It would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here  different from that used in Ukraine...    [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our  reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a  normal condition.    [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have  to violate the laws of Ukraine?    [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors  leading to the current economic situation. The results are  before you, as they say.    [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the  catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed  towards you in a wave?    [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you  think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they  perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some  nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general  economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine  comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization  of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full  composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and  the United States. The United States became alarmed only when  the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While  it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen, but  now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in  Crimea. From where does such delusion come? The dignified  magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The  Second Crimean War."    [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were  elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of  the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected  revelations?    [Meshkov] Yes. First of all, the attitude of previous state  officials; this is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or  secretive, but rather open and defiant.    [Moroz] You were hoping for something different?    [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but  neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would  be so aggressive, clearly antipeople, irrational... and  criminal, in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not  expect. A second thing was the revelation as to what extent our  law enforcement organs are infected with the disease called  corruption.    [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position  as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges  against members of the party and administration nomenklatura  caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive  to fight for justice?    [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have  grown immeasurably.    [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a  specific, precisely defined program?    [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime  runs headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There  are insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight.    [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to  establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and  Russia?    [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the  official level. The situation with respect to Russia is  directly the reverse.    [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a  Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack.    [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian?    [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it.    [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary?    [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is  fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I  speak correct literary language. I speak on the everyday,  colloquial level.    [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is  occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet  problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They  are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen  themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from  a failure to resolve this issue.    [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only  question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be  conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on  Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with  respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet.  This is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest  will depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other  side. For us, the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit  of which it would be a sin not to take advantage.    [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed  formations out of Crimea being executed?    [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove  first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of  agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only  with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The  presence of these forces does not contribute toward  normalization of relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In  addition, they are occupying a fairly large amount of territory  which could be used for economic purposes. Finally, they  represent a certain threat to the ecology.    [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops?    [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately.    [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000.    [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters.  They have reliable sources.    [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the  appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do  not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to  shatter their negative attitude toward you?    [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars  do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to  state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement  of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political  opponent and supported him, and when he lost, they declared they  did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This  is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It  is simply undignified to resolve political problems on the  mundane level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the  Republic of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their  votes is more than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in  this chair. And among that million are a great many citizens of  Crimean Tatar nationality.    [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for  Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised?    [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I  said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of  political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a  deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as  president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and  universal standards, but I have no intention of repealing what  has already come about.    [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special  services? Are they watching you?    [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time  and at a certain level of political and state activity, this is  inevitable.    [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable  decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine?    [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and  decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's  treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial  point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were  declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus,  everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that  remains is to return to common sense and universal concepts.</p>

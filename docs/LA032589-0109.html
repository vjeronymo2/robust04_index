			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN ROBS ARMORED CAR GUARD AT MARKET  </P> <P> A lone armed robber took an undisclosed amount of cash from an armored car  guard Friday morning at a crowded supermarket on Ventura Boulevard in Encino,  Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> No shots were fired and no one was hurt in the incident, which occurred shortly  after 10 a.m. inside a Ralphs grocery, Lt. Bob Ruchhoft said.  </P> <P> A Brink's guard was about to leave the crowded store with a bag of cash when he  was confronted by the gunman, who apparently had been waiting inside, Ruchhoft  said.  </P> <P> The robber also took the guard's gun before running to a small, white car in  the parking lot and speeding off, he said.  </P> <P> The robbery does not appear to be related to a string of armored-car robberies  that have resulted in several arrests and the deaths of three guards in the  past year, he said.  </P> <P> The FBI is assisting the Los Angeles Police Department in the case, he said.  </P></p>

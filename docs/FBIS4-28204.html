			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "A Corner of Society" column by Sergeant Tuy Kdam: </F> "The Khmer Rouge Are Like Mosquitoes"]    [Text] The Khmer can be compared to mosquitoes. Should we  let them bite us, or should we protect ourselves with mosquito  nets or with chemical sprays potent enough to kill them? This  remark was made by Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the  Royal Government, when he returned home from the roundtable.    It is true that there are not many mosquitoes born out of  the  foamy mud or filthy water. To eliminate the mosquitoes from our  houses, one of the most effective means is first for us to  gradually fill up and do away with all the potholes and pits.  If the mosquitoes that bite us are few in number, we just have  to use our hands to slap them, and few of them will survive such  a simple treatment. However, if they are too many and they keep  harassing us, we will have to use not only nets but also  chemical sprays to protect ourselves. The mere use of smoke  coils or sticks will not be effective enough against them.    The Royal Government has made all kinds of sacrifices to  bring peace for the people. However, the Khmer Rouge have  refused to accept peace through cease-fire. They have resorted  to tricks just to rekindle the dying international interest in  their existence.    Right in the heart of the country, the Khmer Rouge have set  up a newspaper [reference to PRUM BAYON NEWS, a twice weekly  publication in Cambodian first appearing on the newstand in  April 1994] to cause confusion in the people's mind as it has  been working to prod its readers against the Royal Government.  This newspaper has vociferously charged that the Royal  Government is a warmonger. It is a kind of a stillborn  journal...    This newspaper is trying to undermine peace in society and  to  sabotage the trust between the people and the Royal Government.  It loftily extolls the genocidal Khmer Rouge, making them appear  already like an overlord in Cambodia.    Many local situation analysts have stressed that the Royal  Government's controlling apparatus is too lenient. We have  tumbled to such a low state, and still we have allowed such a  subversive Khmer Rouge newspaper to remain active! Shutting  down the Khmer Rouge newspaper and driving the Khmer Rouge  office out of Phnom Penh -- something we must do most urgently  -- is already tantamount to eliminating most of the "breeding  grounds" of these mosquitoes.    Before anything else, the Royal Government should take this  measure for the sake of peace in society. If it hesitates to  conduct such a "surgical" action, the impact of the bad  propaganda will surely cause rapid erosion in communal peace and  will certainly bear very serious consequences.</p>

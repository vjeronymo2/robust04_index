			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / E Europe expects more from EBRD THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, set up two years ago to promote economic development in eastern Europe, ploughed only Ecu200m (Pounds 165m) into the region during 1992, though the bank's lending is expected to increase sharply this year. Agreement was reached during 1992 to invest Ecu1.2bn in projects in eastern Europe, and commitments of a further Ecu2.6bn are expected this year, the EBRD revealed as it announced its annual results. The slower disbursement of cash reflected the length of time taken to implement projects, said Mr Anders Ljungh, vice-president for finance. Commitments made so far show a bias towards economically and politically more stable states such as Poland and Hungary, rather than the former Soviet Union. Poland and Hungary account for 44 of the 71 projects approved by the EBRD so far. The Russian Federation, by comparison, accounts for just eight, with less capital committed than to Romania and the Czech and Slovak republics. 'We've done less than we should (in the former Soviet Union), particularly as it accounts for over half of our operations,' said Mr Ljungh. A number of large projects are currently under discussion in the former Soviet Union, including energy projects requiring capital of Dollars 5.5bn in all. The bank has been presented with 'fewer good projects than we would have liked', said Mr Ljungh.</p>

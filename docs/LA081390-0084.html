			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> LET'S GET PHYSICAL  </P> <P> Improved learning is one of the obvious benefits of making sure that elementary  school students are healthy. However, Orange County public schools have a  disturbingly low rate of compliance with a state requirement that children  entering first grade have physical exams.  </P> <P> That's a shame, and school districts need to make more of an impression on  parents about the value of such screening.  </P> <P> The Orange County Health Care Agency estimates that nearly a third of  first-graders are not checked out medically before they start classes.  </P> <P> Much of the problem is traceable to a loophole in state law, which enables  parents to waive the exam for religious or cultural reasons, even though the  point of the exams since first conducted in 1975 has been to identify  developmental problems or disabilities that could affect a child's ability to  learn.  </P> <P> The waiver is easily claimed by anyone, even though officials estimate that  less than 5% of Orange County's population actually has legitimate  prohibitions.  </P> <P> Some of this can be traced to misunderstanding. Parents need to know that they  don't have to go out and get another physical if a child has had a physical  within 18 months of enrollment.  </P> <P> Moreover, Proposition 99 has changed the ground rules, offering money to Orange  County to expand physicals to all low- and moderate-income children through age  18.  </P> <P> So there's no excuse. At registration time, school districts should make an  extra effort to educate parents.  </P></p>

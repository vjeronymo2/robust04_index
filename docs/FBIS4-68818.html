			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Palchikov: "Cold Climate for Business"] </F>   [Text] Tatarsk--V. Naumovets, general director of a  construction association, came to the newspaper's local bureau.  I have known Viktor Sergeyevich for a long time: He is a crafty,  competent manager. He has extensive ties not only with Russian  businessmen but also with near abroad countries.    On my desk is a letter to Naumovets signed by Turkmenistan's  Minister of Education R. Karayev: "The ministry deeply  appreciates your association's help and your personal  participation in the production and delivery of technical  teaching aids, school furniture, and other equipment for general  education schools and other organizations in Turkmenistan."    Viktor Sergeyevich himself says enthusiastically on the  subject:    "What is bad about us attracting foreign investment,  creating  jobs, and paying taxes into the rayon budget?"    Nothing; actually, it is all very good. But why is the  businessman in a depressed mood; who has hurt him? "Hurt"  probably sounds a little innocent: Who can hurt a person who is  economically free, who, as they used to say in classic Russian  literature, moves millions? In this case the offending party is  the rayon tax inspectorate headed by G. Martyntsova. By the way,  a competent specialist and an extremely charming woman.    "There are driving us crazy with audits," says Viktor  Sergeyevich. "They audit the same things five, 10 times."    A lively correspondence ensued between the "adversaries."    Here is what Galina Vladimirovna writes to Viktor  Sergeyevich: "Dear general director! Point 3 of your  statement that the taxpayer Tatarskseluchprofstroy cannot  fulfill its obligations and pay taxes for 1993 sounds  incomprehensible and absurd."    Viktor Sergeyevich responds to Galina Vladimirovna: "Dear  Counselor 2d rank of the tax service! I am very grateful for  your sincere and speedy reply to my letter. You permitted  yourself a remark that the phrase regarding the impossibility of  paying taxes for 1993 'sounds incomprehensible and absurd.' You  did not read my letter attentively; Captain Nazarenko did not  just "violate the form"--he impounded 100 percent of the  documentation, including the balance sheet with attachments  which you, Counselor 2d rank, kindly mentioned..."    This kind of politely cool fencing. As you may have figured  out, the issue is simple: taxes. One side demands them; the  other believes that it does not have to pay. There have already  been appeals to the arbitration court, which made a ruling in  favor of the association. A second hearing will be held soon.  The tax inspectorate has learned from previous mistakes and is  better prepared. It is hard to say in whose favor the ruling  will be.    Both interlocutors are deeply convinced that they are right.    Let us listen to entrepreneurs: In addition to Naumovets,  another participant in the conversation is V. Katernikov,  chairman of Svyaz Joint-Stock Company and a store owner--he also  has problems with the tax inspectorate, only this time the city  one. He also won a ruling in his favor in the arbitration court  and believes that entrepreneurs are being deliberately  hounded--but without them neither the city, nor the rayon, nor  the country will get on their feet. An increasingly greater  share of revenue comes in the form of taxes from business; as to  enterprises and organizations, life is dying there, while  unemployment is growing. And the number of budget-financed  organizations is growing. Over the past few years alone about 10  new ones were added in Tatarsk: two tax inspectorates, tax  police, federal treasury, employment center, pension fund, and  so on.    Until recently Tatarsk had about 15  cooperatives--construction materials manufacture, leather-,  garment-making, and others. They have been crushed by all sorts  of arbitration and taxes. Now there are no cooperatives, except  those in trade, whose number keeps growing. Where would  additional revenue for the budget come from if everybody  consumes but nobody makes anything?    Galina Vladimirovna has a point, too, however:    "We do not want anything beyond what is due. All we want is  to collect taxes; this is what the service has been set up for.  If businessmen engage in tax evasion, what are we to do? It is  not we who make life hard for the association--they have dragged  us from one court to another."    The reader has probably noticed the entrance of a new actor  in our story--Militia Captain Nazarenko, who the general  director mentioned. He was the person who impounded the  documents for the audit. In turn, Naumovets filed a claim with  the Tatarsk People's Court.    It is said that the shadow of the recent elections hangs  over  this whole incident. The association actively helped its  candidate to the oblast soviet and was stunningly successful in  it. Heads of city and rayon administrations suffered a crushing  defeat, after which the incident with the documents allegedly  took place. Most likely this is a coincidence, an accidental  occurrence, but the fact that the recently emerged structures,  needed by the rayon and the country, cannot take root is very  alarming.</p>

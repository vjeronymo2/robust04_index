Based on  statements by those connected with the exercise, it was  disclosed on 19 February that at the command post exercise [CPX]  conducted during the joint exercise, SDF units were supposed to  attack Russian territories, including the four northern islands  and Sakhalin. Despite the fact that the CPX is conducted on  computer screens without actual mobilization of units, the  exercise may become a controversial issue because such an  exercise could be regarded as a deviation from the authority of  the SDF whose objective is to defend Japanese territorial land,  sea and air space based on the principle of an exclusively  defense-oriented posture.    The objective of conducting a CPX, which is different from  an  actual exercise [jitsudo enshu] in which units will be actually  mobilized, is to train staff officers in conducting liaison  between the "exercise command [renshu bu]," which is in command  of actual operations, and the "commanding headquarters [tosai  bu]," which is in charge of creating imaginary circumstances  [jokyo sotei] based on the scenario.    The CPX, which was started in fiscal 1985, has been  conducted  every year except in the year of the Gulf war. The eighth CPX  conducted this year lasted 10 days, from 26 January through 4  February, with the participation of some 3,200 U.S. Forces  personnel and about 3,400 SDF personnel.    Acting as the commanding officer from SDF was Tetsuya  Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council, and from the  U.S. forces was Richard Meyers, commander of U.S. Forces Japan  [USFJ]. While the USFJ set up its commanding headquarters at  Yokota Base, the SDF set up its commanding headquarters at the  Defense Agency's Central Command, and its exercise commands at  the operation rooms of the Ground Staff Office, Maritime Staff  Office, and Air Staff Office.    As was done in past years, the exercise started with an  attack and landing on Hokkaido by Russia, which is regarded as  an "imaginary enemy." It is reported, however, that no attacks  were conducted against Russian territories or the northern  territories because the exercise was concluded by "UN  mediation." However, it was also reported that at the CPX  conducted in the past years, training in attacks against various  places were conducted in accordance with different  circumstances; and an attack against Russia's maritime oblasts  is named "C-1 Attack"; attack against the four northern islands,  "C-2 Attack"; and attack against Sakhalin, "C-3 attack."    In an exercise conducted in a certain year, the exercise  command reported to and requested the commanding headquarters to  launch attacks against a unit of war vessels based on the  imaginary circumstances that a unit of Russian war vessels  intending to make a landing on Hokkaido was concentrated at  Aniva Bay in southern Sakhalin. Based on the judgment of the  commanding headquarters, a permit for attacks was issued. Then  the U.S. Forces first attacked Russian SAM's (surface-to-air  missiles) deployed at such places as Notaro at the southernmost  tip of Sakhalin; secured command of the air; and then F-1  support fighters of the Air Self-Defense Force attacked Russian  vessels. Reportedly, such an exercise was conducted in the past  but this scenario has been handled as "top secret."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["KPA, Invincible Revolutionary Armed Forces" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Today is the 62nd  anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army [KPA].  On this occasion, the entire people warmly congratulate the  valiant officers and men of the People's Army who are firmly  defending the cause of socialism.    The KPA is invincible revolutionary Armed Forces which have  made immortal contributions to achieving the independence and  sovereignty of the country and defending the gains of socialism  over the past 60 years.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said:    "The proud feats performed by the People's Army and the mass  heroism displayed by the officers and men of the People's Army  in the course of our revolution will shine forever together with  the revolutionary history of our party."    The KPA (Korean People's Revolutionary Army in the period of  the anti-Japanese armed struggle) is a proud Army of the people  that played a decisive role in accomplishing the historical  cause of the liberation of the country.    The first revolutionary Armed Forces of the Korean people  were founded on April 25, 1932, in the darkest period of the  Japanese imperialist rule (1905-1945). The great leader  President Kim Il- song who embarked upon the road of revolution,  shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation, made a  deep analysis of the state of the early communist movement and  the independence movement and concluded that a struggle by  standing revolutionary Armed Forces is the only way of  liberating the country. He set before the young communists and  patriotic young people the slogan "Arms is our life and soul!  Arms to arms!"    It was early in the 1930s. In response to his call, a bloody  struggle was waged to obtain weapons inside Korea and in broad  areas of North and South Manchuria. On the basis of these  preparations, he proclaimed the birth of the first revolutionary  Armed Forces. The Korean People's Revolutionary Army grew to be  steel-like ranks, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces in the  flames of the protracted anti-Japanese armed struggle and, at  last, defeated Japanese imperialism and accomplished the cause  of liberation of the country in August 1945.    After the liberation it was strengthened into the regular  Korean People's Army with all services and arms.    The invincible might of the KPA was fully displayed in the  three-year fatherland liberation war against the invasion of the  U.S. imperialists and their allied forces. The U.S.  imperialists mobilized huge Armed Forces two million strong and  all the uptodate combat and technical equipment in the Korean  war. But the valiant KPA fighters took the initiative in the  whole period of the war by overpowering the numerical and  technical superiority of the U.S. Forces with political and  ideological, strategic and tactical superiority. The Japanese  book Land Battle Dictionary Vol. 4 says: "The North Korean Army  was a tough opponent which applied confrontal attack, surprising  and other diverse tactics which the U.S. Forces had not  experienced."    The Korean people and People's Army killed, wounded and  captured more than 1.567 million enemy effectives including  above 405,000 U.S. troops in the war. And it captured, downed,  sank or destroyed a fabulous amount of combat and technical  equipment including over 12,200 warplanes, above 3,250 tanks and  armoured vehicles and more than 560 warships, defending the  country with honor. The war ended in a great victory of the  Korean people.    The KPA has reliably defended the security of the country  and  the people in the period of socialist construction, too. Each  time the U.S. imperialists committed provocations such as the  intrusion of the armed spy ship "Pueblo" (January 1967) and the  case of the large spy plane "EC-121" (April 1969), the KPA dealt  a decisive counterblow at them and smashed their new war  provocation manoeuvres.    The Korean People's Army has entered a new period of an  epochal turn in the long history of its development by  acclaiming Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genius of military affairs,  as its supreme commander.    Today the KPA is united rock-firm around Comrade Kim  Chong-il  on the basis of loyalty to the party and the leader and  revolutionary comradeship. It has earned itself fame as  powerful revolutionary Armed Forces.</p>

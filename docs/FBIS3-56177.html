			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Russian Vice-Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said on Thursday he might remain in  the government after an upcoming cabinet reshuffle.    The statement, which was made in the State Duma, the lower  house of Russia's new parliament, on Thursday followed Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's decision to cut the number of  vice-prime ministers in the government from nine to four. There  have also been numerous leaks that Shokhin and vice-premier  Sergey Shakhray, both have been elected deputies of the State  Duma, will not be offered posts in the new government.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Shokhin disagreed with  statements that reductions will be made at the expense of  reform-minded ministers. To exemplify his point, Shokhin cited  Yeltsin's decision to appoint Anatoliy Chubays who is in charge  of privatisation in Russia a fifth vice-prime minister. He  added that none of the ministers of the old government has  received such an offer yet.    Shokhin did not rule out the possibility that the number of  vice-prime ministers may increase in the future. According to  him, there are two optimum ways to form the government: first to  determine the number of vice-prime ministers and then increase  it or entrust federal ministers with management functions. In  the latter case Shokhin would call for cutting the number of  ministries by "establishing such a system under which ministers  will have more powers in the government, while vice-prime  ministers could substitute the premier in his absence."</p>

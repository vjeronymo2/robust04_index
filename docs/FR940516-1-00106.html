			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA solicits comment on the proposed definition of handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment and on the potential process for handling those types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of equipment that may pose difficulties to classification. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requests comment on the specific cases discussed. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA solicits comment on alternative definitions that may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Alternative definitions of ``handheld equipment''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might include, but need not be limited to, the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Lack of wheels or other means of support (other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I11&bull;Overall weight below some limit such as 10 kg or 20 kg, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above some minimum, such as 75 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Conversely, alternative definitions of ``nonhandheld equipment''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could include elements such as: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Presence of wheels or other means of support other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Overall weight above some minimum such as 10 kg or 20 kg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below some limit such as 75 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be recognized that recent engineering developments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may eventually obviate the need to provide different standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for handheld and nonhandheld equipment engines. Future technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solutions may provide engines used in all applications with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable emission performance capability. For example, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firm has recently announced plans to begin marketing portable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> string trimmers, traditionally powered by either electricity or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-stroke gasoline engines, that are instead powered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lightweight, high-speed 4-stroke engines. This company claims to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve emission rates much lower than either current 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines or engines that would meet the handheld standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in this rulemaking. Numerous efforts are also under way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop direct injection systems applicable to larger 2-stroke  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine-systems that may be able to bring emissions from engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as those used for outboard marine engines down to levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to a well-calibrated 4-stroke engine in the same power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range. However, the applicability of direct injection systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small engines used in handheld applications has not yet been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigated. In developing Phase 2 standards, EPA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisit this issue in its entirety and may combine all engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under one set of standards, modify the definitions of nonhandheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and handheld equipment, as well as the applicable standards, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may promulgate an entirely different regulatory structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Requirements Applicable to Vehicle and Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to require that vehicle and equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and importers use the appropriate handheld or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld certified engine in their vehicles and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and equipment manufacturers and importers to use certified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad engines. EPA has determined that the most effective way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment is to require that manufacturers and importers use such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. Without such a requirement, there would be no penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for vehicle and equipment manufacturers that knowingly purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncomplying engines, thus undercutting the entire program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that vehicle and equipment manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers be subject to the prohibition, injunction, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty provisions of CAA sections 203, 204, and 205, except that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only the nonroad engine in the vehicle or equipment, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vehicle or equipment itself, would need to be certified for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. Although engine manufacturers will bear the burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of certification under this proposal, the focus of enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will fall to some extent on vehicle and equipment manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they determine whether a handheld or nonhandheld engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appropriate for use in their vehicle or equipment and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that those engines are certified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No federal paperwork or reporting burden would be imposed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle and equipment manufacturers by the requirement that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified nonroad engines be used. This is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad large CI engine proposal (58 FR 28809 at 28815 (May 17,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993) and 58 FR 51595 at 51597 (October 4, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only new engines manufactured on or after the effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this rule would be subject to the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, rebuilt engines originally manufactured prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of this rule would not be subject to this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rebuilt engines originally manufactured after the effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this rule would be subject only to the tampering provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New replacement engines manufactured after the effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be subject to this rule. EPA requests comment on whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is any need for manufacturers to produce replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines for use in pre-1996 equipment, and the extent of such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need, if any.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labeling requirements proposed in this notice may also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing an effective date of August 1, 1996 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking. This midyear effective date coincides with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model changeover in the small SI engine industry. Engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured on or after August 1, 1996 for use within the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States would have to meet the standards and requirements included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

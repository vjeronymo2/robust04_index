			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carrie Lee] </F>   [Text] Local governments in China may get flexibility in  the implementation of taxation, including property gains tax,  according to a state tax official.    "In the light of the direction of China's reform, we  shouldn't rule out the possibility of locality governments being  given some flexibility in the implementation of local taxes,  such as deciding on tax rates and ways of collection," said  State Tax Bureau general deputy commissioner Li Yonggui.    In the race for foreign investment, many municipal  governments have proposed refunds on property gains tax for  foreign investors, making the tax ineffective. The move has  been publicly censured by Beijing.    "The property gains tax is an income to locality governments  but its implementation rests with the central government.  Locality governments are not empowered to add something to it  or abandon it," said Mr Li.    He confirmed that details of the property gains tax would be  released and implemented this year.    "Before working out the details, we'll consult locality  governments, the authorities concerned and Hong Kong developers.  We'll consider the interests, returns and risks of Hong Kong  developers (in their mainland property projects). We'll also  take inflation into account," he said.</p>

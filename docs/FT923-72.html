			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Irish Stock Exchange has investor compensation Sir, Donald Elkin's 'Investor Protection - Expatriates' (Finance &amp; the Family, September 15) stated that Ireland does not have an investor compensation scheme. While there is no national scheme for the investment services sector, member firms of the Irish Stock Exchange participate in a scheme for investor compensation. Mr Elkin's final comment was that 'expatriates have greater protection when dealing with UK firms than they would by investing in an unregulated environment'. One cannot quibble with a statement of the obvious. However, some readers may have inferred from his statement that most places outside the UK, in particular certain countries mentioned, do not have regulated environments. The Irish stock market is subject to a high quality system of regulation, based on the same code as in the UK. Members of the Irish Stock Exchange participate in an investor compensation scheme. Tom Healy, General manager, The Irish Stock Exchange, 28 Anglesea Street, Dublin 2</p>

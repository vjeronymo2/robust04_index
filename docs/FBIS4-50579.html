			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Ban Mingli (3803 2494 7787): </F> "`Stability' in Commodity Prices"]    [Text] The General Level Must Be Stable    Commodity prices have to fluctuate as well as stabilize. Is  this contradictory?    Given that we recognize price fluctuations, why should we  still emphasize stability?    This is because the price fluctuations that we recognize  refer to moderate rather than drastic and disruptive ones; and  stability refers to keeping the general level of price rises  basically stable rather than freezing prices from any changes.  We have to seize the opportunity to get through fluctuations in  price reform so as to accelerate the pace of economic  development, but we must also create a macroscopic environment  of price stability so that our economy can continue to develop  in a healthy manner.    Fluctuations and stability are just like two sides of the  same coin which cannot be separated. In price reform, relaxing  restrictions is not equivalent to noninterference, while  fluctuations are not tantamount to loss of control.    The general price level is a comprehensive concept. This  year's 10 percent is precisely the general level of price rises  which the state wants to control and realize. Whether or not  the economic situation is stable will, to a very large extent,  depend on whether or not we can prevent price rises from going  far beyond the 10 percent limit.    According to economic experts' analyses, the growth rates of  GDP and of price rises would be better kept in the ratio of  1:0.6. This year's 9 percent economic growth and 10 percent  price rises are in the ratio of 1:1.1. Compared with the base  of last year, this ratio can be described as a high speed of  economic growth and a low inflation rate. However, since this  year's low price rise level is pulled down from last year's high  level, we still cannot underestimate the difficulties in  controlling this year's general price level.    Obviously, there are many factors affecting the general  price  level. To keep commodity prices under control, we have to  proceed from many aspects.  <H5>  Acting Against Seeking Exorbitant Profits--An Urgent Task </H5>   It is not the case that all kinds of price fluctuations are  reasonable.    In the market, we do not rule out the existence of some  unique commodities. Maybe a thing is precious when it is  scarce, and it is natural that the prices of those unique  commodities are higher than those of ordinary ones, but they are  only a minority. Quite a number of commodities are priced far  beyond their own worth without taking the situation of market  demand and supply into account. To keep the general price level  under control, we must take strong measures against prices  seeking exorbitant profit.    Last year, a wristwatch was priced at 990,800 yuan in a  certain shop, but this year, the price rose to 1.2249 million  yuan. A dumpling was sold at four yuan in a certain restaurant,  but, to everyone's surprise, the restaurant asked 80,000 to  100,000 yuan if one wanted to book a table. All these are not  cases of fixing prices at one's discretion, but cases of asking  exorbitant prices and of running fraudulent businesses by  forcing up prices.    Certain production and management enterprises, plagued by  the  "price starvation disease," cannot restrain themselves, but  rather take advantage of the relaxation of price controls to  drive up prices at will and to shift the burden onto consumers;  while certain traders, plagued by the "blind pricing disease,"  do not fix reasonable prices in light of market demand,  mistakenly believing that they can reap huge profits by marking  prices at will. People can choose not to buy those commodities  for which excessive prices are charged, but they cannot prevent  those who are seeking exorbitant profits from driving up prices.    Recently, how to act against the seeking of exorbitant  profits and fraudulent practices has become a common concern.  In drawing up regulations against practices seeking exorbitant  profits, Shanghai first defined the concept of seeking  exorbitant profits. Any charges exceeding prescribed average  prices and reasonable profit margins are considered as moves  seeking exorbitant profit which must be punished. This is a  weapon given to consumers. But still, some people say that it  is not enough to merely give a quantitative definition, and we  should also evaluate traders' motives and purpose in raising  prices. If fraudulent means are used to raise a certain price,  even though it is not large in quantitative terms, it should be  treated as a fraudulent move and one which seeks exorbitant  profits, and must be punished.  <H5>  Directed Against the Crux </H5>   Where does the crux of price rises lie?    If the impact on prices of a small number of traders'  illegal  profit-seeking moves is a point to be reckoned with, the factor  bringing about overall price rises within greater limits is the  issuance of too much currency and the expansion of fixed-asset  investment. This is the root cause of a constant, overall, and  high level of commodity price rises, that is, inflation. The  crux lies precisely in keeping price rises under control.    Investment is necessary for the development of our  economy. Be it a province, a city, or a prefecture, there are  thousands of reasons and grounds for investment. However, when  all these are added together, they precisely become the force  driving up our country's general price level.    After analyzing the relationship between the growth of  fixed-asset investment and changes in commodity prices over the  past 14 years, some people have discovered the following  characteristics:    1. When the growth of investment is equal to or lower than  the average growth rate, it will not trigger off large-scale  commodity price fluctuations;    2. Generally speaking, price rises will emerge a year after  an investment boom. When the scale of fixed-asset investment  expands drastically and exceeds the average growth rate of  investment in a certain year, then huge commodity price rises  will emerge in the following year.    In order to achieve a rapid and healthy development of our  national economy, we do not rule out the possibility of making  more investment in a certain year but less in others. However,  overall, we must control the scale of fixed-asset investment  within proper proportions. We must provide a material basis for  development, but also keep severe inflation in check and  maintain a relatively stable general level of commodity prices.    Macroscopic regulation in 1993 promptly eased the  inflationary pressure, but by the end of last year there were  still unfinished projects worth 130 million yuan created by  greater investment, registering an increase of 60 percent over  that of the previous year; and 30 to 40 percent of investment  was put into the market in the form of consumption funds, thus  creating more demand, which drove up prices. The aftereffects  of excessive growth in money supply will be felt more noticeably  this year.    There are indications that in the first two months of this  year, the growth rate of state-owned units' fixed-asset  investment dropped as compared with last year; and another good  sign is that more and more investment is being made in projects  at the central level, in coastal areas in the eastern part of  the country, and in the communications and transportation  sector. However, macroscopic regulation is still needed to  oversee the strong trend of investment growth.  <H5>  Beware of the "Float Phenomenon" </H5>   From a long-term point of view, subsidies have to be  abolished. But for a fairly long period, subsidies cannot be  abolished.    In order to offset part of the pressure caused by price  rises  and to maintain the situation of stable development, the state,  at a time of price rises, often provides large amounts of  subsidies to lighten consumers' burden. In order to stop price  rises for some commodities, the state also gives large amounts  of capital subsidies to production enterprises, wholesalers, and  retailers. This is what people call "hidden subsidies."    However, we must have a good grasp of the degree of  subsidies. Commodity price researchers analyzing this situation  say that subsidies are another manifestation of rises in the  commodity price index. That is to say, subsidies are an  essential measure for keeping commodity prices stable. However,  while price rises are held in check, the potential energy of  price rises is also stored up by subsidies, and will be released  when we run into financial difficulties and normal economic  operation is affected. If the open index of price rises is  considered as one level, subsidies are another level of price  rises beneath the horizontal line.    This is what they call the "float phenomenon." Just like a  float on the sea, the open price index is the part of the  "float" on the surface; whereas subsidies are the underwater  part of the "float," which is called "hidden price rises." The  sum of the two parts should be the concrete growth rate of  after-subsidy prices.    Can we reduce subsidies so as to seek moderate price rises?  According to the analysis of the departments in charge of  commodity prices, it is possible to do so, and will be  determined by the macroscopic environment of a basic balance of  demand and supply. When the macroscopic environment is  relatively relaxed, we can duly accelerate the pace of price  reform because there will not be excessive price rises and the  growth rate of subsidies can be lowered correspondingly.    That is to say, when we are in a condition to duly relax  restrictions on commodity prices, even if we reduce some  subsidies, there will not be a huge increase in commodity prices.    It is thus clear that under certain conditions, the hidden  price rises created by too many subsidies may exceed the rate of  price rises brought about by relaxing restrictions on commodity  prices. Hence, for some commodities with strong competitive  power in the market, it is better to provide fewer or even no  subsidies, and the way out is, after all, to gradually achieve  basic stability of prices in light of market fluctuations.    Of course, this is not to say that all subsidies can be  abolished at a stroke. The application of subsidies should be  determined by how relaxed or strained the macroscopic economic  environment is.  <H5>  New Problems </H5>   As far as the requirements of moving toward marketization  are  concerned, the price reform has not succeeded and it must be  deepened. Keeping the general level basically stable is the  prerequisite for deepening the reform.    The formerly distorted price structure has been, to a  certain  extent, rectified, but so far has still to be thoroughly  changed. Ever since the policy of reform and opening up was  implemented, the prices of extraction industries and basic raw  and processed materials industries have been rising by more or  less the same margin, hence the prices of basic industries,  which were originally on the low side, are still low at present.  Relying on the market to distribute resources is precisely  empty talk if prices are not straightened out.    For example, some petroleum prices have been raised since  the policy of reform and opening up was implemented, but it is  getting more and more difficult to exploit petroleum and so the  costs keep increasing. Since the price and the cost of crude  oil are not in harmony with each other, it is difficult to  increase output, which very much restricts our national economy.  This is also one of the reasons accounting for the marked  growth in imported petroleum in recent years. The coal  industry, likewise, faces similar problems.    Meanwhile, unjustifiable phenomena are also present in the  prices of commodities and in the service sector.    That is to say, reforming the unreasonable price structure  cannot be achieved by a few adjustments.    Moreover, inflation over the past few years has also offset  the revised higher prices of some commodities. For example,  grain prices have been raised and restrictions on purchase  prices have been relaxed several times, and the purchase and  selling prices of grain are basically the same, but peasants  have to bear higher costs of grain production because of the  huge increases in the prices of agricultural means of  production, hence the advantages of price rises disappear. To  deepen the price reform, there are still many things to do.  <H5>  Can Prices Be Checked? </H5>   Faced with the complicated situation, can we hold the  general  price level in check? As shown by the determination of the  party Central Committee and the State Council and various  price-regulating measures recently introduced, it is possible to  do so.    The foundation is, first of all, not to regulate commodity  prices for prices sake but to aim at creating a good macroscopic  economic environment and to hold inflation in check by  maintaining an appropriate economic pace so as to bring the  general price level under control; and to bring excessive demand  under control and to hold drastic price fluctuations in check by  guaranteeing normal production.    The "shopping basket" and the "rice bag" projects are  commodity prices most directly felt by people, and their  stability is the foundation of stable prices. Not long ago, the  State Council delegated the authority to take charge of the  "shopping basket" project to mayors of large and medium-sized  cities, who are held accountable for accomplishing the project.  Moreover, every year the mayors have to report their assessment  results to the people's congresses and people of their cities.  This is an absolute order issued to the mayors.    As indicated by information, it is no good not to issue such  an order. The impact on the "shopping basket" project of the  construction and development of some cities has already affected  daily supply and led to drastic commodity price rises.  Vegetable markets in some localities have changed into pet  markets and vegetable farmland into development zones; while  financial subsidies given to key nonstaple foods in some  localities have also been abolished.    After experiencing excessive price rises in grain, cooking  oil, meat, and vegetables by the end of last year, many cities  were soberly aware that the "shopping basket" project is a  "365-day project," which must be handled firmly every day. The  most fundamental way as well as the strongest means to bring  commodity prices under control is to guarantee production and  supply, particularly proceeding from controlling commodity  prices of key agricultural and sideline products. The  municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have adopted  various means not only to have a rich "shopping basket" but also  to build up firm "vegetable farmland."    How can price reform measures be introduced in such a way as  not to cause drastic fluctuations? Comrades from departments in  charge of commodity price regulation hold that as far as price  reform is concerned, we must take into account the three aspects  of our ability to bear, that is, the state, enterprises, and  consumers, and no single one of them can be dispensed with. In  introducing every reform measure, the principles which we must  grasp are not to add to the state's financial burden; that the  increased cost of raw and processed materials thus caused can be  controlled within the limits to which normal production and  management of enterprises can adapt; and that the living  standard of most people will not drop because of price rises.    Comrades studying the commodity price reform liken the  existence of these three conditions to a "satellite launch  window." We should choose such a "window" to introduce reform  measures. If the necessary conditions are not present, we would  rather put off reform and, at the same time, actively create an  environment for such reform. This is a safe and prudent move.    It is also precisely the most significant foundation and  source of confidence for the state's macroscopic regulation. In  the balance measuring the triangular relationship among the  state, enterprises, and consumers, the weight of the consumers  is the heaviest. Macroscopic regulation can control inflation  within bearable limits, that is, the growth of urban residents'  cost of living and income and peasants' earnings are higher than  the extent of commodity price rises. Once inflation goes beyond  bearable limits, the state can also intensify macroscopic  regulation to impose strict controls on it.    We should admit that owing to differing income levels, some  people are weaker in bearing commodity price rises; for example,  workers and staff who retired a long time ago and incumbent  personnel of enterprises without good benefits. The state has  already urged the various localities to take special care of  them. Now, the compensation system linking basic old-age  pensions with the cost-of-living index has been implemented in  some localities; while funds for aiding the poor have been set  up in some cities to subsidize low-income groups and households  with special material difficulties. Moreover, some localities  have laid down minimum income levels for incumbent workers and  staff and a minimum livelihood protection level for unemployed  workers and staff. All kinds of assistance are given to them to  solve their problems.    How Should Departments Responsible for Commodity  Price Administration Control the Situation?    A consumer went to the Administration of Commodity Prices to  sue a store where she had bought several meters of woolen cloth,  because she found that the same cloth was being sold $10 to $20  cheaper in another piece-goods store. Therefore, she urged the  administration to punish the first store.    Similar situations can be seen everywhere. Should the  Administration of Commodity Prices punish the store? According  to the defined jurisdiction of price reform, an overwhelming  majority of traders selling ordinary consumer goods are  authorized to fix prices directly, and the Administration of  Commodity Prices should not frequently take punitive action  against stores. Hence, the first way in which consumers must  protect themselves is to learn how to select among various  prices for the same commodity.    So, at a time when restrictions on the prices of most  commodities have been relaxed, how does the Administration of  Commodity Prices regulate commodity prices in the market? How  to safeguard consumers' rights and interests? All these are new  problems posed for departments responsible for commodity price  regulation.    Obviously, we cannot, as was done in the past, take an  account book and examine and approve, item by item, every  commodity price, neither can we refuse to have anything more to  do with the matter and let prices rise. We must blaze a new  trail of indirect administration.    The goal and task of our price reform in the next stage is  precisely to establish a system of macroscopic regulation with  indirect administration as the core, in which prices can be free  of restrictions but can also be brought under control. This is  also a historic transformation of the functions of commodity  price administration.    We have relaxed restrictions on the prices of grain, edible  oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables since the policy of reform and  opening up was started, but following the panic purchase  occurring at the end of last year, the state swiftly took such  measures as setting up reserves and setting price limits to  bring commodity prices under control as quickly as possible.  This indicates the possibility of accomplishing indirect  commodity price administration and controlling market commodity  prices by means of macroscopic regulation.    Gao Tiesheng and Liu Wen, officials from the State Planning  Commission's Department of Market and Commodity Price  Regulation, say that a system of macroscopic regulation of  prices should include five points: Setting up a system of price  regulation at both the central and provincial levels;  administering prices through comprehensive application of  economic, legal, and administrative means; setting up price  regulation funds and a reserve system for important commodities  at the two levels; establishing a system to monitor commodity  prices and to take precautions against drastic fluctuations; and  installing a sound system of laws and regulations.    At present, price regulation funds and reserves of important  commodities are becoming the two firm systems in various  localities which help to control sudden price rises in the  market due to seasonal changes and the arrival of holidays or to  cope with disastrous events. The systems at the central level  are being vigorously established.    Monitoring commodity prices and taking precautions against  drastic fluctuations are the key tasks of departments  responsible for commodity price administration which have had  their functions transformed. Beijing Municipality has  introduced or is drawing up eight laws and regulations. As far  as the work of price forecasting is concerned, it includes  analyzing the situations of production, supply, marketing, and  consumption, the trend of changes in prices, mass expectations,  and changes in demand and supply in neighboring areas. A system  of placing price rises on file is implemented for most  commodities, whereas for a small number of commodities a system  of reporting price rises to the higher authorities and of  controlling the rate of price differentials is implemented, and  price ceilings are set to guard in advance against drastic price  fluctuations.    The state administration of a small number of directly  priced  necessities and service charges is very strict. Not long ago,  the state unequivocally announced that 20 commodities and  services which were already priced by the market would be  subject to rigorous inspection. As long as prices are fixed  within the prescribed limits, arbitrary price rises can be  checked.    Price reform is also a systematic project of the overall  economic operation, which can never stride forward while  divorced from reforms of the planning, taxation, monetary, and  foreign exchange systems and from the development of enterprise  restructuring. Price reform must proceed in cooperation with  other reforms. As long as we seize opportunities to promote  price reform while taking into account all sides' ability to  bear price fluctuations, prices will not run wild but will be  controllable.</p>

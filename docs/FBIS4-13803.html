			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Zayyat] </F>   [Excerpt] The PLO leadership has asked Fatah leaders in  Lebanon to collect and store weapons in the camps of the south  in preparation for their transfer to Gaza and Jericho under  Egyptian supervision, an informed Palestinian source disclosed.  The source noted that prices of weapons on the world market  have gone up.    The source said that Fatah official in Tyre Sultan  Abu-al-'Aynayn, a supporter of Yasir 'Arafat, began collecting  weapons in the camps of the region under his supervision.    The source said the move is part of an effort to remove  weapons from the camps to influence the Palestinian forces that  oppose Gaza-Jericho agreement and paralyze their activity in  resisting the Israeli occupation of the south. The source noted  that representatives of factions opposing the PLO policy and  opposition Fatah leaders led by Colonel Munir al-Maqdah have  recently held a series of meetings to escalate military action  against the Israeli occupation forces in the south, and even in  northern Palestine (Upper Galilee). This was evident in the  operation carried out jointly by the George Habash-led Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine and al-Maqdah group in  al-Khardali. Three fighters were killed in the operation.    The source described the collection of weapons and their  transfer to Gaza and Jericho as a new card that will be conceded  in favor of 'Arafat's capitulatory policy. [passage omitted]</p>

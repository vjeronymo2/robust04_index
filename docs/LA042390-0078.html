			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Final Act for Whole Theater: It's curtains for the Whole Theater, which rose to  national prominence with a push from its co-founder, Olympia Dukakis. The board  of trustees for the Montclair, N.J., theater said the building will have to be  sold to pay off debts of about $450,000. Officials said the theater's  association with Dukakis, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1988 for  "Moonstruck," may have lulled would-be donors into believing it was financially  sound.

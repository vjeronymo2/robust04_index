			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Community will set up anti-drugs squad EC interior and justice ministers yesterday decided to set up a joint anti-drugs squad from next month, as part of an effort to prevent organised crime exploiting the Community's barrier-free single market. The unit, designed to pool intelligence and develop a combined strategy against narcotics trafficking, will come under Europol, the criminal intelligence office called for by EC heads of government two years ago. However, Europol is still not operational. In an embryonic and under-employed form, it has a temporary headquarters in Strasbourg. Getting it beyond that stage awaits a convention to accommodate the differing civil liberties traditions of the Twelve, and a decision on where to locate new EC bodies - delayed by competing claims. The ministers nevertheless felt it was sufficiently urgent to get an EC anti-drugs effort up and running in advance of these decisions. If the Copenhagen summit on June 21-22 does not resolve the issue, the interior ministers intend to meet again on June 29 to agree a temporary site for the drugs unit. The squad itself will have a staff of about 70, each member state seconding officers to it. Liaison between member states and the analysis of intelligence will be its main work, overseen by the interior ministers, who now meet as the secretive Trevi group. Ministers also agreed recommendations to tighten up on money laundering and the organised crime activities of motorcycle gangs, and to examine ways of combatting the traffic in women and children for prostitution, and the illegal transport of toxic waste.</p>

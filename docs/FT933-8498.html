			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Brazil central bank chief resigns THE GOVERNOR of Brazil's Central Bank resigned last night after being placed in an untenable position by President Itamar Franco. Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes' job as governor had been in doubt all week since he received a public scolding from Mr Franco over confusion surrounding the new currency introduced at the start of this month. The row centred on predated cheques, which are a common form of obtaining consumer credit in Brazil's inflationary economy. The Central Bank contested Mr Franco's announcement that predated cheques written in the old currency would be accepted up until November, declaring the decision illegal. Alleging subversion, Mr Franco issued an official note making it obvious he wanted Mr Ximenes to quit. The battle over the cheques was just the latest in a series of clashes between Mr Franco and Mr Ximenes. The two men have had frequent conflicts over interest rates, Mr Franco blaming the governor for the high rates which Mr Ximenes claims are essential with inflation nearing 33 per cent a month. In office since September, Mr Ximenes was the longest surviving member of Mr Franco's economics team. Since he took office there have been five finance ministers. His departure will heighten the country's economic instability and comes as a blow to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the latest finance minister, who had been anxious that he continued. Although Mr Cardoso said last night monetary policy would not change, Mr Franco is expected to appoint someone to the post who agrees with his wish to keep lower interest rates. Mr Cardoso said Mr Ximenes' resignation was over 'a question of overall economic policy'.</p>

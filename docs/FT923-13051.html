			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric income slips WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a slight drop in second-quarter net income as a weak US economy battered many of its sectors and its troubled financial services operation suffered a substantial dip in profits. Westinghouse reported net income of Dollars 122m, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of Dollars 3.15bn, compared with net income of Dollars 127m, or 41 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.17bn in the same period of last year. The financial services operation, Westinghouse Credit Corporation, which is being sharply reduced after making some disastrous property investments, reported net income of Dollars 2.1m on revenues of Dollars 172.2m, compared with profits of Dollars 19.5m on revenues of Dollars 264m in the same period of last year. Westinghouse Electric's operating profit for the period was flat at Dollars 252m, with an operating profit margin of 8 per cent, against 7.9 per cent a year ago. Interest expense, excluding financial services operations, rose from Dollars 57m to Dollars 67m due to expenses from a new revolving credit facility, part of Westinghouse's bolstering of its financial position following the property problems. Westinghouse said its broadcasting unit produced higher operating profits on flat revenues, due to cost reductions, while electronic systems produced flat revenues on lower operating profits due to an unfavourable sales mix. Environmental revenues and operating profits were down; the industries segment produced an increase in operating profit on revenues slightly higher; and power systems saw a dip in operating profit.</p>

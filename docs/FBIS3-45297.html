NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi expressed the wish  when meeting with Richard Gephardt, visiting majority leader of  the House of Representatives of the United States.    Extending his welcome to Gephardt and his party, Qiao said  that many U.S. congressmen had visited China since last November  when Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill  Clinton met in Seattle, which was regarded as a new start in  bilateral relations.    Such visits have helped promote the congressmen's  understanding of China, and provided opportunities for exchanges  of views on issues of common concern.    On the issue of the most-favored-nation (MFN) trading  status,  Qiao said that the MFN treatment is an arrangement of equity and  mutual benefit between China and the United States.    He reiterated that China is against linking the MFN  treatment  with issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as the  human rights issue.    Qiao said that a sound political, economic and trade  relationship between the two countries is in line with the  fundamental interests of the two peoples and is conducive to  world peace and development.    Gephardt said that U.S.-Chinese relations are "most  essential" to the two countries and to the rest of the world as  well.    He said he believed that dialogues and exchanges would  improve U.S.-Chinese ties, adding that the United States hopes  progress would be achieved in bilateral relations.    The U.S. guests arrived in China Wednesday [12 January] at  the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign  Affairs.</p>

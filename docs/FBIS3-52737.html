			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Randah Habib dispatch from Amman] </F>   [Text] At a time when the Jordanian-Palestinian talks are  being held in Amman for the second consecutive day to launch a  serious dialogue between the two sides, an atmosphere of  frustration has prevailed these talks, and it seems they will  not produce any positive results. King Husayn had earlier  stressed that these talks will be the last opportunity to  rectify the situation following the PLO's continuous  procrastination.    Observers believe that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's  decision to send Faruq Qaddumi to Amman, taking into  consideration that the latter is not informed of the  coordination file, unlike Mahmud 'Abbas, Abu-Mazin, reflects  'Arafat's desire to procrastinate and gain time, especially  since the Palestinian delegation is expected to ask for time to  hold consultations with the leadership in Tunis, something which  will lead to revolving in the same vicious circle.    An authorized Jordanian source has stressed that Jordan has  the feeling that 'Arafat gives priority to coordination with  Israel at the expense of coordination with Jordan. The source  noted that Amman does not want to get involved in the whirlpool  of turning the conflict from a Palestinian-Israeli conflict into  a Palestinian-Jordanian conflict. However, the source added,  Amman holds the PLO responsible for the repercussions of the  failure of the dialogue in Amman, and the additional suffering  this would cause to the Palestinian people inside the occupied  territories.</p>

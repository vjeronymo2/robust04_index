			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (7): Operators locked in battle - Computer reservation systems EXACTLY 40 years ago, a chance meeting took place on an American Airlines' Los Angeles to New York flight involving two Mr Smiths. One, CR Smith, was American's president, the other, R. Blair Smith, was a senior sales representative for IBM. The outcome of the conversation between the two men was a project, designated Semi-Automated Business Research Environment or Sabre. Almost a decade and Dollars 40m later, the world's first airline computer reservation system (CRS) came into operation. Initially, Sabre was an internal system which enabled American electronically to link a passenger name to a specific seat sold on an aeroplane. By 1964 Sabre's telecommunications network stretched from coast to coast and from Canada to Mexico and it was already the largest real-time commercial data processing system in the world. Since 1976, when the first Sabre terminal was installed in a travel agent's office, a handful of competing CRSs has been set up. These have evolved into extremely sophisticated marketing and distribution tools for the airlines which own them. In the process, they have reshaped the way travel is organised and helped travel agents provide a more flexible, efficient and global service to their customers. Today CRSs are an indispensable part of the travel industry. In the US, the most mature CRS market, an estimated 95 per cent of all travel agencies are linked to at least one CRS, 88 per cent of all airline tickets are issued through a CRS and travel agents account for 75 per cent of all tickets sold. All the main CRSs now include features which enable travel agents directly to access a participating airline's own computer database and make 'real time' bookings and reservations. Sabre itself has more than 109,000 terminals installed in over 25,100 locations throughout 65 countries. Its high security underground computer complex in Tulsa, Oklahoma, holds details of 45m fares from 651 airlines, together with other travel data on hotels and car rental companies. It is the market leader in the fiercely competitive US market with about 40 per cent market share, ahead of Galileo International, formed earlier this year through the merger of the US Covia (Apollo) and European Galileo groups; System One, which is owned by EDS; and Worldspan, which is owned by a consortium of airlines including Delta, TWA and Northwest. However, Sabre has had more trouble breaking into Europe - a market which unlike the US is still growing. Amadeus - owned by Air France, Iberia Airlines of Spain and Lufthansa German Airlines - is the market leader in Europe with around a 50 per cent market share according to Ovum, the UK-based technology consultancy which tracks value-added network services such as CRSs in its information service, 'Vans Market Europe'. As Ovum noted in a recent report: 'Europe has recently seen a revolution in the CRS market, with two rival European systems (Galileo and Amadeus) replacing individual countries' reservation systems.' Indeed, Europe is part of a much larger battle between the large CRS operators to build systems spanning the globe. The advent of global industries and large-scale international travel for both business and leisure purposes has become one of the main driving forces shaping CRS development. As travel agencies have followed their customers overseas and formed international alliances, CRSs have been forced to do the same. 'To be a successful CRS, you need to be in touch with your customers - the travel agents,' says Mr Allan Loren, Galileo International's chief executive. 'As they have become more global, we have had to become more global.' This, he says, was the logic behind the recently completed merger of Covia and Galileo. The new Galileo International, which claims to be 'the largest and first truly global CRS,' with a 30 per cent share of the worldwide market, is owned by 11 European and US airlines, including United Airlines, British Airways, Swissair, KLM, USAir and Alitalia. Its Global Access product enables travel agencies to integrate information from Galileo International's three separate databases, Apollo, Galileo and Gemini (the associated CRS in Canada). Using it, a Galileo-automated agency in London can retrieve a customer reservation created by an associated agency using Apollo in Chicago and make any change required by the client en route. However, although the merger has enabled Galileo to take advantage of such factors as economies of scale and a centralised administration and data processing structure, Mr Loren emphasises that Galileo International recognises that 'every region has distinct needs'. Accordingly Galileo, like its European rival Amadeus, has been set up to work with individual national distribution companies (NDCs) which add local content like rail and ferry fares and are responsible for Galileo's customer sales, service, support and training - and for feeding customer comments and local needs back to headquarters. Galileo's motto, says Mr Loren, is: 'Think global, but act local'. Amadeus provides its service through locally-based National Marketing Companies (NMCs) but has also set its sights on building a global network. However, a planned partnership between Amadeus and Sabre fell apart acrimoniously in 1991 because of last-minute disagreements. Since then, Amadeus, Worldspan and Abacus, which is owned by five Asian airlines, have formed a co-operation agreement under which their respective computer reservation systems are being interconnected. Given the pressures to provide a global service, many inside the travel industry think that, even after the recent flurry of mergers and agreements, further consolidation among the CRSs is likely. Eventually, many believe the total number of CRSs will shrink to just two or three. It is unlikely that any new CRSs will start up because of the huge costs involved. Charging policies vary between the CRSs. Both Sabre and Galileo charge travel agents a small sign-up fee but, once a travel agent has reached certain booking levels, the service is free and the bulk of the CRS's revenues come from the participating airlines which pay about Pounds 2.50 for each fare segment booked. For the airlines this is a small price to pay for a highly efficient distribution system, but CRSs have another big attraction for them. Data collected by the CRS enables an airline to run its own sophisticated programmes called revenue management systems (RMS) or inventory control. These systems are designed to juggle the availability of fares in order to maximise the revenue collected by each flight - vital in a fiercely competitive deregulated market like the US or the transatlantic routes. The existence of such powerful marketing tools has made CRSs and their airline owners obvious targets for scrutiny by rivals and by the regulators concerned over allegations of bias in the way systems display or handle data. In Europe this led to a bitter public battle earlier this year over the passage of a new EC code of conduct governing CRSs. However at the end of September a new code of conduct was finally agreed by the EC Council of Ministers based on a compromise which has been generally welcomed throughout the industry and appears to have re-established an uneasy peace between the main protagonists.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ashton Mining to float gold interests ASHTON Mining, the Australian diamond miner, plans to swell the nation's heavy schedule of private equity raisings with the ADollars 112m (USDollars 75.2m) flotation of its gold production interests. Ashton directors said yesterday the company would consolidate its Australian and Indonesian gold interests into a company called Aurora Gold, and initially make a placement to institutional shareholders. Private investors would then be offered 25 per cent of the placement shares, with Ashton retaining a 30 per cent stake in Aurora, which would potentially rank among the top 10 Australian gold producers. Ashton, 47 per cent controlled by Malaysian Mining Corporation, is a partner in the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. Ironically, the company appeared to be moving its investment strategy away from gold as recently as March this year. At that time, directors said the company would focus on opportunities in the diamond sector and place its Mount Muro gold mine in Indonesia out to tender. But that was when the gold price was languishing at around Dollars 327 an ounce. Since then, the price has strengthened by around 20 per cent, prompting a rush by investors for Australian gold stocks. The gold price jump was seen by analysts last night as the main factor behind Ashton's change of heart. Assets likely to be offered in the Aurora float include Mount Muro and interests in the Laverton, Harbour Lights, and Bardoc properties in Western Australia. Ashton's share of gold production from these properties rose from 131,465oz to 135,307oz in the latest year. Mount Muro has the potential to produce around 150,000oz per year. Ashton shares yesterday closed 6 cents higher at ADollars 2.22 on Australian stock exchanges.</p>

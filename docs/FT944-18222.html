			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Tighter checks on insider dealing proposed The Stock Exchange proposed yesterday that trading in individual companies' shares should be suspended if there is evidence that price-sensitive information concerning those companies has been leaked. The controversial measure is part of its campaign to minimise the effects of insider trading on investors' confidence in the market. The scheme is the brainchild of Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive. It was prompted by his concern last May at the four-day delay between a surge in the share price of Portals, the maker of banknote paper, and the company's announcement that it had received a takeover approach. In that period, 854,000 Portals shares worth Pounds 5.7m were traded at prices around 666p. However, after Portals announced the takeover talks, the shares surged to a high of 805p, so anyone who had sold in the preceding days had missed more than 100p per share of profit. Yesterday's exchange document also contains a tentative suggestion that it should be able to force stockbroking firms to 'reverse' or cancel share transactions when it believes they have been 'carried out with the benefit of unpublished price-sensitive information'. The exchange said: 'This would serve as a strong deterrent, as the gain from such illicit transactions would be lost.' However, Mr Lawrence is concerned that he might be accused by the government of attempting to introduce civil sanctions against insider trading by the back door. In relation to the planned system of suspending shares after a leak, Mr Lawrence said: 'I hope it all can be implemented.' He acknowledged that it might initially meet opposition, because it appeared to fly in the face of the longstanding exchange tradition that continuous trading in shares should be maintained at all costs. However, he said he was determined to make the market a fairer place, where those without access to unpublished price-sensitive information were not severely disadvantaged. He said: 'I believe the proposal to suspend individual shares in this way will increase confidence in the market as a whole.' The proposals have been made possible by the development last year of the exchange's computerised Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System, used to detect unusual price movements or anomalous transactions. Under the proposed arrangements, parameters would be set for 'normal' price fluctuations in the shares of every company. If a share price moved outside that band, a warning would automatically be flashed to market participants on the Seaq trading system. At the same time, market makers, the wholesalers of shares, would be absolved of their obligation to deal at the price shown on the Seaq screen.

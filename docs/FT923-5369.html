			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading shopping centre in Scotland Two companies within the ALFRED McALPINE GROUP have been awarded contracts totalling Pounds 6.9m through the company's Glasgow office. Clyde Square Shopping Centre, Greenock, is to be remodelled and refurbished by Alfred McAlpine Building (Scotland), at a cost of Pounds 5.2m. The work will involve the covering of the 1970s shopping centre with new floors, fire protection and alarms, lighting and architectural treatment to the new internal space. The shops in the centre will continue to trade whilst the building is being altered. Alfred McAlpine Management has been appointed by Bield Housing Association East to design and construct a Pounds 1.7m sheltered housing development at Pilmur Street, Dunfermline, for completion in June 1993. This is believed to be the first housing development of its type to be built in Scotland and will consist of sheltered housing for sale and rent, and incorporate six care flatlets for the elderly, with warden accommodation and sleepover facilities.</p>

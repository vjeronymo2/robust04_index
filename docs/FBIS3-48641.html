But  there were three conditions to taking the talks further, he said  in an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency.    "...There are a number of conditions... Including exclusive  adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  safeguards, a resolution of its difficulties with the South  Koreans, and progressing its relations with the United States,"  Bilney said in a written interview relayed through the  Australian Embassy here.    The talks were held "in recent weeks in Southeast Asian  capitals," according to Bilney.    "We're not acting alone -- we're not going solo on any  particular initiative," he said, adding that Australia is  officially conferring with the concerned parties such as the  United States and South Korea.    Canberra and Pyongyang established diplomatic relations in  July 1974 but North Korea unilaterally closed its mission in  Australia in October 1975, when Canberra backed South Korea's  bid for membership in the United Nations. Australia followed  suit one month later.    "The fact is that the initiative did come from North Korea,"  Bilney said when asked who took the first step.    Australia chose to play a part in talking with North Korea,  Bilney said, because of his country's role in the region and  Australia's position as chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors.    Asked about possible advantages in reopening ties with North  Korea, he said, "I think it's far too early to speculate about  those things."</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'MEAGER VALUE,' INDEED  </P> <P> I am writing in regard to the article by Mike Boehm in today's Calendar, Orange  County edition ("Nigerian Musician Sees Music as a Tool," July 27). He uses  Voltaire as a cover for his own views condoning the right to allow the youth of  our nation to be exposed to the worst kind of smut proliferated by the likes of  Luther Campbell's 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> A quote from the fourth paragraph, "He (Voltaire) would nevertheless defend the  rappers' right not to be prosecuted for what they have to say, however meager  its value." Degradation of women and perversion of sex have negative value --  much less "meager value"!  </P> <P> I happened to be watching C-Span on July 25 when Rep. Robert K. Dornan  (R-Garden Grove) addressed the House on the exceedingly detrimental effect some  2 Live Crew rap lyrics have had on the morals of our youth. He could not repeat  any of the lyrics because of House decorum. However, he read an article on that  subject by George Will, using substitute medical words. Having heard what had  been published by 2 Live Crew, I was dumbfounded that so many condone it in the  name of the First Amendment.  </P> <P> In the interest of decency, such gory smut must be kept from young  impressionable minds. It seems a way of life for today's youth to the seek the  "forbidden apple." I applaud the actions being taken in Florida. I appeal to  our national leaders to follow suit and do what is needed to bolster decency  and moral values.  </P> <P> The leaders of our country and the molders of public opinion have an obligation  to use their power wisely. "One nation, under God, with freedom and justice for  all."  </P> <P> HARRY E. TERRELL JR.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Heights  </P></p>

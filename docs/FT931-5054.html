			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dumez to cut 1,500 jobs this year DUMEZ, one of France's largest construction companies, plans to cut 1,500 jobs in France this year after suffering a steep fall in sales in 1992. Mr Jean-Louis Brault, who 18 months ago became chairman of Dumez, a subsidiary of the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez utility group, announced that his company had seen sales fall by 25 per cent to FFr15bn (Dollars 2.65bn) in 1992 from FFr20bn in 1991. Dumez, like other construction companies, has been badly affected by the slowdown across the European construction sector. It has also encountered problems with contracts in Saudi Arabia. Mr Brault said Dumez envisaged reducing its 8,333-strong French workforce by 18 per cent, with 500 job losses at the parent company and 1,000 at the regional subsidiaries this year. News of the Dumez rationalisation follows the announcement earlier this year that Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez faced a sharp fall in net profits of over 65 per cent last year.</p>

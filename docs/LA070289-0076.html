			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMAGE TO BRAUTIGAN  </P> <P> As one of Gerald Locklin's publishers, I'm pleased that he followed the advice  in a recent newsletter I wrote for authors who have published books to their  credit: Be controversial. I'm astounded, though, at what it takes to be  controversial these days. His poem "Homage to John Cage" is written in the  style of Richard Brautigan's "1891-1944" (same "text" as Locklin) from "Rommel  Drives On Deep Into Egypt," the "text" of which is claimed to be "original" by  several of your readers. I'm willing to bet a cup of coffee that Locklin knew  his poem was influenced by Brautigan, but that few of your other readers were  aware of this.  </P> <P> D. H. LLOYD  </P> <P> LONG BEACH  </P></p>

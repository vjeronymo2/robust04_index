			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Family company mirrors plight of machine tool sector SIX MONTHS after the collapse of Beaver Engineering Group focused attention on the plight of the machine tool industry, 10 designers are almost all that remains of what was once the sector's largest family-owned company. Beaver's service and design activities were bought in October by Mikron, the leading Swiss milling machine producer, in a move that received little attention beyond the industry and Beaver's home base of Norwich. The sale was negotiated by Cork Gully, the administrative receivers, and the terms have not been disclosed. A design team led by Mr Tony Jackson, former Beaver technical director, will continue designing machining centres - multi-functional machine tools - at Norwich. Marketing, service and spare parts activities have been transferred to Mikron's Birmingham subsidiary, and manufacturing of Beaver machining centres is being switched to Mikron's plant at Biel in Switzerland, where there is spare capacity. When Mikron acquired Beaver the receivers had already cut the workforce by 80 to between 50 and 60. Mr Tony Balding, former managing director and son of the company's founder, was made redundant in July and has mixed feelings about the sale. 'If you look at what Beaver was - at one point we had 290 employees - it does not seem that much has been saved,' he said. 'But Beaver's innovative capability, or part of it at least, has been retained, and one must hope that it will be nurtured.' Beaver, founded in 1951, was one of the most technologically innovative UK machine tool makers. After expanding in the boom conditions of the late 1980s, it struggled to survive in the recession and foundered when its bank withdrew support. Mikron was immediately suggested as a possible buyer - the two companies signed a marketing agreement in the late 1980s and earlier this year unveiled their first jointly developed machining centre, This is one of two Beaver machining centres which will be manufactured by Mikron. The Beaver name will disappear, but Mr Ralph Schmitz-Drager, Mikron finance director, indicated it might be revived if the Swiss company developed some of Beaver's other machine tools, such as lathes. Mr Schmitz-Drager said the prospects for the Beaver machining centres were good. The design team is looking for a new 5,000 sq ft office in Norwich - the current factory is 100,000 sq ft. Mr Balding has set up his own consultancy, APB Enterprises, and is looking for opportunities to 'keep the wolf from the door'.</p>

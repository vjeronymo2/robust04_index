			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Reimund Westmeier: "New Laender Want To Build </F> Their Own Satellite"]    [Text] Berlin -- The German Agency for Space Flight  Affairs (Dara) wants to support the development and construction  of a satellite by the new laender. The small satellite, called  "NBL- Sat," is to be primarily used for gathering information on  environmental damage in the new laender from space. Speaking at  the ILA 94 international aerospace fair at Berlin-Schoenefeld on  Saturday [28 May], Dara General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken  said that he envisages concentrating the resources available to  eastern Germany on this project.    The plan is in line with Dara's goal of commercializing  space  flight and achieving the greatest possible benefits for the  economy with the help of a state-subsidized space program,  explained Mennicken.    Last year, Dara and the European space agency Esa provided  52  million German marks [DM] to the new laender, the sum being  distributed among 29 industrial companies, 14 research  institutions, and eight universities. The space budget for the  new laender amounts to just DM80 million and is thus less than  4.4 percent of the total budget, says Ralf Joachim, the head of  the Dara coordination bureau.    Speaking to NEUE ZEIT, Klaus Berndt, head of space  technology  sales at the Jena-Optronik GmbH, said that with the NBL-Sat  project, Dara has finally stopped applying "the principle of  giving everyone a slice of the cake." With this new plan, which  will involve the participation of nine eastern German space  technology companies and institutes, Dara will be able to show  something concrete and will have an opportunity to demonstrate  that it is acting in the interest of the laender. Berndt  stressed that the participation of eastern German companies in  the satellite project would serve as a reference for them.  There were no doubts in his mind about their competence with  respect to space distance measuring and analysis technology, as  well as optical sensors. To develop the new satellite, one  will, of course, need the support of companies in the old  laender, but know-how and technical means are abundantly  available in eastern Germany.    Klaus Meyer, the executive director of the Freiberg Space  Sensor GmbH, who initiated the project, assumes that the NBL-Sat  project will use up about 50 percent of the space research  funding available to the new laender. He expects the costs to  reach a maximum of DM100 million over the next four years. The  sum is tiny compared to the benefits to the environment. Thus,  it might finally be possible to shed some light on radiation  levels in Saxony's mining region. Meyer said that Saxony would  have been able to launch such a small satellite project by  itself if Dara had not become involved. However, with Dara  participation, the use and benefits of such a satellite can be  extended to all five new laender.</p>

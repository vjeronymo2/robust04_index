			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Switch to system based on resources - Govt accounts Far-reaching changes in the way government departments and agencies prepare their accounts announced by the chancellor could encourage a much more businesslike approach to the management of the nation's finances. Early next year, the Treasury will publish details of a switch in government accounting procedures from the present cash-based system of budgets voted annually by parliament to a resource accounting framework which should allow ministers to take a longer view of their spending programmes. This will involve drawing up the sort of accruals-based accounts familiar in the private sector, the health service and some executive agencies. It will also require activity-based costing and the preparation of proper management accounts. 'A resource accounting framework will help ministers understand the real costs of their decisions,' said Ms Elizabeth Ransom of KPMG. The switch should stop ministers deciding to make savings which incur considerable costs in later years, according to Mr John Wynn of Price Waterhouse. 'Saving money on things like maintenance now can come back to haunt you in five years' time,' he said. In a resource accounting framework, expenditure represents the cost of resources consumed each year, taking into account the depreciation of assets and the cost of capital, and changes in the level of creditors and stocks. Income represents what is received each year, taking into account changes in the level of debtors.</p>

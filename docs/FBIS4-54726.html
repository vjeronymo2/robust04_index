			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 3 (MTI) -- It is wrong to say that the  elections will decide between the Hungarian Socialists (MSZP)  and the Hungarian Democratic Forum, Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) Prime Minister Candidate Gabor Kuncze told the press in  Kapuvar on Tuesday [3 May]. Voters will almost certainly remove  the present coalition, so the real question is whether the  Hungarian Socialists or the Free Democrats get the authority to  replace them, Kuncze said. The SZDSZ has a good chance and is  attracting growing support, he added.    Some television programmes were openly biased against  certain  parties, Kuncze claimed. The SZDSZ would follow a different  government policy and would involve the future opposition more.  His party wants to see more control for Parliament over the  Cabinet.    He said that expecting miracles from the elections was  dangerous for the stability of the country and blamed the MSZP  for doing nothing to protect people from illusory hopes. He  also promised that between the first and second round of the  elections the SZDSZ would not expand inter-party cooperation  beyond the liberal bloc.    The Boross-Moravcik meeting showed continuity, he said: the  Slovaks were ready to improve bilateral relations.</p>

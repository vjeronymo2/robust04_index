			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni by </F> Gian Antonio Stella on 26 January; place not given: "Segni: I  May Be Naive, But..."].    [Text] Rome -- So what about this squaring of the circle?  "I do not know whether bringing the League into a program  agreement was an attempt to square the circle, as [Italian  Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli says. I know that  it was my duty to try. I could have met with [League Secretary]  Bossi and [League's lower house floor leader] Maroni in secret.  But I decided to do so out in the open. I preferred to present  a proposal in black and white. Of course, since the signing  there has been some opposition. What can I do about it? Now  people will see. They will form their own assessment." So is  it all over? "Well, judging from the League's communiques...."  What, then? "I would say that a major opportunity has been  thrown away." Mario Segni feels embittered. The other evening  success seemed to have been achieved. But instead.... "Bossi's  veto against the Popular Party is ridiculous. Ridiculous. It  splits the liberal democratic area. It consigns part of it to  the left...."    [Stella] So what was it? A trap to get rid of you?    [Segni] What does it matter?    [Stella] It does matter: Is it or is it not true that the  League regards you as the only person that can deprive it of  votes in a certain area?    [Segni] If so, they are miscalculating. Because while I may  appear naive, they look like crafty fellows. So I will be even  more competitive than before. I think, rather, that there is  major unrest within the League. That there are several  conflicting thrusts. In any case, I would not have been  criticized if I had not acted out in the open.    [Stella] [PPI Deputy] Bodrato says that only the naive do  not  realize that Bossi is bringing his adversaries closer in order  to be better able to attack them....    [Segni] I have not been attacked. It is the chance of  creating a major accord for Italy that has been attacked.    [Stella] Some people are saying, it serves you right for  trusting someone like Bossi who said: "Segni is a slimy  snail...."    [Segni] Let us leave personal matters aside. I have tried to  transcend them. What we have attempted remains the only strong  proposal for building an alternative to the left wing forces.  The proposal of an accord based for the first time not on  identities but on a government platform. In the same spirit as  the referendum. And for 24 hours it did raise the hopes of  millions of Italians.    [Stella] The fact remains that after finishing with you,  Maroni went off to telephone Berlusconi to tell him to be  ready....    [Segni] I am not concerned with other people's conduct. What  concerns me is facts.    [Stella] Do you mean that the document that begins "There is  only one Italy, and it is indivisible" is more of a fact than  Bossi's veto against that "chicken thief," Martinazzoli?    [Segni] I told you: Bossi has shouldered a huge  responsibility. A large proportion of League voters are  moderates. To win them over to a liberal democratic platform,  persuading them to transcend the phase of destructive protest,  is essential to Italian democracy. And everything that can be  done in this direction must be done. The document that was  approved was perfect. Of course words are also deeds.    [Stella] Did you not ask Maroni whether or not he had real  authority?    [Segni] He was officially authorized. We explicitly asked  that.    [Stella] Whether he was authorized to sign?    [Segni] Whether he was authorized to negotiate. The answer  was affirmative. So we proceeded.    [Stella] Was this due to some misunderstanding on Maroni's  part, or...    [Segni] Maroni seemed to me to be sincere and in good faith.  But let us return to what we were discussing before. The effort  that we made was to escape from the old rules. Those whereby  the parties proceed on their own and form agreements after.  Whoever undermines such an opportunity is shouldering a huge  responsibility.    [Stella] Do you think that Bossi changed course because of  the complaints that immediately arose within the League?    [Segni] I repeat: I think that there are some huge tensions  within the League.    [Stella] Do you think that he represents only part of the  League members?    [Segni] How should I know? I think that there are huge  tensions.    [Stella] You now seem to be left with no choice: You are  left with Martinazzoli, Amato, any nonconfessionals that are  amenable....    [Segni] I am opting for the Pact for Italy, which addresses  itself to all Italians. Primarily, of course, to the Catholic  and nonconfessional areas. The PPI and part of the  nonconfessionals had already granted their support. I hope that  other nonconfessionals will now join.    [Stella] Have you felt prompted to suspect that the purpose  of all this was to pave the way for Berlusconi?    [Segni] Of course, if this option had succeeded, it would  have been a hindrance to him. But what has happened has not  helped him. Berlusconi had already made his mind up beforehand.    [Stella] But it did clear away the last obstacles, did it  not?    [Segni] Maybe. But it seems to me that he decided to enter  the arena long ago.    [Stella] with regard to the moderate pole, Montanelli wrote  in CORRIERE DELLA SERA: "Assuming that we succeed, we will be  creating merely yet another agglomeration of wreckage and  hucksters."    [Segni] Well, there have always been fears. But together  with the stopgap measures and the resistance, I also perceive  great thrusts. And I also see many new people that want to  stand as candidates. There is an impetus in ordinary society  that will emerge in these elections, even though there will  still be a long way to go.    [Stella] Do you think, as [PPI Deputy] Buttiglione does,  that  "however badly things have gone over the League, at least we  have clarified matters?"    [Segni] Certainly. But I will tell you something else. The  underlying impetus behind the League voters' rapprochement with  the liberal democratic area is inexorable. If the leadership  supports it, it could guide it itself. Otherwise it will lose  control of it. The North cannot remain bound to mere protest.  It wants to build a new Italy.    [Stella] Did you see Berlusconi's message? How did it strike  you?    [Segni] I have already said this several times: I am afraid  that it is something that will make this area even more  fragmented than it is now.    [Stella] Galli della Loggia says that it seems highly  artificial.    [Segni] I am not interested in such definitions. I know that  it is not Giscard's party.    [Stella] Is it more like Ross Perot's? Or Peron's?    [Segni] Let us drop the subject.    [Stella] What about these opinion polls, according to which  one in four Italians longs to be governed by Berlusconi?    [Segni] I think that they are of very little value two  months  away from the elections.    [Stella] Feltri has written that Berlusconi enjoys the  support of honest, hard-working people who pay their taxes and  obey traffic signals...    [Segni] Well, I think that such people support the Pact for  Italy much more.    [Stella] Augusto Barbera says that even though you have made  some "turnabouts" you are no turncoat. What does that mean?    [Segni] That ever since our first rallies the programs that  we have put forward have been the same -- the struggle against  state control, the completion of the institutional reforms....  All this, based on Catholic and nonconfessional culture. I  have merely tried to extend this front and to persuade the  League to adopt these stances. It would have been a major  achievement. It had to be attempted.    [Stella] What now?    [Segni] We will proceed. Whoever support us, supports us.</p>

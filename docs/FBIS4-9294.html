			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Text] In the wake of yesterday's agreement reached  between the authorities of the republic of Srpska and the  prominent UN representatives for Bosnia-Herzegovina, who had  ordered on 10 April the bombing of Serbian positions near  Gorazde, the following question poses itself: Would this be  sufficient to stop the already rushing war machinery that was  started by U.S. President Clinton and the NATO Council with a  new ultimatum and threats directed only at one side in this  civil war -- the Serbian side. The answer could be positive,  provided the Muslim side also guarantees that it will comply  with the unconditional cease-fire and sit at the negotiating  table. As we already know, this not only depends on them but  also on those who have pushed them into a war against their  neighbors in the first place.    The Muslim leaders at Bascarsija [center of Sarajevo] could  finally benefit from the wisdom of their religious brother in  Cairo, President Sadat, who, after four wars with its neighbor  Israel, signed a peace agreement at the end of the 1970's, thus  refusing to fight any more for the Arab cause to the last  Egyptian.    It is well known that roads and interests of not only one  foreign power are crossing themselves on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia that was based on AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council  of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] as well as  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The interests of Germany, Austria, the  Vatican, and Turkey are mostly well known from history. It is  less known why the United States is investing so much passion in  accusing the Serbs wherever they may be and supporting the  Bosnian Muslims whatever they may be doing. This may to some  extent be learned by examining the new U.S. interests in these  regions, which are stronger than the interests of a small ally  in the two world wars.    The U.S. strategic concept, whose implementation has been  elaborated in detail by military experts, includes a general  scale of U.S. national interests. They are officially  established by the President and their implementation depends on  public opinion, support by Congress, and priorities that are  established by executive authorities. U.S. national interests  are organized into four categories according to the degree of  importance. Vital life interests come first, and they refer to  achieving basic national security aims. In order to defend  those, the United States is prepared to risk even waging a  nuclear war. Second place is occupied by great interests that  require from the state readiness to use armed forces for their  protection, but under the condition that the conflict does not  grow into a nuclear war. Ranked as third are important  interests. They are a little less important than vital and  great interests but are important enough for offering logistic  assistance and limited support from the air and sea. Ground  forces would be used only in an advisory role. It is not  difficult to see that the U.S. engagement in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with these important aims.  Occupying fourth place is a single word: interest. With a view  to protecting that, the United States would take certain  measures -- but for war -- including help to allied and other  friendly countries, with a possibility of engaging armed forces  as well, in case of need.    It is interesting to note the further division of U.S.  national interests into direct and indirect ones. Therefore,  for instance, if West Europe is of vital interest for the United  States, then the oil fields in the Persian Gulf and naval routes  from them to Europe are indirectly of vital interest for the  United States as well. Following the analogy, one can understand  Washington's relationship toward the Bosnian Muslims,  considering the U.S. interests to improve relations with  oil-rich Islamic countries and to contract profitable businesses  with them.    When mentioning the United States, the question somehow  spontaneously poses itself of where Russia is and what its  interests are. It is difficult to answer that question now, but  it is nevertheless known that it was in the Balkans that this  country was always confirming itself as a great power. Time  will show whether it is renouncing this status in exchange for  the benefit of cooperativeness and partnership with the United  States.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 OFFICIALS BACK PLAN TO EXTEND RAIL LINE  </P> <P> Seeking to unite San Fernando Valley leaders behind a single rail proposal, two  elected officials on Friday endorsed a plan to extend the Metro Red Line partly  underground from North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin, where passengers would  then transfer to buses.  </P> <P> In supporting a westward extension to Encino of the downtown-to-North Hollywood  subway, state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman  Marvin Braude became the first local elected officials to endorse a specific  rail route.  </P> <P> Several others have condemned specific routes, but most have said they are  waiting for the results of a County Transportation Commission study expected in  September.  </P> <P> A key aspect of their plan is halting the rail line at Balboa Boulevard.  Planners have found no way other than costly tunneling to get trains through  the West Valley without disturbing some residents.  </P></p>

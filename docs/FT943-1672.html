			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Vietnamese arrive home A first group of Vietnamese boat people forcibly sent home by Hong Kong for six months arrived quietly in Hanoi yesterday despite a turbulent start to the deportation in the British colony earlier this week, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. The 33 boat people, most deported against their will, filed off the aircraft at Noi Bai airport without apparent resistance. The flight marked the resumption of Hong Kong's repatriation programme after a six-month gap. The last forced repatriation was in March. The programme was suspended after a controversial April police raid.</p>

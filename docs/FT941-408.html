			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Observer: Questionable probe John Gummer, Britain's environment minister, thinks that two-thirds of those Londoners who filled in a questionnaire on their wishes for the capital's future did not vote for a strategic authority along the lines of the old Greater London Council. That seems a trifle disingenuous - after all, they were never asked that question. True, says the environment department. 'There was no direct question . . . but people were asked for their suggestions,' an official suggested. In that case, it's surely astonishing that one-third said there was a need for a resurrected GLC or its equivalent. Ask no questions and I'll tell you no lies; mind you, truth's at a premium these days, it seems.</p>

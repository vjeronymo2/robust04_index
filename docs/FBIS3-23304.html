An explosive device went off when he  left his home for work.    Our correspondent Abrek Baykov reports from Ufa that Deputy  Internal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Shabrin believes that this  was a contract killing.    A week ago Razil Musin was appointed to the post of head of  administration of Dyurtyuli rayon by a personal decision of the  Republic's president against the wish of virtually all local  leaders.    An investigation of the murder is under way.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 'HAMLET' TRUE TO ITS TIME  </P> <P> Would Michael Wilmington rather be reviewing stand-up comedy again? Do films  not work unless they're brightly lit laugh riots? In "A Matinee-Idol 'Hamlet'  From Mel Gibson," his review of the new "Hamlet" (Dec. 19), he takes Mel Gibson  to task for stepping out of his accustomed persona and daring to be merely  "more than creditable," and Zeffirelli for not coming up with a "dazzling  visual concept" and a "brilliant, breakthrough" film. Is there something wrong  with just being good?  </P> <P> Wilmington's take on the film seems to be that Zeffirelli dropped the ball by  failing to use his usual "high-spirited flourish and flamboyance" and  "overdressed sets and rococo clutter." Perhaps he missed this aspect of  "Hamlet": It doesn't take place in Italy, and it's not a comedy nor a romance.  It's a cold and dark tale of revenge and introspection. It has ghosts and death  at every turn, and not a lot of pleasantry. It's a tragedy, on a microcosmic  yet epic scale. Our Dansker hero is trying to decide whether his life is even  worth living, fighting himself as much as Laertes -- "to be, or not to be."  </P> <P> In the sword duel Wilmington didn't care for, those huge blades are laboriously  swung in a shadowy hall because that's where it takes place and those are the  weapons of the time. Broadswords are hacking and hewing tools, heavy, as  suitable for cutting down trees as men. If you want "an explosive, sun-drenched  free-for-all" duel, I suggest you go to the Mediterranean in the summer and  pick up some nice light rapiers; but it's a little difficult to dance tippy-toe  in wintry Denmark.  </P> <P> By all means point out errors and problems if they are deserved, but don't  castigate historical and geographical accuracy -- nor blame the director for  using a dark palette to paint a tragedy. Pitch your Cliff's Notes, Michael;  I'll loan you my copy of the play.  </P> <P> MICHAEL McCONNOHIE  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

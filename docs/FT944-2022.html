			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / All in the Mind: Dream of new skills Could you learn to ride a bicycle in your sleep? Sleep-learning might seem an impossible dream but experiments this year show that the way you sleep and dream are closely related to your effectiveness in learning new things. A group of Israeli scientists, led by Avi Karni and Dov Sagi of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, measured the time a person took to discriminate the shape of a patch of stripes embedded in a pattern flashed on a computer screen. This task, like bicycle riding, can be learnt. It depends on what theorists call implicit knowledge, or skill, rather than explicit knowledge, such as remembering a person's name or a shopping list. It is not easy - rather like trying to read a striped speedometer needle that appears for a fraction of a second in a striped dashboard while your gaze is fixed on the fuel gauge. But three features make the task a breakthrough for research on learning. It is easy to measure how well people do and how they improve with practice. This sort of learning is also very specific: if the angle of the stripes, or their position is changed, the task must be learnt anew. Finally, learning is very robust: it lasts for years. Last year, Karni and Sagi showed that speed improved, not during a practice session, but during the eight hours afterwards while the subjects were doing other things. This made it possible to study the effects on learning of sleep and its different stages. Subjects were trained and tested over a period of days, with sessions just after rising, and just before retiring. Exactly the same unconscious learning occurred whether the time between training and testing was spent asleep or awake. However, if sleeping subjects were roused whenever their brainwaves showed that they were dreaming, no learning occurred during the night, although learning resumed the following day. If, instead, subjects were roused when they entered the deepest stage of sleep, slow-wave sleep, they learnt normally during the night. This provides the first clear evidence that brain activity during dreaming sleep promotes learning. Scientists have long suspected that sleep is related to learning, but experiments which tested knowledge based on remembering, rather than learnt skills, showed only that sleep delays forgetting. Like most exciting results, the Israeli experiments confirm some old ideas and raise new questions. Brain pathways using the chemical acetylcholine are activated during dreaming sleep and during the waking state. This confirms that acetylcholine is important in forming memory. Karni and Sagi suggest that all our memories may be laid down by the same mechanism. Different types of learning take place in different parts of the brain. So, patients who suffer damage to a region of the brain called the hippocampus are unable to learn explicit knowledge, such as lists or people's names. Such amnesics can retrieve old memories, but they cannot learn new knowledge, although they can acquire skills. Amnesics have normal short-term memory. They can remember a string of numbers for hours by rehearsing them continuously, but if they are distracted, they will forget them completely. To test the size of your own short-term memory read the following string of numbers once, then shut your eyes and repeat them aloud: 4, 4, 5, 2, 7, 1, 4. Most people can manage a seven-digit string, but 11 digits - 0, 5, 4, 8, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 6, 2 - are too many, although much longer strings can be stored in long-term memory. The hippocampus is involved in transferring information from short to long-term memory, but the location of long-term memory is something of a mystery. It cannot be the hippocampus, because amnesics can still recall old memories. The mechanism of forgetting is also unknown. Scientists are divided on whether memories are ever truly forgotten, or whether they simply become impossible to retrieve. The new experiments give no support to the idea that we can learn by playing tape recordings while we sleep. According to Professor Jim Horne of the Sleep Research Laboratory at Loughborough University, learning only occurs if the tape recorder wakes you up.

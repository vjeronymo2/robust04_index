			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> TOLLWAY AGENCIES BUY RIGHT OF WAY  </P> <P> Officials agreed Wednesday to pay a store $5.8 million for the right to build  part of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor directly over the store  and its parking lot, officials said.  </P> <P> Costco, a discount department store that is part of a Seattle-based chain,  agreed to sell the right-of-way for its Cabot Road store just west of  Interstate 5.  </P> <P> That right of way will provide an alternative for linking the corridor with the  freeway. Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies officials are also  considering putting the freeway-corridor link farther south, near Avery  Parkway.  </P> <P> Although the Costco route would have more of an impact on the store, that route  offers several advantages to area residents and motorists, said Donna Stubbs,  manager of public affairs for the agencies.  </P> <P> "It would be farther away from the residences in the area, which makes a big  difference as to what the homeowners would look out and see," Stubbs said. "It  also calls for improvements to the I-5 freeway and the interchange of the  freeway and Avery Parkway, which is a problem the way it is now."  </P> <P> Costco opened the Laguna Niguel store March 1.

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Ex-Soviet states defer key issues THE HEADS of government of the Commonwealth of Independent States failed over the weekend to resolve any of the urgent economic and military issues which increasingly divide them, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Instead, they agreed to loosen their trade links further, to go their separate ways on foreign debt repayment and to postpone the vital issues again to a heads of state meeting in Minsk on Friday Ukraine, whose prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin, did not attend the meeting because he had to ward off a motion of no confidence against him in the Ukrainian parliament, said that it would itself repay the estimated 16.37 per cent of the Soviet debt reckoned to be owed by it to foreign creditors. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, said at the weekend that Russia 'would not oppose' such a course. There is as yet no agreement from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations which established an agreement last year with the ex-Soviet states - including Ukraine - that they would be 'jointly and severally' responsible for debt repayment. It now seems likely that Russia will take over debt repayment for all the CIS states excluding Ukraine but including Georgia - which is not yet a member but whose new prime minister, Mr Tengiz Sigua, attended Saturday's meeting. Moldovan radio said on Friday that the republic could not pay back its share of the debt and was prepared to give up all claims on Soviet property if Russia would take over its share. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, speaking to reporters on his return from France on Friday night, said the position was 'realistic' and that Russia would do the same for any other republic. At the same time, the states appear to have agreed to a Russian proposal to move inter-state trading to 'world prices'  - but, according to Mr Gaidar, at a rouble exchange rate stronger than the present rate fixed by the Russian Central Bank of Rbs110 to the dollar. The rate suggested is between Rbs20 to Rbs30 to the dollar - or precisely in the range at which Mr Gaidar has said he wished the rouble to stabilise. In effect, this establishes a new rate for Russia's exports, many of which go to CIS member states. No decisions were made on the military forces.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Protest in Philadelphia Up to 15,000 Philadelphia city employees staged a walk out protest yesterday, two weeks after the mayor imposed a new cost-cutting contract, AP reports from Philadelphia. The dispute, which the unions called a lockout and the city called a strike, affected rubbish collectors, water and sewage workers, City Hall clerks, inspectors, social workers, emergency line operators and others. Police, firefighters, prison guards, transit workers and schools were not affected. Union leaders said the city was demanding unreasonable concessions while the mayor said it needed the concessions to close a deficit.</p>

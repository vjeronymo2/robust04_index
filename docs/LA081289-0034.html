			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOUP, CLU MAY END UP IN COURT;  </P> <P> LAWYER WARNS SCHOOL LEGAL ACTION PROBABLE IF COACH IS DENIED FOOTBALL POST  </P> <P> His job as football coach at Cal Lutheran University is under siege. So what  will Bob Shoup, master tactician and winner of 182 games and 13 league  championships, do?  </P> <P> Nothing out of the ordinary.  </P> <P> He will show up for work, watch films, plot strategy, converse with his staff  and players, supervise practice and try to ignore the fact that he has been  cast as an unwanted man by the school that has called him coach for 27 years.  </P> <P> In a news conference Friday afternoon at CLU, Shoup and his Westlake  Village-based attorney, Jim Armstrong, outlined plans to "dot the I's and cross  the Ts" in terms of fulfilling the coach's written contract with Cal Lutheran  and threatened a lawsuit if the school does not abide by the same document.  </P> <P> That contract, which was negotiated in April, calls for Shoup to coach CLU's  football team during the upcoming season before taking a one-year sabbatical  leave beginning in January and expiring in December, 1990, Armstrong said.  </P> <P> The school announced earlier this week that Shoup would be welcomed back from  his sabbatical, as a teacher, but that his coaching career at Cal Lutheran  would conclude at the end of the upcoming season. However, Shoup claims that as  a tenured professor he is entitled, by the terms of CLU's faculty handbook, to  reclaim the same job he left -- including that of the head football coach.  </P> <P> Jerry Miller, Cal Lutheran's president, disagrees. He said Wednesday afternoon  that Shoup is tenured as a teacher but not as a coach.  </P> <P> "The university always retains its prerogatives and initiatives for the  appointment of coaches on an annual basis," Miller said. "I am not aware of any  university in the country that has a coaching position that is controlled by  tenure considerations."  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran plans to begin a national search for Shoup's successor this fall  and to have a new head coach by January. All of which could lead to a bizarre  scenario should two coaches claim the Kingsmen football program as their domain  before the start of the 1991 season.  </P> <P> Miller said the school's announcement that Shoup would be dropped as CLU's  football coach at the end of the 1989 season was "built upon earlier agreements  and conversations with Coach Shoup" dating to February.  </P> <P> "The proposals were initiated by Coach Shoup himself," Miller said. "We  discussed them fully in the conference which he had with me for more than an  hour on Tuesday afternoon, which preceded the university's issuance of any  statement on this matter."  </P> <P> Shoup says that he approached James Halseth, CLU's dean of students, with an  "early retirement plan" which was tentatively agreed to but later was altered  by the school. Shoup declined the school's offer and was later asked to resign.  </P> <P> The subject of retirement came up again when Shoup met with school officials  Tuesday morning. "They suggested it as a possibility," Shoup said earlier this  week, "and I said no."  </P> <P> At the press conference, Armstrong warned CLU officials that should they  "attempt to interfere with (Shoup's) existing written contract any further,  we'll probably see them in a court of law."  </P> <P> Shoup, speaking with his wife Helen at his side, said he has not been told why  the university wishes to replace him, but he surmised that his age, the  "misfortunes of the football program" in recent years (the Kingsmen are 16-27  since 1985) and "controversy" may have been factors.  </P> <P> "The timing has to be in some way linked to the move to the Division III and  the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference," Shoup said.  </P> <P> Shoup, 57, who is 182-81-6 at CLU, had argued against the school moving out of  the NAIA Golden State Athletic Conference and NCAA Division II Western Football  Conference to join the non-scholarship SCIAC.  </P> <P> Since the school's decision to make the switch last fall, Shoup said he has  tried to maintain a positive outlook.  </P> <P> "The NCAA Division III and the SCIAC are obviously a part of where we're going  and I will support to the best of my ability all the rules and regulations and  policies of those governing bodies."  </P> <P> "I just want to coach football this year," he added.  </P> <P> Miller declined to state a reason for the coaching change, citing a school  policy against public discussion about personnel matters.  </P> <P> Armstrong, himself a former college football coach, charged that Shoup should  be "praised and acclaimed" for his contributions to Cal Lutheran's development  as a university, rather than be the subject of "a slinky, what I consider  cheap, effort to pressure him out of a job."  </P> <P> He also claimed that Shoup had been threatened in writing with "consequences,"  including possible termination, if he spoke to the media. Shoup declined to  divulge who authored the warning and no evidence of such a letter was made  available.  </P> <P> Miller, who was interviewed from his office after the news conference, declined  knowledge of such a threat. "I have no knowledge of any kind of threat or  suggestion," he said. "It certainly didn't emanate from me or my office or  anybody who works close to me or reports to me."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the start of this season draws ever closer. Cal Lutheran will play  its annual alumni game Sept. 2 before opening its regular season against Sonoma  State the following Saturday.  </P> <P> "I feel my first responsibility right now lies with the players here at Cal  Lutheran who have elected to stay in a very difficult situation, knowing  they're going to be competing at a Division II schedule under Division III  guidelines," Shoup said. "I feel a real responsibility to those players."  </P></p>

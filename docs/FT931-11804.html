			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Vickers deal Vickers and Brown &amp; Root are ending a joint venture agreement as, having assisted the venture to become established in the UK, they agree that there is now little logic in one of them retaining a minority holding. Brown &amp; Root will pay Pounds 5.75m to acquire Vickers' 30 per cent interest in Brown &amp; Root Vickers and its 51 per cent stake in Brown &amp; Root Vickers Technology. Both companies were formed in 1987 through a merger of Vickers Design and Projects and Brown &amp; Root's Project Engineering Management Division.</p>

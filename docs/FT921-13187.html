			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Turkey rules out closure of loss-making companies TURKEY'S new economics minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, yesterday ruled out early closure of loss-making state companies. She said such a decision would require consensus in parliament and among the Turkish public. Rejecting criticism of her new programme as too cautious, Mrs Ciller said it was necessary for the coalition government to seek consensus. Businessmen and economists are worried that without more radical measures it will not be possible to curb the public sector deficit, the main cause of persistently high inflation. The deficit is running at more than 11 per cent of GNP. Mrs Ciller, an academic economist with no previous experience of government, has had a testing time since the formation of the coalition in November between her conservative True Path party and the Social Democrats who are less enthusiastic about market reforms. Mrs Ciller last week announced the formation of a new independent privatisation agency to be staffed by businessmen and academics. However she conceded yesterday that the future of the loss-making enterprises which account for the main part of the deficit, was 'still vague'. These include Zonguldak, the state coal company which alone employs 50,000 people. On the revenue side, the minister predicted that tax reform would generate an increase of between TL10,000bn to TL21,000bn (Dollars 1.86bn-Dollars 3.9bn) in 1992. Legislation to increase the effective corporation tax from 10 per cent to between 23 and 30 per cent was ready to go before parliament. However she said many of the proposed tax measures would only take effect at the end of 1993. Turkey and Russia have agreed to co-operate rather than compete over newly independent central Asian republics, the foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin said yesterday, Reuter adds from Istanbul. Turkey is pushing to expand economic ties with many former Soviet republics, especially the Moslem republics of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kirgizia, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. It would like to act as a bridge between the west and a region where it has ethnic, religious and cultural ties, but denies any ambition to create a pan-Turkic sphere of influence. Mr Cetin said Russia would take over Soviet contracts to supply natural gas to Turkey.</p>

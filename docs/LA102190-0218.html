			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING IN STYLE;  </P> <P> GREAT ESCAPES;  </P> <P> PERFECT PLACES TO UNWIND WHEN IT ALL BECOMES TOO MUCH  </P> <P> Getaways. Hideaways. Retreats. Resorts. These are destinations for stressful  times. We yearn to flee far, far away from tense jobs, polluted cities, more  bad news.  </P> <P> Sure, we're escaping the real world. But we need a place to re-think our lives,  a place of blissful days and tranquil nights. We want only to bask in the sun,  frolic in the water, marvel at the sunset, breathe in the fresh mountain air,  take in a bit of local color and throw our watches aside. We wouldn't mind a  beautiful room, first-rate food and fastidious service in the bargain. Frankly,  we refuse to feel guilty about not having the energy to traipse through yet  another museum, rough it in the wilderness or even schmooze with other  tourists. And it would be nice if we could find some new paradise before the  madding crowd has discovered it.  </P> <P> There are such escapes. In Thailand, only the royal family and blessed few  others know about magical Hua-Hin. In Mexico, a few chic Europeans and Latinos  hide out at a hidden resort called Careyes. In Fiji, the locals have their  small island paradises practically to themselves. At an Idaho guest ranch, the  salmon and deer are your closest neighbors for miles around. In Majorca,  romance reigns morning, noon and night at an ancient villa. In Colorado and  Utah, the snow is pure, the lift lines are short and the millionaires mingle.  </P> <P> It's going to be difficult to come home again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EDITOR: LESLIE ALLYSON WARD  </P> <P> Operations Director: Jefferson G.

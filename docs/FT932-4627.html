			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift PowerGen Much better results than expected from PowerGen, the electricity generator, together with an upbeat statement on current year prospects and the carrot of an accelerated dividend payout, fuelled a substantial surge in the generator's shares. The PowerGen stock price raced up to equal its year's high of 368p, up 13, on 4.2m shares traded as the market absorbed the news. A utilities specialist said: 'The company's profits were a good Pounds 5m above the most optimistic of analysts' forecasts and the 14 per cent increase in the dividend total was at the top end of expectations.' The real thrust of the shares' advance, the analyst added, came from the company's statement that it intends to bring down the level of dividend cover from the current 3.5 times to around 2.5 to 2.7 times: 'a simple calcula-tion means that even on a modest level of earnings growth the dividend will grow by a minimum 15 per cent over the next two to three years'. Residual market worries over heightened interference from the electricity industry regulator Offer are minimised, according to specialists, by the fact that the government will want to unload its remaining 40 per cent stake in PowerGen, and also in National Power, within the next couple of years. 'The government cannot put the squeeze on the company if they are hell bent on selling the rest of the shares,' said one trader. National Power, trading ex the 1.2p final dividend, added 10 at 353p on 3.3m dealt.</p>

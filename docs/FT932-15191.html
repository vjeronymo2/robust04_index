			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / W German GDP may fall 1.5% WEST Germany's GDP could fall by 1.5 per cent in 1993 because of the continuing international recession, a relatively strong D-Mark and persistent high domestic costs, the Cologne-based Institute for German Economy (IW) said yesterday. The report said the recession could only be overcome if prospects for investment and profits improved and the Bundesbank obtained more room for lower interest rates. But it warned unless domestic costs and price pressure are dampened, economic recovery would not begin in 1993. The report came out as figures released by the federal statistics office showed West Germany's wholesale prices in March increasing by 0.2 per cent against the previous month. This followed a similar rise in February and a 0.7 per cent increase in January. In mid-March, West Germany's consumer prices were 0.3 per cent higher thanin mid-February, bringingthe inflation rate to 4.2 per cent. In east Germany, consumer prices increased in mid-March by 0.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. In its yearly spring report, the IW said investment in machinery and equipment will fall by 9 per cent in 1993. Only the constructionsector shows an upward trend,increasing by another 1 per cent this year. The gloomy forecast was partially offset by brighter prospects in the east. Real GDP in eastern Germany can be expected to rise by 6.5 per cent in 1993.</p>

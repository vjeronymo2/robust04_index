			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OSHA SAYS WORKERS ENDANGERED;  </P> <P> GOLF CLUB MANUFACTURER CITED FOR HEALTH HAZARDS  </P> <P> Beauwood California Inc., a golf club manufacturer in Santa Ana, has been cited  by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for exposing employees to  a dangerous compound that can lead to cancer.  </P> <P> Beauwood was cited Thursday for 16 health and safety violations that could  result in $30,200 in penalties. John Hermanson, acting area director for the  federal agency's Long Beach office, said the company knowingly committed at  least two violations.  </P> <P> "We feel they knew they were exposing their employees to the hazard and took no  action to correct it," Hermanson said.  </P> <P> Beauwood spokesman Tracy Burkhardt said the firm believes that OSHA has  overstated the extent of the problem. "We feel this has been grossly  exaggerated," she said. Burkhardt declined to comment further.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Highly Toxic Beryllium  </P> <P> According to OSHA investigators, Beauwood's workers were exposed to a highly  toxic metal called beryllium. Some golf clubs contain a beryllium-copper alloy  that gives off a toxic dust when it is ground or polished.  </P> <P> Employees at Beauwood who ground or polished golf clubs were subject to  conditions that could result in "eye disease, skin disease, respiratory  irritation, irreversible lung damage, cancer or death," according to OSHA's  citation.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the agency alleges that the company did not provide adequate  medical care and safety equipment for its employees.  </P> <P> Burkhardt said the company has shut down its grinding operation. She would not  say when it closed, or if the employees allegedly exposed to the chemicals in  that division still work for the company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints by Workers  </P> <P> Some workers have complained of symptoms including chest pains, itching eyes  and rashes on the arms, according to the citation.  </P> <P> OSHA said two employees were sent to a clinic in 1988 because of skin  irritations and chest pains.  </P> <P> Two workers monitored on Feb. 9 by OSHA were found to have been exposed to  least 4.5 times the permissible amount of beryllium.  </P> <P> The workers' families also may have been put at risk because beryllium sticks  to clothing, OSHA said.  </P> <P> "These employees wore ordinary street clothes and they did not shower or change  clothes before leaving the workplace," the citation says. "Beryllium may be  carried home on work clothes, thus prolonging worker exposure and exposing  family members."  </P> <P> Besides beryllium, OSHA found some workers were also at risk of lead  contamination. "Their hands were discolored from the lead power," the citation  says.  </P> <P> It also says lead contamination had been found on top of the company's lunch  table and that traces of beryllium were found inside a refrigerator used by  employees.  </P> <P> Beauwood has about 20 employees and was incorporated in August, 1976, according  to state records and officials. Documents filed with the California secretary  of state indicate the firm's president is Lawrence Y. Igarashi.  </P> <P> OSHA has given Beauwood 15 working days to file an appeal or correct the  alleged hazards.  </P></p>

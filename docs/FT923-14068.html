			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK warships on Serbian sanctions alert TWO BRITISH warships are standing by to take part in a naval operation that European countries are considering launching to enforce trade sanctions against Serbia and its ally, Montenegro. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said last night that the destroyer HMS Nottingham was at sea in the Mediterranean. British officials later disclosed that the frigate HMS Avenger was travelling to join her. Both ships are expected to remain in the region until a firm decision is made on any military action to prevent goods reaching Serbia and Montenegro. Foreign ministers of the nine-nation Western European Union, meeting tomorrow in Helsinki, are expected to discuss plans for naval operations to check that sanctions are being observed. They are also likely to discuss the need for armed protection of humanitarian aid convoys to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The UN imposed economic sanctions against the two Yugoslav republics early last month to put pressure on the Serbs to stop ethnic fighting in breakaway republics that have declared independence from Yugoslavia. Mr Major said in Munich after the Group of Seven summit that HMS Nottingham would initially log ships going to Yugoslav ports. 'If it were to go further and there were to be stop and search, which conceivably it could, that would require a further United Nations resolution,' he said. Mr Major stressed that there was no question of Britain putting ground troops into Bosnia-Hercegovina. Judy Dempsey adds from Helsinki: British businessmen who have temporarily closed their offices or operations in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, said sanctions-busting was common. 'Electronic goods and spare parts are coming across the Adriatic, into Montenegro and up to Serbia,' one businessman said. Another said that Albania was often used as a staging post. Goods were then moved north into neighbouring Montenegro and onwards to Serbia. Plea to end civil war, Page 3</p>

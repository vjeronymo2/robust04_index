			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Heart drug buoys sales at Zeneca Zeneca, the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals group, reported an 8 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds 3.2bn to Pounds 3.45bn in the first nine months of this year. Demand for Zestril, its best-selling heart treatment, helped lift turnover in the pharmaceutical division from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.48bn. Sales growth in the final quarter is expected to fall back slightly as the benefits of the Zestril Incentive Patient Programme - its response to aggressive pricing by rival drug companies - starts to wane. The programme prompted a wave of purchases in July and August. Reporting its first nine-month sales figures since its demerger from ICI in June last year, the group said the agrochemicals division enjoyed increased turnover of Pounds 1.21bn (Pounds 1.12bn) following strong sales in North America and 'an encouraging start' to the season in Latin America. The group lost Pounds 92m in contributions from businesses sold off during the past year, mainly in the specialities division which manufactures coatings and resins.</p>

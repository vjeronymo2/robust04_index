			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Help for Japanese property group A GROUP of Japanese 'non-bank' financial institutions is negotiating the restructuring of Sueno Kosan, a debt-troubled real estate developer bruised by the downturn in property prices. The restructuring programme is unusual for 'non-banks', the leasing and consumer credit companies often blamed by the Ministry of Finance for the excessive lending that fuelled stock and property speculation during the late 1980s. Japan Housing Loan confirmed that it and three other institutions - Japan Leasing, Nippon Housing Loan and Jyuso - were considering a purchase of properties owned by Sueno in an attempt to reduce its debts, reported at Y600bn (Dollars 4.9bn). The case highlights the close links between many of the so-called 'non-banks' and mainstream banks, which often have strategic holdings in these institutions. Seven trust banks have an involvement in Jyuso, while the Industrial Bank of Japan has links to Japan Housing Loan. The Bank of Japan, fearing that weaker non-bank institutions could collapse under the weight of bad property and stock-related loans, has advised mainstream banks that they should take responsibility for the non-banks' health and that of their leading clients.</p>

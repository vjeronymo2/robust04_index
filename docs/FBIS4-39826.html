			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Already at the beginning of the  election campaign, concern was voiced (?at the session of the  Collegium of the Defense Ministry) over an increase in political  and information tension around the Armed Forces. Currently,  these negative trends are progressing. This caused the Defense  Ministry to release a statement.    The statement says that lately some political structures  have  made attempts to speak on behalf of the Armed Forces trying to  impose their own presidential candidate. Worries are also  triggered by antiarmy sentiments present in the programs and  speeches of some presidential candidates.    In connection with this, the Defense Ministry states that  the  Armed Forces decisively dissociates itself from all attempts  made by political parties and organizations to involve it in  battles for power.    Another segment from the statement released by the Collegium  of the Defense Ministry states: Servicemen are full-fledged  citizens of the Republic. During the elections, they have the  right to exercise their constitutional right, to express their  own will, and to vote for any candidate who actually has the  interests of the state in mind.</p>

This statement is encouraging because the visit, even if made  on purely humanitarian grounds, will implicitly reassert that  the Pope and the Christian world reject U.S. Zionist schemes to  touch off a new series of Crusades.    We cannot help but note the failure of the Bush  administration to control the world in the name of the "new  world order" and the fact that he had no choice but to admit  that the world is drowning in chaos, crises, and challenges --  thus precluding the establishment of a new world order. This  marked the collapse of one U.S. strategy and the prelude to the  adoption of another horrifying and even more criminal option;  namely, pushing the world into the holocaust of ethnic and  religious wars, making them the bases for future conflicts.    Indeed, since the end of the seventies, U.S. policy has been  based on creating and fueling ethnic and sectarian strife.  Therefore, this is not a new policy. What, then, has the  Clinton administration brought with it? The new element is that  the scheme of creating crises is no longer a method to pressure  or remove this or that regime in this or that country. It is  now an attempt to redraw the map of world conflicts and their  causes. In light of this, the "cultural motive" -- allegiances  to religion or national culture -- will be the major cause of  wars.    Consequently, future wars, if the United States gets its  way,  will be wars of conflicting cultures. Thus, Arab - Islamic -  Confucian - Buddhist - Eastern cultures will be pitted against  Western - Christian - Protestant - European cultures. Perhaps,  Professor Samuel Huntington best explained the U.S. scheme in  his research paper "Conflict of Cultures."    The fall of Bush and the rise of Clinton was not the only  development that reflected a change in U.S. strategy. U.S.  political thought also witnessed the death of one of the most  short-lived and absurd of its theories -- the theory of the "end  of history" propounded by U.S. researcher Francis Fokoyama.  According to this theory, the history of conflict would end  with the victory of U.S. liberalism. This theory lasted less  than three years. It was buried along with Bush, pushing to the  forefront the option of the "war of cultures," Huntington's  theory, which contradicts the "end of history" theory.    The United States is now doing what the European feudal  systems did in the Middle Ages when they sought to resolve their  domestic economic crises by capturing the huge resources of the  East. Thus, the Crusades were used as a cover to mobilize the  simple-minded and conceal the true economic objectives of  thievery.    The United States is now trying to ignite cultural,  religious, and ethnic wars only to hide its failure and crisis  and control a world worn out by wars and crises.    Hence, the Pope's crucial role. The Zionist United States is  mobilizing Christian and Jewish public opinion against the Arabs  and Muslims, as well as every other culture and religion. It is  doing this to achieve economic and strategic objectives familiar  to those in the know. It also seeks to ignite new Crusades.  The Pope can, however, actively contribute to thwarting this  criminal scheme of the West's capitalist states.    The new capitalist Crusade has chosen Iraq as a target of  its  malice. It is a major target for igniting new Crusades that  will last for hundreds of years. It is doing this by harming  Iraq so greatly that it will never be forgotten by Iraq, Arabs,  or Muslims and thus become a motive for revenge. Despite Iraq's  insistence on highlighting the nonreligious motives of this  Western hostility to Arabs and Muslims, Iraq's efforts need the  support of the "other camp," which the United States has  nominated to launch wars against us. Hence, the role of the  Pope in foiling the plan of pagan capitalism in the West. The  very visit of the Pope to Iraq will send a clear message to all;  namely, that Christianity is innocent of the greed of capitalism  and its criminal plans, and that Islam and Christianity have  peacefully coexisted for thousands of years. They can -- indeed  they must -- continue to coexist peacefully.    The visit is also a message from the Pope to the Iraqi  people  saying: We are innocent of your suffering. We sympathize with  you and wish the embargo would end. This way, we would fully  immunize the Iraqi citizen against warped ideas and ensure, by  his awareness and balanced thinking, that he will not be carried  away by destructive conflicts.    This is how we view the Pope's visit and its importance. The  timing of the visit is vital. The fact that it should precede  the lifting of the embargo is extremely significant, because  what is needed from this visit is encouragement for the  "Christian world" to act in a more daring manner toward lifting  the embargo and applying pressure toward this end. Will the  Pope do it?</p>

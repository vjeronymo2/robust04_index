			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: WHY FREQUENT FLIERS ARE FREQUENTLY DENIED  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, having accumulated more than 90,000 miles in the TWA  frequent-flier program, I decided to reward myself with a "free" trip to  Europe.  </P> <P> I called the toll-free number at the TWA frequent flier award desk. I confirmed  that I did indeed qualify for the European trip. But when I then called the TWA  reservation number to book my flight I was told that there were no seats  available for London.  </P> <P> "How about the next day?" I asked. Negative. And there were no seats for the  following day. In fact, according to the TWA reservations agent, there might  not be any seats available until October.  </P> <P> October? I redialed the TWA reservation number, did not identify myself as  someone attempting to redeem a mileage award and asked if seats were available  to London on my original flight date.  </P> <P> They were. And seats were also available on every other date I selected. What  had happened? I had become the latest victim in the frequent flier award  redemption Catch-22: You can win the award, but you may not be able to use it  at your convenience.  </P> <P> In the eight years since they began, frequent flier programs have become  probably the most popular marketing tool ever created by the airlines.  </P> <P> There's no doubt that the individual programs have built passenger loyalty, but  the big question is whether they are rewarding it.  </P> <P> Chances are that you've never heard of the Hope Letter. Lately, the document  has been circulating among certain travel agents angered about what they  consider to be frequent flier program abuses by airlines, and a copy found its  way to my desk.  </P> <P> It was a letter authored by Robert Hurd, American Airlines' managing director  of general accounting. The bulk of the letter addressed how American  financially accounted for its frequent flier "Advantage" program.  </P> <P> But in one revealing paragraph Hurd described American's philosophy about the  redemption of mileage awards.  </P> <P> "In a frequent-flier program," he wrote last January, "the most that is offered  to a FFP member is the hope that they will in some way benefit from the  program. They must hope that they will take enough trips to earn an award. They  must hope that the program doesn't cease before enough miles are accumulated  for an award.  </P> <P> "The FFP member must hope that American will not have blocked usage of travel  awards at the time they would like to use the award. And they must hope that  American doesn't change the number of miles needed to earn an award."  </P> <P> Hurd's Hope Letter seems to state the situation precisely for all airlines and  their frequent flier program members. Indeed, not a week goes by without this  column receiving letters of complaint by frequent fliers who have experienced  similar frustrations trying to redeem airline, hotel or rent-a-car awards  earned with airline miles.  </P> <P> A few years ago many airlines -- trying to limit the large mileage liability  they had incurred -- tried to change eligibility and mileage requirements for  trip awards. Suddenly a trip for two to Hawaii, which had once required 75,000  miles, would only be rewarded at 90,000 miles.  </P> <P> Frequent fliers were incensed. Some of them, who just happened to be lawyers,  filed class action lawsuits against some of the airlines, including United.  </P> <P> In the United case the airline was charged with breach of contract. Other  awards were also affected. A mileage award of a cruise, once redeemable for  150,000 miles, had doubled to 300,000 miles. TWA, which tried to limit who  could use a mileage award, was also sued.  </P> <P> The airline required that people who earned frequent flier awards had to use  the tickets themselves or give them to a relative with the same last name. TWA  was sued by a homosexual couple who claimed that the program discriminated  against them. United settled the suit two months ago.  </P> <P> And in July TWA announced a change in policy that now allows its frequent  fliers to use their mileage awards with companions of their own choosing. In  the United suit the airline agreed to reverse its earlier action and permit its  "mileage plus" members to claim mileage awards under the old rules.  </P> <P> A group of state attorneys general also got into the act, and issued a mandate  that forced airlines to give frequent fliers at least a year's notice before  changing mileage level and redemption rules.  </P> <P> One would think that the lawsuit settlements, coupled with the mandate, would  have made things better. Not necessarily.  </P> <P> Yes, the airlines did roll back the mileage levels. And yes, the airlines now  give 12 months' notice for rule changes. But that hasn't made getting a mileage  award flight any easier.  </P> <P> Why? In the case of United, while it did reverse its earlier decision to raise  mileage award levels, it did other things as well . . . none of them in your  best interests. For starters, United shortened to six months (from one year)  the period in which an award certificate must be used. It also changed  upgrading procedures.  </P> <P> Passengers can no longer use an upgrade certificate to fly first-class if they  are traveling on a heavily discounted coach ticket. And last but not least,  United began heavy "capacity controls." What this means is that the airline has  severely limited the number of seats on each flight that can be used by  redeeming frequent flier awards.  </P> <P> To be sure, United isn't alone. Just about every airline has begun strict  capacity controls.  </P> <P> How do you beat the airlines at their own games? Approach the frequent flier  programs the way you would handle the consumer indifference you'd expect from  any other large public utility.  </P> <P> If you're not satisfied with the responses you get, ask to speak to a  supervisor, and then to speak to the supervisor's supervisor. In each frequent  flier program there is someone who can help you, especially in cases of  capacity control and in cases where the flier had accumulated an impressive  number of miles.  </P> <P> Clearly, this isn't a solution to the bigger problem. The U.S. Department of  Transportation is investigating airline frequent flier programs. And other  lawsuits, challenging the airlines' policy of blackouts and capacity controls,  are pending. Stay tuned.  </P></p>

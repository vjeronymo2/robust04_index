			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New cabin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall mean any permitted cabin constructed on refuge lands after December 2, 1980. This may also include a cabin whose claimant failed to meet the application deadline for existing cabins but is otherwise a permitted cabin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other related structures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall mean those structures or devices essential to the activities for which the cabin special use permit is issued. This includes but is not limited to outdoor toilets, food caches, storage sheds, and fish drying racks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Private recreational use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall mean a use associated with leisure activities, not including bona fide subsistence uses or authorized commercial uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Public use cabin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall mean a cabin owned and administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and available for use by the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All cabins. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations in this paragraph (b) shall apply to all cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. The regulations in this paragraph (b) do not apply to temporary facilities: any structure or man-made improvement which can readily be completely dismantled and removed from the site when the period of authorized use is terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A special use permit is required to construct, use and/or occupy a cabin on Fish and Wildlife Service lands within the refuge. The permit may also authorize the use of related structures and other necessary appurtenances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) After adequate public notice has been given, unclaimed cabins become the property of the Federal Government. Adequate public notice shall include: Posting notices of trespass on unclaimed cabins; publication of notices of trespass in Anchorage and Fairbanks newspapers and in at least one local newspaper if available; and posting notices of trespass at appropriate community post offices. A Government-owned cabin may be used for refuge administration, used for emergency purposes by the public, permitted to another applicant, designated a public use cabin, or destroyed. Disposal of excess cabins and structures will be according to regulations pursuant to Title 41, Chapter 114 of the Code of Federal Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Willful noncompliance with the conditions and stipulations of a special use permit shall be considered grounds to invoke the administrative process leading to notice and hearing, and possible revocation of the permit. The refuge manager will attempt to resolve problems of noncompliance with the permittee as soon as possible after the situation becomes known. If this effort fails, the refuge manager shall provide written notice to the permittee within 30 days of that date, informing the permittee of noncompliance, giving specific instructions for compliance and providing appropriate time for the permittee to comply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) No special use permit will be issued for the construction of a cabin for private recreational use or for the private recreational use of an existing cabin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Guests are allowed to occupy a cabin only during the activity period identified on the special use permit. Guests occupying a cabin during the absence of the permittee shall obtain a letter of authorization from the permittee. The guest must have a copy of the letter in his/her possession. In commercial cabins, the permittee or another person listed on the permit must be present when the cabin is occupied by guests or clients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) A person whose permit application (new or renewal) for a cabin has been denied or whose cabin permit has been revoked by the refuge manager may appeal to the Regional Director as described in &sect;36.41(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Existing cabins. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to paragraph (b) of this section, the regulations in this paragraph (c) shall apply to all existing cabins, claimants, occupants, and guests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Where a valid cabin permit or lease was in effect on December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added to the refuge, the refuge manager shall provide for the continuation of the permit or lease under the same conditions. The new permit shall be nontransferable and renewable every five years unless the continuation would directly threaten or significantly impair the purposes for which the refuge was established. The cabin and related structures are the personal property of the claimant and can be removed by him/her upon non-renewal or revocation. The owner of a cabin may sell his/her interest in the cabin to another person; however, the new owner does not automatically qualify for a permit and must apply for a new one. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To obtain a special use permit for a cabin that was not under permit or lease before December 2, 1980, or at the time the land was subsequently added to the refuge, a claimant should submit to the refuge manager an application that includes the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Reasonable proof of possessory interest or right to occupy the cabin as shown by affidavit, bill of sale, or other document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Date of construction or acquisition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A sketch or photograph that accurately depicts the cabin and related structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The dimensions of the cabin and related structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) A U.S. Geological Survey topographic map that shows the geographic location of the cabin and related structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The claimant's agreement to vacate and remove all personal property from the cabin and related structures within one year from receipt of a non-renewal or revocation notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) The claimant's acknowledgment that he/she has no legal interest in the real property on which the cabin and related structures are located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) A list of family members residing with the claimant in the cabin being applied for. It need only include those immediate family members who may be eligible to renew a permit for continued use and occupancy upon the original claimant's death (this is not applicable to cabins used for commercial purposes). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

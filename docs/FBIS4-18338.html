After the electoral defeat, polemics are raging. Carmine  Mancuso, who was reelected senator by a narrow majority, was  asking for the "head" of the movement's regional coordinator,  Pippo Russo. Antonino Caponnetto resigned from his post as  chairman of the town council, although he still remains a  councillor.    In no uncertain terms, Mancuso accused Rete's coordinator  and  "some friends of his" of having used all means at their disposal  to push him aside. "In the meeting of Rete's town councillors,"  Mancuso stated, "Russo said that I should be massacred  politically; I was supposed to be a sacrificial victim, that has  not been sacrificed." And again: "The day after my defeat, the  Mafia would have liquidated me." These are heavy words which  testify to the somber mood within Rete where, according to  Mancuso, there are some "characters whom I know very well, who  have proved they have no charisma and no personality, and who  have boycotted me systematically." These characters "believe  that democracy is made only of words, and are only aiming to get  a seat, in order to wield more power. They must now step down."  Mancuso's polemic and accusations, however, made no reference  to [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando and the Jesuit Ennio  Pintacuda. Antonino Caponnetto handed in a long letter of  resignation, in which he explained that "I have given matters a  lot of thought before reaching a decision which is right and  proper -- and is irrevocable, irrespective of any considerations  on the outcome of the elections." Caponnetto said: "An  irrefutable fact clearly emerges from all this: the  determination shown by the majority of voters in excluding, from  the new parliament, the men who are most representative of a  commitment and a struggle which today more than ever must be  pursued vigorously and resolutely -- men like myself, Alfredo  Galasso, Claudio Fava, Gaspare Nuccio, Pina Grassi, and, in  Milan, Nando Dalla Chiesa."

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Wheel of fortune wobbles Opinion polls showing the government at a nadir of popularity and the official opposition at a peak tell us nothing. If the published numbers have any meaning, it is surely that the Labour party has only one way to go: down. That being the case, the Conservatives can expect to recover some of the support they have lost since April 1992. This supposition works if you believe in the Great Wheel of Fate theory of alternating poll leads for the two tired old parties. I suspect that Mr John Smith puts his faith in another Big Wheel, the one that determines which party shall govern. The Labour leader acts as if this mechanism exists to give every Buggins his turn, if only he waits. Watch him. You would think that all he has to do is sit tight with his deputy, Mrs Margaret Beckett, in their little swing chair. When the time comes, they have merely to close their eyes, lean back and enjoy the inevitable whoosh to the heights of power. From the top of the Wheel they may peer down on Mr John Major, by then an ex-prime minister, walking disconsolately into retirement. Mr Smith would do well to note the wealth warning imposed on the financial services industry. Past performance is no guide to future outcomes. Labour has come back from nowhere before, but cannot be sure that it will do so again. Much depends upon what Mr Smith himself does. Merely positioning his party against the day when the Tories fall may not be sufficient. You could forgive the Labour leader for taking a more sanguine view. Since the collapse of communism, electorates in many countries have turned against sitting governments. In the past few months voters have badly frightened the prime minister of New Zealand and nearly exterminated Canada's Progressive Conservatives. Italians have rejected their traditional political parties. Russian voters showed at the weekend that they can be as cussed as the rest of us. It is also true that if ever a government deserved to be thrown out, it is the one we have. Britain's Conservative administration looks less like a discredited rabble today than it did before the Budget, but not much less. No party leader, least of all Mr Smith, would be foolish enough to assume that the Tories will remain in so sorry a state right through until a general election in, say, 1996. The correct supposition for any grown-up strategist must be that economic recovery plus a closing of the Conservative ranks will win back much of the support lost by the government since April 1992. Labour cannot afford to bask in its present deceptive popularity. It has to address itself to what will doubtless be a far less propitious political marketplace of the future. So far, Mr Smith has done little to instill confidence that he knows how to do this. Yet the contrary argument - that the party must simply keep itself united, stay out of trouble, and pace itself properly - has some merit. Reasonably, the Labour leader has devoted much of his first 16 1/2 months in his new job to internal housekeeping. So far the net result of this has been a disappointingly small reduction in the influence of trade unions, bought at a high price in political pledges. At the same time, Mr Smith has embraced wholesale constitutional reform, while kicking the electoral system into touch by offering a referendum. He has at least managed to prevent a party split over proportional representation. As to Europe, Labour played with parliamentary fire during the Maastricht ratification debates, and might have scuppered the bill. Yet today the opposition looks nearer to the heart of continental affairs than do the Tories. When he approaches the European Union, Mr Major walks on thin glass. At the same time, Mr Smith has paid due attention to day-to-day tactics. Labour is properly devoting much energy to reminding us that the Tories' low-tax election campaign of last year was a swindle. This week Mr Smith has withdrawn co-operation over the conduct of parliamentary business. This is a justifiable response to the government's rash attempt to rush the privatisation of sick pay and the increase in national insurance through the Commons. Perhaps Mr Major thinks everyone is too busy Christmas shopping to notice. Stories of MPs kept late on these matters might help spread the message that paying more national insurance is the same as paying more income tax, only less fair. The test for the Labour leader comes next year, the 50th anniversary of the 1944 white paper on full employment. Mr Smith has already committed his party to that half-century-old aspiration, without producing a convincing plan on how to meet it. He is more at ease with the Keynesian Delors plan to manufacture employment within the EU than was the government last week. An OECD report on the subject, due next June, is as likely as not to be critical of flexible employment policies that end in wholesale casualisation, the creation of mere MacJobs. There is a painful nerve of middle-class insecurity here, waiting for a canny political touch. Late next summer we will also see the publication of the findings of the Commission on Social Justice, set up by Mr Smith when he became leader. Under Sir Gordon Borrie, the commission aims to redefine the welfare state according to contemporary conditions of life, just over half a century since Beveridge's first attempt. This is a higher-sounding aim than that of the government, whose long-term review of social security is intended to cut costs. Yet a Labour left conference has attacked the commission's findings in advance of their preparation. This was done in the presence of Messrs Bill Morris and John Edmonds, a pair of disappointed trade union bigwigs who have found Mr Smith less malleable than they would like. One of the commission's working papers, published yesterday, sets out options for changing child benefit. The left won't like that. The Labour leader should remember that a row - call it a vigorous debate - on these matters is probably the best way of attracting public attention to changed thinking. If/when the Smith Labour party has something new and attractive to say, it had better forget about Scottish caution, shut its eyes to the temporary blips in the polls, and say it. That way, it might carry conviction, and possibly even win an election.</p>

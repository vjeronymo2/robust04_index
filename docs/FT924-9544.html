			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Painful reverse out of a cul-de-sac - The troubled carmaker VOLVO'S painful decision to close two of its three car assembly plants in Sweden is a bitter blow for the prestige of the carmaker, which has run up losses in core operations for the past seven quarters. It is a particular setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the group's increasingly autocratic chairman, who has tried for two decades to fly in the face of motor industry wisdom elsewhere by pioneering alternative car assembly systems in Sweden. Volvo's announcement that it is to close its Kalmar and Uddevalla final assembly plants is also a body-blow for successive Swedish governments' interventionist regional policies, which had sought - particularly in the 1980s - to expand the automotive industry to fill the gap left by the collapse of Swedish shipbuilding. It follows only 19 months after Saab, its smaller - and also chronically loss-making - Swedish rival was forced to close its Malmo final assembly plant, which had been modelled on the assembly methods of the Volvo plants. Financial crisis had caught up earlier with Saab, which lacked the resources of the bigger Volvo group and which was forced to close the Malmo plant less than 18 months after it had been opened, to great fanfare, on the site of the defunct Kockums shipyard. A year earlier, control of Saab had been taken over by General Motors. It had quickly become clear to the new GM management in 1990 that, while the Malmo plant was untenable in the increasingly harsh and competitive climate of the European auto industry, so too were the Volvo plants. The two Volvo facilities had been conceived in much more comfortable times, notably the more modern Uddevalla plant, which started production in 1987. When its planned construction was announced in January 1985, Volvo had just announced record earnings for 1984 and was surfing on a wave of windfall profits from the inflated US dollar, which had made it - temporarily - perhaps the world's most profitable carmaker. Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, the French carmaker and Volvo's partner in a far-reaching Franco-Swedish motor industry alliance, believes that Volvo's problems stem from its profligacy in those earlier fat years - when Renault, by contrast, was running up huge losses. 'When the money came in easily as the most profitable carmaker in the world, they spent lavishly. You see the rich cousin and the poor cousin when you look at their plants and ours,' Mr Schweitzer said yesterday. 'They have excess costs, but now they are coming to grips with their problems.' The clearest warning that Volvo had been heading up a cul-de-sac with its Scandinavian system for car assembly came from a team of academics which two years ago published The Machine That Changed The World. This was the influential treatise on world car industry production methods. It first coined the phrase 'lean production' to describe the Toyota production system which has become the model for all western carmakers. 'Simply bolting and screwing together a large number of parts in a long cycle rather than a small number in a short cycle is a very limited vision of job enrichment,' wrote the report about the Volvo system. That the Uddevalla and Kalmar plants have survived so long owes much to the stubborn vision of Mr Gyllenhammar, who took over as Volvo chief executive in 1971 and became chairman in 1983. He has much personal prestige invested in the plants, where he tried to move the production system away from the traditional Ford assembly line. The Kalmar plant opened in 1974. It was based on Mr Gyllenhammar's concepts of a work-team approach, with computer-guided carriers bringing supplies to decentralised assembly points. It has taken a severe financial crisis to force Volvo back to the basics of carmaking at its two traditional plants at Torslanda, Gothenburg, and Ghent in Belgium. The closures come at a time of rising unemployment in a country where small communities are often based around one company. There will be not just the impact of the direct job losses - 820 at Uddevalla and 800 at Kalmar - but the knock-on effect of associated job losses. Unemployment at Uddevalla is set to increase to around 20 per cent following the closure, and at Kalmar to 15 per cent. The closure decisions show that Volvo's tough new chief executive, Mr Soren Gyll, is making an early impact on the group. Far-reaching rationalisation has been probable ever since he declared in August that 'nothing is holy'. Against a background of depressed sales in the group's three main markets - Sweden, the UK and the US - the cuts seemed inevitable. Sweden has just reported that October car sales were 38 per cent down on a year ago, and analysts expect a further steep fall in sales next year as a result of Sweden's austerity programme.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The firmer tendency in Australian wool prices came to a halt this week. Despite lower offerings at the three selling centres, demand in the middle Merino Categories was insufficient to maintain firmness fully, quite apart from pushing prices into higher ground. Business has in general shown a modest improvement as the price rise did proceed, and early ideas now are that buyers are more cautious again. Buying never became fully confident, with short-term needs only being covered. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator yesterday was at 539 cents a kg.</p>

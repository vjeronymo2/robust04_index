The serious work that has begun in the  country will be continued, Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin said in Davos.    Chernomyrdin is in Switzerland to attend the world economic  forum that is in progress here.    "Russia will not divert from the path on which its has  embarked. Russia will not backtrack because market mechanisms  have already been created. But these mechanisms need to be  filled with substance. I have already said and I will say it  again that we will not lead our country to the point of shock...  But we will not be able to do without therapy either," the  premier said.    Among the main tasks of the government in 1994 Chernomyrdin  named the continuation of efforts to fight inflation in the  country.</p>

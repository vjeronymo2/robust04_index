			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 1 Jun -- Douglas Hogg, British minister of  state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, said that the  resolution due to be debated by the UN Security Council later  today concerning Yemen would be useful.    In a statement he made to KUNA on his arrival in Kuwait  today  from Manama, in the framework of his tour in the region, he  further said: We are not of the view that the declaration of  independence by South Yemen will gain recognition. He also said:  Clearly, Yemenis agree on the need to change the constitutional  situation in Yemen to bring about a completely different  situation, but at this moment we recognize one Yemeni state.    After a meeting with the Kuwaiti Defense Minister Ahmad  al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah, the British minister further said:  We do not believe that time has come to alleviate sanctions  against Iraq, and this requires Iraq to meet two conditions at  least. He said that these two conditions were Iraq's  recognition of the independence and sovereignty of the state of  Kuwait, and the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders as demarcated by the UN.  He also said that amongst the necessary and important  conditions to alleviate the sanctions is Iraq's heeding of the  UN Security Council resolutions concerning its arms of mass  destruction, and its commitment to the measures concerning this.  Hogg said he believed these requirements would not be met this  year.    Hogg also said that his talks with the Kuwaiti defense  minister confirmed the British-Kuwaiti common defense and  strategic interests, noting that Britain was very interested in  Kuwait's independence and security.    He said that the purpose of his visit to Kuwait was to  discuss numerous issues of common interest with Kuwaiti  officials. He described British-Kuwaiti relations as being  excellent.    Hogg is expected to hold a meeting tomorrow with Prime  Minister Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdullah Al-Salim, the deputy speaker  of the National Assembly and a number of local and foreign  businessmen.    The British minister will tomorrow afternoon visit Khawr  Abdullah base where UNIKOM [United Nations Iraq-Kuwait  Observation Mission] forces are stationed, and will also inspect  the border demarcation line approved by the UN Security  Council's resolution 833. The British minister will hold a news  conference tomorrow afternoon.    The Kuwaiti defense minister said that the meeting he held  with Mr. Hogg dealt with a number of issues, both bilateral and  regional.    Shaykh al-Hamud added that his meeting with the British  official was the fourth of its kind in three years and hailed  Britain's support for the Kuwaiti rights through the UN Security  Council.</p>

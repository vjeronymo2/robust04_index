			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / VW expects Seat pact today: Closure of Barcelona plant will cost Germans some Pta30bn Volkswagen, the German car group, is expected to secure agreement today to close down the Barcelona plant of Seat, its loss-making Spanish subsidiary. The deal, between Seat's management, the unions and the local authorities, is also to shed temporarily 40 per cent of the company's labour force, a total of 9,000 jobs, in the biggest single lay-off in Spain's industrial history. The struggle by the German giant to reach agreement for the closure of Seat's sprawling and mostly obsolete Zona Franca factory on the city's outskirts has been costly as well as time-consuming and marked by strikes and by clashes with riot police in central Barcelona. Seat has three plants in Spain and it opened a new plant west of Barcelona earlier this year. The attempt to streamline Seat has sharply illustrated both the rigidities of Spanish labour legislation, which the government intends to reform, and the power of Spain's trade unions, which have called for a 24-hour general strike next month to protest against the government's reforms plans. Under the terms said to have been agreed yesterday with unions, management and the regional government, Seat is committed to re-employing within two years 4,600 workers who have fixed employment contracts, and it is bound to make up unemployment benefits to ensure that the laid-off workers will be receiving at least 80 per cent of their take home pay. The cost of the settlement, which includes Pta5m (Pounds 24,500) cash payments for employees accepting early retirement, is conservatively estimated to be costing Volkswagen's Spanish unit Pta30bn and could represent as much again for Spain's hard-pressed social security system. The management, which hopes that part of its laid-off labour force will be absorbed by a components manufacturing industrial park that is scheduled to occupy the site of the Zona Franca plant, had initially refused to guarantee re-hiring employees and baulked at adding to the unemployment benefits. Apparently rattled by the violent drift that Seat worker demonstrations were taking in central Barcelona, the Catalonian government last week persuaded the company's management to raise its terms, gaining a grudging union assent to the lay-offs. The irony of the settlement is that it could have been considerably less costly for the management had it been able to wait for the government's planned labour market reforms before implementing the cutbacks. But the company wanted to act swiftly - in the first nine months this year it posted losses of Pta87bn, and Volkswagen has made a Pta120bn cash injection to rescue Seat's 1993 balance sheet conditional on the closure of the Barcelona plant before the end of this year. The draft of the government's labour reform law, which is expected to be on the statute book by next summer, allows companies to reduce their labour force for organisational and production reasons - both of which could be plausibly argued by Seat following the opening of its new plant - and to pay off redundant workers with 20 days of salary per year worked up to a maximum of 42 months of pay. Had this new legislation been in place two years ago, when Seat was making money and planning to shift its production out of its Barcelona base, the car producer could have adjusted its labour force far less painfully. Under the current labour legislation, a company has to argue impending bankruptcy, as Seat has done over the past two months, before it can lay off workers. Or it must be prepared to pay unfair dismissal settlements which by law represent a minimum of 45 days of salary per year worked - an expense that is even greater than the lay-off procedure chosen by Seat.</p>

Although certain reports had indicated  that the new cabinet list would be released today, a communique  has disclosed that the prime minister has adjourned the meeting  he convened for this morning to confer with party leaders. The  communique stressed that the meeting was adjourned due to the  absence of opposition political leaders. Sources close to the  prime minister, whom the head of state has asked to confer with  all the political parties to establish a priority action  program, indicate that the prime minister is continuing his  consultations. Gabon is one of the African countries that will  appear before the IMF next week to have their letters of intent  examined.</p>

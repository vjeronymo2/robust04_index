			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA BANS FLYERS ON WINDSHIELDS  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council has banned the distribution of commercial  handbills on car windshields.  </P> <P> The anti-handbill ordinance, approved by a 3-2 vote Tuesday night, would impose  a $50 fine on anyone distributing the handbills on private property without the  permission of the property owner. A violator could be fined up to $250 for  repeated violations within one year.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy proposed the measure, calling handbills a nuisance  and litter problem.  </P> <P> Councilmen Howard P. (Buck) McKeon and Dennis Koontz voted against the  ordinance. McKeon said he disliked finding handbills on his windshield but said  he did not want to limit the ability of small business owners to advertise.  </P> <P> The ordinance is constitutional because it does not affect non-commercial  handbills, such as those carrying religious or political messages, said  Assistant City Atty. Michael Woods. State courts have recognized the right of  cities to regulate commercial speech, he said.  </P></p>

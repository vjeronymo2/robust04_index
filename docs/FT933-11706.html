			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel The Queen and President Mitterrand clearly knew a thing or two when they agreed to open the Channel tunnel on May 6. The day after that announcement, Eurotunnel and TML trumpet a partial settlement ensuring an early opening and prompting a surge in Eurotunnel's share price. The mist has finally lifted; it is now possible to envisage the red ribbon being cut. The settlement, though, is far from comprehensive. It is, in fact, a Bank of England-inspired fudge. Both sides win something from the settlement; neither gets everything they desire. Eurotunnel is assured of the phased opening, minimising lost revenues. But it has dropped its claims against TML for late opening. The contractors no longer have to fund the final stages themselves. They receive Pounds 235m of cash although they still have to justify keeping it. The new co-operative spirit may allow a relatively painless settlement of the Pounds 100m or so which is still in dispute. The contractors may yet be able to release some of their collective Pounds 200m provisions. Eurotunnel can use existing borrowing facilities to pay the Pounds 235m. But the creation of an additional Pounds 120m standby facility shows the tightness of its financial position. This makes it all the more imperative to raise another Pounds 1bn next year. The rights issue prospectus will certainly make interesting reading since Eurotunnel is unlikely to pay a dividend until next century. The board may also care to explain why it wrangled with TML for so long when a settlement last autumn could have saved it more than Pounds 200m of lost revenues.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Sunspot activity is rapidly increasing and could reach record levels within  months, possibly threatening radio transmissions, satellites and electrical  systems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. The  current sunspot cycle began in 1986 and is expected to peak by the end of this  year or the beginning of 1990, according to Joseph Hirman of NOAA's Space  Environment Service Center in Boulder, Colo. Increasing solar activity and  subsequent bursts of radiation have already had serious effects. In March, a  solar flare precipitated a power blackout in Canada, interfered with some  satellites and provoked an intense display of the northern lights.  </P></p>

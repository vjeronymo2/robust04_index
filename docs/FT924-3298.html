			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Warning as German banks show growth TWO MORE large German banks reported robust growth in profits for the first 10 months of the year, providing further evidence of the resilience of the banking sector amid deepening economic gloom in Germany. But both the Dresdner Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank warned of the need for sharply increased risk provisioning. Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest bank, yesterday reported group total operating profits up 16.6 per cent to DM2.37bn (Dollars 1.49bn). Partial operating profits - which exclude any contribution from own-account trading  -rose at a higher rate, by nearly 19 per cent to DM2.09bn. The Bayerische Vereinsbank said its group partial operating profits rose by 20.5 per cent to DM1.2bn. At the parent bank, partial operating profits climbed by more than 25.3 per cent to DM775m. The bank said full operating profits for both parent and group climbed at a higher rate, but gave no precise figure. Mr Wolfgang Roller, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, warned that, when the full-year accounts were drawn up, the bank would have to make big provisions to cover bad and doubtful debts. This reflected the state of the economy and 'unsatisfactory' credit environment. This theme was echoed by Mr Albrecht Schmidt, chief executive of the Vereinsbank. The Federal Cartel Office in Berlin has decided that proposed business co-operation between the Dresdner Bank and Allianz can go ahead. Yesterday's announcement removes the last regulatory obstacle to the two institutions' plans. In September cartel authorities found Allianz's 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner was not anti-competitive. The agreement envisages a cross-marketing of each others' services across a number of German federal states.</p>

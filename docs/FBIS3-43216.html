			<p>Summary:      The meeting between Saudi King Fahd and PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat on 24 January (reported by Saudi radio) marked the  culmination of a steady improvement in Saudi-PLO relations in recent  weeks.  Signs of impending rapprochement were visible as early as  late December, when the expatriate publication AL-MAJALLAH  prominently displayed a picture of PLO Chairman 'Arafat warmly  greeting the Saudi Ambassador to London.  Other evidence of  improving relations, including the recent exchanges of letters and  PLO officials' visits to the kingdom, were chronicled in an early  January article in the expatriate daily AL-HAYAH.      'Arafat Meets Saudi Ambassador in London      Initial evidence of Saudi-PLO rapprochement appeared in the 26  December issue of AL-MAJALLAH, a London Arabic-language weekly  magazine, which prominently displayed at the top of its Society page  a picture of Yasir 'Arafat warmly greeting and shaking hands with  Saudi Ambassador to London Gazzi al-Qusayby during the PLO  chairman's state visit to Britain earlier that month.      AL-HAYAH Notes Improving Saudi-PLO Relations      The London-based and Saudi-owned daily AL-HAYAH published an  article by Sulayman Nasr on 7 January that assessed improvements in  Saudi-PLO relations in recent weeks.  Nasr emphasized several signs  of increasingly cordial relations:  the first public exchange of  letters since the onset of the Gulf War between Saudi King Fahd and  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and recent visits by several Fatah  Central Committee members and Faysal al-Husayni, chief Palestinian  negotiator in the peace talks.      Exchange of Letters      According to the article, 'Arafat's letter to King Fahd expressed  "congratulations on the opening of the Consultative Council," the  Majlis al-Shura, and "deep gratitude for the continuous brotherly  support (he) extended to the Palestinian people."      King Fahd reportedly replied in a cable published by the Saudi  Press Agency on 6 January:  "With my appreciation for what you, your  dear people, and your brothers expressed, I ask God Almighty for all  to succeed in benefitting our Arab and Islamic nation and to attain  its virtuous objectives, in the forefront of which are the hopes and  the objectives of the Palestinian people at this important stage of  its history, as it builds its institutions as a foundation for  establishing an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, God  willing."  Nasr stressed that the publication of the exchange  between King Fahd and 'Arafat was "the first time" that Saudi media  had published a cable from the Saudi monarch to 'Arafat since the  outbreak of the Gulf crisis and the ensuing deterioration of Saudi-  PLO relations.     Nasr further noted that 'Arafat had previously sent King Fahd  several cables and congratulatory letters which had elicited no  published Saudi response.  Nasr speculated that the failure to  respond had been due to Saudi "reservations about dealing with the  Palestinian president since the outbreak of the Gulf crisis," noting  specifically the repeated Saudi rejection of "rapprochement with  'Arafat," despite his attempts to visit Saudi Arabia.      Fatah Members Visit the Kingdom      In addition to the exchange of messages, Nasr reported that a  Palestinian delegation from the Fatah Central Committee visited  Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral of the Palestinian ambassador to  Riyadh, Subhi Abu-Karsh (Abu al-Mundhir), who was buried in al-  Madinah on 5 January.  The delegation consisted of Salim Za'nun,  vice president of the Palestine National Council, 'Abbas Zaki, Nasr  Yusuf, and Intisar al-Wazir (Umm Jihad), as well as a number of  other officials.  According to the author, the delegation visited  the kingdom for "humanitarian reasons" and did not meet with any  Saudi officials.  However, Nasr observed that "this is the first  time this many Fatah officials have visited Saudi Arabia" since the  Gulf crisis.      Visit by Faysal al-Husayni      Nasr also underscored the importance of the month-long visit of  Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, "one of the most prominent  officials from inside Palestine."  According to Nasr, al-Husayni's  visit was limited "to bringing the Saudis up-to-date" on  developments in the occupied territories, in particular those  concerning Jerusalem, "which holds special value for Saudi Arabia."  While there, however, al-Husayni held a private meeting with "a  high-ranking Saudi official," in addition to his "official meeting"  with Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal on 26 December.  The  journalist speculated that al-Husayni "no doubt" discussed with the  Saudis political matters related to the Palestinians, including the  roadblocks facing the implementation of the PLO-Israel Declaration  of Principles.  The article concluded by stating that al-Husayni  conveyed his "strong satisfaction" with his informal meetings with  Saudi officials and with their views regarding "the Palestinian  issue, its latest developments, the Saudi approach to this issue,  and the continuous Saudi support for the Palestinian people,  especially those who are under occupation."

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Arts: La Scala Philharmonic This orchestra is substantially that which plays for operatic productions at the Milan theatre of the same name. A decade ago, when Claudio Abbado was La Scala's music director, he determined to give the band the chance to broaden its scope with purely symphonic concerts, and now under Carlo Maria Giulini's guidance the orchestra, taking its mission very seriously, has a Beethoven symphony cycle underway, being recorded by Sony. At its London debut in Barbican Hall on Monday night, the orchestra under Giulini showed us what it can do with the eighth and third symphonies. Alas, it was not much at all. Good symphony orchestras are ever in short supply in Italy and La Scala Philharmonic sets a high enough technical standard to give its compatriot ensembles pause; but on Monday's evidence one is bound to say that this orchestra cannot begin to compare with those which routinely occupy London's halls. That the concert should have been promoted as part of a 'Great Orchestras of the World' series was entirely preposterous. The violins were sprightly (the leader impressive); there were odd moments of individual flair (first bassoon in the eighth symphony's third movement); the overall sound was solid, on occasion vigorous, and steadfastly unlovely. That in itself is not a decisive objection in the performance of these works: Beethoven's orchestration is hardly a sensuous treat. But it mattered greatly that ensemble was so consistently loose and intonation so unreliable. The woodwind were the sourest offenders in the latter regard: I have seldom heard such crashingly indifferent woodwind playing. Most perturbing of all, though, was Giulini's indifference. The vibrant spirituality for which his interpretations are famed had given place here to dull, dutiful, Kapellmeister-ish time-beating. Tempi were plodding, attention to dynamic shading was minimal, and hardly any desire to secure refinement of phrasing was evinced. The performances were not without sonorous energy but it was of a crude, over-driven sort such as threatened to overwhelm and crush the first movement of the light-boned eighth symphony. The Eroica was sluggish and untidy and remarkably uninspired. Barbican Hall Sponsored by Lehman Brothers International</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Management: Good intentions are not enough - Britain's charities are big business but only a minority of trustees understand their financial, legal and managerial responsibilities Once upon a time, there was a Pounds 17bn-turnover business sector with 220,000 employees, full of companies run by people who did not know whether or not they were non-executive directors. This sounds like the beginning of a corporate fairy-tale; it is, however, present-day reality for Britain's voluntary sector. A survey into the training needs of charity trustees has made the remarkable discovery that only one-third of volunteers serving on management committees knew whether they were trustees of their charities. Since this year's Charities Act has greatly strengthened trustees' legal responsibilities, some are in danger of learning the answer to the question at their personal cost. Tomorrow, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Charity Commission will publish the findings of a working party which has examined ways of increasing the effectiveness of trustees and management committees. The report reveals widespread lack of awareness among trustees of their roles and responsibilities, allied to uncertainties about how lay committee members should interact with full-time managers. There are an estimated 1m people serving as trustees of charities and other voluntary organisations in Britain, and up to 3m members of management committees. The voluntary sector over which they preside is going through a period of extensive change. Government encouragement of voluntary organisations taking over the delivery of welfare services from the public sector, a shift from grants to a contract-based funding system, pressures from corporate supporters for efficiency, and straightforward competition between charities for funds, are all propelling the voluntary sector towards a more businesslike management style. Trustees have wide-ranging legal, financial and managerial responsibilities that have been fortified by the new act. They may be held personally responsible if they fail in their duties. But, as the working party's report points out, their liabilities are increasing at the very time when - because of the shift towards a more businesslike culture - their actual involvement in management could decrease. 'Professional staff will be taking the lead role in contract negotiations and contract management, and there will be a danger that trustees are simply left to rubber stamp their decisions.' Issues raised by the report concerning the relationship between charity trustees and managers mirror the current debate in the private sector over strengthening the role of non-executive directors. Voluntary workers see a number of possible dangers in charities becoming too powerfully driven by full-time managers. One is the risk that voluntary organisations will lose sight of their social objectives, with professional managers becoming over-concerned with winning service contracts in competition with other organisations. Another is the straightforward danger of fraud if trustees are not adequately equipped to scrutinise the activities of full-time staff. The report says that demarcation problems between trustees and senior managers are a source of considerable tension in some charities, with failure to sort out such problems a 'major source of breakdowns in effective management and governance'. To ensure that trustees are properly equipped for their responsibilities, the report calls for radical changes in their recruitment and training. By undergoing proper training and raising the profile of their role, trustees would 'be encouraged to be assertive enough to scrutinise the management of their organisations'. A typical trustee is over 45 years of age, white, from a professional background and is likely to be male. Members of ethnic minorities are under-represented, but proportionately less so than white working-class people. This is partly because charities tend to recruit individuals who already possess financial, managerial and similar expertise to their management committees. But, argues the report, there is more to being a trustee than simply possessing business experience or professional skills, and the sector must find ways of broadening its recruitment base. To widen the pool from which trustees are drawn, suggests the report, there is a need for training in committee work, decision-making, communications, negotiating and related skills to be made available before prospective trustees join committees. There might, suggests the report, be scope for a qualification in trusteeship. Much of the existing training available to trustees is, says the report, 'inaccessible, inappropriate or ignored.' One explanation for its being ignored is provided by the working party's survey of existing trustees - while many agreed training was needed, they implied that it was more appropriate for fellow trustees than for themselves. Tact in the presentation of training activities, suggests the working party, should help to overcome this problem. 'Although a trustee might be reluctant to attend a training course for trustees, he or she might happily take part in a strategic planning meeting, attend a briefing on charity law or participate in the organisation's internal review.' Large charities including Save the Children, Barnardos and Mind have begun formalising the induction of trustees and committee members. But nationally, only an estimated 20 per cent of charity trustees receive formal introduction to the work of the organisations they join, with fewer than 15 per cent receiving training directly related to trustee work. The working party wants to see a range of new training initiatives developed, including a standard information pack for voluntary organisations and expansion of developments like the voluntary sector management course launched by the Open University last year. It says the Charity Commission should play a leading role in trying to persuade the government, local authorities and other funders to invest in improved provision of advice, support and training for trustees. Improved training alone would not necessarily broaden the base from which most trustees are selected. To achieve this, the working party wants employers to encourage trusteeship among their staff by offering paid time-off - it compares this with organisations including British Gas, IBM and Esso already allowing employees time off to serve as school governors. It hopes the CBI, Industrial Society and Institute of Directors will promote a campaign to explain the role of trustees and attract more recruits from industry. Some charities, like Barnardos, require trustees to give written confirmation that they understand the responsibilities they are taking on and such an approach is endorsed by the working party: trustees should, it says, be encouraged to consider at least once a year whether they were willing to continue in office. 'It is essential that trustees are aware of the responsibilities they are taking on. Although they may delegate the work involved in these responsibilities to paid staff, they cannot delegate or avoid the responsibilities themselves.' One trustee described the life-cycle of trusteeship to the working party as follows. 'Start as an energetic ignoramus; make every possible mistake for five years; leave as an exhausted expert.' If the working party's proposals for better trustee training succeed, they should at least help shorten stage two of the cycle.

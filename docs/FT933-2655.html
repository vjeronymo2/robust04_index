			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / LIG falls after new profit warning ANALYSTS yesterday slashed annual profits forecasts for London International Group from about Pounds 35m to Pounds 18m as the world's leading branded condom manufacturer issued its second profits warning in seven months and announced the early retirement of chief executive, Mr Tony Butterworth. Earlier this year analysts had been expecting annual profits of about Pounds 40m. The shares tumbled 63p on last night's news to close at 140p. LIG, which was censured by the stock exchange in May for issuing an informal profits warning to a select group of 13 brokers and four institutions, said yesterday difficulties in its photoprocessing business would leave interim profits 'very substantially lower' than last year. Mr Alan Woltz, chairman, said the group had been disappointed by another poor season in the photo division, leaving it with a small loss in the half-year to September 30. The health and personal products division had been hit by recession and restructuring, Mr Woltz said, although it would enjoy a stronger second half. Gearing remained high, around 100 per cent. Analysts were taken aback by the extent of the warning and some were dismayed to see Mr Butterworth depart. 'It was a surprise,' said Ms Jacqueline Cantle of Smith New Court. 'We did not expect trading to be that good but the extent of the shortfall is greater than we had expected.' SNC estimated photoprocessing had incurred losses of Pounds 2m, in spite of cost savings of Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m in the past 12 months. Some speculated that the announcement of LIG's strategic review would result in the disposal or closure of the photo business. 'Either they will sort that out,' said Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett, 'or someone else will do it for them.' LIG was careful to take a cautious approach in its annual general meeting statement. Analysts, who found it difficult to pitch forecasts following discussions with a reticent LIG, said the group was nervous of incurring further censure from the stock exchange. 'They seem terrified to do anything unless they are talking to 50 people all at one time,' one said. The group announced that Mr Butterworth, 56, would be replaced by managing director Mr Nick Hodges, 54.</p>

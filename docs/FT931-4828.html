			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Equity slump in Japan prompts Salomon revamp THE prolonged slump of the Tokyo stock market has forced Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, to restructure its Tokyo operations. Salomon, which raked in profits from computer-driven programme trading, was virtually unaffected by the fall in commissions due to the decline in trading volume. However, it has fallen victim to the fall in market volatility caused by the Japanese government's stock market support operations to stabilise share prices. The US house plans to cut 60 jobs in back-office and administrative operations for its Japanese equities division through voluntary retirement. Salomon is also considering moving out of its expensive location in the heart of Tokyo's business centre, which also houses the stock and bond trading headquarters of Nomura Securities and the Tokyo branch of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The move by Salomon follows a wave of restructuring moves by other foreign brokerages. County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank, gave up membership on the Tokyo exchange last December, and Merrill Lynch recently announced the closure of its three retail branches. US securities houses, with expertise in stock futures and options trading, have been the leading earners in the Tokyo stock market, using arbitrage to exploit the difference in prices between the cash markets and the stock index futures markets. However, the recent lack of price movements due to market support by the Japanese government has depressed arbitrage possibilities. In addition, Japanese and other foreign brokers have entered the arbitrage business, and the increase in market participants has narrowed profit chances. Salomon said it would focus on domestic and international bond trading businesses, and investment banking, including capital raising and strategic client services.  ---------------------------------------------------- TOP FIVE FOREIGN BROKERS IN JAPAN Pre-tax profits for half-year to September 1992  ----------------------------------------------------                        (Ybn)     % change on year Morgan Stanley         12.66           -2.4 Salomon Bros            7.41          -53.8 Swiss Bank Corp         3.06           +9.2 Goldman Sachs           2.25          -65.8 Societe Generale        2.16          -66.7  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WON 5 ACADEMY AWARDS, WROTE 'BODY AND SOUL';  </P> <P> COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR JOHN GREEN DIES AT AGE 80  </P> <P> Composer-conductor-pianist-music executive John Green, whose film work won him  five Academy Awards and whose songs include "Body and Soul," "Out of Nowhere"  and "I Cover the Waterfront," died at his Beverly Hills home Monday night, it  was announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Frank Liberman, a family friend and publicist, said the diminutive, personable  musician was 80 and had suffered a stroke two years ago. The official cause of  death was listed as pulmonary edema, Liberman added.  </P> <P> Green, who wrote his first hit, "Coquette," while he was still a senior at  Harvard, was a dapper, confident and uncommonly articulate man whose trademark  was the fresh carnation he wore in his lapel every day. He said the flower was  to remind him of the beauty in the world and of his obligation to protect and  extend it if he could.  </P> <P> Long a fixture at Hollywood Bowl summer concerts, he was born to a wealthy and  cultured New York family. His father was a banker and builder after whom the  community of Greenhaven, Long Island, is named.  </P> <P> Green began piano lessons at age 3 and loved them. When he was 12 he was taken  to a party honoring George Gershwin, a friend of the family. The boy was asked  to perform for the composer and, marching to the piano, played his own  arrangement of one of Gershwin's songs.  </P> <P> Gershwin was evidently impressed and Green became a Gershwin protege and  lifelong friend. Green remembered, at 16, attending the premiere of "Rhapsody  in Blue" in New York. "The bloody place blew up," Green said.  </P> <P> In later years Green arranged much of Gershwin's music for movies and records,  including a delightful album of vocals by Fred Astaire. One of Green's Oscars  was for the scoring of "An American in Paris," based on Gershwin's music. Green  also frequently performed Gershwin in concert.  </P> <P> The elder Green wanted his son to go into Wall Street. Reluctantly but  dutifully, Green rushed through the rigorous, progressive Horace Mann School  and entered Harvard at 15, majoring in economics.  </P> <P> But he was already deeply involved in music and spent the summer between his  junior and senior years living in Cleveland and writing arrangements for the  new Guy Lombardo orchestra. (One of his pals that summer was the young  publicist for a Cleveland movie house named Lew R. Wasserman, who in subsequent  years was Green's agent at MCA and eventually head of that giant entertainment  company.)  </P> <P> But Green's father remained unimpressed. "Son," his father told him, "you can  be a good banker, a good lawyer or doctor and you'll be a proud, respected  citizen in the community. But there is no bum in the world like an artist who  is merely good, and I'm afraid as a musician you are merely good."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Took Wall Street Job  </P> <P> Green graduated from Harvard in 1928 at only 19. Despite the fact that his  early song "Coquette" was the biggest sheet-music seller in the country, he  bowed to his father's will and took a job on Wall Street. "I was a sissy to do  it," he confessed years afterward.  </P> <P> He used his music royalties to pay for visits to a psychiatrist. Then, after  six months, he defied his father, quit his job and became a rehearsal pianist  at the Paramount studio in Astoria, Long Island, for $50 a week.  </P> <P> He was also writing songs, often partnered with lyricist Edward Heyman, a  friend of friends, a wealthy young Midwesterner whose family had prospered in  sausage casings. In 1931, they wrote a package of four songs for Gertrude  Lawrence for $250.  </P> <P> "One of them had to be a comedy number, one an up-tempo item, one a ballad, one  a torch song. The torch song was 'Body and Soul,' " Green said not long ago.  Did he know he was writing a classic? a reporter asked him. "I only knew I was  writing for Gertie for Wednesday," Green said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Copyright Sold  </P> <P> Green and Heyman had actually sold the copyrights to the singer. But when  another singer, Libby Holman, asked permission to use the song in her own act,  Lawrence generously gave the song back to Green and Heyman. As it turned out,  the royalties from "Body and Soul" would have assured their lifetime solvency  if nothing else had. A favorite with both singers and jazz instrumentalists, it  is one of the most-recorded songs in the repertoire.  </P> <P> During his Astoria stay with Paramount, Green did his first bit of  movie-scoring, an arrangement of "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me" for  Maurice Chevalier. Green is also credited with the music for a forgotten 1930  film called "The Sap from Syracuse."  </P> <P> In 1932, Green conducted the house orchestra for the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz  Hart musical "By Jupiter," and at the time his principal ambition was to write  for the musical theater. He wrote show tunes for Jack Buchanan and other  performers, but the one musical he wrote a few years later closed out of town,  in Boston, and he did not try another.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formed Dance Orchestra  </P> <P> At the suggestion of William Paley of CBS, Green (who then was still Johnny  rather than John) formed a dance orchestra. It opened the St. Regis roof, a  posh new night club that opened after the repeal of Prohibition.  </P> <P> Green was also the orchestra leader on several coast-to-coast radio programs,  including the Philip Morris Hour, the Packard Hour with Fred Astaire and the  Jell-O Show. His sidemen on the early radio shows included Artie Shaw and Benny  Goodman (in the same reed section), Tommy Dorsey and Bunny Berigan.  </P> <P> Green and the orchestra starred in a memorable short, "Music Magic," in which  trick photography reduced Green to a Tom Thumb miniature amid the full-sized  band. The film is still occasionally shown on television. He remained an  orchestra leader until 1939, when he gave it up to try his hand at the  unsuccessful musical.  </P> <P> In 1942, Green left New York for Los Angeles. He did a season as musical  director of the Jack Benny radio show, doubling as a comic foil specializing in  dialects. He also began his major work as a film composer, initially at Metro  Goldwyn Mayer, where he scored, among others, "Bathing Beauty," "Easter Parade"  (for which he won an Oscar), "The Great Caruso," "Brigadoon" and "Raintree  County."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MGM Musical Director  </P> <P> For a decade, 1949-58, Green was musical director at MGM, an executive position  in which he earned a reputation as a hard but fair taskmaster. He could imagine  his father, Green said, whirling in his grave at the thought of his son being  more than a musician at last.  </P> <P> But Green chafed at overseeing the work of others. "I'm glad I had the guts to  assign myself the music for 'Raintree County,' " he said in a Times interview  in 1973. It was the film music of which he was proudest and was nominated for  an Academy Award (one of 14 nominations in his career), but lost to Malcolm  Arnold's score for "Bridge on the River Kwai."  </P> <P> He left MGM for a similar role as musical director at Desilu and, after a brief  stint, became a free lancer, winning two more Oscars for the musical direction  of "West Side Story" in 1961 and "Oliver!" in 1968.  </P> <P> His fifth Academy Award was as producer of an MGM musical short based on "The  Merry Wives of Windsor Overture."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guest Conductor  </P> <P> Green recalled seeing his first performance at the Hollywood Bowl in 1921, a  concert version of "Carmen." He returned to the Bowl as a guest artist in 1945.  Then in 1949, he began a series of appearances as a guest conductor of pops  concerts that lasted without interruption until 1966, when he was away in  London for two years working on "Oliver!"  </P> <P> During this period Green also conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic's  Promenade concerts of light classics (1959-63). He continued to conduct at the  Bowl for several years after his return from London, making his 32nd appearance  in the summer of 1984.  </P> <P> In later years, he appeared as conductor and pianist with several symphony  orchestras across the country. His one-movement symphony, "Mine Eyes Have  Seen," was commissioned by the Denver Symphony and performed at the dedication  of its Boettcher Concert Hall in 1978. In June, 1988, in conjunction with the  60th reunion of his Harvard class, Green conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed Name  </P> <P> As he moved out of song-writing into more serious conducting, he was persuaded  that "Johnny" was insufficiently dignified and he became John Green, although  he remained Johnny to old acquaintances.  </P> <P> He was a four-term director of the American Society of Composers, Authors and  Publishers and had been active as a fund-raiser and mentor for the Young  Musicians Foundation, among several other organizations. He was a longtime vice  president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and chairman of  its music branch. He conducted the Academy Award presentations 10 times.  Pepperdine University gave him an honorary degree in 1981.  </P> <P> Green was married three times. His first was to debutante Carol Koshland when  he was 20. By his second wife, television consumerist Betty Furness, he had a  daughter, Barbara, an actress in Los Angeles. In 1943, he married Bonnie  Waters, a statuesque actress who was under contract at MGM. She survives him  along with their two daughters, Kathy, a composer-performer who lives in New  York, and Christopher Allyson (Kim) Green-Meglio of Los Angeles. Four  grandchildren also survive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attended Luncheon  </P> <P> Although he had suffered a stroke in October, 1987, and had been in failing  health since then, he attended a luncheon in his honor given by the Pacific  Pioneer Broadcasters last September when he was saluted by fellow film  composers Henry Mancini, John Williams and Arthur Hamilton, among others.  </P> <P> In what turned out to be his last public tribute, the Beverly Hills Pops  Orchestra gave a concert in Green's honor on his 80th birthday, last Oct. 10  with Bill Conti conducting and songs performed by Dinah Shore, Tony Martin,  Rosemary Clooney and Carol Lawrence.  </P> <P> He had remained active until a few days before his death, producing as recently  as last Sunday the annual gala for the John Douglas French Foundation for  Alzheimer's Disease, of which he was a founder.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the foundation said that although confined to a wheelchair, he  had lined up the talent for the fund-raiser and "did everything but conduct the  orchestra," as he usually did.  </P> <P> Mrs. Green said there will be a private celebration of her husband's life on  Monday. In lieu of flowers, donations are asked to the French Foundation, 11620  Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90025 or to the Bel-Air Presbyterian Church, where  a new organ will bear his name.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, 6 May (MENA)--Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel has affirmed that the objectives of the upcoming  bilateral meetings with President Husni Mubarak are to establish  joint cooperation between the two countries and to formulate a  general framework on this subject.    In an exclusive interview with the MENA correspondent in  Ankara dealing with his visit to Egypt, which will begin  tomorrow, Saturday [7 May], the Turkish president said that the  resources of Egypt and Turkey could together contribute to  establishing peace and stability in the Middle East.    Demirel added that he agreed with President Mubarak to  eliminate all barriers and protocols and to meet at any time.  They also agreed to stay in continuous contact to negotiate  various bilateral and international issues of mutual interest.    President Demirel said that both he and President Mubarak  realize their important responsibilities since Egypt and Turkey  have so much influence on the course of events in the Middle  East and can preserve security and stability in the region.    He added that if Egypt is considered a gateway to Africa,  Turkey is considered a gateway to the Islamic republics in  Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe.    In his speech, Demirel praised President Husni Mubarak's  wisdom in overcoming the problem that emerged during the  ceremony held in Cairo on Wednesday to sign the Israeli-PLO  Agreement.    He clarified that he telephoned President Mubarak to  congratulate him on his wisdom, which saved the agreement from  collapse before it even started.    President Demirel said that we consider the agreement signed  by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo an important step in  establishing peace. We believe it will pave the way for and  open the door to the aspired for peace.    The Turkish president said in his interview with the MENA  correspondent in Ankara that when peace is established in the  Middle East we can then benefit from the large potential in the  region.    Demirel added that after the former Soviet Union collapsed,  the independent Islamic republics emerged, which Egypt and  Turkey are cooperating with in various social, cultural, and  economic fields to serve them.    Answering a question on the Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi economic  cooperation, Demirel said that the Israeli-PLO agreement, which  was signed on Wednesday in Cairo, will make it easy to realize  this cooperation. In this regard, he affirmed that Egypt and  Turkey have very good relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.    On the Turkish role in the Middle East peace process,  President Demirel said that Turkey has very good relations with  Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel.    He added that relations with Israel were limited until Egypt  and Israel signed the peace treaty that opened the door to  Turkey to develop relations with Israel.    The Turkish president said that contacts between his country  and Israel continue. He pointed out that it is possible during  the coming stage to establish peace agreements between Israel  and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.    On the Turkish stance regarding the idea of a Middle East  common market, President Demirel said that he believes such a  market can be established in time. However, he noted that a  common market requires certain developments in the region, such  as the return of Iraq to the international community.    He said that Iraq's return to the international community is  not Turkey's idea alone, but that some leaders of Islamic  countries share it.    Demirel affirmed that Iraq's return to the international  community as soon as possible could open the opportunity of  launching the concept of the Middle Eastern market. However, he  said that he does not know how Iraq's return should be handled.    On the international sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Turkish  president said these sanctions have not affected the Iraqi  Government or Iraqi President Saddam Husayn but the Iraqi  people, who are suffering from the shortage of their basic needs  of medicine and food. He added that Turkey has also suffered as  a result of these sanctions, noting that its losses since the  outbreak of the Gulf War have reached approximately $20 billion.    Asked about the differences between Ankara and Washington  over the repair of the Iraqi oil pipeline passing through  Turkey, President Demirel said his country is losing  approximately $4 billion annually as a result of the closure of  this pipeline. For this reason Turkey calls for the economic  blockade of Iraq to be lifted as a way of overcoming Turkey's  economic problems. He explained that the nonuse of the Iraqi  pipeline for an extended amount of time will damage it. He said  he is confident that in the next few days officials in  Washington will realize the need for carrying out maintenance  work on this pipeline.    Regarding the water problem, President Demirel explained  that  the Euphrates River also passes through Syria and Iraq. He said  Turkey is building 12 dams on the river to regulate its water  flow. He said his country has not yet begun the full  exploitation of these waters for generating electricity or for  agriculture. He said he hopes that Turkey will begin  exploiting these waters for generating electricity after these  dams are completed. He stressed that Turkey has no intention of  depriving neighboring countries of water.    Regarding the differences between Turkey and Greece, Demirel  accused Greece of providing shelter for the supporters of the  banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK].    He said Turkey does not object to a solution of the Cyprus  problem provided it is not an imposed solution. This is because  there are at least 150,000 Muslim citizens in the Turkish sector  of Cyprus while the Greek community lives in the other sector.  He added that an imposed solution on either party will not be  permanent and comprehensive. Therefore, there is a need for  dialogue.    Regarding the political solution proposed by some European  countries for the problem in southeast Turkey, President  Demirel condemned all acts of terrorism, describing them as a  human crime abhorred by religion and society. He said Turkey  cannot hold a dialogue with a terrorist band or organization  that kills innocent civilians. He added that no political  solution can be reached with a terrorist organization under any  pressure because the PKK uses terrorism. He said we will not  negotiate with terrorists and will not compromise on Turkey's  territorial unity.    On Turkey's role in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem,  Demirel said Turkey has offered all it can in terms of aid and  contacts with Bosnian officials to reach a solution to this  crisis.    On the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Demirel said  Armenia continually commits aggression on Azerbaijani territory.  He called for a halt to these aggressive acts. He added that  Turkey gives every kind of aid to Azerbaijan to repulse these  attacks.</p>

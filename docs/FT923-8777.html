			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Long View: Number 29, your time is up DADDY, WHY do we have to leave home to live at granny's next week? Will I have to sleep in that tiny room? Where will I put my computer? Well, son, I'm afraid it's what people call repossession. At least, everybody except the officials at the Bank of England, who call it possession. I suppose instead of the repo man they talk about the po man. Anyway, our building society has the right to take over the house because we've fallen behind with the mortgage payments. Why can't you sell it and pay them back? It's because we bought the house in 1988 on a 90 per cent mortgage. Since then house prices have fallen, by about 25 per cent in these parts. So the house is now worth less than the loan, especially because we have fallen a few months behind with the monthly instalments. But you could pay most of it back, couldn't you? Then perhaps you could pay the rest later. Yes, but it isn't as simple as that. You see, when I bought the house the building society made me pay for an insurance policy called a mortgage indemnity plan. When the house is sold for less than the money owed the insurance company will pay the difference. But the policy only pays out when the house is repossessed by the building society and sold. But that's good, isn't it, Daddy? If you bought an insurance policy you won't be made to pay for the losses. It's like when Mummy crashed the car last year. I'm afraid you don't know much about the way insurance works, son. Although we paid the premium, the benefits only go to the building society. Then the insurance company will make a claim on us for whatever it has paid out, which could easily be Pounds 20,000. Of course, we don't have any money. So I have no idea what we will do. Will it take ages to sell our house? Number twenty-nine was empty for ever and you could hardly see it for grass and weeds. The Avenue Gang kept going in there and breaking the windows until they were boarded up. They said they found twenty pounds under a carpet, and they sold some lead pipe to a man with a cart. And in the kitchen there was the biggest wasps' nest you ever saw. Mr Higgins next door kept saying it was a disgrace and a danger to the public. I know, that house was repossessed too. It's what I'm afraid of. As soon as the house is repossessed it will start deteriorating and it will be worth a lot less than I could sell it for now if the building society would only let me. So our losses will be greatly increased. Doesn't that mean that the building societies are making things worse by taking homes over? Why can't we stay here until this house is sold? They don't sound very nice. And they don't seem to care if prices go down and down. They sound really stupid. Yes, it seems like that to me sometimes. But I suppose they are following their own rules. You see, they never expected a crisis like this. Until a few years ago there were hardly any repossessions at all, and only because the people in those houses had run away or died or something. But now there are hundreds of thousands of homes at risk up and down the country. Daddy, you said once that the house would be worth a lot of money and it would come to me one day. Was that wrong? And you talked about some kind of housing ladder. What happened to that? I'm afraid that like a lot of dreams it has all come to nothing. For a long time it seemed that a house was the best investment anybody in Britain could possible make. Once you managed your first step on the housing ladder you could move upwards and make more and more money. House prices would rise while debts would be more affordable because your income was always rising. But it has all gone horribly wrong. Debts have become more expensive, but house prices have gone down. The ladder has lost its rungs. So when you make your will and die, you won't be able to leave me a house. Where will I live? Will I still be in the little back bedroom at granny's? Maybe it won't be so bad for you. Many years ago people thought that buying houses was a mug's game and they rented their homes instead. Later it became almost impossible to rent, but there were big profits for those who bought. I suppose it was my bad luck to come along at a time when the cycle had run its course and prices had finally stopped rising. But won't the government do something, Daddy? On the Radio One news they said the government was being asked to kickstart the housing market. People would be given incendiaries so they could buy houses. Well, incentives, actually, although sometimes I think I would be better off setting off a few incendiaries in this place. Then I really would get the benefit of the insurance payments. But seriously, the incentives would have to be extremely expensive if they were to do any good. I think that your generation will need to have a very different attitude to owning houses - more like they have in Germany, for instance. It may be better to rent, at any rate unless you are quite old, or very wealthy. You won't be able to expect rising house prices to pay off your mortgage painlessly. You will do better to put your life savings into other kinds of investments. So who will own the houses then, Daddy? I expect the banks and building societies will still have them on their books, son. Perhaps, if you have a bit of money, you will be able to buy this house back again really cheaply. But then you will have to start cutting the grass.</p>

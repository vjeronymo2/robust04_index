			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Observer: Capacious It may soon take a head for more than numbers to work at Britain's Central Statistical Office. Australian Bill McLennan, its new director, is known not only for his professional skill but for his fluid approach to management. As deputy head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, he has become renowned for his use of socialising to promote morale. It is said he can outdrink most of his colleagues. The bureau's house magazine lately reported that McLennan joined the members of a management course for drinks which went on into the small hours. But next day, McLennan still left the hotel 'clear of head and conscience' at 6.30 in the morning, and put in a nine-hour day before catching the 9pm flight to Tokyo.</p>

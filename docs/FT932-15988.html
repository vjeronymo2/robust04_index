			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Coal pension move defended BRITISH COAL's chairman has defended its plans to claim half of the corporation's Pounds 1bn pension fund surplus. Mr Neil Clarke, in a letter published in The Times today, says there is 'no question of BC 'raiding' the fund', and stresses that members would gain 'substantial additional benefits'. Critics have claimed that the government is using the pension fund surplus to finance the Pounds 500m subsidy to the industry, and pension fund trustees have challenged the move. Mr Clarke admits that the claim on the fund was inspired by the government, and says British Coal's legal advice was that it was allowed. But, he says, the corporation intends to seek a High Court ruling on its legality as soon as possible. At issue is Pounds 481m of outstanding staged payments to the fund to cover the cost of early retirements. The bulk was due to be refunded to British Coal by the government. On Monday British Coal suspended a Pounds 109m payment on which an Pounds 82m rebate was due. In his letter Mr Clarke says the pension fund has a surplus of more than Pounds 1 billion. Under the rules the corporation and fund members are entitled to split any surplus, after a 'prudent allocation for reserves' and provision for rises in the cost of living. Mr Clarke says: 'The surplus will result in substantial additional benefits to contributing members, by extending the number of years they are deemed to have contributed, and in enhanced payments to pensioners.' British Coal last night said there was no connection between the government's subsidy to the coal industry and the pension fund payments. 'There's been a deliberate confusion by one or two trade unionists and politicians,' it said.</p>

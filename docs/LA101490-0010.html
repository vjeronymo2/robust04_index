			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPENSES FOR 'THAT BIG DAY' ARE A DISGRACE  </P> <P> When I came home from my office at Wilshire Boulevard Temple yesterday, there  were two bright-eyed, happy girls at work with my wife. She was teaching them  the complicated knots for the traditional fringes that were to grace the  corners of their homemade prayer shawls.  </P> <P> Making those prayer shawls with the help of their mother, two grandmothers and  a great-grandmother was an exciting part of the family's bat mitzvah  preparations.  </P> <P> In my 42 years as rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, an old (chartered 1862),  large (2,500 families) and prestigious Reform Jewish congregation, I have  witnessed very few bar or bat mitzvah celebrations matching the image projected  by your article. They exist. They are an embarrassment. They subvert a sacred  ceremony whose meaning should be the preparation of a young man or woman for a  responsible life of caring and of giving.  </P> <P> Thank God, in the majority of cases, it is.  </P> <P> ALFRED WOLF, Ph.D  </P> <P> Rabbi Emeritus  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the supplement on Science and Education by </F> Karel Knip: "The Free Piston Engine"]    [Excerpts] For decades it was the dream of an entire army  of inventors: to build a combustion engine with a "free piston"  that produced power without using the unfortunate combination of  connecting rod and crankshaft -- in other words, a combustion  engine without rotating parts. It is impossible to say how many  solutions to this problem have been devised over the years.    However, not many of these solutions ever made it further  than the drawing board and, eventually, all the designs  disappeared without trace. Engineers at the Innas engineering  bureau in Breda designed and built two interference-free  prototypes of a "free piston unit" which has every chance of  being the first produced on a large scale. When asked, experts  are unanimously enthusiastic and impressed. Volvo and Daf Bus  [Department of Daf which manufactures buses] have said they are  "very interested."    It would not be true to say that the Innas "free piston  unit"  operates noiselessly. Even if the heavy door of the  sound-proofed cell in the hall where the machine is set up is  closed and the piston frequency is reduced to an impressively  low level, simply by turning a knob, it remains impossible to  hold a normal conversation.    Peter Achten, rounding off a long technical explanation with  the noisy demonstration, wears an "I couldn't care less"  expression. Either he no longer hears the racket or he no  longer wants to hear it. In the exhaustive measuring and  optimization program which he ran through with the spiritual  father of the machine, Theo Potma, no attention has yet been  devoted to sound production. For ease of research, the machine  is running with no muffling worth mentioning. It is expected  that the unit will make less noise than the diesel hydraulic  engine which it is intended to replace. It will not be  difficult to mount the unit free from vibration.    The Innas free piston unit appears to be a compact machine,  smelling pleasantly of oil, of which precious little can be  seen, least of all moving parts. What is most exciting is the  picture that the computer monitor gives of the piston movement.  Free piston movements look very unusual -- in no way comparable  with the smooth sinusoidal movement of the piston in a  crankshaft engine.    Noise measurements and life cycle trials are virtually the  only tests to which this machine, the second operating prototype  built by Innas, has not been subjected. For over four years, an  average of four people have been measuring vibrations, emission,  output, controllability and response speed. It has thus been  established that the unit could prove a worthy replacement for  the regular diesel hydraulic drive in forklifts, mechanical  scoops ("shovels" as they say on television), street cleaning  machines, garbage trucks, and city buses. The theory is that  the Innas unit is considerably more economical and cleaner than  the drives it can replace and, furthermore, will only require  approximately half the space. In addition, it offers  flexibility of control and low purchase and maintenance costs.  [passage omitted ]    The output of the diesel engine within the unit is estimated  at 50 percent, while in regular diesel hydraulic units it is  approximately 45 percent. The absence of the mechanical  intermediate stage between diesel engine and hydraulic pump  (where roughly 10 percent of the loss occurs) is obviously just  as important. The maximum overall yield of a conventional  diesel hydraulic unit is estimated at 36 percent -- that of the  Innas unit at 45 percent. The differences between average  consumption outputs could be even greater.    So far, two working prototypes of the Innas unit have been  built, the second "pre-production prototype" was finished this  year and already seems a considerable improvement on the initial  type. The maximum stroke frequency of the piston (which  determines the delivery of the hydraulic pump) has been  increased from 23 to 35 hertz, the hydraulic output from 60 to  90 percent (by restricting leakage and current losses) and  consumption by peripheral equipment has been cut from 7.5 to 5  kw. Efforts are being made to improve the modest cylinder  output (the extent to which combustion gases are replaced by a  fresh fuel/air mixture). The number of sensors can perhaps be  reduced. "The concept still has a great deal of room for  development, there is still a lot left to perfect," says Achten.    An operational free piston unit is now available, with a  maximum capacity of 20 kw (27 Horsepower) which is almost half  the size of a conventional diesel hydraulic unit of the same  capacity. NOx [Nitrous Oxide] measurements taken by the  Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research [TNO]  in Apeldoorn have shown that the emission of combustion gases  will be below the future Euro III standard. (The emission of  particles has not yet been measured.) [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, four new patents have been applied for with  regard  to the main discoveries. This summer, the BV Innas Free Piston  Engine (IFP) was founded in order to "market" the unit. Novem  [committee which counseled the project] thought it was time to  look for a partner in industry.    Achten and Potma found this no easy task -- remember the  Wankel syndrome and the gloomy example of Van Doorne's  Transmission. As Van der Does of Projectbureau Warmte/Kracht  (PWK) says: "The problem is that the Netherlands lacks an  industrial climate."    The design of the Innas unit is so simple that it will  certainly be no problem finding sufficient companies in the  Netherlands to manufacture the engine. With the exception of the  piston and the engine block, it can be assembled almost entirely  using existing products. The problem is that the companies  approached can only start production once there is a firm order  for the sale of the machines. Potential customers such as Daf  Bus, Volvo and the German company Linde (forklift manufacturer)  only want to order when production is guaranteed. The young  company IFP is still hesitant about the nature of the contracts  which it wants to conclude with the business community.    One promising aspect is that Daf Bus has expressed lively  enthusiasm about the new engine, which product planning manager  G. Batterink refers to as "very daring and very innovative."  "This defies all recent thinking in the field of combustion  engines." Volvo Flygmotor of Sweden is following developments  very closely and has already sent delegations to Breda on four  occasions, offering far-reaching collaboration. It is claimed  that the Innas unit could not be put to better use than in city  buses equipped with Volvo's controversial Cumulo system for  recycling brake energy (which Daf Bus could also buy). Cumulo  buses have a heavy conventional diesel hydraulic drive which  could very profitably be replaced by an Innas unit.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMED FAN BREAKS INTO SHARON GLESS VALLEY HOME  </P> <P> A woman described by police as an obsessed fan armed herself with a rifle and  broke into an unoccupied Studio City house owned by actress Sharon Gless early  Friday, barricading herself in a bathroom and threatening to kill herself for  nearly seven hours before surrendering.  </P> <P> Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove, who had been under a court order to stop  harassing the former star of the "Cagney &amp; Lacey" television program,  talked for hours with police negotiators about Gless and suicide before finally  surrendering at 10 a.m.  </P> <P> She suffered a cut hand while breaking into the house but there were no other  injuries.  </P> <P> Police took a loaded semiautomatic rifle away from Penn and arrested her on  suspicion of two counts of burglary, including an attempted break-in at the  house three days earlier.  </P> <P> Penn was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail at the Sybil Brand Institute,  where she will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, police said.  </P> <P> Penn had sent more than 100 "obsessive" letters to Gless during the last four  years, Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron LaRue said. "She wanted to be near her."  </P> <P> The letters and an earlier visit by Penn to the house caused Gless to seek a  court order in 1988 to keep Penn away from her.  </P> <P> Gless was not in the house Friday morning because she lives elsewhere in Los  Angeles, police said. Her press agent, Heidi Schaeffer, said the Studio City  house had only been used recently as an office by the actress.  </P> <P> In a statement released Friday, the actress said: "These are horrendous times  that we live in, especially when disturbed people have such easy access to  weapons that can be used indiscriminately."  </P> <P> Gless appealed to a state Senate subcommittee last year to approve a bill  restricting the release of home addresses by the Department of Motor Vehicles.  The legislation was prompted by the death of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, killed  by a fan who had tracked her down at her West Hollywood apartment through DMV  records.  </P> <P> Saying that she had been harassed, Gless testified: "I would just like to go  home and not be afraid."  </P> <P> Penn broke into the house through a window about 3:15 a.m., triggering a silent  burglar alarm that brought two LAPD patrol officers, police said.  </P> <P> "They went into the home and they were confronted by the woman," Sgt. Richard  Thomas said. "She pointed the gun at herself and threatened to kill herself.  She then moved back into the bathroom and locked the door."  </P> <P> Capt. Dan Watson said a Special Weapons and Tactics team was called to the  scene and evacuated homes surrounding the secluded house at the end of a short  cul-de-sac backing the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> "We just heard this pounding on the door in the middle of the night and were  told there was a crazy lady with a gun," neighbor Susan Cascio said. "It was  scary."  </P> <P> A specially trained police negotiator was brought in to talk to Penn. According  to Watson, Penn objected that the negotiator was a man, and a woman negotiator,  Officer Patricia Stark, was then brought to the house.  </P> <P> "Throughout the night and the morning, she was talking about suicide," Watson  said of Penn.  </P> <P> While the standoff continued, scores of reporters and camera crews descended on  the quiet, middle-class neighborhood. Vans and cars belonging to the media  lined both sides of nearby Kling Street. Television transmitters were cranked  into the sky so live reports could be sent to local stations.  </P> <P> Members of the media stood along the street and set up camera tripods across a  lawn near the house where Penn was barricaded. Television programs such as  "Entertainment Tonight" and tabloid newspapers from as far as London dispatched  camera crews to the scene.  </P> <P> The police and media vigil ended at 10 a.m. with Penn's surrender. A  .22-caliber AT-22, with a clip containing 13 bullets, was confiscated. The  rifle had been purchased at a store by Penn a year ago, police said.  </P> <P> The restraining order was issued Nov. 16, 1988, three weeks after Penn  allegedly visited the Studio City home and told a secretary she had a gun.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ordered Penn not to harass or  annoy Gless and to stay at least 1,000 yards from Gless' residences.  </P> <P> Police said Penn apparently continued to send letters to Gless but adhered to  the order to stay away from her until this week. Detectives said Penn  unsuccessfully attempted to break into the Studio City house early Tuesday  morning but declined to say what evidence links her to the crime.  </P> <P> Gless is a two-time Emmy winner for "Cagney &amp; Lacey." She also appeared in  the "House Calls" television series and in several television movies.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Greg Braxton, Philipp Gollner and Steve Padilla contributed  to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OBSESSED FANS  </P> <P>  Celebrities who have been victims of obsessed fans:  </P> <P> Rebecca Schaeffer: A man who had sent several fan letters to Schaeffer was  arrested last July after the actress was shot to death at her West Hollywood  apartment. Robert John Bardo reportedly obtained Schaeffer's address from a  Tucson private investigating firm, which obtained it from California Department  of Motor Vehicle records.  </P> <P> Theresa Saldana: A Scottish-born drifter who tried to kill Saldana outside her  West Hollywood apartment in 1987 was charged last March with sending  threatening letters to her from Vacaville state prison. Arthur Jackson would  have been eligible for parole next month, but he will remain in custody until  the new charges are resolved.  </P> <P> David Letterman: A Crawford, Colo., woman, Margaret Ray, was arrested last  March after twice breaking into Letterman's Connecticut home. She had been  released from prison only days earlier for one of five earlier break-ins at the  TV talk show host's home, police said. She claimed she was married to  Letterman.  </P> <P> Stephanie Zimbalist: Michael Lawrence Shields of Plymouth, Mich., was arrested  last March in Sherman Oaks after sending more than 200 threatening letters to  Zimbalist, former star of "Remington Steele" and daughter of actor Efrem  Zimbalist Jr.  </P> <P> Justine Bateman: A Houston man, John Thomas Smetek, was arrested in September,  1989, outside a Berkeley theater where Bateman, former star of "Family Ties,"  was scheduled to perform. Smetek, who had been following Bateman, had  threatened to commit suicide outside the theater.  </P> <P> Michael J. Fox: A Westlake Village shipping clerk who in a year's time sent  nearly 6,000 threatening letters to Fox was sentenced to three years probation  last December after pleading guilty to three counts of making terrorist  threats. The clerk, Tina Marie Ledbetter, told investigators she was furious  when the star of "Back to the Future" and "Family Ties" married actress Tracy  Pollan. She had threatened to kill the couple.  </P> <P> Johnny Carson: A Wisconsin man who for more than a year sent threatening  letters to TV talk show host Carson and other celebrities was arrested last  December after showing up at NBC Studios in Burbank with a homemade bludgeon --  a sock filled with gravel -- in his jacket. The man, Ken Orville Gause, had  threatened to kill Carson unless he was paid $5 million.  </P> <P> Kelly Lange: An unemployed Los Angeles man, Warren S. Hudson, who for five  years purportedly sent letters and gifts to KNBC-TV news anchor Lange, was  charged last August with making a terrorist threat against her.  </P></p>

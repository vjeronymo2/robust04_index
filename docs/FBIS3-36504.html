			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Soskovets, Russian first deputy prime </F> minister, by reporter A. Peslyak in Moscow on 5 February --  recorded]    [Text] A good two-thirds of the 25 Russian-Georgian  documents signed in Tbilisi apply to the economic relations  sphere. We asked Oleg Soskovets, the Russian first deputy prime  minister, to characterize the results of the agreements and  treaties that were signed. [Video shows footage of Yeltsin,  Shevardnadze, and others at documents-signing ceremony in  Tbilisi. Then Oleg Soskovets is shown seated in his office being  interviewed]    [Soskovets] Let us take the agreement on cooperation in the  communications field. What does it signify? It signifies that  our television programs -- the Ostankino and Russian Television  programs -- will be regularly relayed, received, and shown to  Georgia's inhabitants and the whole region. I think that a  legal format has simply been given to all those relationships  that were developing previously as part of the traditional old  relations of partnership. Now they have been endorsed at the  level of interstate relations. Now the old laws have a  foundation. In principle, Georgia is an independent state and  whether it uses our television programs and information sources  depends on many things, since in principle we must now work on a  commercial basis with this state.    An agreement was signed on international highway  communications. This is also a matter purely of production  links. They existed traditionally in the former Soviet Union.  Now they need to be given a legal format in line with  international law. Well, they have now been legalized.    Agreements were signed on trade and economic cooperation  with  the appropriate appendices. I should like to dwell precisely on  this area, which is the most complicated at the present time, as  Georgia, since it acquired its independence, has been busy  working on its own economic policy and industry reform. At  present both of these spheres of activity are in difficulties,  especially industry, power- generating, and transport. It is  therefore, necessary, in view of Georgia becoming a CIS member,  to find approaches that will not unite the two economies but,  with them functioning quite independently of each other, will  provide opportunities for them to develop various production  infrastructures. In this respect the Georgian side has been  displaying considerable interest in Russian industrial  enterprises and power-generating enterprises. During the  negotiating process proposals were made to the Georgian  Government that Russian joint-stock companies and joint-stock  capital should become involved in Georgia's industrial and  oil-refining enterprises. Georgia now possesses fine transport  potential in view of its ports, and I think that, given a normal  development of events, we shall simply be involved at the  economic level and economically in the production activity of  these infrastructures. This was a more serious agreement, since  here there can be no question of any disinterested links that  might weaken Russia's economy, as ways are being sought to  create financial clearing relations, since Georgia has its own  currency. Let me reiterate that there can be no philanthropic  relationship where the Russian enterprises, which are now the  real economic subjects in our economic zone, will not receive  the funds for the output they supply. Nor, naturally, must our  companies, such as Roskontrakt, which are involved in giving  substance to these relations in respect of goods, be bankrupted  by this cooperation. This is one of the main tasks that we have  set ourselves. We explained this to the Georgian side and it  was received quite normally, as should be the case in a  civilized world.    [Peslyak] What can you say more specifically about  power-generating, transport, and other areas of bilateral links?    [Soskovets] Georgia still has a metallurgical industry,  which  had earlier been transformed into one of the Soviet Union's  unified metallurgical complexes. It still has a deposit of  manganese ores, without which it is impossible to produce steel.  It also still has units for the production of ferrous alloys in  Zestafoni, manganese in Chiatura, and there is the iron and  steel works at Rustavi. These enterprises, especially the  enterprise in Rustavi, were oriented toward the oil industry  market. They make extra-strong oil well casing. I think that  we must not lose this production capacity, enabling us to have  high-quality piping for the oil men that is, at the same time,  between 30 and 40 percent cheaper than world prices, and that we  must not neglect it. I think that it is essential to avail  ourselves of this opportunity and to organize this link. That  is one example.    Another example is in the refining and transportation of  petroleum products. I must say that the existing potential for  using Georgia's territory for commodity pipelines and the  transportation of oil and gas -- I have in mind exporting -- is  a very convenient opportunity for us to reduce transportation  costs.    As far as Georgia's industry is concerned, I must of course  say that all these conflicts, which have been going on over the  last few years, have in effect ruined Georgia's economy. The  plants are at a standstill and so is the transport system. It  is at present winter in Tbilisi and yet there is no heat in the  apartments. The provision of electricity for lighting is  strictly regulated, and so on and so forth. I think that first  and foremost, of course, we all have to do a lot of work to  revive all our economic activities.    [Peslyak] You spoke of an agreement on road transportation  cooperation, but the railways also account for a considerable  proportion of transportation. This concerns Russia's economic  interests, and the economic security of Georgia, and indeed its  neighbors.    [Soskovets] The head of the Georgian Government's Department  of Railways has expressed a willingness to become part of the  system of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Railways. This  statement was made prior to the visit and our Railways Minister  Gennadiy Matveyevich Fadeyev is now studying the issue. The  fact is that a mass of Russian goods passes through the  territory of Georgia. Therefore, we must not evade the issue,  but probably it is not possible at present to see how we can  take part in such a way that we do not become a donor and simply  say that the Georgian railways will be some department or  railway like, for instance, the West Siberian Railway or the Far  Eastern Railway. The Georgian Government has proposed that our  transport management entity -- our Transport Ministry -- become  involved, for instance, as a shareholder in the development,  construction, and extension of the port in the town of Poti.  There is a also a proposal that Batumi too, is expanded and  conditions created for the modernization of the oil refinery.  Another proposal is to build a 150-kilometer section of  pipeline to develop the transportation of gas to Turkey.    [Peslyak] The first deputy prime minister remarked with a  smile that the Moscow City Government had concluded its own  agreements, and soon Muscovites will be becoming acquainted, for  instance, with new examples of Georgian wines and brandies.</p>

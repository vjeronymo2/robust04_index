			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Military Communique No. 2" issued by the PFLP-GC on 10 May] </F>   [Text] Further to the first military communique issued by  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command [PFLP-GC], on the air raids launched by the Zionist  enemy aircraft against the PFLP-GC's social and humanitarian  institutions at 1200 today, 10 May 1994, the PFLP-GC military  spokesman has stated the following:    The Zionist enemy aircraft have continued their terrorist  raids against the positions mentioned in the previous  communique, having failed to inflict the losses they had planned  to inflict.    In an attempt to spread panic among secure civilians and  draw  attention to its suspect aims; on the pretext of talking about  military posts in populated civilian areas; and in  implementation of the policy of confronting all those who oppose  the agreements that seek to liquidate our Palestinian cause, the  Zionist enemy aircraft have launched new raids at 1720 today,  thus raising the total number of raids to 11.    As usual, the Zionist enemy has claimed that it has  inflicted  casualties within the ranks of the PFLP-GC. This was reported  by other news media.    We in the PFLP-GC deny sustaining any casualties within the  ranks of our fighters. We reassert that the locations targeted  by the air raids are civilian institutions that provide free  humanitarian aid.    We stress that the Zionist political and military raids will  not prevent us from sticking to our objectives and jihad  positions and our confrontation of the conspiracy of surrender.    We pledge to pursue the march until the liberation of land  and man.    [Signed] The Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command</p>

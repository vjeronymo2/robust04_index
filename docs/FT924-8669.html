			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Detour for the through train: Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong are a high-risk strategy That things in the Colony aren't what they should be no one can doubt any longer, and though in spite of everything we do move forward, maybe - as more than a few believe  - the time has come to bring in a Political Reformer. C P Cavafy, In a Large Greek Colony, 200BC It was clear from the day Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong that his governorship was going to be different from those of the 27 governors who had come before him. This was underlined on October 7 when he publicised his proposals for the reform of Hong Kong's political system. In one move he changed the course of British policy towards Hong Kong in two significant ways. First, he signalled his intention to involve the people of Hong Kong in their political future, in contrast to past colonial policy which had involved only a coterie of local worthies. And second, by saying he would present his proposals to the local legislature if China failed to agree, he went against Foreign Office orthodoxy. This had always stressed the need for British policy to complement what Beijing planned for Hong Kong after its reversion to China in 1997, known locally as the 'through train'. Mr Patten's strategy is nothing if not high risk. After a series of unsuccessful meetings with Chinese leaders in Beijing two weeks ago, he now faces protracted trench warfare with China, which has given every indication that it neither approves of his proposals nor is prepared to discuss them further. His, and Hong Kong's, nerve will be sorely tested in the coming months. It is also a strategy which, if successful, could raise awkward questions in Britain about past policy: in particular, the questions of why the UK did not stand up to China earlier and why it took so long to accelerate the introduction of democracy in Hong Kong. Mr Patten's proposals for constitutional development of the 60-member Legislative Council (LegCo) in 1995 are not radical by the standards of any western democracy. In the 1991 elections, businessmen and professionals had two votes - one for a legislator to represent their professional affiliation and another for a geographical constituency. The proposals would extend this right of two votes to ordinary employees in the 1995 elections. In addition to expanding the franchise, 10 more legislators will be returned to LegCo by selection of an electoral college, which, under the Patten proposals, would consist of democratically elected local officials. As a concession to China, however, he has not sought to increase the number of democratically elected seats from the 20 already agreed with China for the 1995 election. He has also kept liberal politicians off his Executive Council, or quasi-cabinet, which China has always opposed. To date China has refused to discuss the plans, saying publicly that Britain has reneged on secret agreements made in early 1990. It has threatened to overturn the 1995 elections if conducted on Mr Patten's terms when it takes over in 1997. It has also threatened to repudiate contracts and debt agreements for the colony's HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 13.9bn) airport project if he proceeds to build it without China's approval. Talks about the airport broke down three weeks ago and China appears to be in no hurry to settle the issue. The question now is: can Mr Patten succeed? Or will he inevitably have to bend to China's will? The key to the answer lies in his ability to retain the support of the public, maintain confidence in the colony's economy and most important, get his plans through LegCo. So far, the political tide appears to be turning in his direction. First, the business community appears to have shrugged off the recent furore. The Hong Kong stock market has continued to rise in spite of the diplomatic stand-off between Britain and China. The prospect of rapid economic development in China has attracted international investors, and Hong Kong is the only market through which they can obtain an exposure to it. The Hang Seng index - the market's barometer - closed yesterday at 6,267.91, only 1.5 per cent off its all-time high set on Thursday. Furthermore, there is no shortage of money for new listings, another crucial indicator of confidence. Last week a mainland Chinese company floated a subsidiary and broke all records for a new listing in the colony. China Travel Service sought HKDollars 400m for 25 per cent of an offshoot subsidiary which owns theme parks in China and a freight-forwarding business. The issue was oversubscribed, by 411 times; the market offered CTS HKDollars 150bn. Further signs that the colony's influential business community is reserving judgment come from business people themselves. According to Ms Sally Aw, chairman of the Sing Tao media and property group: 'This is 1992 and by 1995 there will have been a lot of changes. By 1997 the situation will be different again. Anything can happen. By 1995 China may have a different view; I think you have to give them time.' Mr Adrian Fu, scion of the colony's Fu family which has interests in property and hotels in both Hong Kong and China, strikes a similar tone: 'No one expected China to agree to Patten's proposals. What was unusual is that he and Lu Ping (China's top official on Hong Kong affairs) had bad words without offending each other.' Mr Patten cannot, however, count on local Chinese business people for much support. Their economic interests, which increasingly lie on the Chinese mainland, will prevent the few who support him from speaking out, because by doing so they invite China's retaliation. As one China expert noted: 'These people are vulnerable because the success of projects they are mixed up with in China depends on a corrupt and arbitrary bureaucracy.' The Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong yesterday implicitly endorsed Lu Ping's line and called on Mr Patten to withdraw his proposals and seek fresh talks with China. It said it was unacceptable to put in place a political structure which would be dismantled in 4 1/2 years. Mr Patten will also be denied the support of the expatriate business community. Schooled and brought up in liberal democracies, many expatriates scorn suggestions that the people of Hong Kong are interested in political liberty. They view the Hong Kong Chinese as being more interested in making money. This perception, however, is not supported by the public opinion polls that the Hong Kong media have been conducting since Mr Patten arrived in the colony in July. One recent poll published by East magazine, a new weekly launched by the popular Oriental Daily, tracks Mr Patten's personal popularity and approval for his proposals in the period from his announcement of them on October 7 until his return from Beijing on October 23. The poll shows that his popularity has fluctuated between 61 and 65 per cent, while approval for what he wants to do has ranged between 70 and 85 per cent. Other polls show equally strong readings. One in Ming Pao, published four days after his speech to LegCo, showed nearly five-to-one in favour of proceeding with his political reforms even if China objected, which by then was the course it had already embarked on. This is not to say that Mr Patten has a guarantee of permanent support; many local people are cynical about his motives and see his style of leadership simply as a desire for popularity. 'He is trying to push for more democracy in the knowledge that he can't succeed; he is here to fail 'honourably',' noted one local. The feeling of many working-class people was summed up by Mr Yip Wing Shing, a photocopier repairman. 'No one can say at this point if his reforms are good, but I think we should give them a try. Because no one can guarantee that even if we do what China wants now, they won't change things in 1997.' The governor's plans, however, will stand or fall on the floor of LegCo. It is the local legislature which, as Mr Patten constantly reminds it, will have to pass the laws which are needed to conduct the 1995 polls. Few doubt that if Mr Patten laid legislation before the council today it would be passed. The calculation is a fine one, but according to one estimate the government could count on 27 sure votes compared with 24 - mostly members appointed by Mr Patten's predecessor, Lord Wilson - against. That leaves seven undecided, together with one further legislator he has to appoint. But opinion is volatile. Views within LegCo are as polarised as the above numbers would suggest. The conservative grouping, which will vote against his legislation, wants him to call a referendum before LegCo votes on the package. 'The French have just held a referendum; so have the Canadians,' says Mr Allen Lee, leader of the Co-operative Resources Centre, the main conservative grouping. 'Do not tell me that democratic countries can hold referenda and Hong Kong cannot. If the people vote for his proposals, then we will go along with them. In the absence of a referendum we will vote against.' A referendum, however, is unlikely to be held. It is far too close to an 'act of self-determination' and Britain has always said such a plebiscite was inappropriate for Hong Kong because it was not being granted independence. Mr Lee is a believer in the 'through train' concept. 'If LegCo passes Mr Patten's proposals by a narrow margin - which I think it will - the question still remains, do we want elections that will be good only until 1997? Do we want China to have a total say over who sits in LegCo post-1997?' Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, who supports Mr Patten even though he believes he has not gone far enough, takes a different view. 'The lack of convergence is not a big deal,' he says. 'Why is it so terrible? There is at least a chance that China will not reverse what Mr Patten does. China can ruin Hong Kong if it wants to be bloody-minded. But how does that help China and its economic development?' This view finds some resonance with Mr Patten's close advisers. One points out that the alternative to the governor's ideas is for Britain to ensure that the politicians whom China does not like do not get elected in 1995. This, he says, is too much to ask. The advisers maintain that the costs to China of reversing a system which Mr Patten believes can be made to work would be too great. To some, however, this rationale echoes the hopes expressed in June 1989, when another group of Chinese free-thinkers faced the authorities in Tiananmen Square.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo Judging by the 8 per cent fall in Lasmo shares yesterday, the market has no great faith in the viability of its planned flotation of Ultramar's US assets. The GPA debacle aside, it would be understandable if US institutions were reluctant to invest in assets already spurned by the oil industry. As things stand, Lasmo intends to go ahead at a price which could be as much as a quarter below that originally indicated. That will do less to ease its stretched finances. Shareholders might be better served in the long run if the flotation were pulled altogether. Either way, short term their dividend is more vulnerable than ever.</p>

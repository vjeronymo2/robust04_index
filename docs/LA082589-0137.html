			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FANS HAVE THEIR SAY ABOUT ROSE'S FATE  </P> <P> Fans waiting to purchase Angels' tickets at Anaheim Stadium Thursday spoke out  on Pete Rose's lifetime ban by Commissioner Bart Giamatti.  </P> <P> Some fans said Rose got what he deserved for allegedly betting on Cincinnati  Reds' games. Others said they didn't believe the charges. Nearly all seemed to  feel sorry for Rose.  </P> <P> Some sample comments:  </P> <P> Bob Edwards of Fountain Valley: "It's about time they caught up with him. I  support the suspension. He can always ask for reinstatement. I liked to watch  him play. No (I don't feel he should be allowed back).  </P> <P> "He was a grown man. He should have known better. He broke the cardinal rule.  It's regretable. He's a national hero to a whole lot of people.  </P> <P> "No matter what he's done, you can't take away what he did (on the field as a  player)."  </P> <P> Richard Ernst of Garden Grove: "He should have gotten suspended for five years.  I think he should be able to come back too. I don't think he's going to come  back. I'd like for him to. The odds aren't in his favor. He was a good baseball  player, I'll give him that.  </P> <P> "He should have know better, yeah."  </P> <P> Kurt Leavitt of La Habra: "He'll be back at the end of next year. They'll make  him sit out this year. I think he should have gotten five years. I was  originally thinking life. Five years would give him time to think. We'll see.  </P> <P> "This was not good for the game."  </P> <P> Bob Borden of Agoura: "If he's guilty, it's not harsh, and I kind of figure he  might be guilty. I think he made a deal. I think he'll be back next year. As a  person, he's guilty. He's not too good as a person. He certainly deserves to  keep his records. You can't take those away from him. You can't have the  second-best records."  </P> <P> Ivan Caldwell of Tustin: "I think it's a little too harsh. Six months would  have been plenty. (Should he be in the Hall of Fame?) No question about that.  This has nothing to do with his ability on the field."  </P> <P> Jerry Cummings of Placentia: "He played with fire and got burned. He knew what  he was doing. He (Rose) did as much, added as much to baseball as any man has.  That includes Babe Ruth. He made a mistake and now he has to pay for it.  </P> <P> "I'm sorry to see it. He was probably one of the greatest to ever come along.  </P> <P> "I think he should be reinstated. I believe the suspension should last several  years. I'm truly sorry. You have to draw the line somewhere. Just because he's  a famous athlete, I'm not going to condone him for illegal actions. It's as  simple as that."  </P> <P> Barbara Sanchez of Upland: "I think he dedicated a lot of his time and effort  to baseball and for one false move that hasn't ever been proven (in court),  it's pretty severe. I've seen worse mistakes (in life).  </P> <P> "They should consider what he's done."  </P> <P> Joanna Sanchez of Upland: "Until he says he did it, I won't believe it. He  better go in the Hall of Fame."  </P> <P> Jim Tsouris of La Verne: "Judging from the things he admitted all along, I  think he's guilty as hell. I think he wants to make a deal. This game doesn't  need it (gambling). Fans are going to get turned against the game.  </P> <P> "The main thing was to get him out of baseball. I don't think he's ever going  to come back.  </P> <P> "There's gambling in all sports. He might be the one who paid the price. It's a  shame."  </P> <P> George Tsouris, Jim's 11-year-old son: "I don't think he bet on his team. My  dad does, though."  </P> <P> Terri Gritzmacher of El Toro: "I guess if he knew what the possibilities of his  actions would be, it's about right. I guess it was a foolhardy thing to do."  </P> <P> Charles Stetler of Newport Beach: "Life is pretty tough. Five years I thought  was fine. Life is too long. I feel sorry for him. He should have had more  sense, really.  </P> <P> "It's too bad he wasn't more realistic in his thinking. It's always going to  catch up with you."  </P></p>

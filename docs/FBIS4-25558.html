			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Hong Wen (3126 2429): </F> "China's Aviation Industry Badly Needs Import of Modern  Management System"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 10 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The cause  of the 6 June Xian plane crash is still under investigation.  The Russian airplane manufacturer will send personnel to assist  in the analysis. The plane crash, the most serious incident in  China's civil aviation history, shows once again the serious  problems in China's civil aviation safety. In order to quickly  reverse the situation, the solution is not merely to purchase  several more advanced planes from abroad, but more importantly  to vigorously import the management system of the modern  aviation industry to enable the quality of personnel and  management levels to catch up with the speedily developing civil  aviation industry.    State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua recently urged the  management of China's civil aviation to draw a lesson from the  air crash and to adopt more measures to step up security. In  fact, the authorities' determination to step up aviation  security is seen from the placement of new heads of the Civil  Aviation General Administration at the end of last year and the  upgrading of the General Administration from the vice  ministerial level to the ministerial level. Moreover, the new  personnel really have had new performance, which includes the  promulgation of a series of regulations on air traffic  management and several measures to upgrade services and  safeguard the safety of civil aviation. Early this month, they  held many meetings at which they stressed the paramount  importance of "strict control."    Despite this, records of civil aviation safety are still  worrying. In May, there were 17 incidents, which were followed  by a plane explosion in the air. What were the reasons for the  frequent incidents? According to an analysis by a senior  official of China Northwest Airline, one of the main factors  were that the civil aviation industry is developing too quickly  and the corresponding technology, equipment, personnel, and  management cannot catch up. In recent years, passenger volume of  China's civil aviation has continuously increased at a rate of  25 to 30 percent each year and several dozen local airlines have  been newly set up. There is no denying that the delegation of  executive powers and the increasing purchase of new airplanes  from abroad help meet the huge need of the aviation market. But  for the civil aviation industry, a special industry that gives  priority to safety, introducing modern management concepts and  systems and hiring overseas management and technical personnel  in the field are important and must not be delayed.    China has already placed a record-breaking order for new  American passenger planes to replace old models. But the  immediate task is that it should, beginning with the management  system, make great efforts with regard to personnel, training,  maintenance, supervision, control, and logistics to ensure that  regulations are implemented.</p>

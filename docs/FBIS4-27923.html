			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia says it has been incorporating human  rights issues into its direct and indirect defense contact with  Indonesia. The approach is outlined in an Australian Government  response to a parliamentary report on relations with Indonesia.    The document said Australia's Defense Force did not provide  training to Indonesian troops for internal security or  counter-insurgency.    The statement said cooperation with Indonesian Special  Forces  focussed on low-level military and welfare skills, as well as  communications operation, small arms practice, and medical  training.    Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the government shared the  parliamentary committee's view that human rights was the most  sensitive area of Australia's relations with Indonesia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Everyone Fears A Different </F> Extremism"]    [Text] Fears of extremist political trends have slightly  increased in the past 18 months; however, on the basis of public  opinion, the danger of left-wing extremism is considered to be  small in Hungary, and the danger of right-wing extremism only  slightly greater. This is how we can sum up the results of two  opinion polls carried out by Szonda Ipsos in October 1992 and  March 1993 using a sample representing the composition of  Hungary's population. It was commissioned by NEPSZABADSAG.    Although the general picture has changed only minimally in  the past 18 months, more substantial changes have taken place on  details. The increase in political and ideological extremist  demonstrations and activities has brought this phenomenon from a  geographic and historical distance to our immediate proximity.  This is also clear from the fact that, while 40 percent of the  people refused to answer this question or evaluate the danger of  extremist political trends in 1992, fewer people did so now,  namely 30 percent. However, this does not mean that people  regard the situation as dire, but they continue to express their  concern. Summing all this up into a single scale ranging from 0  to 100 and representing the feeling of danger, we find 29 points  for extreme left-wing danger in the autumn of 1992 and 33 points  in the spring of 1993; regarding extreme right-wing danger, the  figures are 38 in 1992 and 40 in 1993.    Both in 1992 and 1994, a third of people said they did not  notice any extreme left danger, which also shows that the public  does not absolutize extremist demonstrations. On the other  hand, the number of people who consider the problem to be  insignificant is slightly smaller: a quarter in both cases.  However, the increase in the number of people who regard both  the leftist and rightist danger as a more serious problem shows  the increase in the relative weight of fear of extremism: An  increase from 8 percent in 1992 to 15 percent now regarding the  leftist danger, and an increase from 17 percent to 22 percent  regarding the rightist danger.    We can also simplify the issue of extremist trends to  alternatives if we only examine which trend is regarded as more  dangerous by the people surveyed, leftist extremism or rightist  extremism. Both in 1992 and 1994, the biggest group was made up  of people who see the two types of extremism as equally  dangerous. The number of people who thought so has increased  even more over the past 18 months, from 45 percent to 54  percent. Among people who feel a difference between the two  extremist trends, there are more people who think the right-wing  danger is more serious (36 percent in 1992 and 30 percent in  1994). The opposite view, namely a more serious leftist danger,  was held by 19 percent in 1992 and 16 percent in 1994.    In this, the opinions of various social groups differ only  slightly, people expressing identical fears form a majority, and  there are fewer who fear left-wing extremist trends than those  who fear right-wing extremist trends. In 1992, people with a  basic education and currently living in villages proved to be  most divided in judging this issue: The same number of people  saw a greater danger from one side as those from the other side.  Among high school graduates, more regarded right-wing extremism  as more serious (51 percent) in 1992, and fewer than average  regarded the two sources of danger as equal (34 percent). At  present, the size of these two groups is identical and makes up  40-40 percent of intellectuals.    If, in addition to this trend, we also consider the extent  of  the danger, we can conclude that every social-demographic group  regards right-wing extremism as a more serious problem. Both in  1992 and in 1994, with the increase in the level of education,  people found the extreme right danger increasingly  insignificant. While the differences in opinions of various  groups regarding right-wing extremism were small or non-existent  in 1992, we can now notice a considerable difference: People in  towns, and particularly in Budapest, are more afraid of  right-wing extremism (42 percent and 44 percent respectively)  than people in villages (34 percent).    It is also worth analyzing the positions of the potential  voters for individual parties. With only one exception, we  could say in 1992 that the sum total of various camps considered  extreme right manifestations more dangerous than extreme left  ones. Supporters of the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] saw this differently: In their opinion, the danger  mostly came from the left. Today, the picture is much more  varied: Among the supporters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], the KDNP, and  the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], there are more who  consider the extreme left-wing danger more serious than the  other danger; among the supporters of the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP],  people stressed the danger of the extreme right.    Regarding the extent of the danger, the opinions of Fidesz  and MDF supporters changed most: Compared with 1992, the  feeling of danger from the extreme left has increased  considerably. Consequently, supporters of both parties consider  the extreme left to be slightly more dangerous than the extreme  right. The same way of thinking is characteristic of KDNP  supporters, but their position is less marked than 18 months  ago. FKGP supporters regard the extreme left danger much more  serious than the average, but they also fear the advance of the  extreme right. There has been no essential change in the  opinion of SZDSZ and MSZP supporters: They consider the extreme  right danger more serious than the extreme left danger.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.J. Tzou and Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- Economics  ministers of the Republic of China [ROC] and Australia Tuesday  [12 April] agreed to strengthen bilateral trade ties during  informal tariff reduction talks here.    ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang urged Australia to  support Taiwan in its bid to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as trade, investment and tourism  relations between Taiwan and Australia have been growing rapidly.    Some 4.8 million Taiwan tourists have visited Australia,  spending more than than US$8 billion while there, Chiang said.    In addition, Taiwan-Australia trade has been growing at a  rapid rate, Chiang said.    Chiang's Australian counterpart, Bob McMullan, agreed that  Taiwan is one of Australia's most important trading partners in  the Asia-Pacific and he believes that Taiwan should be a member  of the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT  before the end of this year.    McMullan added that he hopes Taiwan will gradually reduce  import tariffs -- especially those on fruit, automobiles, and  beef -- to meet the regulations set out in the GATT Uruguay  Round accord.    McMullan and Chiang are in Morocco for a GATT ministers  meeting which opened Tuesday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] And now let us look at yesterday's news conference,  because a very important issue for Latvia was discussed there.    Because at the end of the day, the withdrawal of the Russian  Army from Skrunda and the dismantling of the Skrunda radar  station are currently the most topical issues for Latvian  security policy. The government is currently working on Latvian  stance at talks with our eastern neighboring state and on the  signing of corresponding agreements. And Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs is reporting about that.    [Begin Birkavs recording] Now it has become more or less  clear to everyone that security is really the number one  priority for Latvia and I would say for the whole Baltics.  Taking into account that the talks with Russia are entering the  decisive phase, I think that we have to give a wide and complete  idea of what will happen if we conclude the agreement and what  will happen if we do not conclude the agreement.    Latvia has to conclude an agreement with Russia on possibly  earlier troop withdrawal and the deadline is 31 August. Skrunda  is to be left here for four years and 18 months. With our  strong stance not to yield, we have practically secured very  stable support for Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania from American  and European states and a guarantee that they will support us  and that they will bolster us, but this agreement has to be  concluded. These signals which come from other countries of the  world. They will considerably intensify in the future, as soon  as the agreement is concluded and they will become particularly  active after the 31st when there will be no [Russian] Army here.  [end recording]    However, as the experience shows, agreements concluded with  Russia do not at all mean that they will be really complied with  and Valdis Birkavs is continuing about possible guarantees in  such case.    [Begin Birkavs recording] We wish to begin the dismantling  [of the Skrunda radar] much sooner and I hope that we will  succeed in it. However, while it is worked on -- and the  Russian side, at least at the previous talks, agreed -- we will  also work on a corresponding security mechanism, which means  that the system of international security guarantees would come  into effect in the event that the agreement is not complied  with. [end recording]    This is an excerpt from yesterday's press conference, at  which Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs was speaking.</p>

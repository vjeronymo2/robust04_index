			<p>BFN     [Text] Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca is to  leave today for an official visit in the United States at the  invitation of Defense Secretary William Perry. This is the  first visit by a Romanian defense minister to the United States  since 1989 and the second in the history of Romanian-U.S.  relations after World War II. Tinca made the following  exclusive statement to Radio Romania Actualitati correspondent  Nicu Popescu:    [Begin Tinca recording] The visit I am to begin today in the  United States is a very important one for Romanian-U.S. military  relations and the cooperation between the two countries. It  would mean a great deal if at least the majority of the goals I  set for myself -- even if not all of them -- could be achieved  so that I could return home with the certitude of a genuine  progress in the Romanian-U.S. relations.    I hope I will be able to present as convincingly as possible  the concrete steps taken by Romania on its way to  democratization of Romanian society, the stabilization of the  economic situation, and the increasingly dynamic implementation  of the economic reform in our country.    I also hope that I will be able to convincingly demonstrate  the clear readiness of the Ministry of National Defense in view  of carrying out certain specific actions together with the  United States and with other countries within the Partnership  for Peace initiative, as well as our readiness for Romanian-U.S.  cooperation with respect to our efforts to modernize and  re-equip the Romanian Armed Forces.    I hope very much that my visit, and the results it will  yield, will contribute not solely to the consolidation of our  country's internal stability, but also to the strengthening of  the feeling of security in our entire region and, why not, in  the whole of Europe.    I begin this visit with a very strong sense of  responsibility, but also optimism, having in view the United  States' increasingly pronounced readiness to further relations  with Romania and the consensus existing among our political  forces with respect to the importance of Romania's ties with the  United States.

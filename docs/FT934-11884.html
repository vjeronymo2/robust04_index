			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: India told it should gain from Uruguay Round talks Mr Peter Suthertland, Gatt director general, yesterday sought to reassure India and other developing countries that they stood to gain from a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade talks, Stefan Wagstyl writes from New Delhi. Indian ministers said they accepted the assurances, during a visit by Mr Sutherland, and urged a speedy conclusion to the talks. But protest groups of farmers, trade unionists and others, who staged angry demonstrations in the streets of Delhi, vowed to fight for changes in the draft agreement prepared by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Mr Sutherland's predecessor.</p>

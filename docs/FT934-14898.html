			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Wiring up Tinsel Town Hollywood was not mentioned once in Bell Atlantic's statement about its merger with TCI, perhaps for fear of frightening the children. The deal has many dimensions, and the expansion of cable television and its integration with telephony was a powerful force bringing the companies together. But the timing is important and Paramount is discernibly the ghost in the machine. TCI owns over 20 per cent of QVC, which is bidding for Paramount. Having looked a weaker competitor than Viacom, QVC suddenly has a merged Baby Bell and large cable operator as its backer. If an improved bid is forthcoming from QVC, Paramount's board can hardly swat it away. The prize of the last footloose Hollywood studio feeding programmes into the largest US cable network backed by a telephone company with the capital to develop a large scale digital system has clearly turned executive heads. Whether Bell Atlantic will ever make money from TCI is more questionable. The price of 11.75 times cash flow is higher than the valuation of many telecoms companies, but not wildly so. The 35 per cent first year dilution of earnings is, however, a better indication of how much Bell Atlantic is betting on the deal. Yet valuation seems almost irrelevant to companies at this stage. A stake in the few properties available in the fusing world of media and communications is viewed as merely the ante which buys admission to the multi-media poker game. No one can yet discern the final shape of the industry which will emerge, and the risk of buying the wrong companies at the wrong price is high. When this kind of money is changing hands, not even apparently impregnable stars like Disney are safe.</p>

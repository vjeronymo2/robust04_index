			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES had a dull session, with stock index futures trading in a narrow range for most of the day as dealers focused on the overnight fall in Tokyo and poor corporate results from Germany, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,369, a brief rise in the September contract on the FT-SE soon went into retreat, pulling the underlying cash market lower, with a Japanese securities house reported to have been an early seller. Attempts at a mid-morning rally met with little success, and following a brief dip to 2,367 September bounced between 2,369 and 2,374 for the next few hours. Another sell-off in the last hour of trading caused a further retreat by the contract and it eventually settled at 2,363, down 26 from its previous close and around 4 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Futures traded at a discount to fair value throughout the session. Turnover, at 6,793 contracts, was thin. In traded options, total volume reached a mere 21,852 lots, once again indicating a dull mood. The FT-SE 100 option had 7,120 contracts dealt and the Euro FT-SE 100 index 1,846 lots. British Gas was the busiest stock option on 1,398 lots transacted.</p>

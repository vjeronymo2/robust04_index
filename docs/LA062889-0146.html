			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PETE ROSE JR. TAKES TIME OFF  </P> <P> With his father's troubles mounting, Pete Rose Jr. has been given permission to  leave the Baltimore Orioles' Class A farm team at Erie, Pa., for a few days.  </P> <P> He told Manager Bobby Tolan of his decision on Sunday after the Orioles urged  him to consider taking the time off if he needed it. The suggestion was made  Friday because the Orioles believed that Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose Sr.  would have his hearing with Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti on Monday.  </P> <P> "We wanted him to know if he took some time off it was fine with us," Orioles  Farm Director Doug Melvin said. "We left it up to him, but we know it has been  tough. There have been a lot of media waiting to see him and fans hassle him  and so forth."  </P></p>

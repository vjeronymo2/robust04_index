			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Swedish bull run may be coming to an end - Emphasis will be on corporate earnings in 1994 A bull run dating from late 1992 may finally be coming to an end for Swedish equities. Long-term interest rates are heading upwards, thanks to turbulence in international markets and worries about higher US interest rates, At the same time a stream of rights issues is soaking up liquidity. The two trends have combined to bring the most unsettled market conditions for nearly 18 months. Shares have generally fallen in recent days, but even so the Affarsvarlden index remains up some 4 per cent since the beginning of the year. The turbulence may just be temporary: Goldman Sachs in London, for example, anticipates a 20 per cent rise in the market over the next 12 months. To some extent, the bourse has been a victim of its own success. What began as a trickle of companies seeking new equity from their shareholders has turned into a flood. The government is also making heavy demands on the market with its privatisation programme, the most recent being its SKr8bn (Dollars 1bn) sell-off of a 49 per cent stake in forestry group AssiDoman. Some observers are suggesting that the state's planned late spring disposal of its stake in Pharmacia - for an estimated SKr14bn-16bn - should be delayed. Skandia, the insurance group, and Avesta Sheffield, the stainless steel producer, are the latest big companies to announce rights issues. According to one estimate, rights issues and privatisations may soak up as much as SKr50bn this year, equal to some 3.4 per cent of GDP, and dwarfing the SKr27bn raised in 1993. The demand is huge, but supply from both foreign and domestic sources remains healthy. Last year foreigners bought a net SKr30.8bn of Swedish shares, taking their ownership of the stock market to nearly 25 per cent. There has been no sign of a let up in 1994, with a further SKr3.95bn of net purchases by foreigners in January. Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share Promotion, expects overseas institutions to make SKr30bn of net purchases in 1994 simply because many are still adjusting their portfolio weightings after Sweden relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership in January 1993. He also expects a big inflow of funds from domestic institutions and households because of higher personal savings, new individual pension schemes, and changed tax treatment for dividends and capital gains. Most analysts are agreed that the fundamentals will remain strong in 1994. However, the driving factor this year will be corporate earnings, rather than lower interest rates, even though the trend for the latter is expected to be downward. Corporate results for 1993 generally met or exceeded expectations, and further gains are anticipated this year as companies benefit from the three hard years of cost-cutting and a generally weak currency. One big difference in 1994 is that currency flows have been hedged at much more attractive rates. The general economic picture is also much more encouraging, with positive GDP growth expected in 1994 for the first year since 1990. The recovery was triggered by strong growth in exports, following a 20 per cent depreciation in the krona last year, but is now spreading to the domestic economy. The improved economic outlook has brought a strengthening of the krona since the beginning of the year. This will be positive for foreign interest in the market, according to Mr Christian Diebitsch, Swedish analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. 'I don't think we will see the market rise another 54 per cent rise in local currencies, like last year, but a strong krona is certainly positive from a foreign perspective,' he states. On the negative side, Sweden's huge budget deficit - one of the highest in the OECD - and an unemployment rate of around 14 per cent will continue to cause concern about the state of the country's finances. Uncertainty will also increase as the year progresses, with both a general election and a referendum on entry into the European Union due before the end of the year. A 'no' vote in the EU referendum, in particular, would damage confidence. These factors aside, there is the market's vulnerability to developments in the international arena: a vulnerability which has been enhanced by the increased levels of foreign ownership.</p>

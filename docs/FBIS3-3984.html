This is a view shared by the chief representatives and  managers of the Beijing offices of ROK's Daewoo, Hyundai,  Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung corporations. In a recent interview  with XINHUA before ROK President Kim Yong-sam's China visit,  they said that the two countries are mutually supplementary in  terms of natural resources, technology and economic structure.  If the two sides can combine their advantages, their  enterprises will develop rapidly.    Chung Chae-kwan, chief representative of Hyundai  Corporation's Beijing office, said that as the ROK and China are  neighbors with a long history of culture exchanges and economic  and trade contacts, there is a solid foundation for the  cooperation of the companies of two countries.    Since the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in  1992,  he said, many Korean enterprises have come to invest in and  conduct trade with China, and many Chinese companies have  entered Korean markets.    As a result, Chung noted, the Sino-ROK trade ties have  enjoyed tremendous development. Last year, the bilateral trade  volume stood at 8.2 billion U.S. dollars, and ROK investment in  China reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.    S.C. Yi, representative of the Beijing office of Daewoo,  said  that since China has rich natural resources and labor, while the  ROK has accumulated useful experience in its 40-year economic  development and possesses advanced technology suitable for  China, the effective cooperation between the two sides will  create development chances for both sides.    Since the late 1980s, Daewoo began to invest mainly in  China's fields of machinery, chemicals, electrical appliances  and automobiles. By the end of last year, its investment in  China had reached 300 million U.S. dollars. Its trade volume  with China in 1993 was one billion U.S. dollars. Daewoo has  also set up a joint venture with Chinese companies in the ROK.    Business in China has also developed smoothly for Samsung.  With 10 offices in China, its trade volume with China surpassed  1.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, ranking first among all ROK  companies. It has invested more than 100 million U.S. dollars  to set up an ROK-China joint venture to manufacture electronic  products and telecommunications equipment.    Chun Sung-chin, chief representative of Lucky-Goldstar's  Beijing office, said that since the enterprises of both  countries all are facing tense competition in the world, they  must introduce new technology and expand their production scope.  The industrial circle of the two countries should strengthen  their cooperation in this regard.    All of the ROK entrepreneurs interviewed stressed that their  companies have made long-term plans to cooperate with China,  some of which have been carried out. Daewoo has signed an  agreement with China to jointly produce automobile parts. The  Lucky-Goldstar Group has just reached agreements with China to  invest 400 million U.S. dollars to manufacture electronic  products. It also plans to move its Asian sub-headquarters from  Hong Kong to Beijing.</p>

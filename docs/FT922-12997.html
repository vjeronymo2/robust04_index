			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: GE up 6% in first quarter GENERAL Electric, the US group whose interests range from power systems to financial services, unveiled a 6 per cent rise in first-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 1.06bn from Dollars 999m a year earlier, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Earnings per share advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 1.23 from Dollars 1.15, reflecting a five-year Dollars 10bn share repurchase programme. Revenues grew 2 per cent to Dollars 13.5bn from Dollars 13.3bn. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company's power systems, medical systems and financial services operations had contributed to the improvement. GE's NBC broadcasting operations also had better first-quarter results. However, the recession's impact on short-cycle, high-margin business was reflected in a decline in operating margins, to 11.7 per cent in the quarter from 12.1 per cent.</p>

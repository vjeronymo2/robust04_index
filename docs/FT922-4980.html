			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Equiticorp fraud trial opens in Auckland MR Allan Hawkins, founder of the finance group, Equiticorp, and six former colleagues went on trial in Auckland yesterday on fraud and conspiracy charges relating to the collapse of the group in 1987 with millions of dollars of debt. The case before a judge sitting alone is expected to create legal history as it is expected to last up to two years, with the reading of the case against them alone due to take three days. The case involves an investigation into the startling growth of Equiticorp from a small finance company in 1984 to an international group with assets worth NZDollars 4bn (Pounds 1.17bn) and interests as diverse as Guinness Peat in Britain, a Hong Kong listed company, Capitalcorp International, merchant banking in Australia, and control of New Zealand Steel. Equiticorp ran into difficulties in October 1987, on the day of the stock market crash when it signed a deal to buy 87 per cent of New Zealand Steel for Dollars NZ327m from the government. Events surrounding the New Zealand Steel deal are central to criminal charges against Mr Hawkins and his legal adviser, Mr Paul Darvell, a partner in one of Auckland's largest companies. They and five others are also charged with conspiracy to defraud in relation to the floatation of Capitalcorp International in Hong Kong, and to management fees allegedly taken after the sale of shares in its Australian companies. An all-encompassing conspiracy charge against all seven men alleging they were involved in a money laundering scheme was introduced by the Serious Fraud Office. When the trial is over, some of the defendants will face a NZDollars 564m civil claim by the Equiticorp statutory managers who took over Equiticorp's reins when it collapsed.</p>

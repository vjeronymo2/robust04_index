Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters  the  government has decided to send only Labor Minister Chikara  Sakaguchi to the Detroit meeting as other ministers invited to  the meeting are unable to go because of Diet business. "There  is a perception that deliberation on the (fiscal 1994) budget is  more important, so the government made a decision to have only  the labor minister attend," Takemura said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton has invited officials of the  other G-7 major industrial countries -- Japan, Germany, Britain,  France, Italy and Canada -- to the meeting to discuss ways to  create new jobs.    From Japan, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International  Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Economic  Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota were also invited  to the meeting.</p>

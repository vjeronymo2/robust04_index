			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Ukraine to sign NPT Ukraine will formally renounce its nuclear status today, ending a long-running row over the former Soviet nuclear arsenal and opening the way for the delayed implementation of superpower arms cuts, Reuter reports from Budapest. President Leonid Kuchma said yesterday he had come to the European security summit in Budapest ready to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) provided he gets the guarantees he wants for Ukraine's protection. US President Bill Clinton is scheduled to preside over a signing ceremony with President Kuchma on the margins of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe summit today. The deal opens the way for long-delayed implementation of old Cold War era superpower arms cuts under the Start-1 treaty. Of the three other former Soviet republics which inherited nuclear weapons, Russia remains a nuclear power while Belarus and Kazakhstan have already given them up.</p>

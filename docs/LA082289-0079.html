			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KENNEY GETS CHANCE TO PLAY THIRD FIDDLE  </P> <P> Joe Gibbs always has been known as an innovative coach, but he has outdone  himself. He has divided an NFL game into thirds.  </P> <P> Four quarters are not viable for a coach who has three quarterbacks he wants to  test, as Gibbs will Monday night in the Washington Redskins' pre-season game at  Minnesota. So Gibbs has broken the 60-minute game into thirds. Stan Humphries  will play the first 20 minutes, Bill Kenney the middle 20 and Mark Rypien the  final third.  </P> <P> Humphries and Rypien are young, but they have been around enough to become  familiar with the Redskins, and vice versa. But Kenney -- who knows him?  </P> <P> There are mental images of him, and they are not particularly good ones. As a  Kansas City Chief, he appeared in an occasional NFL highlight film, but usually  it was the highlight film of the other team. There's a faint recollection of a  Pro Bowl appearance in 1983. There are more than 17,000 passing yards and  numerous team single-season records. There even is longevity that makes him, at  age 34, the oldest Redskin, nearly seven months the senior of Doug Williams.  </P> <P> But still, who knows who Bill Kenney really is? And why in the world, so close  to the end of his career, is he here?  </P> <P> "I think the fans in Kansas City thought I was a nice guy, but not a great  quarterback," he said. "I had some good years, but when you don't win. ... "  </P> <P> Kenney came to the Redskins last month as an insurance policy when Williams's  lower back began to ache. He eschewed an opportunity to be the No. 2  quarterback in Atlanta so he could become the No. 5 man here. He had never been  with a winner before, save for one AFC wildcard game in 1986. You can't  overestimate the importance that holds for him.  </P> <P> "My objective has been to play with a team that I feel, selfishly, can get me  to where I want to go, which is the playoffs, but on the other hand, that I can  help," he said. "I looked at the situation here and they offered the best of  both those objectives."  </P> <P> Kenney, who came out of Northern Colorado and joined the Chiefs as a free agent  in 1979 after being cut by the Redskins, has a better sense of humor than one  might expect of a quarterback on a hapless team.  </P> <P> "We were in the Hall of Fame the other day and the guys said: 'Hey Bill, come  here. Come here.' Howie Long was the defensive lineman of the year in the  Miller Lite display of, I think it was 1987. They have a bunch of pictures of  me (being sacked by Long). I've also had comments from people on the Sports  Illustrated Crunchman (advertisement) that I'm in there 50 percent of the  time."  </P></p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Davies &amp; Newman wind-up battle DAVIES &amp; Newman Holdings, parent company of Dan-Air, was given a rough ride to its death by small shareholders at yesterday's extraordinary meeting in London. The initial count on the resolution to wind up the group voluntarily showed 44 against and only 10 in favour. Well over 100 people attended the meeting. However, the dissenters were swamped by proxy votes in a poll, with 400 holders of 41.6m shares in favour and 244 holders of 1.18m shares against. Liquidators from Price Waterhouse were appointed. Shareholders in Davies &amp; Newman, rescued in both 1990 and 1991, have ended up with nothing after the sale of Dan-Air, its main asset, to British Airways for Pounds 1. They were told the only alternative was receivership. About 750 employees sank Pounds 542,000, at 50p a share, in last October's Pounds 49.3m rescue issue. It was these and other small shareholders who dominated yesterday's meeting. Their angry questions were fielded by Mr David James, company doctor-chairman since autumn 1990. Mr Peter Frankel said shareholders had been treated with contempt. He questioned whether the Stock Exchange should have waived the requirement to refer the BA deal to shareholders. Mr James replied that Davies &amp; Newman would have gone bust before the procedure could be completed. Having heard that an extra Pounds 10m would have enabled the company to shed the cost-albatross of its Boeing 727s, Mr Frankel asked whether the Pounds 8.75m paid in special fees to the banks should have been used instead to save the company. Mr James said Pounds 8.75m was 'a drop in the ocean' compared with projected debt of Pounds 55m by next April. Capt Robert Burgess, who used to fly one of Dan-Air's Boeing 727s, asked why pilots had only received the statutory minimum redundancy pay, adding up to perhaps Pounds 4,000, when he understood flight engineers got up to Pounds 35,000 and cabin staff up to Pounds 20,000. He was told that different agreements had applied to different categories of staff, and there was a limit to the restructuring costs that could be attached to the BA deal. Sir Ivor Broom, chairman of Gatwick Handling, in which Davies &amp; Newman had a 50 per cent holding, said employee-shareholders had been misled in a September newsletter from Mr James pointing out that debt was low and cash positive at that point - although both points were true. According to the EGM circular it had been realised by late August that new capital was essential to enable the group to trade beyond the third week of October. Mr James said the September newsletter had pointed out that new funds would be needed. Talks with Mr Richard Branson, of Virgin Atlantic Airways, had raised hopes of fresh investment. With Mr James contending that Dan-Air's dwindling charter business was the main reason for its loss of independence, one shareholder asked how much had been 'wasted on setting up new scheduled routes and then closing them down because of recession?'</p>

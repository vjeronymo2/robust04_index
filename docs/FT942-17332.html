			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Contest over peninsula escalates The contest between Crimea and the Ukrainian government over who rules the Black Sea peninsula escalated over the weekend, writes Jill Barshay from Kiev. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, annulled a March 15 decree by the Crimean President Yuri Meshkov, which stated that Crimean recruits would serve exclusively on the peninsula instead of being dispatched by the Ukrainian command. Meanwhile, Crimea contested the legitimacy of Mr Kravchuk's March 31 decision to send a presidential representative to Crimea.</p>

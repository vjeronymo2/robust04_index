			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Cut-price advice plan for jobless MANCHESTER Training and Enterprise Council yesterday launched a cut-price redundancy counselling service for non-executive workers after trials suggested it might reduce the time taken by some people to find new jobs. The service, claimed to be the first of its kind offered by a Tec - the employer-led bodies which administer government training schemes in England and Wales - costs an employer Pounds 200 a day for up to 15 places on a tutorial session with a qualified counsellor. Daily rates in the private sector - usually for executives only - are said to be in the Pounds 750 to Pounds 1,000 range. Many smaller companies cannot afford to spend much on helping people they make redundant - even though the government allows counselling costs to be set against corporation tax. Trials among six companies involved 200 redundant people. More than half were back in work within three months.</p>

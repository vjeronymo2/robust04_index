			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai banks earn more after liberalisation THAILAND'S 15 commercial banks increased their overall net profits by 59.8 per cent last year to Bt31.10bn (Dollars 1.2bn), after a 25.4 per cent rise in 1991, according to figures compiled by Bangkok Bank, the country's largest. Bangkok Bank attributed the strength of profits partly to financial liberalisation measures introduced by the Thai authorities, including the relaxation of foreign exchange controls and the easing of restrictions on new branches. Banks have been allowed to engage in many new areas of business. Compulsory holdings of government bonds as a condition for opening new branches have also been reduced. 'All banks have been improving their efficiency to prepare themselves for the anticipated greater competition from both local and overseas commercial banks and other financial institutions,' Bangkok Bank's research department said. 'Furthermore, several banks have been able to reclaim many of their bad debts, resulting in greater revenue.' One factor not mentioned in the report is the continued co-operation between Thai banks in maintaining wide spreads between deposit rates and lending rates. Bangkok Bank said the assets, deposits, credits and capital of Thai banks last year grew at a lower rate than in previous years because of the moderate slowdown of the local economy and the world recession. Assets of the 15 banks were Bt2,589.5bn at the end of December. Rates of return on assets were generally higher last year than in 1991, averaging 1.2 per cent against 0.87 per cent, with Bangkok Bank itself chalking up the highest figure of 1.58 per cent. Bangkok Bank also had the highest rate of return on equity, at 23.25 per cent, compared with the average of 17.59 per cent. Twelve of the banks reported much higher increases in net profit last year than in 1991. Bangkok Bank was one of the three exceptions: its net profit rose 45.3 per cent last year to Bt10.54bn, after a 54.7 rise in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY SUES 13 FIRMS THAT USED ASBESTOS IN BUILDING COURTHOUSE, JAIL  </P> <P> San Diego County sued 13 building manufacturers Friday whose  asbestos-containing products were used anywhere from 15 to 30 years ago in the  county courthouse and its adjoining jail, officials said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, authorized by the County Board of Supervisors and filed in the  U.S. District Court in downtown San Diego, seeks to recover the expense of  removing asbestos discovered in the county buildings in October, 1988.  </P> <P> The exact amount sought was not included in the lawsuit because officials have  not yet determined the extent of the damage, county spokesman Bob Lerner said.  But, he added, "It will run into the millions."  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the manufacturers, including primary defendant W. R.  Grace &amp; Co. of New York, either knew or should have known of the health  hazards associated with asbestos when the material was sold to the county, said  Tom Penfield, an attorney with Casey, Gerry, Casey, Westbrook, Reed &amp;  Hughes. The San Diego-based law firm, which has extensive experience in  asbestos litigation, is representing the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Knew It Was Harmful'  </P> <P> "We're taking this action because, ultimately, the manufacturer was  responsible. . . . They knew it was harmful," said Supervisor Susan Golding  about the cancer-causing agent that was outlawed in 1979. Federal law also  requires removal of asbestos before a building's renovation or demolition to  prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the environment.  </P> <P> "People working in buildings or just visiting buildings with loose asbestos can  be harmed," Golding said. "That's why we're determined to correct the problem.  But the cost of removing asbestos is astronomical. There is no question that we  do not have enough money in the county budget to do it."  </P> <P> The suit targets only the asbestos found in the courthouse and the jail. County  officials believe the material could have been placed in the two facilities  during its construction from 1959 to 1961 and during seven major renovations,  the last one reaching into the mid-1970s.  </P> <P> More lawsuits may soon follow, Golding added.  </P> <P> "We are surveying all county buildings, and we will specify the  highest-priority buildings and address them as quickly as possible," Golding  said. "After taking a look, if we determine that a lawsuit is required, we will  file them. We really don't have a choice in the matter."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Lengthy Process  </P> <P> Growing concern in recent years over the dangers of asbestos has spurred  governments to either remove or encapsulate loose microscopic asbestos fibers  commonly found in more than 3,000 building products such as cable insulation,  roof shingles and fireproofing coatings or materials. The Environmental  Protection Agency estimates that more than 733,000 public and commercial  buildings in the United States contain asbestos.  </P> <P> "Discovering asbestos is a somewhat lengthy process," Penfield said. "You have  to have people who are specially trained to identify the substance, which then  has to be confirmed in the lab."  </P> <P> Besides recovering the cost of replacing the asbestos with non-hazardous  materials, the lawsuit seeks to receive reimbursement for testing and other  associated costs. Efforts to inform employees about the presence of asbestos,  instituting strict work requirements and installing warning labels are all  costly procedures, Penfield said.  </P> <P> Penfield's firm is also representing the city of San Diego in similar  cost-recovery litigation. The case, involving the discovery of asbestos in  eight city buildings, is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 1, 1990. Another case,  involving more city buildings, is scheduled to go to trial Aug. 1, 1991.  </P> <P> Besides W. R. Grace &amp; Co., the county lawsuit names Thorpe Insulations,  Fibreboard Corp., Armstrong World Industries, Durabla Corp., Francis Steam  Generator Co., Garlock Inc., H.K. Porter Co. Inc., Keene Corp., Keene Building  Products Corp., Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., Owens-Illinois Glass Co. and  Pabco Inc.  </P></p>

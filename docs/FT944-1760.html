			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / High Court to rule on BCCI payout plan today The painstaking progress towards a settlement for the creditors' of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International moves forward today at the High Court in London. The latest plan put forward by the UK-based liquidators, accountants Touche Ross, must be cleared by the court before arrangements can be made for the payment of an interim dividend to the creditors. But success today will not remove all the obstacles facing the creditors. The agreement has to be cleared by courts in three jurisdictions - the UK, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Any court decision may be subject to an appeal. So far the case has been heard in Luxembourg but a judgment is not expected until January 12. The case comes before the courts in the Cayman Islands on January 12 as well. Today's hearing in London is expected to last a day. While appeals lodged in the UK courts or the Cayman Islands can be dealt with relatively swiftly, an unsuccessful appeal in the Luxembourg court could delay a payment to creditors by up to a year. A successful one would derail the agreement. An earlier creditors' plan had to be abandoned after a successful appeal was granted by the Luxembourg court in October last year. The current plan, the second offered to creditors, was designed to meet objections raised during that appeal. BCCI was shut down in 1991 with liabilities of up to Dollars 10bn following the discovery of the world's biggest banking fraud. The bank's assets may total up to Dollars 4bn. Estimates of the number of creditors worldwide range up to 150,000. Under the new agreement the Abu Dhabi government, the principal shareholder of BCCI, will pay Dollars 1.55bn after the successful completion of the court hearings, Dollars 150m 24 months later and Dollars 100m 36 months after completion. The eventual dividend to creditors was estimated shortly after the collapse of the bank at between 30 per cent to 40 per cent and throughout the lengthy process of finding an acceptable agreement most forecasts have kept within that band. However, the final offer could well be outside this range because of unresolved legal actions linked to the bank's collapse and uncertainty over the final level of claims by creditors - particularly those outside the UK and Luxembourg. Estimates of an interim dividend have been put at about 20 per cent. This is based on creditors' claims of about Dollars 10bn and funds available to the liquidators from the Abu Dhabi settlement and other sources. The current plan received a boost when it was welcomed by the BCCI Depositors Protection Association. The association had been responsible for helping to block the original offer. It said it wished to end the delays caused by appeals. It also pointed out that the new agreement, unlike the original, allowed creditors to pursue claims against the government of Abu Dhabi. An appeal against the agreement is possible from a range of interested parties. These include regulators, directors of the failed bank and former employees, as well as individual creditors.</p>

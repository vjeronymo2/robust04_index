			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In considering whether grounds exist to deny Respondent's application for DEA registration, the administrative law judge found factors two, four and five relevant in light of evidence regarding Respondent's falsification of employment applications, representing that he held a DEA registration after he had surrendered the registration; and, Respondent's issuing of prescriptions for controlled substances using his surrendered DEA registration number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative law judge found, that despite Respondent's explanations regarding his falsifying employment applications and writing prescriptions with a surrendered DEA registration number, Respondent showed no remorse, and appeared to consider his actions justified by exigent circumstances. The administrative law judge also found with respect to the prescriptions for Dilaudid, that Respondent's testimony was not responsive nor particularly credible. The administrative law judge further found that Respondent's admission that other persons, including his wife whom Respondent knew to be a drug abuser, had access to his prescription pads, showed that Respondent had little respect for the responsibilities of being a DEA registrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Judge Bittner concluded that the preponderance of the credible evidence established that it is unlikely that Respondent would competently or reliably discharge the obligations inherent in a DEA registration, and further concluded that it would not be in the public interest to grant his application. Therefore, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration, executed by Timothy H. Reese, M.D., be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Stephen H.

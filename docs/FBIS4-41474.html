			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 23 Jun -- Russia has officially  informed the UN Security Council that CIS collective  peacekeeping forces are being deployed in Abkhazia for a period  of six months in order to prevent fresh bloodshed in the  conflict zone. This is stated in a letter from Russian  Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was distributed here  today as a Security Council document.    "The situation in Abkhazia and in the Republic of Georgia  remains very tense and there is a continuing threat of fresh  bloodshed. The fact that there are still over 250,000 refugees  and displaced persons there means that no eventuality can be  ruled out. This includes the possibility that elements which  are not under the control of either side could destabilize the  situation," A. Kozyrev noted.    The minister pointed out that although the international  community realizes that a peace-keeping operation in the Abkhaz  region "is indispensable," it has been reluctant to adopt a  decision on forming a UN force for peacekeeping in Abkhazia, on  the grounds that "conditions are not ripe" yet. "However, as far  as the peacekeeping operation is concerned, the time factor has  now become critical if peace is to be secured and the necessary  conditions created for further progress toward a political  settlement," A. Kozyrev stressed.    He recalled that in the agreement on a cease-fire and  disengagement of forces, which was signed in Moscow on 14 May,  the Georgian and Abkhaz sides appealed to the Council of CIS  Heads of State to adopt a decision on the use of collective  peacekeeping forces in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.  Furthermore, the parties sent a special appeal to President  Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who is chairman of the Council.    "Acting on the basis of Chapter XIII of the UN Charter, the  commonwealth decided to send collective forces to the conflict  zone for a period of six months. An advance party, consisting  of Russian forces already stationed in Abkhazia, is being  deployed right away," the document says.    It points out: "The commonwealth is not seeking to take the  place of UN efforts, but to help create the best possible  conditions for them to work. Therefore, it is important to  establish, right from the outset, close cooperation between the  peace-keeping forces and the UN observer mission in Georgia. We  hope the Security Council will decide to increase the strength  of this mission and to expand and clarify its mandate."    Russia expressed hope that the establishment under UN  auspices of a special voluntary fund to finance peacekeeping  operations in Abkhazia "will help to attract a wide range of  states to peacekeeping work."</p>

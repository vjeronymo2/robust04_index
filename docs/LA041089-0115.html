			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 DEFENDANTS 'KNEW' OF PENTAGON BRIBERY;  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR CLOSES HIS CASE; DEFENSE CITES PLEA BARGAIN  </P> <P> Three California businessmen charged in the Pentagon corruption scandal "knew  more than they wanted to admit they knew" about a scheme to bribe a Navy  engineer, a prosecutor told a jury today.  </P> <P> The defendants, all former executive vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of  Newbury Park, Calif., are accused of conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud in the  first trial stemming from the government's nearly 3-year-old investigation of  kickbacks and bribery in the Pentagon's purchasing system.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Jack Hanly said in his closing argument that the  defendants -- Eugene Sullivan, George Kaub and Dale Schnittjer -- were aware  that a private consultant they had hired was paying bribes to obtain  information about a lucrative radar contract.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $24-Million Contract  </P> <P> But defense attorney Mark Tuohey, representing Kaub, tried to pick apart the  government's case by pointing out that the main witnesses had pleaded guilty in  exchange for lesser sentences and were cooperating with the government.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Richard Williams was to explain the charges to the jury  before the group of four women and eight men begin their deliberations in the  trial that began a week ago.  </P> <P> Tuohey said Kaub had no idea that William Parkin, the private consultant hired  by Teledyne Electronics, had paid money to Stuart Berlin, a Navy engineer, for  details about a $24-million contract that Teledyne won to make hand-held radar  sets. Parkin and Berlin are among those who pleaded guilty in exchange for  helping the government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Motive . . . to Save Skin'  </P> <P> The government's witnesses had "every motive in the world to save their skin,"  Tuohey argued. "Each came into the courtroom under immunity promising to  cooperate with the prosecution with a hammer over their heads."  </P> <P> But Tuohey said his client was in the dark, a victim of a conspiracy between  Parkin, Berlin and two other men. Their only motive was "to get everything you  can and don't tell anybody about it," he said.  </P> <P> But prosecutor Hanly said of the defendants, "They knew more than they wanted  to admit they knew."  </P> <P> During the trial, the jury heard tape-recorded conversations between Parkin and  the defendants obtained from wiretaps.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BROKERAGE SUBPOENAED IN PROBE OF ATTEMPTS TO SELL LINCOLN S &amp; L  </P> <P> A Cincinnati brokerage has been subpoenaed by federal investigators looking  into possible stock manipulation involving American Continental of Phoenix and  its efforts to sell Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine.  </P> <P> But the head of Queen City Securities said the firm was not itself a target of  a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into questionable trading of  American Continental stock.  </P> <P> "We haven't done anything wrong. We are cooperating with the SEC in any way we  can," said H. Garrett Frey, Queen City's chairman.  </P> <P> Although SEC representative Mary McCue would not confirm or deny that a probe  is under way, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers has confirmed that both  it and the SEC are investigating, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reviewing Trading  </P> <P> "We are reviewing trading in the stock," said Enno Hobbing, an association vice  president. His agency oversees the national over-the-counter securities market  on which American Continental is traded.  </P> <P> American Continental's common stock, which sold for more than $7 a share just 2  weeks ago, has plummeted to nearly $3. The firm's preferred stock also has  declined in price, selling at around $6.50 a share in recent trading after  holding steady just weeks ago at more than $10.  </P> <P> That drop has been blamed on persistent rumors that plans by the Arizona firm  to sell Lincoln had run aground.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, American Continental said its agreement to sell the thrift  to a Los Angeles investor group headed by veteran thrift executive Spencer  Scott had expired. The firm said it would continue to negotiate with the Scott  group while entertaining bids from other suitors.  </P> <P> "We are certainly willing to work with Scott, but we will be looking very  closely at other sale options as well," American Continental Chairman Charles  H. Keating Jr. said in a statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Development  </P> <P> In a separate development, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles confirmed  this week that Lincoln is involved in a criminal fraud investigation. A  spokesman for the office declined to discuss the matter, however. It was not  clear if that investigation was related to the SEC inquiry.  </P> <P> Frey said his firm is examining the spread and impact of stock market rumors  about the Lincoln sale and the short selling of American Continental's stock.  It also is examining whether investors and American Continental have been  harmed as a result, he said.  </P> <P> Short selling involves the sale of borrowed stock by speculators who believe  that the price is headed down. If they are right, they will buy shares at a  lower price to cover their short sales and profit from the difference.  </P> <P> Robert Kielty, American Continental's senior vice president and general  counsel, said Friday that he was not aware of a short-selling investigation.  </P> <P> Such a probe would not involve the company directly, Kielty said. "But we sure  would be pleased if the SEC is looking into it," he said. "Short selling has a  negative effect on our shareholders because the short sellers want to drive  down the price of our stock, so they generate bad news. We think they are the  source of some of the rumors and negative information" about American  Continental."  </P> <P> Queen Cities Securities said it learned of the investigation when it was  subpoenaed in February. It was asked to provide information concerning its  activities in American Continental stock. Queen City holds hundreds of  thousands of shares of the stock for its clients.  </P> <P> Queen City supplied the SEC with documents, but no company executives have been  interviewed by the agency, Frey said. Also, association investigators have not  contacted the firm, Frey added.  </P> <P> "We asked the SEC if we were a target and they said no, " Frey said.  </P> <P> Although Frey would not disclose their names, he said others subpoenaed are  likely to be among brokerages throughout the United States that make a market  in American Continental's stock.  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / ITC to allow lottery adverts The Independent Television Commission has cleared the way for television advertising for the National Lottery - something that would be prevented under present rules. The commission has decided to amend its code of advertising standards and practice. Television programmes designed as promotional vehicles for the lottery, which is due to launch late next year or early in 1995, will not be allowed. Codes forbidding 'undue prominence' of goods and services in programmes will remain in place, but the ITC has decided that it will be possible to incorporate a lottery draw in 'suitable programming', such as a light entertainment show. This will only be possible where: There have been no financial inducements to the programme maker or licensee. No other programme elements - other than the draw - can be supplied by the National Lottery. Editorial control must remain with the broadcaster. The commission also suggests that it may be possible for the National Lottery operator to sponsor programmes on ITV or Channel 4.</p>

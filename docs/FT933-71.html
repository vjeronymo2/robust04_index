			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of Japanese Companies - Financial Review (8): Veteran of the iron triangle - Profile, Gaishi Hiraiwa JAPAN'S new generation of leaders has, ironically, turned to a member of the old guard for advice on how to get out of the present economic fix. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, 78, the man chosen last month by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, to prepare a report by the end of the year on how to restructure the economy, is a typical product of the establishment on which the old conservative-run order was based. He is also an example of how the reformist government needs the establishment's help to function at all. The government's package of deregulation measures, covering 94 sectors from satellite broadcasting to brewing, is one step towards reducing unnecessary costs in Japan's Byzantine economic system. Mr Hiraiwa's report, a separate project, has been asked to go even deeper. He has been asked for ideas on how to change Japan from a society driven by companies and producers into a society that pays more attention to consumers' aspirations, the most important popular theme of the Hosokawa government. In this, his 15-man panel drawn from the top ranks of corporate Japan aims to build on the Maekawa report. Named after a former governor of the Bank of Japan, the Maekawa report in 1986 urged that domestic consumption should be stimulated to reduce Japan's burgeoning trade surplus. Few of its proposals have been acted upon. Mr Hiraiwa's strikingly low public profile is belied by his extensive behind-the-scenes influence as chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, an organisation which forms part of the so-called iron triangle of business, bureaucrats and politicians. A graduate of Tokyo University, the traditional breeding ground for the Japanese elite, Mr Hiraiwa started his professional career as a humble washing machine salesman, working his way up to the chairmanship of Tokyo Electric Power by 1976. He has a gentle, professorial manner and is said to be among the most widely read members of the business establishment. His influence on all sides of the iron triangle is said to be formidable. Yet this member of the old guard showed his ability to move fast with the times when the Keidanren recently announced that it would stop channelling funds to the defeated Liberal Democratic Party. The Keidanren doled out Y13bn to the LDP at the latest count, in 1991, so the decision is a heavy blow to the conservatives, made worse by the fact that other business groups are following suit. The decision was triggered by the wave of political scandals surrounding the arrest of Shin Kanemaru, former political 'godfather' of the LDP, and the ultimate collapse of the LDP government last June. But it also reflects the Keidanren's realisation that following the collapse of socialist regimes across the world, it no longer needs to pay the ruling party to guarantee the continued existence of a free market economy in Japan. The Keidanren has clearly indicated that its old job financing the LDP will now be less important. It is therefore expected to devote more effort to being a think-tank and government adviser. Here Mr Hiraiwa will be able to draw on the federation's 200-strong research unit to make his mark on the new government's economic policies. The job should suit him well, in that Mr Hiraiwa is known for having lobbied fiercely for the former government to deregulate the economy and to have taken a hand in the formation of the three public spending packages launched by the LDP and Mr Hosokawa's government over the past 18 months. Mr Hosokawa, meanwhile, will be an attentive listener. The seven-party ruling coalition is divided on many things, but not on the realisation that if it fails to deliver economic revival before the next election, likely within a year, the LDP could well stage a surprise come-back.</p>

The editorial says the historic letter of the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song consummates the theoretical and practical  matters for finally solving the rural question, the most  difficult question in socialist construction, by dynamically  accelerating rural construction along the road indicated by the  rural theses.    The editorial quotes the respected leader Comrade Kim  Il-song  as saying:    "If we consolidate the position we have already taken up and  launch a new battle by making more strenuous efforts, we will  win a historic victory in the solution of the rural question,  the most difficult question in the building of socialism."    The work, it notes, is a militant banner that instills into  the minds of our agricultural working people and other people  the conviction of the might of the chuche-based system of the  socialist rural economy and the invincibility of the  Korean-style socialism and that powerfully encourages them in  the work for consolidating and developing them; it is a highly  important guideline in effecting a new revolutionary turn in our  rural economy and in all sectors of agricultural production.    The work is a famous work that has further developed and  enriched the revolutionary theory of the working class on  socialist and communist construction with new and unique  contents, the editorial points out, and goes on:    It is of weighty significance in the development of the  revolutionary theory of rural construction that the great leader  in this work gave a comprehensive exposition of the principle,  ways and time of the conversion of cooperative property to  all-people property. The theories of creating conditions for  the switchover of cooperative property to all-people property,  conducting it with the county as a unit, and correctly defining  the forms and ways of the switchover and other theories  propounded in the work light the path of finally solving the  rural question without the slightest deviation.    The great leader's work is a powerful weapon in refuting the  sophism of the imperialists that socialism cannot find a  solution to the rural question and smashing all descriptions of  opportunist tendencies of removing the revolutionary principle  of the working class in rural construction.    The editorial calls upon all the party members and other  working people to make a deep-going study of the profound idea  and theories laid down in the work, fully grasp them and develop  in depth the three revolutions, ideological, technical and  cultural, in compliance with the requirements of socialist rural  construction on a new, higher stage.</p>

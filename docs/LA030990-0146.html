			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR BANS RECYCLABLE TRASH FROM LANDFILLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday told Bureau of Sanitation officials  not to put any trash separated for recycling into landfills, after at least one  city contractor said some glass may have to be dumped because the market cannot  accept all of the glass being generated in the city's pilot recycling program.  </P> <P> The mayor, in a memo to the Board of Public Works and Bureau of Sanitation  officials, said putting material into landfills that was meant to be recycled  could "undermine (public) support for the curbside recycling program we have  launched for 720,000 households in the city."  </P></p>

SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994. Thereafter, perform a visual inspection, and ECI or FPI, for cracks in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, at intervals not to exceed 10 hours TIS since the last inspection, unless a new post-1983 later style propeller hub is installed, per paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For propellers installed on all other aircraft models, except for the four non-agricultural models listed in paragraph (a) of this AD, and that utilize Textron Lycoming TIO&hyph;540, LTIO&hyph;540, or turbocharged IO&hyph;540 series reciprocating engines accomplish the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Within 50 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, but not to exceed 50 hours TIS since the last inspection, and thereafter at intervals of 50 hours TIS, perform a visual inspection for presence of grease on the propeller and determine the source of this grease leakage prior to further flight. Following the visual inspection, perform an ECI or FPI for cracks in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Use of a black light to inspect the suspect area can aid in determining the source of grease leakage because authorized grease contains fluorescent properties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) If grease is leaking from the hub arm or wall, replace the propeller with a serviceable propeller prior to further flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If grease is determined to be leaking from other causes, take the appropriate corrective maintenance action and record in appropriate maintenance records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If a crack is found in a propeller hub during the inspections required in paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, replace the hub prior to further flight with a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub, or with a serviceable 1983 or earlier hub that has been inspected in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc.

Thereafter, perform a visual inspection, and ECI or FPI,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS since the last inspection, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, unless a new post-1983 configuration propeller hub is installed, per paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) An alternative method of compliance in Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, describes a propeller hub modification to chamfer the inside and outside hub arm surfaces of the grease hole fitting. Performing this interim modification allows an operator to extend the initial and repetitive inspection period as required by paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this AD, as applicable, to 400 hours TIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For propellers installed on aircraft listed in paragraph (a) of this AD, once 400 hours TIS is reached, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, the propeller hub must be replaced in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For propellers installed on aircraft listed in paragraph (b) of this AD, once 400 hours TIS is reached, or 36 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first, an internal inspection is required at intervals not to exceed 400 hours TIS since last inspection in accordance with Hartzell Propeller Inc. SB No. 165E, dated January 21, 1994, or replacement of the hubs must be determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) For propellers installed on aircraft listed in paragraph (a) of this AD, install new post-1983 configuration propeller hubs that have fitting holes near the hub parting line prior to June 30, 1995, or in accordance with the time extension provided in paragraph (c) of this AD. For propellers installed in aircraft listed in paragraph (b) of this AD, this replacement is optional. For all affected propellers, this replacement constitutes terminating action to the inspection requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Propeller hubs that are configured 1983 or earlier, with the grease fitting holes located on the side of the hub, that have been removed from service cannot ever be approved for return to service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the aircraft to a location where the inspections may be performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The inspections and modification shall be done in accordance with the following service document:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,6,xs60 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Document No. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Pages <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Date <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Hartzell Propeller Inc., SB No. 165E <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Jan. 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=1 --> Total pages: 10 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Adverse interest swing leaves Caird flat at Pounds 3.2m CAIRD GROUP, the waste management company, yesterday reported interim pre-tax profits almost unchanged at Pounds 3.15m as the interest charge on debt used to develop landfill sites rose sharply. Profits rose from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.15m on sales 28 per cent lower at Pounds 9.5m after disposals in the intervening period. At the operating level profits rose 27 per cent, despite a sharp deterioration in economic conditions. The group suffered a sharp swing in interest from earnings of Pounds 197,000 to a charge of Pounds 545,000 as debt rose to Pounds 15.5m and gearing to 32 per cent following a burst of capital expenditure to achieve permits for landfill sites. Mr John Ashton, chairman, said he was uncomfortable with debt at this level but that gearing would fall next year as capital expenditure fell sharply. He said the group had not only been affected by the deterioration in economic conditions but by administrative delays in achieving new planning consents and licenses. 'Not only can the legislative backdrop be characterised as one of disarray, with anticipated revisions from both the EC and The UK being delayed or amended, but also when they are implemented, they are not accompanied by clear guidelines from the enforcing authorities,' the company said. Earnings per share fell from 2p to 1.81p after a higher tax charge and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.33p. COMMENT At the operating level these are pretty impressive results, held back only by the interest charge on debts run up to accelerate the process of permitting sites. The trouble is that regulation of the industry is increasingly confused leading to long delays that leave Caird, and others in the sector, with assets not only not contributing to income but draining cash. Caird's bulge of high capital expenditure is probably over now and gearing should begin to fall if not in the second half then in 1993. But it is suffering from being a small growth stock when small is not beautiful and growth in the UK is illusive. Nevertheless, if investors believe management's story, it could be attractive for income, particularly via the convertible which is yielding something over 17 per cent. Full year profits are forecast to be about Pounds 7m, giving 4.5p of earnings, and a multiple of only 8.8.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> RIVER WATER TO BE TESTED FOR HEPATITIS  </P> <P> The Surfrider Foundation announced this week that it plans to test water dumped  from the San Gabriel River into the ocean for the virus that causes hepatitis.  </P> <P> Gordon Labedz, a foundation member and physician, said the group decided to do  the tests because some surfers have complained about getting ill after being in  the water at the mouth of the river.  </P> <P> Most of the illnesses are minor sinus and stomach infections, but group members  also say they have heard about dozens of undocumented infectious hepatitis  cases. Doctors handling such cases are required to report them to the county  health department.  </P> <P> County health records show only two infectious hepatitis cases in Seal Beach  last year. Also, the County Health Care Agency, which samples ocean waters off  the coast weekly, has never had a documented case of any serious illness from  swimming in the ocean off Orange County.  </P> <P> The water that empties from the San Gabriel River comes from three sewage  treatment plants upstream and is tested by the Los Angeles County Sanitation  District. Labedz said the foundation wants to work with the sanitation  district, which tests for bacteria, but not viruses, at the river mouth.  Testing and an attempt to document cases will begin sometime this winter, he  added. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

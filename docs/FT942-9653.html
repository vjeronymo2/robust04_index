			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo rejects 'second class' bid Lasmo, the independent exploration and production company, yesterday unveiled its formal defence against the Pounds 1.5bn all-paper bid launched last month by fellow explorer Enterprise Oil. Mr Rudolph Agnew, chairman, called on shareholders to reject the bid, describing it as 'an extraordinarily complicated and second class offer'. The all-paper offer is for 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants for every 80 Lasmo shares. The unusual equity structure has been criticised by some institutional investors, who are believed to be keen for a cash offer. Mr Agnew yesterday said he would 'not ask shareholders to reject a fully valued bid', adding that his only duty was to 'get every penny he can for shareholders'. Enterprise Oil is believed to be considering a range of options for introducing a cash element. These are thought to include a mechanism for shareholders to receive cash for the warrant portion of the offer. Enterprise is believed to have looked at the possibility of securing a group of specialised investors to under-write the warrants, which would allow it to provide a cash sweetener to Lasmo shareholders. The company has repeatedly said it would prefer not to offer cash. However, Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said yesterday that 'there is absolutely no technical reason why . . . one should not underwrite the warrants'. But he refused to say whether Enterprise was seriously considering such a move. 'It is not a strategy we are considering over and above any others,' he said. Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said Enterprise would retain flexibility but, 'we are committed to the offer we have made'. Lasmo's defence document emphasised management changes within the company and highlighted its shift in strategic direction which should reduce the company's vulnerability to low oil prices. It dismissed Enterprise's charges that Lasmo did not have the financial strength to take advantage of all its development opportunities. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said that after completing its current Pounds 219m rights issue Lasmo will be able to spend Pounds 800m on exploration, assessment and development projects over the next three years, as well as maintain a Pounds 200m 'cushion' to respond to unforeseen developments. Enterprise, however, said the figures failed to include the Pounds 450m in debt that Lasmo needs to repay over the next three years, and charged that Lasmo was 'still on the edge of the financial risk curve, with no capacity to take a knock'. Mr Hearne compared the document to 'an elaborate selling brochure'. He agreed that Lasmo's assets were attractive, but said a combined company would have the financial strength to exploit them fully.</p>

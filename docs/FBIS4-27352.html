			<p>CSO     [Text] (Nagasaki) Tomiken (Omura, Nagasaki Prefecture;  chairman, Hideo Tominaga), a building materials and home  construction equipment sales and operations firm, announced on  19 May that it will begin joint development and sales with Sharp  of a solar power system incorporated in the roof of homes.    They judge that an environment in which this system will  become popular with the average family has begun to be ready  such as national subsidies for establishment of home solar power  systems starting this fiscal year, and have decided to embark on  sales.    The roof-incorporated system developed by Tomiken and Sharp  directly incorporates solar battery modules (condenser and  generator) in the roof, and has the characteristic of increased  stability compared to the method of attaching them on top of  existing roof tiles.    There are five levels of power, ranging from 1.8 kilowatts  to  5 kilowatts. The price is from 4.7 million yen to 9 million yen.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is trying  to  popularize home solar power as a link in using clean energy.  Beginning this fiscal year, they will give a public subsidy of  900,000 yen for 1 kilowatt in the construction of general  housing. Moreover, surplus power during the daytime can be sold  to electric power companies.    The plan is to market it together with an air cycle  construction method developed by Fukubi Chemical Industries  (Fukui city) which coaxes out energy savings through air  circulation since "a solar power system alone still leaves a  sense of being relatively high in equipment cost compared to the  amount saved from electric power rates" (Chairman Tominaga).</p>

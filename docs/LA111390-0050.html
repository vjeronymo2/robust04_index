			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> EXPLORING SAFETY OPTIONS  </P> <P> Yorba Linda city officials and the Fairmont Private School need to come up with  a better way of ensuring safety for young children at a dangerous crossing near  the school. Three youngsters were seriously injured at dusk there last week  when a driver -- who told police that she never saw the students -- ran into  the children crossing Valley View Avenue as they returned from a park.  </P> <P> The crossing lies between existing crosswalks to the north and south on a  thoroughfare that neighbors say has become a dangerous speedway. There doesn't  seem to be any question that teachers take special precautions to get groups  back and forth safely for play periods, but that clearly isn't enough.  </P> <P> There is, after all, always a first time, despite the safety record the city  says it has, and despite the good luck students at that crossing had  previously. Just one incident is one incident too many. A crosswalk, a  pedestrian signal or a crossing guard are obvious options.  </P> <P> City officials have said that it would both be unusual and unsafe to install  such a crosswalk in the middle of a city block where the youngsters cross to  the park. But what good are crosswalks to the north and south of a busy school  crossing if the need is at some place in the middle? After what happened last  week, what additional provisions could be more unsafe than what now exists?  </P> <P> Moreover, the school needs to review its safety precautions. It does not  routinely employ crosswalk guards, but the city does for its public schools.  Obviously, the private school can learn something from the public ones.  </P> <P> The recent time change has hastened the arrival of dusk and created  late-afternoon danger. But there's a larger problem -- the increasing traffic  and pace of life in Orange County in general. There are other pedestrian  trouble spots around the county and this accident dramatizes the need for  better safety provisions.  </P> <P> In the meantime, if schools cannot provide better assurance of safety, walk the  group the long and safe way around.  </P></p>

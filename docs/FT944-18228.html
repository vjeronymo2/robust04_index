			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Berlusconi corruption scenario causes row An Italian opposition leader has caused a political storm by conjuring up a scenario in which Mr Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister, could be accused of corruption, allowing the far right to replace him with a top magistrate, Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Rocco Buttiglione, leader of the Popular party, the former Christian Democrats, said on Sunday: 'Some people are saying that there could be a judicial warning against the prime minister and a good substitute would be (Mr Antonio) Di Pietro.' Magistrates issue judicial warnings when formally announcing they suspect someone of having committed a crime. Mr Di Pietro is Italy's leading anti-graft magistrate and spearhead of the war on corruption which has swept away the political old guard. Italy's corruption scandals have brushed perilously close to Mr Berlusconi.</p>

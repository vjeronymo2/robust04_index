			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Wham] A culture clash: George Michael's court fight with Sony London High Court proceedings on competition law and restraint of trade do not usually attract crowds of teenage girls. They are likely to turn up on Monday, however, when hearings begin in the case of Georgios Panayiotou v Sony Music Entertainment. Mr Panayiotou is better known to his fans as singer George Michael. He is asking the court to declare his contract with Sony void and unenforceable because it represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and is contrary to the Treaty of Rome's competition provisions. If George Michael wins, he will turn the international music industry upside down. Entertainment industry lawyers say many other disaffected performers will demand the renegotiation of their contracts. Record companies say the cost of producing music could escalate. Whichever way the case goes, it could cast doubt on the ability of Japanese electronics companies such as Sony to manage the creative talent in the western music and film businesses they have bought in the past few years. George Michael says his problems began when Sony bought CBS Records in 1988. Before then, he says his years with CBS were creative and productive. When Sony took over, the atmosphere changed. He adds: 'I have seen the great American company that I proudly signed to as a teenager become a small part of the production line for a giant electronics corporation, which, frankly, has no understanding of the creative process. 'With CBS, I felt I was believed in as a long-term artist, whereas Sony appears to see artists as little more than software. Musicians do not come in regimented shapes and sizes but are individuals who change and evolve together with their audiences. Sony obviously views this as a great inconvenience.' George Michael alleges his contract with Sony is unfairly loaded against him. The writ he has issued says Sony is entitled to receive eight albums from him. He has so far delivered two: Faith, and Listen Without Prejudice, Volume I. Given the time taken to record albums, the contract will probably last until 2003. During that period, he is not entitled to record for any other company. Sony is entitled to ownership and copyright of George Michael's recordings. He, however, has to bear the cost of making them. Sony has undertaken in the contract to release between three and four singles from each album George Michael delivers in the US and the UK. Sony does not have to release singles in any other country. The company is under no obligation to release any of George Michael's full albums in any country. He can, however, under certain circumstances bring the contract to an end if Sony does not release one of his albums in the UK. In some other countries, he has the right to ask the company to find a licensee to release albums, but the writ alleges this would be difficult to do. Sony retains copyright over George Michael's recordings even if it does not release them, the writ says. The writ says that Sony's right to reject albums 'could result in a total sterilisation of the artist's recorded output for a very lengthy period of time, or even for the remainder of his professional career.' The writ alleges the level of royalties paid to George Michael is inequitable. It says the singer has not been able to quantify this exactly, but his lawyers estimate that he received an average 57p an album for his first two releases, while Sony received Pounds 1.83. George Michael also alleges that Sony distributed about 9 per cent of his first two albums free to UK wholesalers and retailers in lieu of price discounts. This meant he received no royalties on these albums. Sony declined to comment on the case. A music industry lawyer who has negotiated contracts for recording companies says there is nothing unusual about George Michael's contract. If anything, he says, it is more generous than most, particularly in its royalty provisions. It is true, he says, that young artists, desperate to have their songs recorded, sometimes conclude unfavourable contracts. 'When an artist starts out, he will pay a record company to take him on,' he says. He adds, however, that, while George Michael signed his original contract when he was a relatively unknown member of the duo Wham, he has been able to renegotiate it several times since he became successful. Mr Martin Mills, managing director of music company Beggar's Banquet, says that the industry will be less inclined to take a chance on young talent if Sony loses and contracts become more strongly weighted in musicians' favour. Money made from more successful acts is currently used to subsidise untried performers, he says. If George Michael wins, he says, 'it would mean artists would have to mortgage their houses to pay for their first recording, instead of the company investing in them'. Nevertheless, artists have in the past persuaded the courts to declare their contracts void. In one case, the Court of Appeal in 1989 allowed Holly Johnson, lead singer of the group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, to escape his contract with a recording company called Zang Tumb Tuum. The court said the contract, lasting eight or nine years, was 'grossly one-sided'. It was unfair, the court held, for the company to own the copyright to the group's songs while still retaining absolute discretion over whether albums were released or not. The court rejected the company's argument that the contract was necessary to enable it to invest in groups which might not turn out to be successful. Some record industry executives believe Sony has nothing to gain from fighting the case. Even if the company wins, they say, it can hardly force George Michael to record albums if he does not want to. One senior executive said Sony had clearly mishandled its relationship with the performer. He added: 'A lot of this business is built on personal relationships. You have to understand that artists are sensitive people who can easily feel rejected, particularly if they are going through a creatively difficult time.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- At the closing meeting of  the national conference of customs directors today, Li Lanqing,  State Council vice premier and member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, said: Customs offices nationwide  must abide by and support the general situation of "seizing  opportunities, deepening reforms, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability" to further deepen reform  in customs operations, as well as to better serve the cause of  establishing the socialist market economic system and efforts to  maintain the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy.    Li Lanqing pointed out: Customs operations are an important  part of the country's macroeconomic regulation and control. A  reform of the customs system must be implemented simultaneously  with a reform of the country's overall economic structure to  gradually establish a modern customs system with Chinese  characteristics that is compatible with the socialist market  economic system, that is supportive of China's opening up, that  conforms to general international rules, and that is organically  unified in terms of convenience and discipline, as well as in  terms of restrictions and efficiency.    He said: In reforming the customs system, we should pay  attention to the force that we apply, and we should consider the  ability of all to withstand this force. We must stop unhealthy  practices and must promote integrity through reform; we must  control what needs to be controlled and must assign tasks that  need to be assigned. To achieve these two tasks, we must  implement the auditing system as well as reform the customs  declaration system and the system and style of customs  management. Meanwhile, we must combine customs reform with the  application of modern technological means to establish a modern  and highly efficient customs system.    Li Lanqing stressed: Customs officials' principal duty is to  monitor and control import and export activities in accordance  with the law, as well as to ensure the efficient implementation  of state policies and laws concerning foreign economic  activities and trade. Customs offices must strengthen their  control over imports and exports, as well as strictly check and  penalize illegal activities such as certification evasion, tax  evasion, and tax cover-ups to safeguard the proper economic  order.    Li Lanqing said: Under the direct leadership of the party  Central Committee and the State Council, we have made progress  in the current antismuggling struggle, but we must not relax it  one bit. We must fully realize that the antismuggling struggle  is a long-term and arduous task, and we must continue to  strictly crack down on illegal smuggling activities. Customs  offices must further bring into play their principal  antismuggling departments, gather the support of local  governments and their antismuggling leading groups, strengthen  their cooperation with the relevant judicial and law-enforcement  organs, exploit the role of the relevant press and propaganda  departments, and spur the broad masses to do a good job in the  comprehensive control of smuggling activities. Customs offices  must resolutely implement the principle of "making arrests at  sea, catching people in ports, investigating at customs  checkpoints, exercising control of the market, and imposing  heavy penalties" while undertaking antismuggling tasks. In  particular, they must insist on imposing strict penalties and  speed up investigations of major cases, and they must not  replace punishment with fines. Customs offices must  simultaneously undertake antismuggling and anticorruption tasks  to ensure the healthy development of the country's economic  construction.    He asked customs offices to impose strict self-discipline,  realistically strengthen their development, and systematically  control their operations. Customs offices must establish clean  administration and undertake reform measures to ensure the  proper use of power and to prevent corruption from spreading.  He said he hoped that in the new year, customs offices  nationwide would continue to uphold the principle whereby tasks  are focused on promotion and on strict controls to effectively  safeguard the country's economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 7 [no month as received] (PL) -- Cuban  Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina today described his  official visit to Uruguay as very positive. One of the trip's  main objectives was to renegotiate Cuba's $33-million debt with  Uruguay.    Robaina believes that his contacts with the highest-ranking  government and banking authorities, entrepreneurs, and  businessmen, was a first step toward the solution of this  problem.    To this end Robaina explained his government's policies  regarding the opening to foreign capital as one more alternative  in facing Cuba's current economic difficulties.    The main idea behind this decision is to attract capital,  technologies, and markets in certain branches such as tourism,  oil, nickel, communications, science, and others, according to  his explanation in interviews.    During the next few months entrepreneurs and businessmen  will  travel to Havana, invited by Robaina, to explore investment  possibilities.    The other purpose behind Robaina's stay in Montevideo is to  explain Cuba's situation, especially following the end of the  socialist bloc and a stepped-up U.S.-imposed economic, trade,  and financial blockade, which has been in force for more than  three decades.    Regarding this, Robaina referred to the efforts of Cubans to  face the adversities and find solutions through the common  resolve to increase production and exports.    The local media highlighted the visit of the head of Cuban  diplomacy with a balance that could be considered favorable to  Cuba's interests, according to observers.    Tomorrow, Foreign Minister Robaina and his retinue will make  a technical stopover in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where they will  spend all day. Television, radio, and newspaper reporters will  take advantage of this to obtain exclusive interviews, which are  already planned, according to Cuban delegation sources.    By dawn on Saturday, Robaina will begin his official visit  to  Peru, the second stage of his South American tour, which will be  followed by visits to Argentina and Paraguay.</p>

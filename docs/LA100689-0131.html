			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEER GROUP TO BUILD LOW-COST HOUSING IN O.C.  </P> <P> Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit home-building group whose most famous  members are former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn, will announce  plans today for a 48-unit "self-help condominium neighborhood" in Rancho Santa  Margarita.  </P> <P> The two-acre development, designed for lower-income households, would be the  largest undertaken by Habitat for Humanity in the nondenominational Christian  volunteer organization's 13 years of building affordable housing.  </P> <P> Typically, Habitat for Humanity builds housing units with volunteer labor and  donations from private industry and sells the finished product at cost, often  making the mortgage loan itself.  </P> <P> The project is being proposed in partnership with the Fieldstone Co., a Newport  Beach-based residential builder, and the Santa Margarita Co., developer of the  Rancho Santa Margarita planned community.  </P> <P> Officials of Habitat for Humanity, based in Americus, Ga., and the Santa  Margarita Co. would not comment on the project in advance of this morning's  press conference, and Fieldstone's president, Peter Ochs, was in Atlanta and  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> But a statement issued by representatives of the groups said: "The development  is the most ambitious of its kind in the United States. The construction of  these homes will provide a solution to one of Orange County's most pressing  issues: the need for adequate housing for low-income households."  </P> <P> In Orange County, where housing prices are among the highest in the nation, the  median price of a resale home in August was almost $248,000 and the median  price of new homes is well over $325,000. The California Assn. of Realtors  estimates that only 14% of local families can afford to buy the median-priced  used home in Orange County.  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Margarita, although the newest planned community in the county  with several thousand acres still left to develop, is designed in large part  for first-time home buyers. Many of the new condominium units being built there  sell for prices well below $200,000.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes Rancho Santa  Margarita, said he was first approached about four months ago by officials of  the three organizations and asked to help shepherd the project through the  county bureaucracy.  </P> <P> "This is a unique project," Vasquez said. "It provides a tremendous opportunity  for home ownership for people who cannot otherwise afford to purchase a housing  unit in Orange County." Vasquez called the partnership of a builder, a land  developer and a charitable housing organization "innovative and exciting. This  is a great opportunity," he said, "and I hope it will be the first of several  projects like this in the county."  </P> <P> The proposed condominiums, if approved by the county, would be located on a  two-acre tract within a larger project being built by Fieldstone in the  northeast section of Rancho Santa Margarita. The exact location could not be  determined Thursday.  </P> <P> Orange County Planning Director Michael Ruane said that a preliminary tract map  and site plan for the Habitat community have been approved.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Break in Fees Sought  </P> <P> He said Habitat for Humanity officials currently are negotiating with the  county for reduction of the costly "infrastructure fees" which could easily  total $10,000 per unit. Those fees are levied by the county to help pay for  parks, roads, sewers, police and fire protection and other intangible "support"  items, Ruane said.  </P> <P> Also being negotiated is waiver of the plan processing fees generally charged  developers. On a 48-unit project those fees could hit $10,000.  </P> <P> Ruane said that the county Planning Department would assign the project "top  priority" once final plans are submitted. "We should be able to get things  processed and to the (county) Planning Commission in 30 to 60 days from the  time we get the final plans," Ruane said.  </P> <P> Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by Millard Fuller, an Alabama native  who made a fortune in the mail order business and then poured it all into the  organization when he decided to dedicate his life to helping the poor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Capital, Not Charity'  </P> <P> Fuller has said that the group's guiding philosophy is that "the poor need  capital, not charity." Potential buyers usually are chosen based on need,  willingness to help build the houses and ability to repay the mortgage loans  Habitat for Humanity makes.  </P> <P> In 1988, the organization's volunteers built 2,000 homes and the organization  said its goal for 1989 is 4,000 units. Habitat for Humanity operates in nearly  300 cities in the United States, Canada and 25 Third World countries.  </P> <P> Former President Carter -- an accomplished carpenter and woodworker -- first  became involved with Habitat for Humanity in 1984 and has said that the  organization is one of the few volunteer efforts to which he gives a large  amount of his time.  </P> <P> He has served as a member of the group's board of directors and on several  occasions has helped generate publicity for the organization simply by showing  up, hammer in hand, to help on a project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suggested by Ochs  </P> <P> One knowledgeable source said the Rancho Santa Margarita project was suggested  by Peter Ochs, founder and president of Fieldstone and a former top executive  of William Lyon Co.  </P> <P> He approached Habitat for Humanity and the Santa Margarita Co. about the  project more than four months ago as part of the county Building Industry  Assn.'s homeless project -- which calls for builders to engage in some type of  housing program in each of the five county supervisorial districts, sources  said.  </P> <P> Ochs and Anthony Moiso, president of the Santa Margarita Co., both have strong  business and charitable backgrounds.  </P> <P> Ochs, 45, holds an economics degree from Princeton University and an MBA from  Stanford. He was president of the William Lyon Co. in 1981 when he decided that  he wanted to run his own company and founded Fieldstone. He is an avid art  collector, specializing in early California Impressionist works, and is a  longtime supporter of the South Coast Repertory theater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started With Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Moiso, 49, is a member of the O'Neill family, which owns the 40,000-acre Rancho  Mission Viejo. He cut his development teeth on the planned community of Mission  Viejo -- which later was sold to the Philip Morris Cos. and now is an  independent city. He spent more than 10 years planning development of the  5,000-acre Rancho Santa Margarita community in which the Habitat project is to  be located.  </P> <P> Among his charitable and philanthropic activities, Moiso has supported various  arts programs and youth groups. Several years ago he donated 40 acres of his  family's land as a site for the $26-million Santa Margarita Catholic High  School -- the first Catholic high school built in Orange County in 22 years.  </P></p>

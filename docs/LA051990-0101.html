			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> Ambassador College in Pasadena held its 40th and final graduation ceremony  Friday, awarding 286 students with bachelor of arts and associate's degrees.  Joseph W. Tkach, who heads the parent Worldwide Church of God, gave the  commencement address.  </P> <P> The denomination and its cultural arm, the Ambassador Foundation, will remain  at the site along the Rose Parade route, but the faculty and many of the  remaining students will switch to the college's Big Sandy, Tex., campus in the  fall.  </P> <P> Tkach, who has led the church and college since the 1986 death of  founder-President Herbert W. Armstrong, announced last December that the  campuses would be merged because of the anticipated expense of seeking  educational accreditation for the schools in two states.  </P> <P> Church officials originally said that extension courses might be offered at the  Pasadena campus in the next school year, but a spokesman said this week that  the plan was dropped.  </P> <P> After Aug. 1, various departments and support services of the Worldwide Church  of God and Ambassador Foundation, which have occupied only 7 acres of the  40-acre complex, will begin moving into the vacated college facilities.  </P> <P> The church, regarded by mainstream Christianity as sectarian in many beliefs  and relatively authoritarian in style, has 95,000 members in 120 countries. It  is best known publicly for its Plain Truth magazine, its syndicated television  program, "The World Tomorrow," and its concert series at Ambassador Auditorium  in Pasadena.  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Lou Holtz, who coached the University of Notre Dame football team to an Orange  Bowl victory and the top college ranking last season, will be the featured  speaker at the 17th annual Los Angeles Mayor's Prayer Breakfast on June 9, it  was announced this week. Breakfast Chairman Keith Phillips, who heads World  Impact ministries, said entertainer Pat Boone will emcee the event and Mayor  Tom Bradley will also speak. Other participants include Van Nuys Pastor Jack  Hayford of the Church on the Way and Trinity Broadcasting Network owners Paul  and Jan Crouch. Tickets are $17 each.  </P> <P> GRANTS  </P> <P> Franciscan Communications has been awarded $12,750 by the U.S. Catholic  bishops' communications campaign to help fund the production of AIDS-awareness  television spots in English and Spanish. The media center in downtown Los  Angeles also received the identical amount for six short videos designed to  help abused or afflicted children deal with their situations. Other grants to  Southland groups were $57,000 to the Catholic-oriented Heart of the Nation  program in Burbank to produce a half-hour music video program, and $17,850 to  Paulist Communications in Los Angeles for Spanish radio public service spots on  evangelistic concerns, human rights and other themes.  </P> <P> CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Bishop Emeritus Nelson Trout, who presided over the Los Angeles district of the  old American Lutheran Church, will speak at 10 a.m. today at the annual meeting  of the Pacifica Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The  sessions, which began Friday night and end Sunday, are being held at the Red  Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. The synod, or district, headed by Bishop Robert L.  Miller, embraces 128 congregations in Orange, San Diego, San Bernardino,  Riverside and Imperial counties and in Hawaii. JOHN DART  </P></p>

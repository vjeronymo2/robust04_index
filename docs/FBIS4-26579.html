			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Since the early 1980s,  the Ministry of Communications has used loans of about 2.5  billion U.S. dollars from the World Bank and the Asian  Development Bank, as well as 290 billion Japanese yen from the  Japanese Government, to construct communications infrastructures.    Huang Zhendong, minister of communications, said in a press  conference today that China has used foreign capital to  construct a host of docks in the ports of Shanghai, Tianjin,  Guangzhou, Qinhuangdao, Rizhao, Lianyungang and Qingdao,  increasing the handling capacity by 43 million tons.    Twenty-three provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities  have used or are going to use loans from international financial  institutions or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of  highways.    Besides, direct investment in highway or port  infrastructures  by foreign business people has also advanced considerably, he  said.    As for opening to the outside world, Huang said, by the end  of 1993 China's water transport ports open to foreign vessels  had grown to 107 in number, and 35 highway transport ports are  now open to foreign vehicles from neighboring countries.    In addition, China has signed maritime agreements with 43  countries and signed governmental road transport agreements with  eight countries; 577 joint ventures in highway transportation  and water transport businesses and vehicle services have been  approved, of which 415 are in the road transport sector, 66 in  automobile services, and 96 in water transportation.    Huang said that his ministry will take advantage of all  favorable opportunities and provide a list of infrastructure  projects with high economic returns to attract foreign capital,  adhering to state industrial development policies to solve the  problem of inadequate investment.    He said that there are good prospects for the communications  sector's use of foreign funds. Guangdong province alone has  signed letters of intent on the use of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars  in foreign funds.</p>

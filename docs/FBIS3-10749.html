			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Rafael Caldera at ceremony to sign </F> emergency banking law in Caracas -- live]    [Text] Mr. President of Congress; Mr. President of the  Chamber of Deputies; Messrs. Senators, Deputies, Ministers, and  representatives of public power; and civilian society:    I will just say a few words to state that we have decided to  promulgate without delay the emergency law that Congress has  issued so that the special measures contained in the law can be  adopted immediately and the situation of Banco Latino and the  financial system in general can be addressed.    I think that in this case, we have had the first experience  of what we call the commitment to solidarity. All the public  power institutions have contributed to the effort to face this  delicate, difficult, and complex situation. The private sector  has also expressed, in different ways, its willingness to  cooperate so that solutions can be undertaken to the  satisfaction of a large number of Venezuelans and foreign  residents in the country who have seen their economic situation  gravely jeopardized by the events that have taken place.    After promulgating the emergency law, the national  government  plans to immediately present to the legislative chambers a bill  with a brief partial reform of the published document because it  considers that some of the approved provisions, due to the  justified brevity of time because of the praiseworthy urgency  with which Congress worked on the law...[pauses] perhaps there  was not sufficient thought about the consequences that some of  the norms might have and which, far from helping, might hinder  the objective of achieving the reorganization of the Venezuelan  financial system, which is an objective that concerns all of us.  The law that I just signed has this double objective: on the  one hand to address the emergency situation, the special  situation created by the Banco Latino crisis, and on the other  to give the branches of government the definite possibility of  favorably resolving the aspects that might create fear among the  Venezuelan community and the difficulties for the operation of  the financial system.    I am sure that the same climate of dialogue and cooperation  among the branches of government, which has prevailed in the  passage of this law, will also be present when the government  proposals regarding this are received.    I think today's action brings hope to those who have watched  their personal situation with anguish due to the Banco Latino  crisis, which I have not hesitated to describe as a real  disaster and whose dimension has exceeded everything that was  initially thought when the government of President Ramon  Velasquez decreed the intervention of that bank.    I thank those present here, especially the members of the  legislative chambers and the members of the committees that have  been involved in this issue. I thank them on behalf of  Venezuelans because they have maintained an open-minded,  understanding, and constructive position that undoubtedly leads  us to have strong hope about the future of the country and which  views with undeniable and appropriate concern the situation of  the economy and the National Treasury.    Again, thank you, and I hope the Venezuelan people, who have  been shaken by the recent events of Banco Latino will feel more  secure and have more hope about the efforts that the public and  private sectors are making to guarantee everyone their  legitimate rights and to share the necessary sacrifice to  resolve the situation.

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (10): Dynamic engine with a military rhythm - Singapore Technologies AT THE heart of Singapore's intensely competitive, market-orientated economy is a group of state companies, accounting for an estimated 25 per cent of gdp. They, along with the multinational corporations, have formed the engine of Singapore's economic growth over the years. Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp. (STIC) is part of the Singapore Technologies conglomerate, the largest industrial and high technology group in the country with a total workforce of more than 12,000 and annual sales of Dollars 1bn. The Singapore Technologies group started life in the mid 1960s as the industrial arm of Singapore's armed forces. One company in the group, Chartered Industries, has developed considerable expertise in a wide range of armaments and, according to a Singapore newspaper report last year, is now one of the world's top 10 military small-arms companies. The group has diversified into many other areas. Following a company reorganisation in the late 1980s, STIC was formed to oversee the group's commercial activities in the electronics, precision engineering and industrial services sectors. Last year STIC had a turnover of SDollars 730m. 'Start with the idea that Singapore is like a company - that's the way it works,' says Mr K. S. Wong, STIC's president. Mr Wong says STIC is not like public companies in other countries. 'We have no subsidies. We have to borrow from the market. We have to take part in tender processes and compete with private sector companies.' STIC's activities are very varied. It owns the largest computer software house in southeast Asia and provides computer recovery services to a number of companies, including Singapore Airlines. It provides communications links on Singapore's mass rapid transport system (MRT), runs car parks, builds flight simulators, supplies the Singapore army with cooked food, runs a vehicle leasing company, owns one of the country's biggest travel companies and two retail stores. It also operates Singapore's mint and mints coins for Burma and Brunei. Now the emphasis is on expanding activities overseas. Industrial park development has been the main focus of attention. STIC helped in the formation of the first industrial park in Thailand a few years ago. In partnership with another state company - Jurong Environmental Engineering  -and the Indonesian Salim Group, STIC is building and operating a 500 hectare industrial park on the Indonesian island of Batam, about 20km south of Singapore. Batam will eventually employ 20,000 workers, mainly in the electronics industry. Already several multinational companies have set up operations on the island. 'We provide everything for the (multinationals) from beginning to end,' says Mr Wong. 'We organise work permits, build their factories, lay on water and electricity, build sewerage systems, provide their housing. All they have to do is get on with their business.' The Batam concept is now being transferred to China on a much larger scale. With the same partners STIC is building a 5,000 hectare industrial park in Fujian province. A similar project is being investigated in southern India. Other international opportunities are being explored. STIC now has offices in Munich, New York and Tokyo. As well as industrial parks STIC is involved in specialised electronics and precision engineering projects overseas. STIC has recently entered into an agreement to supply stitcher/binder modules for Xerox photocopiers. Mr Wong says there are many other possibilities for STIC overseas, particularly if partnerships are formed with multinationals. 'If you are a multinational in Europe or elsewhere, involved in technology and want to come to Asia then we suggest you look at us as a possible partner. STIC has an established network in the regional market. We also have all important guanxi (connections) in China. Perhaps most importantly we are willing to put our money up front. Forming such partnerships is part of our philosophy and the way to grow internationally in the future.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Candidate of Technical Sciences Anatoliy </F> Kovalevskyy: ``Is the Explosion of the `Sarcophagus'  Inevitable?'']    [Text] I will start by reiterating commonly known facts.  The Chernobyl catastrophe was preceded by a similar accident in  Chelyabinsk Oblast Kyshtym where the Soviet atomic bomb was  being constructed. Radioactive waste was dumped in a lake near  the town, and that caused an explosion.    Has anybody ever analyzed why this happened?    I spent many years working at the Ukrainian Academy of  Sciences Institute of Electrodynamics and I am an expert in the  field of thermodiffusion.    The fourth block ``sarcophagus'' consists of nuclear fuel  residue covered with a thick layer of concrete. All in all,  about 1,000 tonnes of uranium and plutonium are stored at the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant [AES], including fuel for  operating reactors and radioactive waste. Without going into  detail, I want to say that on 30 December 1992, I came to the  conclusion that a terrible thermonuclear explosion is inevitable  at the fourth block. The explosion will totally destroy Ukraine  and a larger part of Europe.    I came to this conclusion after analyzing thermodiffusion  processes recently discovered by me and still unknown to the  public. The essence of the discovery is this: Plutonium that is  a component of the solid radioactive alloy of the fourth reactor  (both earlier produced and the new one created by the  disintegration of uranium), influenced by the heat emitted in  the course of the process, is moving very slowly to certain  points of the block and is accumulating at these points.    As a result of this diffusion process, the amount of  plutonium in one of these points may exceed the critical mass  and lead to a nuclear explosion. It is impossible to reverse  this process. I am assured that the explosion at the nuclear  dump near Chelyabinsk was caused by the same factors, although a  much smaller amount of uranium was involved.    I think that Japanese thermodiffusionists can confirm my  conclusions. These people are working on creating extra-large  integrated microchips, and are currently the most qualified  experts in the field of thermodiffusion in the world.    I did not calculate the possible date of a new explosion at  Chernobyl AES. However, I want to emphasize once again that an  explosion is inevitable. There is no chance to avoid a  catastrophe.    However, I believe that a solution can be found if we do not  waste time. No new ``sarcophagus'' should be constructed. The  ``green meadow'' version must be urgently implemented at the  AES. This is the only way to avoid a disaster. I have drafted  a number of technical measures regarding this version.    Unfortunately, my appeals to high officials in Ukraine  brought only a partial result -- the version was accepted but it  will be carried out within a five year period. The process for  plutonium to exceed the critical mass will hardly wait that long.    I have turned to the press to attract public attention to  this issue and demand its expeditious resolution. Time will not  wait!</p>

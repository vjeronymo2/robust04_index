By 27 December, the China Petroleum and Natural Gas  Corporation had fully met its state plan for the output of oil  and natural gas, and the total annual output of crude oil was  139.2 million tons, 1.037 million tons above last year's figure,  and the natural gas output was 15.4 billion cubic meters, up 290  million cubic meters from last year. The China Offshore  Petroleum Corporation produced 4.60 million tons of crude oil,  up 0.73 million tons from last year. This outstanding  accomplishment enabled China to maintain its rising position  among the world's main petroleum producers.    Beginning this year, the continental oil fields brought  about  a favorable situation in which east and west are keeping pace  with each other. The eastern region, as represented by the  Daqing oil field, vigorously implemented the "stable oil output  and control of water consumption" system engineering project and  posted an annual output of 55.90 million tons of crude oil, up  0.244 million tons from last year. In the west, all oil fields  strove to create favorable conditions, increasing their crude  oil output by 1.739 million tons compared with last year.  Offshore oil and gas exploration and production also set records.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MONEY MANAGER STILL PICKING UP THE POST-CRASH PIECES  </P> <P> The stock market crash in October, 1987, was a nightmare for many investors.  Unfortunately for David H. Menashe, an investor, money manager and publisher of  an investment newsletter, the fright isn't quite over yet.  </P> <P> During the crash, he watched $100,000 of his wealth evaporate. He also lost  $60,000 of the $300,000 that three clients gave him to invest shortly before  the crash. And although the market has regained all of the ground that it lost  in the crash, many small investors still have the jitters, and that isn't good  news for somebody like Menashe.  </P> <P> His personal money-management business, Menashe said, is flat. "I haven't had  any new clients since last year."  </P> <P> And since the crash, more than half of the 1,200 people who had been buying his  newsletter, Fund-line, have dropped their subscriptions. The annual  subscription before the crash cost $97 and is now $127, so Menashe has lost  about $67,000 a year in newsletter sales.  </P> <P> Being tied to the market guarantees ups and downs for a small business like  Menashe's, where he's the only employee. What does he do now? Be calm, wait  until investors feel better about the market, then advertise heavily and hope  new clients come knocking.  </P> <P> Menashe has been offering market tips for 20 years and claims to have made  enough correct calls to have carved out a rather wealthy living -- even if he  is not a household name who's regularly quoted in the financial press.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Desperate Yet  </P> <P> Given his net worth, which he says is well into six figures, and given his age,  67, Menashe isn't desperate to sign up new customers.  </P> <P> "When I feel confident that the confidence is out there again, then I'll  promote again. I'll do some advertising, some direct mail," he said.  </P> <P> Menashe, who raised chickens before he got into the stock-picking business,  manages about $3 million in other people's money for investment mostly in  mutual funds, and he collects a fee of 1.5% of his clients' assets at the end  of the year. His newsletter focuses only on trying to pick winners among stock  mutual funds, rather than individual stocks.  </P> <P> Why? When Menashe started his business in 1968, mutual funds were a hot item  with investors, who liked the idea of pooling their money to own a variety of  stocks. But mutual funds can drop like any investment, and Menashe said he  started the newsletter "with the idea that I would be smart enough to tell them  when to get out and to warn them of the pitfalls."  </P> <P> He contends that over the last 2 decades, an investor would have earned an  average 16% total return on an investment each year from following his advice.  "Which is not as good as I'd like," he said. "Some years I've gone 25%, 27%.  Other years I've done less."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Average Track Record  </P> <P> According to an impartial source, Menashe's forecasting track record appears  only about average in recent years. The Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria,  Va., which monitors the performance of newsletters' stock picks, said Menashe's  Fundline gained 29.3% from the start of 1986 until the end of 1988. That left  Fundline near the bottom among mutual-fund newsletters; 11 others did better,  and four did worse. Among all 77 stock newsletters tracked by Hulbert, Fundline  came in 31st.  </P> <P> In any case, Menashe's Fundline isn't the only investment newsletter whose  following has dwindled in recent months. Norman G. Fosback, an oft-quoted Fort  Lauderdale, Fla., publisher of several newsletters, including one on mutual  funds that has 175,000 subscribers, said "renewal rates for all mutual fund  newsletters are down."  </P> <P> "In our case, 65% used to renew, now it's about 40% or 50%," Fosback said. "The  bottom line is there is very little interest in funds right now."  </P> <P> Menashe, Fosback and other advisers often count on advertising to help bolster  circulation. Menashe has advertised in Barron's, Money and other financial  publications, and has used direct-mail ad campaigns. But advertising is costly  -- it can account for half of Menashe's total expenses -- and these days not  enough investors are responding to the ads to make the cost worthwhile.  </P> <P> Menashe said that a year ago he spent $5,000 to send ads directly to 20,000  people on a mailing list of current and past subscribers that he had collected  over 2 decades. "The return was very poor," he said. He picked up fewer than 20  subscribers.  </P> <P> In 1987, Menashe's gross income from the newsletter and his money-management  service was about $108,000. His costs that year were $12,800 for advertising,  $8,500 for printing, $5,600 for postage and $1,100 in telephone charges. His  pretax income was about $80,000.  </P> <P> Last year, however, he did not advertise because he feared that new  subscriptions would not cover the costs. Meanwhile, more subscribers dropped  Menashe's newsletter, leaving him with much less income in 1988, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chicken Business  </P> <P> Menashe was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., but that is as close as he ever got to Wall  Street. When he was 10, his parents moved the family to Burbank, where his  father started a chicken ranch. The younger Menashe, after flying several B-25  bombing missions in the Pacific during World War II, then started his own  chicken business, first in Sepulveda and then in Moorpark.  </P> <P> Although his chicken flock grew to 30,000 from 4,000, Menashe had some money in  the stock market and decided in 1959 to become an investment adviser. But after  4 years of "so-so success," he went back to chicken ranching for another 5  years.  </P> <P> By 1968, however, Menashe decided that the only way to make good money in  chickens was to raise hundreds of thousands of chickens -- a growth plan he was  unwilling to pursue. Menashe decided to give the stock market another try.  </P> <P> With about $20,000, he opened an office in Woodland Hills and started  publishing his newsletter. He later moved his office into his house. He based  his recommendations on the market's "technical" trends.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, technical analysts believe that the stock market moves in  repeating cycles and that money can be made if investors correctly buy or sell  at certain points within those cycles. Technical analysts pay little heed to  corporate profits or the economy's overall direction.  </P> <P> Menashe insisted that technical market trends "will show up before the  fundamental news will show up," so that "you know there's trouble up ahead."  </P> <P> Menashe's newsletter typically is eight pages; the first two are filled with  his advice, and the rest contain several technical charts and graphs, including  some devoted to individual mutual funds. On the back page, Menashe lists the  recent track record of 40 or so funds and tells readers which funds to buy,  sell, hold or ignore.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Best, Worst Calls  </P> <P> Menashe said his best call came in January, 1973, when he urged subscribers to  sell every mutual fund share they owned. Soon thereafter came the 1973-74 bear  market. His worst call was in September, 1987, a month before the crash, when  the market was dropping rather sharply from its record highs reached in August,  1987. Menashe counseled his subscribers that "yes, there has been a correction,  but no, it's not yet the beginning of a major bear market."  </P> <P> Menashe urged his readers to be fully invested in stock funds.  </P> <P> Today, Menashe has about half of his money in real estate partnerships and the  other half in -- no surprise -- stock mutual funds. He won't diversify into  bonds or gold. "That implies that you don't have confidence in what the  market's going to do," he said.  </P> <P> And just what is the market going to do? Menashe said he thinks that the market  will probably advance over the next few months. So far this year, the Dow Jones  average of 30 industrials is up 7.5%, but he warns that this year could be a  repeat of 1961, when stocks rose sharply for the first few months, then sagged  during the next 18 months.  </P> <P> "I'm generally confident, but I'm always looking out in case things change," he  said.  </P></p>

Even now many printed publications in  Azerbaijan come out very late, and some have ceased to exist  altogether. Editorial offices are in dire need of capital to buy  metallic plates which are essential in the printing process, the  price of paper rises every day, and many press organs are unable  to handle these problems on their own.    In S. Rustamkhanly's opinion, there is only one solution to  the situation which has developed--financial support of  publications, including independent ones, from the government.  He emphasized that slightly more than a million dollars a year  are needed to buy everything necessary. "The leadership of  Azerbaijan must be clearly aware that a normally operating  `fourth estate' is an enormous help in the cause of state  construction," S. Rustamkhanly stated in conclusion.</p>

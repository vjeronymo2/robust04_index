			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Observer: Wealthy women The editor of BusinessAge magazine ought to be invited to the next Buckingham Palace garden party. Amid mounting pressure from the mob for the Queen to pay taxes, his magazine has shown that far from being the wealthiest person in Britain, the Queen is worth a mere Pounds 100m. According to its list of the country's wealthiest females, the Queen is only the tenth richest and ranks well behind Christine Goulandris, a 44-year old heiress married to Tony O'Reilly. She has an estimated Pounds 280m to play with. As for Britain's richest widow, Lady Eleanor Glover who was married to the late Sir Douglas Glover, is deemed worth at least Pounds 200m.</p>

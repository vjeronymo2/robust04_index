			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Food: Luxurious penance - Fish for Lent / Recipes to convert faint hearts to fish NOW THAT the British are eating less red meat, surely fish should fill the gap? This is a good time to test that theory, for Lent is the traditional season to forego meat. I would not, however, risk serving a dish that is aggressively fishy to guests whose tastes I do not know. Fins, tail, scaly skin, gills, gaping mouth and lugubrious eyes gazing up from the plate can cause nervous diners to panic, and the presence of bones might make them choke. Bowdlerised versions - fish dishes using fillets, purees and flakes - are better for winning converts to the pleasures of fish; witness the general popularity of fish pie, fish cakes and kedgeree. The only trouble with this trio is that its their associations with the nursery are strong. For a dinner party, you might prefer recipes with a little more panache. The two that follow are simple, but luxurious enough to guarantee no hint of Lenten penance. SCALLOP QUENELLES (serves 8) Featherlight and creamy, these are the loveliest of all dumplings. Sauce Nantua is the classic accompaniment, and it works well using prawns if you cannot get hold of freshwater crayfish. Bearnaise sauce and beurre blanc are quicker to make and also excellent, particularly if a handful of shrimps is added just before serving. Take care to measure quenelle ingredients carefully: the ratio of seafood to cream and egg white is crucial. Quenelles traditionally are served fresh from poaching, which is best, but cooks who like to avoid last-minute work at the stove will be heartened to hear that they can be cooked ahead and re-heated gently. Ingredients. 1lb fresh scallops (this is the net weight needed after trimming away black intestinal threads and hard white muscles); 4 fl oz double cream; 4 egg whites; sprigs of fresh herbs (parsley, coriander, chervil, tarragon or dill) to garnish for serving. Method. Wash the scallops and dry well. Whizz them in a food processor with the cream to make a very smooth puree. Scrape the mixture into a shallow dish and season generously with salt and pepper. Using a fork, blend in the raw, unwhisked egg whites carefully, a little at a time. Then chill the mixture, uncovered, for a few hours. Choose a saute pan or other pan with a large surface area (great depth is unnecessary). Fill it with water, salt it and bring to a bare simmer. The liquid should barely tremble or the quenelles may disintegrate as they cook. Using a pair of dessertspoons, scoop and mould the quenelle mixture lightly into plump, meringue-shaped ovals; about two dozen in all. Drop them into the pan in batches, spacing them well apart, and poach gently. They will take five-six minutes and should be flipped over with a perforated spoon at half-time. Drain the quenelles on kitchen paper and lay them in a single layer in a shallow buttered dish. Keep warm while cooking the rest. Sauce them, garnish with little bouquets of herbs and serve quickly. Alternatively, if preparing ahead, let the quenelles cool in the buttered dish. When cold, cover them with a dome of foil and refrigerate until needed  -but remember to bring them back to room temperature before re-heating. To reheat, bake (still covered with foil) at 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) for 12-15 minutes - but no longer or the quenelles will lose their creamy lightness. Sauce, garnish and serve. THAI MANGO SALAD WITH SALMON (serves 6) This comes from Sri Owen's Exotic Feasts (Kyle Cathie, Pounds 16.99), a charming and user-friendly book of east-meets-west cuisine. Ingredients. For the mango salad: 2 medium-sized mangoes, peeled and cut into julienne strips;  1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 tablespoon lime or lemon juice; some mixed varieties of lettuce leaves; 12-14 coriander or mint leaves. For the fish: 6 salmon fillets weighing 3-4 oz each; 2 tablespoons peanut or olive oil; 1 onion, sliced finely; 2 garlic cloves, crushed; 1 large red chilli, seeded and chopped finely; 2-inch piece of lemon grass, outer leaves discarded, chopped finely; 2-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and chopped finely; 2-3 kaffir lime leaves, shredded finely (optional); 2 tablespoons fish sauce (nam pla) or light soy sauce; 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar. Method. Put the mango slices in a bowl and sprinkle with salt and lime or lemon juice. Use the mixed lettuce and coriander or mint leaves to line a serving dish. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry all the chopped and sliced ingredients, stirring all the time, for two minutes. Add the fish sauce (or soy), vinegar and 4 fl oz hot water and simmer for another two minutes. Then add the fish to the pan and let everything simmer for three to four minutes, turning over the fish pieces once. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. When the fish is cool, arrange the mango strips on top of the salad leaves and lay the fish on top of the mango. Then pour the cooking juices over the salad. Chill, but take the dish out of the fridge about 10 minutes before serving.</p>

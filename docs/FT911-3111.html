			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Arts: On Wenlock Edge - Purcell Room The poetry of Housman inspired a whole generation of song composers in this country, Vaughan Williams being only the most considerable of them. His cycle On Wenlock Edge is one of the important staging-posts in the evolution of English song and the prospect of a leading tenor taking it on always raises hopes. On Wednesday the singer was Arthur Davies, well-known to audiences at English National Opera and increasingly on the international stage. His is an operatic tenor, clear and open in the Welsh tradition. He would probably be happier singing this cycle with orchestra, as he is not an intimate song interpreter in the line of Partridge or Rolfe-Johnson; but a little poetry in his art would undoubtably shine through in the right performance. Unfortunately the accompaniment was far too heavy; whether through lack of rehearsal or a belief that they had a big operatic voice to support, the London Smetana Trio (with extra violin and viola) played several notches too loudly. That special feeling of a land eternal and tranquil, the heart of what On Wenlock Edge is all about, was almost wholly lacking. Almost, because it surfaced in the penultimate song, 'Bredon Hill'. At last the playing became quiet. We could hear the words for the first time and the sensitivity with which Davies charted the song's progress from lazy summertime love to the chill bereavement of winter gave an idea of the English song interpreter he might aspire to. There are few song cycles written for piano quintet accompaniment and it was enterprising of the performers to couple the Vaughan Williams with the first performance of Marjolijn Anstey's The Lost Summer: Dunkirk 1940, a cantata based on poems by Ted Harriott. This offers few opportunities for the singer to show an awareness either of drama or poetry. But Davies's versatile singing was a reminder of what a valuable tenor he has become to us.</p>

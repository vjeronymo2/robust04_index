			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economic reform brings golden dawn in Peru - The flood of foreign miners into South America's 'new Eldorado' To judge from the interest shown in last week's first ever gold symposium held in Lima, Peru is now seen as the continent's new Eldorado. More than 800 gold experts - geologists, metallurgists, traders, environmentalists and just plain miners - attended the three-day event. 'It's like Chile was 15 years ago,' said Mr Johan Smit of Newcrest's Peruvian subsidiary. 'There's a 'let's go' feeling which is tremendously exciting. It's the herd instinct, but in this case the herd is right.' Acting as chief magnet for foreign interest - and drawing gold prospectors to the north-central Andean department of Cajamarca - is the successful Minera Yanacocha operation, a joint venture between Newmont Mining of Denver, leading local group Buenaventura and France's BRGM. Yanacocha is a perfect advertisement for the opportunities on offer in Peru today. Its gold, in a low-grade disseminated deposit, was commercially unrecoverable until the development of leaching techniques over the past decade. Now, since coming on stream last August, the company has clawed back its Dollars 37m initial investment in just seven months. Carachugo, Yanacocha's first deposit, has mineable reserves in excess of 28m tonnes averaging 1.38 grams of gold per tonne. By November a second, nearby deposit known as Maqui Maqui will be producing its first dore bullion. Larger and richer even than Carachugo, Maqui Maqui promises 40m tonnes of ore at an average 1.91 grams a tonne. Unlike Carachugo, whose porous ore can be scooped up and dumped directly on to leach-pads, Maqui Maqui will be exploited as an open-cast mine. Trials indicate the leaching cycle will take 120 days with a 60 per cent recovery rate, compared with Carachugo's exceptional 35-day cycle, 80 per cent recovery. Development of Maqui Maqui is costing Newmont and partners Dollars 40m. With production costs around Dollars 150 a troy ounce and projected annual output of 180,000 ounces, Minera Yanacocha is on to another hugely profitable operation. Combined output from the two Yanacocha deposits should top 400,000 ounces next year. That alone will boost national gold production to close to 40 tonnes a year and catapult Peru up the Latin American gold league table, still well behind Brazil but vying for second place with Chile. Gold would then become Peru's second most important export after copper. Hard on the heels of Newmont in the current Peruvian gold rush is American Barrick, also Nevada-based. In the past six months, Barrick has established an aggressive presence, with 'between 40 and 60' geologists and minerals experts sizing up maybe a dozen Peruvian prospects. Barrick is already drilling at Cerro Corona in Cajamarca. The company is tight-lipped about its findings but industry rumours credit Cerro Corona with some 15m tonnes at 3 grams a tonne in an 'attractive, eminently leachable oxide cap' with huge sulphide deposits below. Initial investment is expected to be in the region of Dollars 20m. An equally enthusiastic newcomer to Peru is Canada's Cambior, which in March acquired the Cajamarca copper deposits of La Granja. Investing an initial Dollars 31m in the five-year exploration stage, Cambior expects to start drilling in June. Simultaneously, the Canadian company will begin development of a recently-acquired gold deposit in the remote eastern jungle department of Apurimac, the first foreign company to venture into a zone hitherto considered dangerous. Some 35 people are involved in Cambior's Peruvian operation and investment in exploration locally is 'double what we're spending in Chile this year', according to Mr Andre Gauthier, Cambior's regional manager. Yet another Canadian company, Placer Dome, has also gained a foothold in Peru. In January, it outbid Newmont to secure a gold deposit known as Jehuamarca-Canariaco in the northern department of Lambayeque. Initial studies are under way. All of this is good news for the long-suffering Peruvian mining community. Inward-looking, nationalistic and protectionist economic policies meant Peru had been shunned by international investors for a full 25 years. With the exception of the giant Asarco-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation and Japan's Mitsui - which has continued with a low-profile operation - mining development has been left to local companies. 'Four hundred mining concerns have closed down in the past 15 years and the rest are badly decapitalised,' said Mr Roque Benavides, president of the national mining society. 'There's been almost no new exploration. The deposits you see today were known in the 1960s.' Privatisation was an initial trigger for international investors. AngloAmerican/Mantos Blancos, Cyprus Minerals and China's Shougang Corporation, in addition to Placer Dome and Cambior, all acquired their stakes by bidding for formerly state-owned deposits at public auction. Other foreign investors are forming associations with Peruvian mine-owners, many of whom hold promising claims but cannot finance development. Still others are participating in the anticipated boom by acquiring shares - many leading Peruvian mining companies have large, liquid holdings available for purchase through the Lima stock exchange. But for many mining concerns like Newcrest and RTZ, Peru's attraction lies in its largely unexplored territory. Over the past year, Peru's mines ministry has seen twice as many claims lodged as in the previous four decades. 'In Peru, the nice surprises come from grass-roots exploration,' says Mr Smit. With increasingly attractive macro-economic conditions and a much improved security situation, it seems plenty of foreign investors agree.</p>

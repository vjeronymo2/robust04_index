			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- Five of the country's top  10 business groups said Thursday they have decided on their  three leading lines, but others still find the decision-making  hard.    The Daewoo Group named automaking, heavy industries and  service; Hanjin chose transportation, heavy industries and  construction; Ssangyong picked automaking, non-metal mineral and  energy; Kia opted for automaking, heavy industries and steel;  and Hanhwa selected energy, chemical and service.    Among groups ranked from 20 to 30, Keumho, Daelim, Dongah,  Hyonsung, Halla, Dongbu, Keukdong, Woosung, and Miwon have  announced their two choices.    Other conglomerates, who face a Jan. 18 deadline to name  their mainstay industrial fields, are said to be watching the  moves of their rivals before making any decisions.    The Hyundai Group is reportedly set on automaking and  electronics and is weighing chemical and heavy industries for  its third choice. Samsung has picked electronics and heavy  industries and is scrutinizing the chemical and service sectors.    Lucky-Goldstar is firm on electronics and chemicals, but is  picky over energy and service, while it is easier for Daewoo as  it became unnecessary to designate Daewoo electronics a mainstay  firm since it was named a blue chip company for stock  diversification.    Lotte is expected to choose construction over chemicals as  it  will be no match for Hyundai or Samsung if they name chemicals.    Sunkyong has decided on energy and chemicals and will choose  another from electronics and service, but it is most likely to  select the latter sector as its main subsidiary (SKC) can handle  electronics and chemicals.    Haitai is set on beverages and food and will select the  second field from electronics and service. The choice is said  to be hard as it depends much on service, but must grow an  electronics arm for the future.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon Head Lado </F> Markhvashvili by Dzhemal Kurkhuli: "I'd Like To See Garedzhians  Smiling Again, Or, About What's Bothering Us"; place and date  not given]    [Text] I met Lado Markhvashvili about 15 years ago.  At the time, the young man seemed to have taken on a hopeless  task: in prosperous, bustling Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon, a little  village called Udabno had been built. And Lado was elected the  village's first mayor. The village leaders and their  subordinates had to do a lot of heavy, day-and-night labor, but  they got a lot done. Now a couple of months ago, Sagaredzhoyskiy  Rayon elected its new head--Lado Markhvashvili. At such times we  journalists usually say, he's a seasoned worker. Often, the  particular individual does not deserve it, but in this case Lado  really is an excellent choice. His biography tells us that he  has served as a Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon official at various times,  and was chairman of the agroindustrial complex. Most important,  he is still the same hearty and industrious man he was when he  was elected mayor of the newly founded village. Things to do? As  the Great Ilia says, there's plenty to do; all it takes is a  sharp sickle.    "It will take major, unstinting toil to save Georgia.  Literally or figuratively, it will take a sharp sickle to save  us." These were the words Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon's head began our  talk with.    [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, since you mentioned sickles, just  how  much of a crop will you have to harvest?    [Markhvashvili] In late October we only had 1,200 hectares  of  fall crops sown. Then we got behind on cropping schedules. But  we got busy, and by now we have sown 7,200 hectares. We will be  harvesting spring crops on 1,700 hectares. It goes without  saying that we have a lot of work to do tending the crops in  spring; we'll have to figure out a way to get gasoline and  diesel fuel.    [Kurkhuli] Recently, the head of Udabno visited you and  asked  for help getting diesel fuel and other things. You gave it to  him readily. Don't you think you're still paying more attention  to "your" village and letting the others go?    [Markhvashvili] People are probably kidding you. In my own  hometown of Patardzeuli I always had an "oppositioner"--my  father. He was a machinery operator, and if I failed to give  their farm a ballbearing, he would give me such a hard time I  was afraid to go home. What do you think happens to me now, when  Potardzeuli and the whole rayon is in trouble, and everybody  knows me? But I do have to admit that a lot of people, many sons  of the land, put a lot of sweat into Udabno. I'm nobody special.  But I do truly believe that we did a good thing to build a  village in our forefathers' sacred place, and that was Udabno.  No matter what happens to us now, that foundation is going to  stay, or else what kind of patriots would we be? Probably that's  why I pay so much attention to Udabno, but as for the others  getting left out, Udabno is having as hard a time as the rest of  Georgia.    [Kurkhuli] Kakhetia is a land of bread and wine, and  Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon is the gateway to it. How are the  vineyards doing?    [Markhvashvili] Most of the vineyards have been privatized,  but the results have not been beneficial. Do you think most of  the Kakhetians don't care about vineyards anymore? God forbid,  but we haven't been able to take care of them... we haven't had  the fuel, chemicals, and sulfur. These are things we have to  take care of starting now. The sulfur has been brought in.  People are hungry, we cannot deny it. The situation is truly  deplorable and disastrous. An abundance of agricultural products  will help us. We must also point out that although we have  received agricultural credits, we can't survive with  high-interest loans.    [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon always had plenty of sheep  and cows. The Giorgitsminda Hog Complex had lots of animals, and  Patardzeuli had its poultry plant. Now, nothing seems to be left.    [Markhvashvili] That was a time of terrible mistakes and  shortsightedness for all of Georgia. Naturally, the trouble  spread to Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon too. The kolkhozes and farms  were dismantled, people stole the livestock. There used to be  over 5,000 cows in the rayon, now there are only 1,605. The  number of sheep and hogs has also gone down. Our aim is to do  everything we can to build up our livestock. Useful steps have  been taken in the poultry plants. We have to do what we can to  straighten things out, we have no other choice.    [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon also has highland  districts,  the villages of the Gombori and Kochbani. Our editors received a  critical letter from some anonymous readers demanding the  restoration of the Gombori and Kochbani farms. I know that  district, I'm personally acquainted with every person there. In  that letter, which I showed you, a lot of workers are being  blamed unfairly. I realized that when I went to those villages  yesterday and the day before. What interests me, however, is  whether the Gombori and Kochbani farms can be restored as the  anonymous letter writers want.    [Markhvashvili] How can we restore them to what they were?  That would be turning back the clock! We would have to take away  people's orchards and crop fields. It simply can't be done.  Those farms no longer have cattle or other livestock. It would  only be possible to create agricultural links to take care of  the workers' own farms. Another thing is that a lot of grain was  stolen from the Kochbani farm. The Procuracy is looking into it,  and it will all be clarified.    [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon used to be the biggest  industrial district in all of Kakhetia. In the past 10 or 12  years, not counting three or four disastrous years, the millions  generated by industrial goods greatly exceeded the millions  generated by the supposedly traditional agricultural sector.    [Markhvashvili] Yes, that was true, but what used to be is  now no more. We no longer have electrical power, or gas, and the  big industrial plants have shut down--the reenforced concrete  products plant, the tire repair plant, and the auto repair  plant. The rayon has also been hurt bad by the closing of the  wine bottling plant. The recent economic agreement between  Georgia and Russia has made us hopeful. These industrial  facilities will resume operation and our economy will probably  get back on its feet.    [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, you said that all this has to be  done. There is no other choice. Could you say a bit about what  you have managed to do? People are hurting.    [Markhvashvili] Not one emergency medical vehicle was  working, but we managed to provide one emergency vehicle with  gasoline, and we know that we can get help to someone in  trouble. The bus that connects the city of Sagaredzho with the  railroad station is operating again. We have focused all our  effort on providing people with bread. We have an emergency  there too. One thing that makes me feel a little better is that  in the highland districts, the villages of the Gombori, where  things were supposedly the worst, the situation is actually  better.    We have made up a list of people who are alone or sick and  we're doing what we can to help.    [Kurkhuli] In conclusion, what wish do you have?    [Markhvashvili] I'd like to see Garedzhians smiling again.</p>

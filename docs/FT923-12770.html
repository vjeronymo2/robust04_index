The 18-minute demonstration ended after an assurance that Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, would meet the group to discuss their grievances. The other MPs involved were: Mr John McAllion (Dundee East), Mrs Irene Adams (Paisley North), Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) and Mr Dennis Canavan (Falkirk W) - all members of the 'Scotland United' group which campaigns for devolution.

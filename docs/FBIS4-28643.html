			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- As tension mounts over  the nuclear dispute with North Korea, the government has decided  to strengthen the civil defense structure by checking and  revamping civil defense organizations and facilities.    Under the decision made at a Central Civil Defense Council  Meeting presided over by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok Monday, the  government will also increase civil defense-related educational  and public relations programs to focus public attention on  national security.    An emergency call-up exercise will be conducted Wednesday  and  Thursday to check the mobilization status of 6.6 million  reservists for civil defense.    Air-raid shelters, emergency water supply systems and  warning  systems will be tested and renovated, if need be, by the end of  the month in full preparation for any emergencies.    The air-raid drill on Wednesday will focus on evacuation to  shelters, vehicular traffic control, first aid for the injured  and emergency reconstruction of destroyed facilities.    The Ulchi defense exercise slated for late August will serve  as an overall test of the government's ability to manage a  crisis -- not only an emergency in the run-up to war but also a  flood, fire or other disaster.    The government should keep the public informed of every  security development to ensure that they do not fear for their  safety and willingly participate in civil defense drills, Prime  Minister Yi told the meeting.    Emergency preparations should be carried out in such a  manner  that neither will they cause the people excessive uneasiness nor  will they provide any reason for North Korea to make military  provocations, he stressed.    Attending the meeting were Economic Planning Minister Chong  Chae-sok, National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, Home  Minister Choe Hyong-u, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and  Emergency Planning Committee Chairman Chon Yong-taek, among  others.</p>

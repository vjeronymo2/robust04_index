			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Forecasters make mistakes by ignoring money supply Sir, I am sorry that Peter Norman ('Wise-eyed and legless', August 15) should have thought that I 'triggered an unseemly squabble' last year when I asked which member of the Treasury panel had produced the most accurate forecasts. Perhaps I am naive, but surely policymakers and others are interested in forecasts only if they are accurate, at least to some degree. The most serious forecasting error in recent years occurred in early 1988, when the Treasury and other prominent forecasting groups said the economy was about to slow down. This set the scene for large tax cuts in the March 1988 Budget and for inappropriately low interest rates through the spring and summer. The Treasury arrived at its forecast and policy judgments despite extraordinarily rapid growth in the quantity of money. In early 1989, the Treasury and semi-official forecasting groups exonerated themselves from the disaster in 1988 on the grounds they had all been wrong and so no one was to blame. In fact, it was not true that everyone had had the same equally wrong forecast. With my team at the broking firm where I worked, I produced a forecast which was largely right about 1988 and warned about the medium-term inflationary consequences of excessive monetary expansion. Since 1988, my forecasts have on average been better than those of the other members of the Treasury panel, although they have not been the most accurate of the six in every year and I would make no claims to 'accuracy' in some absolute sense. My better record is simply a matter of fact, since the numbers and commentary are all available. But I am not interested in 'forecasting prowess' for its own sake. Indeed, I would ditch the paraphernalia of econometric forecasting if my fellow panellists would accept my central point. This is that the behaviour of the money supply is fundamental to the determination of national income. Forecasting models without a role for the money supply are therefore likely to make serious mistakes, as they did in 1988 and also, much earlier, in the catastrophic Heath/Barber boom of 1972 and 1973. I apologise if I am repetitive with these themes, but - if I am right - there are vital implications for the conduct of economic policy. The key to good economic management is not to base decisions on computerised forecasting models, but to maintain a low and stable rate of monetary growth. Pace Mr Norman, the Treasury panel is a good forum for discussion. Happily, the Financial Times has more than one voice on the matter. In an article ('Monetarism reborn', January 13 1989), Martin Wolf criticised 'the present conspiracy of silence' about my forecasting performance in 1988 and commended its 'moral courage' in 'standing outside the consensus'.

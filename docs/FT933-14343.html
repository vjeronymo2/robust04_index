			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Walesa says no plan to run in poll PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday denied that he was intending to run in Poland's parliamentary election next September, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. He said he had suggested a new political grouping be formed in order to avoid anarchy and disorder. Poles 'no longer believed in political parties'. He was responding to Mr Adam Michnik, editor of Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, who attacked the 'new type of party made up of those merely interested in holding on to power'.</p>

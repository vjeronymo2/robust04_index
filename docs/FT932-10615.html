			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (10): Waiting for a late bloomer - Profile / Domtar FEW big forest products firms have been mauled more severely by the three-year recession than Domtar. Hopes for higher prices for its communications, speciality fine papers, newsprint and groundwood (magazine) papers were kindled in vain in 1991 and again in 1992. The recession and oversupply quickly nipped recovery in the bud. Domtar, based in Montreal, maintained volume and its US market share in paper products, but had to continue a heavy investment programme to raise efficiency at its mills. Assets were sold or shuffled and manpower cut by several thousand as losses mounted. The crisis would have been worse without backing from the Quebec government for a restructuring. Domtar is 44 per cent-owned by two Quebec government agencies, including the Dollars 41bn Caisse de Depot, which invests public sector pension funds. But now Domtar sees light at the end of the tunnel, says Mr Pierre Desjardins, president and chief executive, a marketing expert who arrived with a new management team in 1990, hoping for a fast turnaround. The recession proved deeper and longer-lasting than he had expected. Paper and building materials prices sank to abysmal levels. Domtar faced run-in troubles at a new Dollars 1.2bn twin-machine uncoated freesheet mill at Sherbrooke, Quebec, a heavy floating rate debt burden as federal policy drove interest rates higher, and a Canadian dollar which rose to a peak of US89c late in 1991. Most of Domtar's pulp and paper products are sold in the US, and each one-cent move in the Canadian dollar has a Dollars 10m impact on annual operating results. Domtar is also North America's third biggest producer of gypsum wallboard, with several US plants. 'The Sherbrooke mill's problems are over and output is up from 325,000 to nearly 500,000 tonnes yearly with a narrower product range, machine speed-ups and technical improvements,' says Mr Desjardins. 'We've won full labour flexibility from the unions. Our communication and fine paper mills, plus the newsprint and groundwood units, accounting for half our total annual volume of nearly CDollars 2bn, are becoming fully competitive with the US, especially with the 9 per cent drop in the Canadian dollar in 1992.' With about Dollars 350m just raised in Canada and the US, Domtar can retire the maturing portion of its Dollars 1bn long-term debt and cover interest and capital outlays this year. 'Market pulp is always a late bloomer in a recovery, but we should see better prices this autumn and in 1994,' says Mr Desjardins. Wallboard prices went up 10 per cent in the spring with strong US housing starts, and construction timber has eased seasonally after an early 1992 run-up. Packaging products are firm in Canada, where Domtar is a dominant player. Several analysts see Domtar in the black in 1993 after three years of heavy losses, but Mr Desjardins puts the emphasis on recovery in 1994. Much depends on the pace of US recovery and the level of the US dollar. If it falls, that helps Domtar's offshore business. Domtar started off as a coal tar distiller 90 years ago, but under the control of the late Toronto financier EP Taylor and his Argus Corporation in the 1960s and 1970s its range was wide: from timber, pulp, newsprint, groundwood papers, fine papers, packaging, bricks and roofing materials, to plastics, metal powders and special chemicals, with plants in the US and Europe. It even diversified into oil and gas. In the 1980s Domtar bought five US wallboard plants in another diversification move. For several years its North American wallboard business turned in handsome profits. Building the Dollars 1.2bn Sherbrooke uncoated freesheet mill was the next big venture, but the recession began before Domtar could complete the run-in period. Profits peaked in 1987 and declined steeply in 1988 and 1989 as costs continued to rise and prices crumbled. Between 1990 and 1992 Domtar piled up losses of CDollars 600m, including restructuring charges. Domtar is entering the recovery with four sound communication and fine paper mills in Quebec and Eastern Ontario, with total capacity of well over 700,000 tonnes, plus converting and merchanting units. It has two upgraded newsprint and groundwood paper mills and a softwood kraft pulp mill in Quebec, that sends half its output to company paper mills with the rest sold outside. It has long experience in recycling and is ready for future US recycled-content rules for paper products, so protecting its major markets. It has developed its own process to recycle corrugated containers to make fine papers, and the first recycling unit is being installed at its Ontario fine paper mill. The second goes into the Sherbrooke mill for 1995 start-up. The two projects will cost CDollars 225m. Domtar's conglomerate days are over. Mr Desjardins wants to concentrate on developing the core communication papers and specialty fine paper businesses. The two newsprint and groundwood paper mills may be sold - possibly to Donohue, a low-cost newsprint producer. The wallboard division's future is uncertain, but linerboard and packaging can bring healthy returns. 'Timing was our great problem in the 1980s,' says Mr Desjardins, 'but now we've slimmed down and we're determined to rebuild our financial base with our most cost-competitive businesses. That's where our resources will go.'</p>

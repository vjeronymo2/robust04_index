			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Wilrig issues to finance rig purchases WILRIG, the Norwegian oil and gas drilling company, is to issue 4m American depositary shares and make a Dollars 100m offering of senior secured notes. The proceeds will be used to help finance the acquisition of new drilling rigs, repay debt and boost working capital. A Nasdaq listing will be sought for the 4.8m new shares, of which 2.8m would be offered in the US and 1.2m elsewhere outside Norway. The company expects to complete both the ADS and note offerings in November. Wilrig's planned sale of 2.45m new ordinary shares to the Paris-based Forasol-Foramer Group as part payment for the Dollars 41.5m acquisition of two drilling rigs is not included in the ADS offering. The company also has an option to buy a Drillmar I semi-submersible rig for Dollars 34m from Spanish interests.</p>

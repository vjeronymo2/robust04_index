			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Markus Schnurpfeil: "Mobile Radio Operates on </F> Equal Footing alongside Ground Networks"; "European Study  Concerning Future of Mobile Communication"]    [Text] VDI NACHRICHTEN, Bonn 8 Apr 94--In its most  recent study the Eutelis Consult consulting firm predicts that,  as the turn of the millennium approaches, it will be possible to  reach telephone subscribers at the same one number regardless of  whether their receivers are part of a ground or mobile network.  In this way will the various network systems be integrated, as  the authors of this study, Ulrich Kranz and Dr Gurnad Sodhi,  explain in an interview with VDI NACHRICHTEN.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Mr. Kranz and Mr. Sodhi, the  mobile radio study which your consulting firm has made on behalf  of the EU-Commission is concerned with scenarios of mobile  communication in Europe by the year 2010. In your analysis,  however, you surprisingly often refer to already now available  technologies. How does this jibe?    Kranz: With adoption of the European GSM Standard,  on which both German mobile radio networks D1 and D2 as well as  the new E-network are based, there has been initiated an  extremely dynamic development. This development has been sort of  the starting shot for the future of mobile communication, in  which GSM networks will certainly play a significant role. This  is because these networks offer not only a large subscriber  capacity. They also offer a whole lot of functional advantages  such as, for example, International Roaming and thus  communication across international borders.    Sodhi: A further example is DECT, an already now  available technology which seems to have have a quite  significant potential for future applications in mobile radio.  Fist of all, this Standard is the basis for development of  cordless telephones and cordless telecommunication facilities.  At the same time, DECT is also an excellent accessing technology  which facilitates, for instance, linking subscribers of local  networks via radio to other telecommunication networks. In other  words, with DECT in place, competition with the local network  (Local Loop) could begin sooner or later. This example  demonstrates clearly that in the foreseeable future the  significance of mobile radio will fundamentally change.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What will this change lead to?    Sodhi: Today when we speak of mobile radio, we  mean networks and attendant services which widely differ from  those provided by ground networks. As a D-network customer, I  can naturally reach a party connected to a conventional network.  With a telephone installed at home and another one at the  office, and also with a hook-up to a radio mobile system, I now  have have three telephone numbers and the caller does not know  at which one I can be reached at any given time. This will not  be so in the future, because I will have just one personal  telephone number...    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: ...at which you can be reached  regardless where you are located.    Kranz: Precisely. The various network  infrastructures will be integrated into a "Personal  Communication System" (PCS). The connection will be made by an  intelligent exchange apparatus which always knows the location  of the party called and will steer incoming calls over the  appropriate network to that party. As to the question about the  changing significance of mobile radio networks, they will  operate in a Personal Communication System on practically equal  footing with ground networks.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Who will be the providers of such  services?    Sodhi: In our opinion the service providers, being  already active in mobile radio operation, will play an essential  role in its expansion. They will put together packages of  telecommunication services tailored to the needs of customers in  diverse user categories. I repeat: the PCS will not be based on  one technology alone but rather will be a hybrid system  combining several technologies such as GSM 900, GSM 1800, DECT,  and the ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] ground  network.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And does this not also mean that  different customers may be receiving different services?    Sodhi: Certainly. Whoever wants to be reached only  at home or in a certain area thereof will receive a different  package of services than someone who requires telecommunication  services at the office and during international business trips.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What functions are taken over by  the queuing strategy with regard to setting up guideposts for  the PCS scenario you are describing?    Kranz: Certainly that of a central station,  because development of mass markets for Personal Communication  services can succeed only when the constraints have been  optimally defined.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And this means, for instance,...    Kranz: ...that viable competitiveness must be made  the overriding principle in the development of mobile radio and  telecommunication on the whole. This is why, for instance,  private network operators should be permitted to install their  own lines linking them to radio base stations for use of  exchange computers of mobile radio networks.    Sodhi: In order to assure an effective  competitiveness, it is also necessary that the relation between  network operator and service provider be already stipulated in  the licensing of mobile radio networks.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Assuming that the queuing  strategy constraints are correctly defined and the effects of  fair competition become fully realized, how many European users  will avail themselves of Personal Communication System services?    Kranz: We are starting on the premise that in such  a case there will be up to 80 million European PCS users by the  year 2010. Certainly, essentially instrumental in attracting  such a large number of subscribers will be a network operators'  and service providers' rate-setting strategy. In our opinion the  PCS will grow on the mass market when the prices for manual  mobile telephones and the monthly basic charges have fallen down  to 100-150 German marks [DM] and below DM15 respectively.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When the PCS is now based on  already available or soon to be introduced technologies, what  comes next?    Sodhi: Over the long range we will experience  developments in mobile radio comparable to those taking place in  ground networks, namely, integration of all services in one  universal network and flexible transmission over various  different frequency channels of this network, as the user may  require.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Thus a sort of ATM [Asynchronous  Transfer Mode] for mobile radio?    Sodhi: Yes, one could describe it as such.  Preliminary work is underway at the European Standardization  Institute (ETSI) on establishing a Standard for a Universal  Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). Meanwhile groups of  experts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are  doing similar work directed toward a Future Public Land Mobile  Telecommunication System (FPLMTS). These two developments have,  in principle, the common goal: a high-performance mobile  communication system with a very large subscriber capacity and  which in the long run will integrate all other mobile radio  services.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When, in your opinion, will such  a marvelous concept of mobile communication become reality?    Kranz: We are starting on the premise that a  technology based on the UMTS Standard will be introduced at the  turn of the millennium. Services with transmission speeds up to  2 Mb/s should be realized during the initial phase. Still higher  speeds will be attained later on.    VDI-NACHRICHTEN: A multimedia-capable mobile  communications system is what this is, then.    Sodhi: The UMTS will integrate not only all  services but also all forms of telecommunications. And this also  includes, of course, image communication.    [Boxed material]:    Pillars of Mobile Communication    At the present time the status of mobile communications is  determined by two standards: 1. Global System of Mobile  Communication (GSM) Standard, which covers digital mobile radio  in almost 60 countries including both German D1 and D2 networks;  2. Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT) Standard for  cordless telephones in Europe.    Study for the Green Book    The study concerning the future of mobile communication was  one of three mobile radio studies made by Eutelis Enterprise  Consultants in Ratinger in preparation of the planned "Mobile  Communication" Green Book for the European Union. In this Green  Book, the draft of which is now being discussed in Brussels and  the final version of which is to be ready this year, the  EU-Commission will have laid down its concepts of mobile  communication development in Europe and begun setting up the  necessary guide posts for a queuing strategy.</p>

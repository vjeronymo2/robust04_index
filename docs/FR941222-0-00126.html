If the new cap is larger than the existing cap, the new cap is applied. If the new cap is smaller than or equal to the existing cap, the existing cap is applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception to the calculation of the capped amount for certain married borrowers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The capped amount for married borrowers who repay jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is the same amount as calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section except that the amount is based on the combined Direct Loan debt of the borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other features of the income contingent repayment plan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative documentation of income.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a borrower's AGI is not available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower to calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repayment period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The maximum repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan is 25 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower makes payments under the standard repayment plan and under extended repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that is up to 12 years. The repayment period does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative repayment plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The repayment period also does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under an extended repayment plan in which payments are based on a repayment period that is longer than 12 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period for each loan begins when that loan enters repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 25-year repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, the Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the Secretary calculates the borrower's monthly repayment amount on the basis of the borrower's income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitation on capitalization of interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification of terms and conditions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a borrower elects or is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent repayment plan, the Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and conditions of the plan, including_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's agents; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations, as described in &sect;685.209(a)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary and obtain the Secretary's determination as to whether an adjustment is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consent to disclosure of tax return information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A borrower shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and servicing and collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent form, developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the borrower by the Secretary, and shall return the signed form to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6), tax filing status, and AGI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years from the date the borrower signs the consent form. The Secretary provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The IRS does not disclose tax return information after the IRS has processed a borrower's withdrawal of consent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who selects the income contingent repayment plan but_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Fails to provide the required written consent;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-year period for consent; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income contingent repayment plan for the borrower but the borrower fails to provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to the borrower establishing a repayment schedule for the borrower.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1840&hyph;0693)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1087a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

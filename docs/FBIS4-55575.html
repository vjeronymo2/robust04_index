			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 17 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Human Rights  and Minority Minister Margit Savovic has stated that as  individuals, members of the ethnic Albanian community in  Yugoslavia enjoy all rights guaranteed to all the other  citizens. Savovic told a press conference on Tuesday she had  written a letter to that effect to U.N. Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to refute allegations made in an appeal by  `Albanian intellectuals'.    The appeal, dated May 6, in which `Albanian intellectuals'  accuse Yugoslav authorities of flagrant human rights violations  in the Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, only testifies to  the intention of some ethnic Albanian leaders to put an equation  mark between the status of the ethnic Albanian minority and that  of a constituent nation, and to alter the existing state  borders, said Savovic in her letter to Butrus-Ghali.    A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in  Kosovo-Metohija. Its leaders illegally proclaimed the province  a republic in an attempt to take it away from Serbia and its  parent country Yugoslavia and subsequently annex it to  neighbouring Albania.    Savovic said there was no need to engage international  organizations and bodies to monitor the implementation of human  rights in Yugoslavia. She also said she had invited experts of  the U.N. Committee for the Protection of Children's Rights to  visit Yugoslavia and gain a first-hand knowledge about the  difficult situation in which innocent children are suffering  because of anti-Yugoslav sanctions.    In late May of 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed tough  sanctions against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in  civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In her letter to the U.N. committee, Savovic proposed that  the experts check on the spot whether the problems the Yugoslav  government would list in a report scheduled for release in June  were true. Savovic argued that U.N. special human rights  rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki did not present a true picture  about the rights of children in Yugoslavia because he had  covered the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia and drew a  parallel between children in Yugoslavia and those in war-torn  areas. `We cannot accept such an approach, because the rights  of children in Yugoslavia are threatened precisely because of  sanctions by which the United Nations violate its own convention  on children's rights.'    The sanctions have a devastating effect on the health and  development of Yugoslavia's 3.2 million children and more than  193,000 refugee children.    The infant mortality rate has increased by 10 percent since  the sanctions were introduced. The hemoglobin count in some  children has been seriously affected because of a poor diet,  with the number of children with hemoglobin defficiency  increasing to 19.5 percent from the 8.3 percent before the  sanctions.</p>

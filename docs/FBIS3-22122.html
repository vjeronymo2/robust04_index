			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by environment correspondent Bronwen Maddox: </F> "Rebuke From EU on Water Estimate"]    [Text] The UK has overestimated the costs of complying  with water quality directives, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the  union's environment commissioner, said in London yesterday.    UK water companies have predicted that they will need to  invest more than 10bn pounds to bring water and sewage treatment  standards in line with the EU [European Union] urban waste water  directive. But Mr Paleokrassas, whose officials met UK water  regulators Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority this week,  said the eventual costs were likely to be "several billion  pounds" lower.    His comments came after months of rising tension between  London and Brussels over water standards. The UK has attacked  some standards as unnecessarily high, and asked for more time to  comply. Yesterday Mr Paleokrassas said: "There will be no  lowering of standards or lengthening of dates."    Thames Water said: "A lot of investment follows from this  directive, but the costings are complex and the interpretation  needs to be clarified further."    Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Paleokrassas  also said the European Commission would say within two weeks  whether the UK government's decision to licence the Thorp  nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield followed commission  rules.    "There is some doubt as to whether the environmental impact  assessment has been infringed," he said.</p>

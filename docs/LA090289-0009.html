			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOM BRADLEY AND THE PRESS  </P> <P> If we would track the reason some of our politicians are mixed up in ethical  problems today, we'd find it all stems from one problem: too long in office.  </P> <P> There are many reasons for limiting the number of terms in office that a  politician can serve:  </P> <P> 1. The longer they stay, the more temptation for graft and dishonesty.  </P> <P> 2. Political positions were never meant for the person to become wealthy, but  the fact is that they do. Ask yourself, how come? I thought they were supposed  to be public servants.  </P> <P> 3. Low voter turnout is the result of long incumbency and is exactly what the  incumbent wants.  </P> <P> 4. Politicians have one primary objective, to perpetuate themselves in office.  To act in the best interests of their constituency is secondary.  </P> <P> MAURINE REEDY RUZEK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens falls into loss and omits dividend HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, is to omit its 1991 dividend after falling into loss last year. The group foresees no improvement for the first half of 1992. The company made a net loss of Fl 51m (Dollars 27m) last year compared with a net profit of Fl 298m in 1990, when it paid a dividend of Fl 4.40, down 23 per cent from 1989. It blamed the profit decline mainly on an 8 per cent fall in the selling price of its principal steel and aluminium products. This pushed group turnover down by 4 per cent to Fl 8.1bn. The company, the Netherlands' only steel producer and the sixth biggest in Europe, noted that difficult economic conditions in western Europe had resulted in the postponement of both corporate investment projects and purchases of consumer durables.</p>

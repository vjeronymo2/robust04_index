			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Viacom looks at selling Madison Square Garden Viacom, the US entertainment group, yesterday in effect put its Madison Square Garden operations up for auction, signalling a disposal that analysts expect to raise more than Dollars 1bn. The company denied, though, that it was being forced into the sale by the heavy debt load associated with its Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount Communications, the former owner of MSG. Viacom said it had been approached by more than one potential buyer, and had retained the investment bank Allen &amp; Co to evaluate offers. Mr Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, said: 'While we have the option of retaining this extraordinary asset and building on its many strengths, it would be imprudent to ignore the many inquiries from possible buyers.' Viacom would explore a sale of MSG 'as part of an orderly process for determining how best to maximise shareholder value in the company.' Mr Redstone's statement follows speculation that Viacom would be forced to sell a number of assets. To help service debt resulting from the Paramount takeover, the company has been counting on the completion of its planned merger with Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group. Blockbuster itself has little debt and strong cashflow. However, that transaction has looked in doubt as Viacom's B shares, the currency for the deal, have tumbled in value in recent months - although the shares rose Dollars 1 1/2 yesterday to close at Dollars 24 1/4 . The MSG operations include the New York venue itself, two professional sports franchises which play there - the Knicks basketball team and the Rangers ice hockey team - and a sports cable television channel. Viacom said that it had had 'expressions of interest from a number of parties' interested in buying the operations, but did not say how far these discussions had progressed or when it expected Allen to complete its evaluation.</p>

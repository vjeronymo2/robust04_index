			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Prince urges lessons in education THE PRINCE of Wales yesterday said that Britain had much to learn from France and Germany in education and training, and should do that rather than 'blame them for our problems'. He said at a Business in the Community conference in Manchester: 'We do ourselves no justice if we ignore that greater value is attached to technical and vocational training, staying-on rates are higher, and better apprenticeship arrangements prevail in some of our European partner countries.' He added: 'It is probably fair to say that, as a nation, we have not always given education the priority it deserves.' The Prince highlighted better vocational education as the main challenge. Noting that the present resession was 'causing pain and difficulty' he added: 'It has been particularly demoralising for those who have raised their sights and been successful in further and higher education, only to find that employment opportunities are still depressingly scarce.' The Prince called for a concerted campaign to win the 'hearts and minds' of business people, teachers, trainers, politicians and parents to the importance of staying-on and achieving worthwhile qualifications. He added, however, that the country needed 'the right package of support measures: attainable but credible qualifications, appropriate courses, good schools, and enlightened partnerships' between business, schools and the community. The Prince welcomed the new range of vocational qualifications coming on stream, which are the government's answer to the problems he highlighted - but he also stressed the importance of history, literature, art and drama to 'education for life'.</p>

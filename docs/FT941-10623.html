			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UN row over Bosnian air strikes: Russia and China lead opposition to action against Serbs Two of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council yesterday came out against air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, with Russia claiming that the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, had exceeded his authority in instructing Nato to prepare for such action. China said it wanted to see only peaceful means used to settle the conflict in Bosnia, instead of 'actions which might intensify the confrontation and further complicate the situation there'. With Nato ambassadors due to consider the feasibility of air strikes at a meeting in Brussels today, the Russian foreign ministry yesterday issued a statement saying that 'Mr Boutros Ghali's letter (to Nato) deals with actions which go beyond UN resolutions on Bosnia'. In the letter - delivered to Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, on Sunday - Mr Boutros Ghali said he was empowered under UN resolution 836 to authorise the use of force in Bosnia. However, Mr Mikhail Demurin, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman, said Mr Boutros Ghali's request to Nato should have been made only after consultations with the international community. 'Nato's readiness for strikes is one thing, while making a political decision to launch them is quite another,' he said. Ukraine and Canada, which both have peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia, yesterday spoke out against military intervention as well, fearing it might endanger their troops. The US also appeared to be retreating from the idea of air strikes. White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the US was still focusing on diplomatic remedies to the situation and would present 'ideas to reinvigorate the peace process' at today's Nato meeting. On Monday, President Bill Clinton said he supported Mr Boutros Ghali's request for Nato to prepare for air strikes. However, the UK seemed to be softening its opposition to air strikes, in the belief that there was likely to be overwhelming support for an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, renewed calls for urgent action as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, returned to London from Bosnia for an emergency cabinet meeting on the matter. Mr Major emphasised that UN forces must apply 'immediate and strong pressure' to halt attacks on Sarajevo. He said UN commanders should set clear and specific conditions for relief of the city. Mr Major insisted, however, that the UK would continue to block any suggestion of generalised air attacks, amid considerable doubts about the likely effectiveness of such action. Mr Mate Boban, the hardline nationalist leader of the Bosnian Croats, resigned yesterday, an apparent casualty of growing international pressure on his political backers in Croatia.</p>

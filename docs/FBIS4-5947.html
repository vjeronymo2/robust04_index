			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom  Ranariddh, commenting on the failure of the suppression of the  Khmer Rouge, said his patience in dealing with Thailand was  wearing thin. He noted that the report carried by the Thai  newspapers on the recapture of Pailin town by the Khmer Rouge  was untrue, adding that such a report was an indication of  Thailand's backing for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.    Earlier Prince Ranariddh said, in a rather aggressive tone,  that the three tanks used by the Khmer Rouge during an ambush  against the Phnom Penh troops came from Thai soil and claimed  that two of them were destroyed by the Phnom Penh government  troops.    As of the time of this report, there has not been any  reaction from the Thai Government leaders because the Thais are  celebrating their traditional new year, Songkran, from 12-14  April. However, Thai officials including the foreign minister  clearly announced that Thailand had noting to do with nor did it  provide any support for the Khmer Rouge. They asserted that  Thailand wants to see genuine peace restored in Cambodia because  peace in Cambodia will also mean safety for the Thai people  along the border with that country. Stray artillery shells from  the fighting in Cambodia frequently landed on Thai soil, forcing  border villagers to run to safe places.    Prince Ranariddh has reportedly been implementing an  aggressive foreign policy toward Thailand. Recently, he accused  Thailand of helping Pol Pot flee Pailin into Thailand as the  Phnom Penh troops were launching offensives against the town.  Several foreign news agencies reported his accusation against  Thailand worldwide. After the Thai Government openly voiced its  discontent over Prince Norodom Ranariddh's groundless  accusation, the prince simply denied his own statement on Pol  Pot seeking refuge in Thailand, saying what he meant was that  the Khmer Rouge or Pol Potists were the ones who fled to  Thailand.    An analyst who has long observed the Cambodian situation  noted that Prince Norodom Ranariddh has been making attempts to  reduce Thailand's influence over his country, especially in the  economic field. The Thai baht currency is widely accepted and  influential in Cambodia. The Cambodians prefer baht to  Cambodia's reil currency because the latter's value is nothing  more than plain paper. Moreover, the listing of the baht  currency as one of the world's 20 strongest currencies by  international monetary institutions has further fanning up the  anti-Thai sentiments in Cambodia.    The analyst also warned that Cambodia will try to project  more accusations against Thailand onto the international arena  in a bid to use the hands of the world community to push  Thailand out of its economic circles. He noted that some  countries might be waiting for an opportunity to replace  Thailand in Cambodia's economy.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> LAB PARTS WAY TO BALDNESS CURE  </P> <P> British scientists today celebrated what they believe to be a breakthrough in  the elusive quest for a cure for baldness -- test-tube hair.  </P> <P> A team of scientists at Cambridge University announced that they had cleared a  main obstacle to the development of an anti-baldness drug by growing human hair  in a test-tube.  </P> <P> "This is a real breakthrough," Terence Kealey, head of the research team, told  a reporter. "No one has ever managed to grow hair in a laboratory before."  </P> <P> The idea is not to grow a replacement head of hair in the laboratory but to  allow effective testing of potential baldness cures on single human hairs.  </P> <P> Kealey says the discovery makes the development of a cure for the age-old  problem of hair loss just a matter of time.  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Moscow denies military presence in Chechnya The Russian government yesterday denied it had interevened militarily to destabilise the Caucasian republic of Chechnya despite an outbreak of fierce fighting over the weekend. Mr Victor Yerin, Russia's interior minister, told the Interfax news agency yesterday: 'All that is happening with Chechnya is the business of the Chechen people alone. No interior troops are involved in the events in that republic.' Russian news agencies reported that fighting had erupted on Friday between supporters of Mr Dzhokhar Dudayev's regime and opposition forces at Dolinskaya, 30km outside the republican capital of Grozny. The fighting involved artillery and armoured vehicles, raising suspicions that Russian forces were involved. Mr Movladi Uganov, the Chechen information minister, told Reuters on Friday that two Russian helicopters had fired on the outskirts of Grozny inflicting casualties. The Russian defence ministry vigorously denied the charge. Reports of the fighting have been confused and there have been no details of casualties. The situation was reported to be calm yesterday. Moscow has repeatedly made plain that it wants order re-established in the break-away republic and has called upon Mr Dudayev to step down, warning that Chechnya faces the risk of 'self-annihilation in the bloody flames of civil war'. The Russian government has openly supported a Chechen opposition grouping, led by Mr Umar Avturkhanov, which has been fighting to remove Mr Dudayev. On Friday, Chechnya ordered the expulsion of all Russian journalists within 24 hours. The telephone lines between Moscow and Grozny have been cut.</p>

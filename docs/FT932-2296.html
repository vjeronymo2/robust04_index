			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Two wise men want Treasury to boost training funds: Advisers likely to be divided on how to cut PSBR THE TREASURY will be told on Monday by two of its panel of outside economic advisers to earmark more funds for training and investment, in a move which could jar with the attempt to cut the government's Pounds 50bn budget deficit. Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs, link training funds to the need to boost Britain's industrial strength and lay the foundations for long-term growth. The meeting of the Treasury's so-called seven wise men is likely to be divided over whether the government should favour tax increases or spending cuts as the main weapon to bring down state borrowing. Several of the advisers see regaining control of the deficit as vital to helping a solid upturn. Any tax rises would come on top of the Pounds 17bn worth of tax increases announced in the March Budget to take effect in the three financial years to 1995-96. Monday's gathering will take place privately between the seven economists and senior Treasury officials led by Mr Alan Budd, chief economic adviser. It is their first meeting since Mr Kenneth Clarke took over as chancellor last month from Mr Norman Lamont, who set up the panel at the end of last year. A report written by Treasury officials that summarises the group's proposals and forecasts is due to be sent to Mr Clarke the week after next. The panel's discussion will be the first since Professor Tim Congdon, a staunch monetarist who is one of the group, criticised his colleagues' understanding of economics in an open letter published in March. Mr Britton said the government needed to increase funds for training and investment in areas such as transport, while cutting back where possible on social security spending and other areas which did not contribute to economic growth. While Mr Britton feels further tax increases are not necessary, Mr Davies would like to see tax increases phased in during the next four years 'to pay for a shift of resources' into areas of public spending that will help industrial growth. Mr Davies said the tax increases, combined with possible cuts in public spending, should add up to a fiscal tightening that would total about Pounds 12bn by 1997. Prof Congdon, economic adviser to the Gerrard and National discount house, also wants tax rises to curb the budget deficit. But he is not in favour of plans to shift government resources into investment or training, arguing the private sector should take the lead on such decisions. Mr Andrew Sentance, head of economics at the Confederation of British Industry, and Liverpool University's Prof Patrick Minford both want spending cuts to bear the brunt of the effort to bring down borrowing. Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, another panel member, said he preferred not to state a view prior to the meeting. Prof David Currie of the London Business School, the seventh wise man, did not return telephone calls.</p>

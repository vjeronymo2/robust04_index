			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIBERAL THINKINGS VS. BELIEFS OF CHRISTIANS  </P> <P> Re: Joseph N. Bell's "War Against Sin," I would disagree with his conclusion  that "we sin-fighters are left with defining sin with our own personal lights."  One's "personal light" is hardly a suitable guide. My "personal light" tells me  that 80 m.p.h. on an uncrowded freeway is a suitable speed for both my car and  my driving ability. Guess who would disagree?  </P> <P> We are a nation governed by law, not a democracy governed by the majority. The  law is designed to protect me from those whose "personal lights" say it's OK to  harm me. I'm sure Mr. Bell will find this hard to take, but most of our law, as  it relates to humankind's crimes against one another (sins), has its precedent  in biblical law.  </P> <P> Mr. Bell has difficulty in accepting the biblical definitions of sin. I wonder  why. If that collection of books is suitable to form the foundation for the  moral codes of Western civilization, then it should certainly be suitable to  define the very disease for which it provides the cure, sin.  </P> <P> More money and time has been expended, than any time prior, on sex education,  acceptance of homosexual life styles, state and federally financed abortion,  drug interdiction and drug law enforcement. In recent years, these moral issues  have been dealt with without the benefit of biblical ethics. Let's examine the  results. Unwed teen pregnancies are skyrocketing, teen suicide is higher than  ever, AIDS accelerates its deadly toll within the homosexual community, child  abuse and sexual molestation by parents is rapidly increasing, and we're no  closer to winning the drug war than we've ever been.  </P> <P> Could Lou Sheldon and the other "narrow-minded fundamentalists" possibly be  right in believing that the problem is sin and that these other symptoms of the  problem could be done away with once the problem is recognized and dealt with?  </P> <P> Eric and Janet Snyder,  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

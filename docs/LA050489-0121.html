			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHECKING OUT;  </P> <P> SUCCESS STORY AT SYLMAR SCHOOL  </P> <P> See what's been going on at Sylmar Elementary School over the last three years,  and your stereotype of Los Angeles public schools may change.  </P> <P> The school enjoys outside support from a neighborhood business -- Builder's  Emporium has adopted the school -- and lots of parent involvement, including  parenting skills sessions offered off-campus, in apartment recreation centers  and housing projects, where teachers volunteer to teach parents how to help  their children succeed.  </P> <P> Parents and student volunteers of all ages are building an outdoor science  center that includes a stream, a sink to demonstrate erosion and a playhouse.  The $500 for the project was raised through the school's 35-member Parent  Friendship Group, which meets three days a week to make crafts, cook and sell  their products to fund special projects such as the science center.  </P> <P> "In the last three years, we have a lot more students coming here from private  schools," Principal Yvonne Chan said. "The dressing up of our school has a lot  to do with it. Visitors can see the attractiveness of the physical setting --  murals, plants, the childrens' work. Secondly, our reputation has improved due  to the number of our extra programs and the parent bulletins we distribute."  BARBARA BRONSON GRAY  </P></p>

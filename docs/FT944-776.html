			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cautious welcome for BTR Nylex deal Investors and analysts yesterday gave a cautious welcome to news that BTR Nylex, the Australian-listed arm of the UK's BTR group, was back on the acquisition trail with the ADollars 800m (USDollars 620m) purchase of Formica Corp, the New Jersey-based laminates manufacturer which has been undergone a series of leveraged buy-outs and refinancings in recent years. By yesterday's close, BTR Nylex shares had gained 4 cents to ADollars 2.47, while in London BTR rose  1/2 p to 290p in active trading of 10m shares. The US deal comes in the wake of concerns that BTR Nylex had lost direction, and a sharply weaker share price following the release of disappointing interim results in September. Earlier this month, in an effort to address these problems, the company announced that it was calling in an outsider, Mr Philip Aiken, as managing director, part of whose job would be to identify acquisition opportunities. Yesterday, in Melbourne, the company acknowledged that the Formica transaction, which was already in the pipeline before Mr Aiken's appointment, could double the gearing ratio - perhaps to 30-35 per cent. But it did not see this as a limitation on further deals. The Formica consideration of ADollars 800m will comprise the assumption of the US group's debts, put at ADollars 440m at end-September, with the balance payable in cash. The principal sellers, who have all agreed to accept the terms, are Dillon Read, the US investment bank, with a 51 per cent interest; Masco Corp, with 32 per cent; and Formica's management, with 7 per cent. Formica is the number two force in the US decorative laminates market, with total sales in 1993 of ADollars 580m. More than half the sales are in the US, with the UK, France and Spain accounting for a further 30 per cent. About 11 per cent of revenue comes from Asia. Pre-interest operating profits last year were ADollars 45m, but finance charges of ADollars 62m left an after-tax loss of ADollars 5m. Mr Jackson said Formica had been paying an overall rate of about 14 per cent on its debt burden, but a recent refinancing had cut this significantly. BTR Nylex did not expect any dilution of earnings in year one as a result of the deal. BTR maintains the US interests should tailor neatly with the Australian-based Laminex business, and that its own knowledge of the Asian markets should help it to boost Formica's sales there. According to Mr Jackson, Laminex's pre-interest margins are around 18-20 per cent, more than double Formica's. The two BTR laminates businesses will have sales of ADollars 850m annually, making this division the biggest decorative surfaces manufacturer worldwide.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 5 (A.A.) -- Albanian President Sali  Berisha called on Turkish businessmen to invest in his country,  on Tuesday [5 April]. In a press conference in the capital  city, Berisha, on an official visit, said that his country had  tourism potential, mining, and cheap manpower. He said that  the objective of his visit was to further the existing friendly  relations and political, economic, technical, cultural and  military cooperation between the two countries.    He added that improvement of the two countries' relations  was  a result of the existence of common values between Turkey and  Albania. He stressed that Turkey and Albania shared the same  views on regional and international issues.    Berisha said his country welcomed the presence of Turkish  soldiers in Bosnia.    "Turkish soldiers are going to Bosnia for peace and will  spend efforts to contribute to peace," Berisha said.    Recalling that Albania was the only country near Bosnia,  which availed to NATO its sea and airports, he said that  cooperation between Turkey and Albania was vital for the region.    Berisha said that Albania was facing great economic  difficulties and that the government has been implementing  reforms for two years, to improve the situation.    By virtue of the political, economic, institutional, and  legal reforms implemented, inflation in Albania fell from 400  percent to 30 percent and production rose by 10 percent, the  highest rate in Europe.    Berisha added that during their talk, President Suleyman  Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller assured him that they  will encourage Turkish entrepreneurs to invest in Albania. "Our  country has extraordinary facilities for investments," he said.  "We have great natural resources, a tourism potential, and cheap  labor, as well as an encouraging legislation."    During his talk with Ciller, Berisha asked for low-interest  loans from Turkey, to be used in importing goods from Turkey.  Berisha stressed that Albania wanted to have friendly relations  with its neighbors, but its people were against any change of  borders, by the use of force.    On the Kosovo issue, Berisha said that the UN embargo  imposed  on Serbs should not be lifted unless the Kosovo problem is  resolved.    Berisha said that his country wanted to join the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization and supported the concept of  Partnership for Peace.</p>

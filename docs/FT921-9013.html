			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / 'Draft-dodging' row opens up Democrat race SEVERAL US congressional Democrats are taking a second look at entering the 1992 presidential campaign because of fears that Governor Bill Clinton's chances have been irreparably damaged by charges of draft-dodging. The leading contenders include Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House Majority leader, and Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. None has shown his hand, but none has cut off speculation about a future candidacy. Much will depend on the outcome of next Tuesday's primary election in New Hampshire, where Mr Clinton, once the overwhelming favourite, has seen his lead vanish in the wake of allegations of adultery and renewed controversy over draft evasion 23 years ago. A prominent Democratic strategist on Capitol Hill said yesterday: 'Clinton is finished. Electability is the issue and Clinton cannot make that case any more.' Another Democrat speculated that if Mr Clinton, governor of Arkansas, fared poorly in New Hampshire, a group of southern senators and congressmen and regional officials would press for a national figure such as Mr Bentsen, Mr Gephardt or Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee to enter the race. These arguments are propelled by general dissatisfaction with the quality of the current Democratic candidates, generally viewed as 'second tier'. Mr Clinton, a centrist southerner with broad appeal among liberals and conservatives, was seen as the best candidate to beat President George Bush in November. The problem for new contenders is that filing deadlines for 27 states will have passed after the New Hampshire primary, covering almost 60 per cent of the delegates to the national convention which will select the presidential nominee. This makes a late entry hard, but not impossible. Pressure for a southern candidate will increase if former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts scores a big victory next Tuesday, because his appeal outside the north-east is rated as limited. Equally, Mr Clinton's southern supporters are nervous about Governor Mario Cuomo of New York stepping in, since he is viewed as too liberal to win next November. Cuomo supporters are urging voters to write his name on to the ballot paper in New Hampshire. This campaign, if moderately successful, would highlight the weakness of the current Democratic crop. Mr Clinton has blamed a Republican smear campaign for the controversy over his actions during the Vietnam war. On Wednesday, he was forced to release a 1969 letter in which he acknowledged misleading an Arkansas reserve officer about his opposition to the war and thanked the officer for 'saving me from the draft'. The three-page letter - filled with anti-war sentiment - could be particularly damaging in his native south, which has a strong military tradition.</p>

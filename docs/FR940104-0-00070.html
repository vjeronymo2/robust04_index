			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice establishes the policies and procedures necessary for schools to implement the Direct Loan Program and most of the policies and procedures relating to borrowers in the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary anticipates publishing another notice in the spring of 1994 to govern repayment of loans for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year and establish standards and procedures relating to Federal Direct Consolidation Loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 10, 1993, the Secretary published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 47816) soliciting applications from schools for participation in the Direct Loan Program. Over 1,100 schools responded to that invitation. The Secretary selected 104 schools, representing approximately five percent (5%) of the total Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) loan volume, to participate in the Direct Loan Program for the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. The rules in this notice are applicable for the period beginning July 1, 1994, and ending June 30, 1995. As required by statute, program regulations for the Direct Loan Program in future years will be developed through the use of a negotiated rulemaking process to the extent practicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Schools may participate in the Direct Loan Program by originating loans directly, by participating in a consortium of schools that originates loans directly, or by using an alternative originator to originate loans. All schools are responsible for determining student eligibility for Direct Loan and disbursing loan proceeds to borrowers. Some schools participate in the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL concurrently, while the rest of the selected schools participate exclusively in the Direct Loan Program. Some of the schools that participate in both programs concurrently make Direct Loans available to first time borrowers only; other schools make Direct Loans available to students studying in certain divisions of the school and make FFEL loans available to their other students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards and procedures in this notice are, unless otherwise noted, applicable to each participating school regardless of its method or volume of participation. As stated in the notice announcing the selection of participating schools for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year, a school may withdraw from participation within 30 days of the publication of these standards, criteria, and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Administrative Fee for Loan Origination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Schools and consortia that originate loans will be paid a fee to assist in meeting the costs of loan origination, including the costs associated with drawing down the funds, maintaining the Direct Loan Program account, and reconciling cash and individual loan records with the Secretary each month. The Secretary prefers that originating schools print promissory note/disclosure statements on site. To assist in compensating for the costs associated with this function, schools that print promissory notes/disclosure statements will be paid a larger fee than schools that do not print promissory note/disclosure statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative fee is paid for borrowers for whom a first disbursement has been made and for whom the first disbursement has been reconciled with the Secretary. For the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year, the program-wide average administrative fee may not exceed $10 per borrower. The Secretary will notify schools that originate loans of the actual fee schedule and payment procedures when they are determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This fee structure is applicable to the first year of the program only and is likely to be restructured through the negotiated rulemaking process and when additional data are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Making Direct Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning with the 1994&hyph;95 academic year, all student applications for Federal student aid, including Direct Loans, will be processed by the Central Processor System (CPS). The school will receive an official output from the CPS in the form of a Student Aid Report (SAR) or an Electronic Student Aid Report (ESAR). The ESAR output may be on tapes, cartridges, or rosters. With this official output, the school will be able to assemble a financial aid award package. A school participating in the Direct Loan Program may package Direct Loans as part of the financial aid package in the same manner that a school participating in the FFEL Program packages FFEL Program loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A school in the Direct Loan Program will either originate loans or use the services for an alternative originator. A school will use an alternative originator if it chooses not to originate loans or is not eligible to originate loans. For the first year of the Direct Loan Program, the criteria for eligibility to originate were prescribed by statute. These criteria were included in the September 10, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Originating Schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Direct Loan Program, schools and consortia that originate loans must use software provided by the Secretary, or other software based on specifications provided by the Secretary, to create a loan-origination record containing the basic information necessary to make a loan. The software provided by the Secretary reformats the data received from the CPS and prompts the school to add data collected by the school, such as the type of loan, loan amount, and disbursement dates. Because schools have different needs, various options are available to schools after they generate the loan origination record. The software allows schools to computer-generate combined promissory notes/disclosure statements. Alternatively, a school could transmit the information collected by the school to the Direct Loan Program Servicer, which upon request, will print promissory notes/disclosure statements on behalf of the school and ship them to the school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

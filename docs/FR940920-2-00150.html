Basic State Grants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Program Focus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last two reauthorizations of the vocational education basic grant have emphasized program improvement and achieving equitable access for special populations. Have these emphases produced the desired results of better preparation for, and success in, postsecondary education and the labor market for the target populations? Should the reauthorization address a revised or expanded set of objectives?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Secondary and Postsecondary Education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should the Perkins Act be restructured to focus on assisting in the comprehensive reform and improvement of secondary education, for example by providing resources primarily to encourage the integration of academic and vocational education at the high school level? Alternatively, should the Act focus mainly on the improvement of postsecondary education, especially community college programs? As a related issue, should the Perkins Act continue to support vocational education only below the baccalaureate level? What attention should the Act give to the needs of out-of-school adults and youth, including dropouts?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Discretionary Grant Competitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final NAVE report recommends that Congress consider using some portion of Basic State Grant funds for competitive grants to States that propose, and show promise of effecting, comprehensive reforms consistent with the goals of the Act. Should the Department adopt this recommendation? More broadly, should the Act be revised to provide incentives for States to undertake comprehensive reform of their vocational education programs? How would these incentives account for the differences in progress States have already made in undertaking reforms?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Role of the States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most observers agree that the 1990 amendments to the Perkins Act deemphasized the role of the States, yet the NAVE Independent Advisory Panel has contended that States hold the key to achieving vocational education reform at ``a pace and scale sufficient to affect national workforce quality.'' Should the next reauthorization establish a stronger State role? For what purpose? Should the current State governance structure in the Act be modified to reinforce the State partnerships developing under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act? How would this be achieved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Targeting Funds for Special Populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAVE reports that individuals with special needs are overenrolled, relative to their presence in the population, in vocational education. Should the Perkins Act continue to target funds to areas with high concentrations of special populations? Should there be more emphasis on serving all students?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Criteria for Services to Special Populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Perkins Act amendments greatly increased the amount and specificity of procedural requirements related to provision of services to special populations. Are these provisions ensuring that members of special populations receive equal access to program services? Are the services provided of benefit to special populations? Could the level of prescription be reduced, in exchange for greater attention to higher outcomes for all students, including students with special needs? Are the current provisions and protections for special populations effective at ensuring that they have an equal opportunity to enter and succeed in the full range of high-quality vocational programs? Should the law continue to focus on providing the supplementary and other services that special populations need to succeed in vocational education, or, as the final NAVE report suggested, should it instead focus more on improvement of the vocational programs in which those students participate? If that strategy were carried forward, would other programs such as Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act be able to provide the supplementary services special populations require?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;State Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current Perkins Act State planning requirements are some of the most prescriptive found in any Federal education legislation. Can the goals of these planning requirements be met without these controls on State process? Are the existing procedures for development of the plan and the items required to be included in the plan having their desired effect? If not, what changes should the Department consider?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

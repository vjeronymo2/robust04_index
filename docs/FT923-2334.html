			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Reynolds takes stake in Ukraine plants R J REYNOLDS Tobacco International has acquired a controlling interest in two of Ukraine's four tobacco factories and promised to expand production. RJR hopes that, with its 70 per cent interest in the Lviv tobacco factory in western Ukraine and in the Kremenchuh tobacco factory in the south-central area of the country, it will be able to supply more than one-quarter of the 80bn cigarettes Ukraine's 52m people smoke annually. The deal will make RJR, which already produces cigarettes in St Petersburg, the largest producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States and represents a wider attempt by the company to expand into east Europe and the former Soviet Union, where smoking is still fashionable. 'It should be recognised that in eastern Europe and the CIS, total cigarette consumption is about 700bn units and represents a major potential market,' said Mr Thomas Marsh, RJR's regional president. 'I can assure you that RJR is not the only company which has recognised this.' These are tough times for tobacco companies in North America and western Europe, and RJR, which produces two of the 10 best-selling cigarette brands, has been under attack from the non-smoking lobby. By contrast, RJR executives have received a warm reception from Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president. 'Most people smoke and get great pleasure from smoking,' he said. Mr Kravchuk apologetically conceded that he was a non-smoker but hastened to add: 'My son is an enthusiastic smoker.' In turn, Mr Marsh praised Mr Kravchuk's commitment to 'very rapid movement to a free market' and said that the speed with which the Ukrainian government negotiated the joint venture has encouraged RJR Tobacco's parent company, RJR Nabisco, to invest in food processing in Ukraine. Mr Serhi Boriak, a part-time economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, who was hired as a consultant by RJR for the deal, said RJR was able to negotiate the agreement so swiftly by avoiding ministerial structures and working directly through the president. A Ukrainian official said RJR acquired its stakes in exchange for a Dollars 4m investment in new equipment in each factory.</p>

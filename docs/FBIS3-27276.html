			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Agricultural Council under the Executive Yuan  stated yesterday that it could not agree to lower all tariffs  for individual agricultural products to below 20 percent and  that Taiwan will not categorically refuse the [word indistinct]  proposed by the United States, noting the need to wait until the  major supplying countries and the final results of the  negotiations [as heard]. The bilateral consultation meeting with  the United States over Taiwan's joining the GATT will begin next  Thursday [24 February].    The Agricultural Council is said to be working out the  bottom  line in talks and the room for maneuver in lowering the tariffs  in view of the United States' call for the lowering of tariffs  on 387 items. It is said that the percentage for tariff  reductions on 387 items is greater than that requested by the  United States during the talks on tariff cuts in January, and  that the United States wants Taiwan to slash tariffs on the  majority of agricultural products by more than 50 percent. The  United States also requested Taiwan not to set all tariffs on  individual agricultural products at higher than 20 percent.    At the upcoming bilateral consultation meeting with the  United States over Taiwan's joining GATT, the United States is  expected to again call on Taiwan to further slash tariffs on the  over 100 agricultural products on which Taiwan had earlier  agreed in the talks in January to make cuts.</p>

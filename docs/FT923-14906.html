			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / A sporting innocent on his way to the Olympic Games: Nicholas Woodsworth has been in training for Barcelona I AM not a sports person. I have not entered a locker room in good faith since 16-year-old, 6 ft 2 in Mick Shepherd, school tough-guy and offensive lineman, used to threaten me during pre-game kit-ups. 'I'm going to beat the bejeesus out of you on the field,' he would say. And he did, regularly. Wham. Crunch. Canadian high school football left me looking at competitive athletic activity in a less than kindly light. Even today the back pages of the newspapers are foreign territory to me. Recently the strangest place I have been is a vast bar called Champions on the Riverwalk in San Antonio, Texas, where simultaneously, and to packed crowds of roaring fans, 16 TV screens show 16 different cable sports channels. Such places do not offer an entirely rational view of the world, and leave me anxious for its future. This may not be the best background from which to gaze out on to the wide world of sport. None the less, after half-a-lifetime's sports avoidence I find myself about to enter the greatest sporting competition on earth. There will be many large teams travelling to Barcelona later this month for the 1992 Olympics - the Games get more spectacular, the stakes higher, the competitors more numerous each time they come around. But no competition is going to be larger or more rigorous than that between the 15,000 journalists  -more than one for every genuine athlete - who will cram themselves into each stadium, arena and bar in the city to dish up a two-week media extravaganza. Apart from the strength and stayinging power necessary, this leaves me concerned with my pre-game training. How does one get in shape for such a monstrous contest - more than 160 national teams, 25 different sports, 41 sporting venues, 257 medal events, 400,000 excited observers, hundreds of dramas and stories daily? Jaded old sports hacks may sit back, chew cigars, and sprint across PC keyboards. But what about this reporter, a sports dolt who recently had his eight-year-old son correct him on the rules of checkers? If there were some journalistic version of steroids, a treatment that would pump me up into a George Plimpton overnight, I just might be tempted. But no pain, no gain. In recent weeks I have been building myself up, making forays, some brief and tentative, others longer and more demanding, into what until now for me has been the uncharted and baffling world of sport. I began with reading, piles of it from the local library. For want of any logical starting point, I began with the book at the top of the stack, a treatise on archery. The bow, I was told, ranks with fire and the wheel as vital developments on the road to what humans are today. We make sport of curious things. In A Cultural History of Sport I learned that the original Olympian athletes competed oiled and naked. In Lords of the Rings, I found out that not everyone admires the International Olympic Committee - its authors have dug up every piece of dirt imaginable on the perverting of Olympic ideals, and now face angry IOC libel charges. In the Underground Steroid Handbook (not available from the local library) I learned how to cook up a batch of performance-enhancing GHB using nothing more than industrial solvent and caustic soda. Feeling somewhat strengthened, I began to make training sorties across the English countryside to interview athletes. Why is it that most British Olympic athletes seem to live in northern cities? I met individuals - Olympians, trainers, and sports academics - who seemed as novel to me as creatures from another galaxy. In Sheffield, I met race-walker Les Morton and for the first time saw in a participant's eyes the power of the Olympic magnet. 'Ooh aye,' he said slowly of race-walking in Seoul four years ago. 'It were like a dream.' I watched wrestlers grapple on sweaty mats in Manchester and gymnasts tape and talcum their hands in Newport. I met a marathon runner in Bridgend who lives from the proceeds of two races a year. I saw a 51-kilo Chinese weightlifter snatch-lift 120 kilos over his head in Cardiff and break a world record. In Amersham a doctor for elite sportsmen explained to me why black athletes' bodies make them so formidable. In London's Drug Control Centre I learnt of a new generation of sports-drugs that have no legally acceptable test. In Birmingham I discussed women's pelvises with a physiologist. There are not many things, in fact, that sport is not about. The wham and the crunch of it, the will to dominate, certainly make sport what it is. But so do politics, ethics, technology, big business, social history, drugs, entertainment, medicine, sex, philosophy, and journalism - just about everything else we grapple with every day. What makes sport so odd and intriguing is that in the stadium we deliberately arrange all these elements in competitive order for our entertainment. Competition - winning or losing in front of the world - is what the Olympics are all about. Even non-football, non-checkers-playing journalists get fired up by it. Like Japanese archers, British sprinters, Kenyan runners and the vast global hack-pack heading to Barcelona, I have got butterflies.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Another contributing factor to the white sturgeon decline is the elimination of side channel slough habitat in the Kootenai River floodplain due to diking and bank stabilization to protect agricultural lands from flooding. Much of the Kootenai River has been channelized and stabilized from Bonners Ferry downstream to Kootenay Lake, resulting in reduced aquatic habitat diversity, altering flow conditions at potential remaining spawning and nursery areas, and altering remaining substrates and conditions necessary for survival. The former slough and side channel areas were considered important rearing and foraging habitat for early age sturgeon and their prey (Partridge 1983). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, these extensive aquatic habitat and flow modifications in the Kootenai River basin are believed to have caused adverse effects on white sturgeon reproduction, recruitment, and survival, and threaten the continued existence of the population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All legal commercial and sport harvest for Kootenai River white sturgeon has been eliminated in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia. However, it is not known what impact, if any, to Kootenai River sturgeon may still be occurring from the illegal harvest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While no historic evidence of white sturgeon exploitation in the Kootenai River basin during the 1800's exists (PSMFC 1992), sturgeon were utilized by the Kootenai Indians ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;at least several hundred years ago'' (Graham and White 1985). In Idaho, the harvest of white sturgeon in the Kootenai River was first regulated in 1944 when commercial fishing was prohibited and sport fishing restrictions were imposed (Apperson 1992). With increasingly restrictive harvest and length restrictions, an estimated 10 to 20 white sturgeon were harvested per year from 1944 through the mid-1970's. Partridge (1983) reported that although the legal harvest had reached a relatively constant 51 to 52 fish per year over the 1979 through 1981 period, the total number of sturgeon caught was decreasing with fewer fish being released. Partridge also found that only 13 percent (n = 50) of the 342 sturgeon sampled were younger than age 15 and smaller than the legal size of 32 in (92 cm) total length. He concluded that lack of recruitment was limiting the population and fishery. Following this investigation and citing concerns about the status of the population, Idaho terminated the legal sport harvest in 1984, limiting the sturgeon fishery to catch and release only. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Montana, the harvest of white sturgeon was not restricted prior to 1972 (Apperson 1992). Graham and White (1985) reported that burbot (ling) anglers and fishermen using set-lines harvested sturgeon in the Kootenai River downstream of Kootenai Falls during the 1940's and 1950's. Beginning in 1972, harvest was restricted to two sturgeon per year with a slot (size) limit of between 36 and 54 in (102 to 183 cm). Over a 6-year period, 5 to 18 sturgeon were harvested annually. Fishing for sturgeon in Montana has been prohibited since 1979, and the species is now classified as a ``Species of Special Concern'' (MTNHP 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In British Columbia, the white sturgeon harvest was first regulated in 1952 (Apperson 1992). During the 1974 through 1989 period, anglers were required to secure a permit to fish for white sturgeon and allowed to harvest one white sturgeon per year over 1 m total length. An average of 55 permits were issued annually from 1973 to 1980 with an estimated annual legal and illegal harvest of 10 to 20 fish (Graham 1981). Most sturgeon angling occurred on or near the Kootenai River delta or in the river. Setlining for white sturgeon in British Columbia was prohibited in 1989, and a total ban on the sport harvest was imposed in 1990. Current regulations allow catch and release only for white sturgeon in Kootenay Lake. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few adult white sturgeon are collected each year for experimental culture purposes. The Kootenai Tribal Experimental Hatchery in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, is currently evaluating factors limiting recruitment, including the relationship between water quality and gamete viability, as well as habitat use and survival of juvenile white sturgeon released into the Kootenai River. Collection for experimental culture purposes does not appear to be a threat at this time. The BPA recently completed an evaluation of a captive broodstock program to determine the environmental impacts and genetic risk of supplementation on the remaining wild white sturgeon population in the Kootenai River (Kincaid 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

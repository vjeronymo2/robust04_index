			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Stockholm A spate of corporate results will make for a busy week in Europe's best performing market over the last quarter, as investors continue to assess last week's budget in the run-up to Sunday's referendum on EU membership. Nine-month figures are due today from Trygg-Hansa and SSAB reports tomorrow. Electrolux produces third quarter details on Wednesday, Pharmacia on Thursday and Astra and Gambro on Friday. Mr Peter Tron at Unibank Securities expects a volatile week, although he said that the week's corporate results were unlikely to disappoint. However, opinion polls suggest that the EU referendum may be too close to call, although Mr Tron said that the markets were discounting a 'yes' vote. A 'no' vote, he said, could in the short-term lead to a 10 - 15 per cent correction in equities and a rise in the long bond yield from the current 11.4 per cent to around 13 per cent.</p>

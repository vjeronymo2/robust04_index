			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On his return to Knin, Slobodan Jarcevic, member of  the delegation of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] at the  negotiations in Zagreb and foreign minister, held a news  conference. Jarcevic said that both sides agreed not to mention  the possible political solutions during the talks and to discuss  only a cease-fire and the end of hostilities. Dragoljuib  Stankic reports from Knin:    [Stankic] The main reasons why the RSK delegation had  accepted the invitation to take part in the negotiations is the  desire of the Serbian side that peace be established and  hostilities end. This was stated by Foreign Minister Slobodan  Jarcevic at the beginning of the news conference, adding the  following:    [Begin Jarcevic recording] Messrs. Vital Churkin and the  U.S. ambassador guaranteed us that they would exert their  influence on the Government of the Republic of Croatia so that  it no longer resorts to arms and crosses the border that has  been established between the RSK and Croatia with the agreement  reached in Geneva on 23 November of 1991, and whose lines were  confirmed by the agreement in Sarajevo on 3 January 1992. [end  recording]    [Stankic] According to Jarcevic, the negotiations in Zagreb  were not prepared in the best possible way, because both sides  only acquainted themselves with the proposed maps on their  arrival in the Russian Embassy. Considering that the border of  some 1,600 kilometers is running through many villages and  towns, and that there are many disputed facts, both delegations  need to consult their governments so that the interests could be  articulated in a much better way at the new negotiations.    Thus, the talks have not been broken, but will resume next  Tuesday [29 March]. At this meeting, new maps will be  presented. These, as Jarcevic said, will not deviate even one  meter from the real situation on the ground.    Journalists' questions mainly referred to the possible  political solutions. Slobodan Jarcevic said several times that  this was not discussed. He mentioned the resolve to finally  establish peace as the most important result of the talks  yesterday.</p>

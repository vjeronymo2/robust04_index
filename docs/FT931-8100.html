			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Figures that can bemuse - Scheherazade Daneshkhu investigates the mysteries of APR MORTGAGE-seekers attracted by an Abbey National advertisement on February 10 for its fixed rate of 5.99 per cent - 'our lowest fixed rate ever' - might have wondered what an annual percentage rate (APR) figure of 8.2 per cent was doing alongside it. Most people tend to ignore the APR figure which banks and building societies are obliged to quote. But it is meant to reflect the true cost of the mortgage so that customers have a fair basis of comparison. The mathematical calculation itself is based on a formula set out in the Consumer Credit (Total Charge for Credit) Regulations Act 1980. It takes into account all payments made throughout the life of the mortgage, when they are made and includes a number of the lender's costs. For instance, the Halifax building society's assumed charges on a Pounds 50,000 loan, completed on April 16, include: Valuation fee of Pounds 125. Conveyancer's fee of Pounds 117.50, which is the legal cost to the lender of arranging the mortgage. Mortgage indemnity premium of Pounds 500, which is insurance protecting the lender against losses if you were to default. Halifax charges it on loans of more than 75 per cent of the purchase price of the property or valuation, whichever is lower. Mortgage discharge fee of Pounds 40 and a Pounds 15 charge for despatch of the title deeds on repayment of the loan. If the mortgage was a fixed or capped rate loan, its fee would also be included. Because these costs are included, the APR will be higher than the quoted rate. Most lenders with a 7.99 per cent variable rate are quoting an APR of 8.5 per cent on a repayment mortgage and a slightly lower rate, 8.3 or 8.4, on an endowment. Abbey National has an 0.1 percentage point difference between the two types. Abbey's Richard Bolton says this is because, 'You are paying down the loan throughout the year with a repayment mortgage. But that is not reflected in our calculations until the year-end, so you are implicitly being charged a slightly higher rate of interest.' Although APRs are meant to make life easier for the consumer, they can be misleading because they are based on a set of assumptions about the size of loan, the time it was taken out, the length of its term and the cost of the charges, all of which are variable. Moreover, assumptions vary from lender to lender. 'Our concern is the lack of clarity regarding the assumptions,' says Michael Coogan, of the Building Societies Association. 'Some members do one thing and some do others. No one understands what the law says.' One thing lenders have done is to assume a fixed rate will apply throughout a 25-year mortgage term, thereby arriving at a much lower APR. But the trading standards department of Devon county council has been active in prosecuting lenders for an abuse of the standards of fair trading. Bob Imrie, from the trading standards department, says lenders now have accepted that a fair basis on which to calculate the APR is to assume that today's standard variable rate should apply after the fixed-rate period. The Abbey National fixed-rate loan at 5.99 per cent lasts only until the end of May 1994, leaving more than 23 years at the variable rate. This means the APR on the fixed-rate mortgage is 8.2 per cent, only slightly lower than the 8.4 per cent APR which applies to an endowment mortgage taken out at Abbey's standard rate of 7.99 per cent. Coogan would like to see lenders follow the practice in Europe and include the cost of a life policy - such as an endowment - in the APR figure. When you go to a lender for a mortgage, do not be surprised if the APR figure is not quoted. Earlier this year, branches of the National &amp; Provincial, Barnsley, Nationwide, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Leeds Permanent and Halifax societies all were fined by Doncaster magistrates for giving misleading quotations, which included either failing to quote an APR figure or quoting an incorrect one.</p>

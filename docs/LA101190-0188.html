			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABLE TV FIRM OFFERS A CHINESE CHANNEL  </P> <P> Hoping to turn on a new audience of cable television viewers, a local company  has started offering a Chinese-language station as part of its standard  subscription package.  </P> <P> "Sixty percent of our non-subscribers are Chinese," Alan Kraslow, area  marketing director for American Cablevision, said Monday at a news conference  in the company's South Pasadena studio. "This group has never had an interest  in cable programs. We tried to find a unique channel for our non-subscribers,  unique to their lifestyle."  </P> <P> On Oct. 1, American Cablevision began offering Chinese-language programs  produced by North America Television Corp., a South El Monte-based station that  airs news, music and variety shows from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and other  Asian countries, as well as local news of interest to the Chinese community.  </P> <P> Previously, the shows were available via satellite only to people willing to  spend $499 on a satellite dish and special receiver, and up to $200 for  installation costs.  </P> <P> Now, all residents in South Pasadena and San Marino who subscribe to American  Cablevision -- which costs $20.95 a month -- can watch the program, which  broadcasts four hours daily and is billed as the primary source of news for  North America's Chinese-speaking population.  </P> <P> "This is the market of the future," said Randy Campbell, cable relations  director for North America Television.  </P> <P> American Cablevision and North America Television officials said they hope to  attract as many as 1,000 new viewers by adding the Chinese-language program.  Currently, few of American Cablevision's 6,300 subscribers are Chinese,  although Chinese constitute an estimated 20% of San Marino and South Pasadena,  Kraslow said.  </P> <P> To solicit customers, the company plans to send mailers in Chinese and English  to non-subscribers with Chinese surnames, and Chinese subscribers will receive  bilingual programs each month, Kraslow said.  </P> <P> By December, the cable company expects to have the technology to allow viewers  to receive the channel in either Mandarin or Cantonese, but only if viewers'  sets are equipped to receive the dual signals.  </P> <P> Other cable companies from San Francisco to New York are considering adding the  station, or others like it, to their programming, North America Television  officials said.  </P> <P> Locally, Cencom Cable Television, a St. Louis-based company that provides cable  to 16 Southern California communities concentrated in the West San Gabriel  Valley, is considering adding North America Television to its list of programs,  Cencom general manager Craig Watson said.  </P> <P> "There are 4 million potential Chinese viewers in North America," said Pi Hsou  Chu, vice president of North America Television. "In the near future we hope to  reach (cable subscribers) in Washington D.C., New York, Boston, Houston, San  Francisco and Chicago."  </P> <P> Cencom already carries Chinese programs provided by the Jade Channel, a Hong  Kong station that broadcasts news, entertainment and soap operas.  </P> <P> But Cencom subscribers must pay $17.95 a month extra for the channel, unlike  the American Cablevision channel, for which there is no additional charge to  cable subscribers. In addition, Jade Channel shows are sent via videotape,  rather than by satellite.  </P> <P> Watson said Cencom is considering adding the North America Television channel  in hopes of attracting Chinese-speaking viewers who do not watch the Jade  Channel.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: The Caribbean comes to theatre-land The Royalty has been over-thrown. London's most desolate theatre has been transformed into the Island. More than that it is a Caribbean Wonderland. The place is stiff with atmosphere, from the charming staff and a tableau of old timers playing dominoes on the stairs, to the spicy snacks, rum cocktails and ethnic market. This is one theatre where you are positively encouraged to dawdle and make a night of it. Stoll-Moss, owners of the old Royalty, have thrown everything, including over Pounds 500,000 of real money, in an attempt to prove that just because it is sited east of Holborn, in the favourite haunt of vagabonds and bag ladies, the Island can still be a success. Of course all the name changes and trimmings would be futile if the Island does not produce a hit, and with Once in this Island it reckons that it has got a banker. The connection between the two is everywhere; indeed half the auditorium is consumed by the set, with a tropical trellis creeping towards the circle. By the time you take your seat, with its bright new white covering, you are in the mood for yet another 'feel-good' show. And that is exactly what you get. Once in this Island is a musical set in the Caribbean, which has been a huge success on Broadway. A fine balance is maintained between carefree escapism and social comment. Sure, there are plenty of happy black peasants lauding the simple life and their affinity with the gods, singing their hearts out and shaking their beefy bits. But this cliche is subverted by the plot, an embroidery on Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Mermaid, with the young girl offering her life to the underworld in place of the man she loves. There is also some topical tension in that the island seems to be Haiti, divided between poor villagers, who provide the heroine Ti Moune, and rich mulatto Beauxhommes, who spawn her faithless lover, Armand. Lynn Ahrens wrote the book and lyrics and Stephen Flaherty conjures up music which borrows heavily from Caribbean rhythms. You hardly leave the theatre singing but it all fits wonderfully as a piece. Director David Toguri has concentrated the action into 90 minutes without interval, which builds to a compelling intensity, with the set contributing some exciting storms. The cast play so well as an ensemble that individuals lose out, but Lorna Brown is enchanting as the orphan Ti Moune and Clive Rowe makes a character out of her adoptive dad. The fairy tale ending is affecting, and you would have to be a sad old curmudgeon not to leave Once in this Island without a warm glow.</p>

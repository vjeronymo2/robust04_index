			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: QVC undecided on bid from shareholders The board of QVC Network, the US cable television shopping group, was still locked in discussions last night over whether to accept a takeover offer from its two largest shareholders, Comcast Communications and Liberty Media. The cable companies are reported to have increased their original offer for the 65 per cent of QVC that they do not already own from Dollars 44 a share to Dollars 46 a share, an all-cash bid which values QVC at just under Dollars 1.5bn. Although QVC was expected to accept the revised offer yesterday, the lack of an early announcement from the board meeting, which started at 10.30am in New York, led some analysts to suggest that there may have been last-minute opposition to the deal from some members - possibly from Mr Barry Diller, QVC chairman, who is believed to have wanted the company to wait and see if a higher bid would emerge from another source. A QVC spokesman declined to comment on the progress of the board meeting, but last night sources close to the company said the board was still hoping to announce an agreement within a few hours. Last month the QVC board was close to accepting a merger offer from the CBS television broadcasting network, but before it could sanction the deal Comcast stepped in with a higher bid on July 12. Ten days later, Comcast was joined by Liberty Media.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS &amp; AUTHOR: SCI-FI'S BENFORD ALSO WRITES 'BAD' FAULKNER  </P> <P> For a professor of physics at UC Irvine who is also a noted science fiction  author, Gregory Benford admits it's an unlikely honor.  </P> <P> But the Laguna Beach resident has placed among the top 25 entrants in the first  annual William Faulkner Write-Alike Contest.  </P> <P> Benford's Faulkner parody will be one of 50 top contest entries that will be  included in "The Best of Bad Faulkner," an anthology to be published in 1991 by  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich -- the same house that published "The Best of Bad  Hemingway," a 1989 collection of entries in the now-defunct annual imitation  Hemingway contest.  </P> <P> The Faulkner contest, in which entrants had to write their best bad Faulkner in  500 words or less, is co-sponsored by American Airlines' in-flight magazine,  American Way; the English Department and the Center for the Study of Southern  Culture at the University of Mississippi; and Yoknapatawpha Press, the Oxford,  Miss.-based small trade publishing house named after the fictional county in  which Faulkner set many of his books.  </P> <P> Benford, a longtime fan of the Nobel prize-winning Southern author, read about  the contest last year and entered it "on a lark."  </P> <P> "I didn't think I'd win," Benford said, adding that he almost threw away the  recent notification letter, thinking it was an advertisement. "I was very  surprised. I had completely forgotten about it."  </P> <P> Benford's 400-word entry, a parody of Faulkner's famous novella "The Bear," is  titled "The Bore."  </P> <P> "It's about a rapacious Southern land developer," he said with a laugh. "It was  written as one long paragraph, Faulknerian style -- roughly a page and a half,  double spaced."  </P> <P> It took Benford about two hours to write his entry. But then, as a native  Alabamian, he has been reading Faulkner "since I was a kid."  </P> <P> "The thing that most critics miss about Faulkner is that his famous  storytelling voice is, in fact, a standard Southern storytelling voice that is  typical of the Gulf Coast -- Mississippi, Alabama and so on."  </P> <P> As a boy in the '40s, Benford said: "I heard stories told that same way, with  the long rolling sentences, the digressions and the Biblical terminology all  the time. I think that is why the South has so dominated American letters in  this century, because it's the region that retains storytelling most strongly."  </P> <P> As it turns out, the top winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike Contest is anything  but Southern.  </P> <P> He is Saul Rosenberg of London, who is working on a doctoral dissertation on  Faulkner at Columbia University.  </P> <P> The winner and two runners-up -- Jeffrey E. Simpson of Middletown, R.I., and  Michael A. Crivello of Flower Mound, Tex. -- were selected by three celebrity  judges: authors George Plimpton, William Styron and Willie Morris.  </P> <P> Four other Californians were among the top 50 contest entrants: John C.  Richards of Los Angeles, Sally Jackoway of San Diego, Don Mangan of San Mateo  and Clare A. Simmons of Palo Alto.  </P> <P> Contest officials figured they would be lucky if they received 250 entries in  the first year of the contest. Instead, they received more than 650 submissions  from 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Australia, Brazil,  Canada, England and France.  </P> <P> "We were staggered by the response to this," said contest coordinator Dean  Wells in a phone interview from Oxford, where she and her novelist-husband,  Larry, are, as they say, "the sole owners, proprietors and janitors" of  Yoknapatawpha Press.  </P> <P> The press, Wells said, publishes everything from facsimile editions of  Faulkner's novels to football history books -- and "a lot of Willie Morris in  between."  </P> <P> It also publishes the quarterly Faulkner Newsletter and Yoknapatawpha Review,  which provides information about the author to 285 Faulkner-loving subscribers.  (The two contest runners-up will receive a 10-year subscription.)  </P> <P> As the contest deadline neared last February, Wells said it got to the point  where there were so many entries stacked on their dining room table that she  and her husband couldn't even eat a meal on it.  </P> <P> "I'd bet next year we break 2,000," she said. "I think people just had so much  fun with it. The entries were just hysterical. They were funny and brilliant  parodies."  </P> <P> "As I Lay Dying," one of Faulkner's most famous novels, prompted a string of  similarly titled entries: "As I Lay Dieting," "As I Lay Crying," "As I Lay  Frying."  </P> <P> Because the three contest judges would not be able to read every single  submission, the entries were initially screened by Dean and Larry Wells.  </P> <P> "We had a committee from the university to help us, Faulkner scholars," Larry  Wells said. "And even an old lady friend of Mr. Bill's -- that's what I call  him -- stopped by to help us judge them." With a laugh, he added: "I won't name  which one."  </P> <P> One entry had only one line: "My fish is a mother" -- a play on Faulkner's  famous line in "As I Lay Dying": "My mother is a fish."  </P> <P> Most entries were more demanding.  </P> <P> "Faulkner prose is so dense to read, you had to stop after reading an hour or  so and clear your mind and do something else," Larry Wells said. "You got  satiated with Faulknerisms and Faulkneriana."  </P> <P> For Dean Wells the contest is a labor of love: William Faulkner was her uncle.  She called him Pappy.  </P> <P> "All the children in the family grew up saying Pappy," she said. Her father,  Dean Faulkner, was William Faulkner's youngest brother. A barnstormer, Dean  Faulkner died in a plane crash before his daughter was born. "So Pappy  certainly, in many ways, was a real pappy to me," she said.  </P> <P> Dean Wells has been having as much fun with the contest as the entrants.  </P> <P> Noting that the winner of the Imitation Hemingway Contest was sent to Harry's  Bar and Grill in Florence, Italy, "where they got exotic Italian food," Wells  observes that the winner of the Faulkner Write-Alike Contest "gets flown into  Oxford, Miss., in the worst part of the summer as far as heat is concerned to  look forward to a diet of black-eyed peas and grits."  </P> <P> As first-place winner, Rosenberg and a friend were flown by American Airlines  to the weeklong Faulkner Yoknapatawpha Conference held last week at the  University of Mississippi in Oxford. (Rosenberg actually landed in Memphis,  Tenn. and was picked up by the Wellses, who drove him to Oxford. "We're so  small, we don't have an airport," she said.)  </P> <P> The couple can usually count on a lot of people dropping by their house during  the Faulkner conference. As Dean Wells explains: "The whiskey's cheap and we  never close."  </P> <P> During a ceremony last week at Rowan Oak, Faulkner's home, George Plimpton  presented Rosenberg with a first-place contest certificate; a plaque with  Rosenberg's name -- and subsequent first-place winners -- will be installed at  the university's Center for the Study of Southern Culture.  </P> <P> Wells said the local Holiday Inn also gave Rosenberg five nights of free  lodging, and various restaurants in town provided free lunches and dinners.  </P> <P> "On top of all that," she said, American Way magazine and United Airlines will  be flying Rosenberg and a friend anywhere in the United States and the Bahamas  for a five-day, free vacation "in any place that has a Marriott Hotel."  </P> <P> The top 10 contest entries have been published in the August issue of American  Way magazine.  </P> <P> Entries are now being accepted for next year's contest, which has a Feb. 1  deadline. Entries, typed and doubled-spaced, should be sent to The Faulkner  Newsletter, P.O. Box 248, Oxford, Miss., 38655.  </P> <P> "Urge your readers to enter," Wells said. "The more the merrier."  </P> <P> And what would William Faulkner, her beloved Pappy, think of the write-alike  contest?  </P> <P> "I would like to think -- and there's no way to say -- but that he would be  chuckling somewhere," she said. "It is such a wonderful tribute to him to have  people all over the world not just read him, but to enter this contest and to  know his works well enough and let their own wit and creativity turn loose on  it."  </P> <P> Poets Reading: Catherine Spear and John W. Hart III will read at the Poets  Reading meeting at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N.  Pomona Ave., Fullerton. $3.  </P></p>

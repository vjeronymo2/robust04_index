			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Eric Meyer: "China Shows the Full Measure of </F> Its Strength"]    [Text] A page of history in relations between China and the  West was perhaps turned yesterday when President Clinton  announced the unilateral, unconditional and definitive extension  of the most favored nation or "MFN" clause.    This is also a measure of China's newly acquired strength --  and what a distance it has travelled since June '89 when its  government was the pariah among nations. Although the decision  to renew this clause was taken some months ago -- rumors on this  issue were too loud to mean anything else -- it also seemed  probable that the White House would limit the effect of this  clause for the benefit of China, allowing it to reap the lion's  share of a bilateral trade worth 32 billion dollars in 1993.    Last year Bill Clinton even stated that in 1994 MFN status  would only be granted in return for specific improvements in the  human rights situation.    The very least that can be said is that such improvements  are  far from evident. The government has released the half dozen  most famous dissidents (such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan) and  has refrained from locking them up again when they have made  statements or had meetings of which they disapprove. And that  is about it. At the same time, other arrests are continuing  throughout the country, in Tibet, and in the major cities. Most  significantly, the police blanket is weighing more heavily than  ever on those who are considered suspect, the foreign press  included. Eavesdropping on telephone conversations,  surveillance, pressure, and warnings are all part of everyday  life -- this very day a number of Asian journalists had their  residence permits withdrawn and were escorted to the airport.  The reasons for this "soft expulsion" are not known.    Close negotiations continued for several months, interrupted  by mutual visits, as if the White House were asking China  whether it would accept the "proposed" sanctions and Beijing  just was not interested.    Last Thursday [26 May] this same ambiguity was still to be  found. It was learned from the White House that the clause  would be renewed, but in order to save face Bill Clinton would  set up a "human rights secretariat" headed by his predecessor  Jimmy Carter and charged -- without having any actual powers --  with monitoring the situation in China. And then, immediately  afterwards, a very confident Chinese spokesman informed the  press that China "would accept no condition attached to its  (sic) status as most favorable nation" and "also rejects the  proposal for a joint committee to look at human rights problems  together."    The message was relayed from Beijing to Washington and these  cosmetic concessions disappeared: Clinton purely and simply  gave in. But why? First of all, although China sells much more  to the United States than it buys from it, the products it does  buy are vital to the survival of U.S. high-tech companies --  companies which are in competition with Europe, such as Boeing,  China's leading civil aviation supplier. Beijing, in the  position of arbiter, can count on a powerful industrial lobby to  defend its interest in the United States and in Europe.    China and the United States are also "competing" on the  important matter of stability in the Far East. With many  interests in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore,  Clinton feels that good relations with China as a growing power  are necessary to maintain its influence in the region.    Finally, initial reactions by dissidents to the announcement  of the MFN clause renewal show differences depending on whether  they are speaking from China or from abroad. Li Lu, a prominent  leader during the Beijing spring who is now exiled in the United  States, says he is discouraged and disappointed by the news.  The same opinion is shared by professor Wang Lizhi, also living  in exile. But inside the country, dissidents can be heard who  welcome the abandoning of any economic pressure. Such as Mrs.  Ding Ziling, a teacher, who feels that pressure of this kind has  been ineffective. Her views are all the more surprising when you  consider that her own son died under a hail of soldiers' bullets  during the night of 3 June 1989. But we must not deceive  ourselves, there are others in China who deplore the U.S.  retreat. It is just that they are not now in a position to  speak out -- such as the most famous of all the dissidents, Wei  Jingsheng, a notable opponent of the clause renewal.</p>

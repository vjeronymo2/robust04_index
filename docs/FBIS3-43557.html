			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] Natal Midlands  region has joined the chorus of criticism against Inkatha's  decision not to take part in the election. Midlands spokesman  Blade Nzimande says the decision is the most direct warning that  the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] way forward in the transition  process is going to be waging war in Natal.    Nzimande says the IFP decision, made at its Central  Committee  meeting yesterday, is the most serious threat to the transition  process. The Midlands spokesperson says what is even more  serious is the fact that the IFP is placing the fate of the  oppressed majority in the hands of the right wing.    Nzimande also says all those in Inkatha who are for national  liberation and democracy should abandon the IFP and join forces  with democracy.</p>

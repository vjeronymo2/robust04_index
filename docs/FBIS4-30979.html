			<p>BFN     [Text] In regard to recently frequented violations of the  Macedonian-Serbian border, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  representative for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Elizabeth Baldwin stated for the independent  A1 television "there is no immediate war threat, but there is an  increased activity of the Yugoslav Army in the border area and  cases of violations of the border are frequented." As for the  24 May incident near the November 40 observing post, she  informed a 21-men patrol of the Yugoslav Army halted the regular  UNPROFOR patrol (the Nordic battalion) and an argument broke  out. The Yugoslav troops informed the road on which the  UNPROFOR patrol was going was to be closed, thus, practically  disconnecting the two observing posts (November 40 and November  41) within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The road  is to be closed in two weeks and this is a in fact a warning to  UNPROFOR to withdraw from that part of the Macedonian territory.  According to Mrs. Baldwin, UNPROFOR disagreed with the Yugoslav  Army patrol and stated this clearly to them. UNPROFOR expects no  essential changes in their observing and informing activities in  this part of Macedonia in the future.    Meantime the paper VECER, citing several official sources,  reports the incidents on the Macedonian-Serbian border are not  calling for panics as such incidents happen on nearly most  borders. The reason for these incidents is formally explained  with no internationally verified agreement on the border, which  can be signed only after the two states mutually recognize each  other. Serbia still considers the border to be more of an  administrative than a border between two states. Serbian  authorities still use maps made on basis of measurements done  back in 1935, i.e., when the then existing Vardar regional unit.  [sentence as published] The same measurements were also used to  mark the territory of the Republic of Macedonia after the  liberation in 1945.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy The initial impression from yesterday's producer price and consumer credit figures is that both demand and price pressures are strengthening. On closer inspection, though, this conclusion looks flawed. Consumers are shedding some of their aversion to debt, but such a development follows naturally from the previously-reported recovery in retail sales. Besides, part of September's Pounds 489m increase in consumer credit reflects building society lending in connection with business expansion schemes as well as the stronger car market. Of more consequence is whether the momentum can be maintained. In the short run, the CBI's October distributive trades survey is disappointing. One interpretation of the flatter trend is that consumer appetites will only really be titillated by the kind of discounting which was prevalent in the summer but has since died away. That does not suggest a level of confidence able to shrug off the fiscal tightening which is already in train, let alone any further tax increases in the budget. But consumers' caution makes inflation less threatening. True, there is an upward drift to the annual rate of output price rises adjusted to exclude food, tobacco and petroleum. At the retail level, though, food price inflation should be dampened by competition among the supermarkets, while manufacturers' input prices are still falling. There would be room for rate cuts, if the chancellor has the courage to risk the blow to consumer confidence by raising taxes in the budget.</p>

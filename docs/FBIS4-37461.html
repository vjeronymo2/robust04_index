			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army says 1,300 Palestinian prisoners will  remain in Israeli jails because they would not sign a  declaration renouncing violence and terrorism. The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] spokesman said Israel has released about 3,400  prisoners, adding that a further 100 Palestinian criminals chose  to stay in Israeli prisons rather than be transferred to jails  in the Gaza Strip.</p>

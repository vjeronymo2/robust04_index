			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 10 TASS -- Preparations for the  upcoming elections to bodies of local government in Russia's  constituent republics and regions are just "a matter of  coordination between bodies of power and the population,"  according to Chief of the Russian president's staff Sergey  Filatov. He participated on Thursday in a hotline telephone  conference with regional leaders and heads of constituency  electoral commissions. The conference was held by the Central  Electoral Commission together with the presidential staff with  an aim to check whether subjects of the Federation were ready  for the forthcoming elections.    Theoretically, all issues pertaining to the polls have been  settled. But there are some facts provoking concern of federal  authorities, filatov noted. First of all, these are certain  breaches of citizens' voting rights, which have been already  mentioned in a resolution by the State Duma. Thus, many experts  point to improper "slicing" of constituencies. "There is some  doubting that in certain cases the apportionment was politically  motivated", the presidential staff's chief suggested.  Sometimes, segmentation into constituencies "was carried out  along ethnic lines, with distorted proportions in the number of  constituents and a shift towards rural areas," he noted.    Filatov urged regional leaders not to abuse their powers,  since at the moment they are "the only authorities in localities  and should always remember that executive and elected bodies of  power should be kept in balance." One must not "erect barricades  from the very outset of the election campaign," Filatov  stressed. If we build up confrontation between different  branches of government, reconciliation in the society will be  never achieved, he firmly believes.    Dwelling upon elections to bodies of local government, the  presidential aide noted that some regions did not understand  well enough what local government should look like. In this  connection, Filatov referred to the Constitution which  stipulates that local self-government is separated from bodies  of federal power. It is up to local residents to decide what  government they need. Local bodies of power should not be  unified. Regional specifics and traditions should be taken into  consideration.    Filatov stressed the need for a law to give a clear  definition for bodies of local government. He encouraged  participants in the telephone conference to come up with their  proposals on this issue, so that a draft law on local government  could be submitted to the State Duma. Some officials believe  that elections to bodies of local government should be postponed  until after an appropriate law is passed. Filatov said the  president was likely to issue a decree postponing the polls  until this autumn, as the public chamber proposed. As for the  regions which have settled all the problems in this field,  elections will be held at the discretion of local authorities  and residents.    Filatov also expressed concern over the population's  inertness in the election campaign. He called upon regional  leaders to "work for the highest possible turnout in the  upcoming elections".</p>

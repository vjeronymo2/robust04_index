			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pensions that damage your wealth - Why a top firm of actuaries is recommending a five-year ban on with-profits policies INVESTING in with-profits pension plans can damage your financial health, according to a leading firm of actuaries and consultants. Following extensive research, Bacon &amp; Woodrow has issued a report for private investors recommending an embargo on such policies. The ban, which B&amp;W expects to last at least five years, affects individuals who want to make single premium investments in personal pensions and other individual pension arrangements. The firm's advice might not, therefore, be appropriate for people holding long-term, regular premium contracts which could incur significant penalties if the premiums are stopped. In the report - examined in detail in April's issue of the FT's sister publication, Pensions Management - B&amp;W explains how it tracked the impact on underlying with-profits funds of excessive bonus payments from the mid-1980s to 1992. The report says a five-year period of drastic bonus cuts will follow so that funds can re-balance. Only when providers have put their houses in order will it be safe to consider the with-profits route again. B&amp;W warns, however, that even when this rationalisation is complete, the bulk of with-profits funds will fail to offer a real alternative to equity-based, managed, unit-linked funds. To support this argument, it cites the fundamental switch in the risk profile of with-profits contracts over the past 10-15 years. In fact, the two problems - the mis-match of bonus payments to investment returns, and the switch in risk profile - are linked directly. The original concept of the with-profits fund - which is invested mainly in equities, property and fixed interest - is to smooth investment returns by holding back some of the return during years of plenty in order to maintain a reasonable bonus rate in lean times. Premiums invested secure a modest but guaranteed maturity payment (the 'sum assured'), while profits are distributed through the bonus system. Annual (or 'reversionary') bonuses, once allocated, are guaranteed. For many years, the combination of sum assured and accrued annual bonuses formed the greater part of the final pay-out. An extra bonus was added at maturity. This final (or 'terminal') bonus was completely discretionary. The amount reflected the long-term capital appreciation of the fund not passed on previously through annual bonuses. Terminal bonuses are thus closer to the unit-linked concept, with a direct link between the performance of the underlying fund and the investor's return. On most policies nowadays, the final bonus can account for more than 50 per cent of the total payout, so narrowing the risk gap between with-profits and unit-linked contracts. The trend towards higher-risk, with-profits policies gathered pace during the period of exceptional investment returns in the 1980s, when market conditions and competitive pressures forced up bonus rates. But insurance company actuaries chose to achieve this via the non-guaranteed, terminal bonus while reducing the guaranteed annual declarations. Final payouts often remained unaffected or even improved. But while this structural change in the with-profits bonus system went virtually unnoticed during the bull markets, the chickens came home to roost when returns dropped sharply. And this is when the great cover-up began. Up to 1992, providers continued to declare unrealistically high bonus rates while actual returns fell sharply and, in one year at least, were probably negative. The B&amp;W report was produced by the firm's partnership pensions section. Its head, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, said this week: 'The smoothing process has been used to mask the reality over this period, but no smoothing process can continue to do this indefinitely if average returns are much lower than are necessary to maintain bonus rates.' In fact, cuts in the bonus rates are just one aspect of rationalisation. Individuals who leave early - either to transfer to another pension arrangement or take early retirement - receive an extra blow in the form of the 'market level adjuster.' This gives pension providers a free hand to reduce the value of funds when the contract is terminated early. Moreover, many providers have closed their traditional with-profits funds to new clients and offer a unitised version instead. But unitised with-profits funds do not offer a basic sum assured with a guaranteed minimum return to maturity. Instead, they offer a guaranteed return which can be varied from year to year, so watering down the long-term security of the contract. Following its analysis of these developments, B&amp;W recommends to private clients investing in individual pension arrangements that: No further single-premium contributions should be invested in with-profits funds for the moment. Contributions should be made to competitive, unit-linked managed funds (or in cash and fixed interest for those near retirement). Regular payments to with-profits funds should be maintained pending a review of the terms offered by the provider if contributions are stopped. People within five years of retirement should discuss with their financial adviser the possibility of crystallising existing bonuses by a transfer, or by taking the benefits early. (This will make sense only where the provider offers a good transfer value and does not impose early termination penalties.) Existing with-profits holdings should be reviewed in the light of likely cutbacks in bonus rates and the lower guarantees now offered by most contracts. Expert advice should be sought. But if with-profits personal pensions are excluded, where should you be investing your money? B&amp;W analysed managed unit-linked contracts and assessed pension providers on consistency of performance of their managed funds, good administration, and sound financial strength. Equally important, B&amp;W recommends only those providers that operate a low charging structure, incorporating nil-commission terms, and where the contract is free of hidden early termination penalties. As Warwick-Thompson explained: 'We felt it was vital that our clients should be able to take a transfer at any time or retire early without penalty.' From the firm's preliminary 'long list' of 14 providers, only four were awarded top marks on all criteria: Rothschild Asset Management, Standard Life, National Mutual and Scottish Widows. Warwick-Thompson stressed that people who have started a long-term, regular premium, with-profits contract should not act hastily. He added: 'In the long term, with-profits funds may still play an important role in the individual pensions market. However, even after the period of severe bonus cuts is over, it is important to understand the fundamental change in the risk profile of these contracts brought about by the greater dependence on terminal bonuses. 'If you need a high degree of security, you should consider a mixture of with-profits, cash and fixed-interest pension funds, particularly in the run-up to retirement. Younger investors looking for good long-term growth are likely to do better with a competitive, equity-based, managed unit-linked or unit trust fund.'</p>

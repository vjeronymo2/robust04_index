			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Tokyo police reported searching the offices and homes of a Japanese machinery  maker and its executives on suspicion that the company illegally exported  sensitive nuclear reactor material to East Germany. The firm, Prometron  Technics Ltd. of Tokyo, was suspected of exporting the material used for  nuclear reactor control rods on several occasions between 1986 and 1987 in  violation of international and domestic regulations. The material, known as  hafnium, is a rare metal substance. News reports said the hafnium, which the  firm imported from the United States, is used chiefly in military reactors  aboard nuclear-powered ships.  </P></p>

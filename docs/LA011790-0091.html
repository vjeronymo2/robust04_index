			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury sold $7.6 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 7.68%, up from 7.57% last week.  </P> <P> Another $7.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.54%, up from 7.44% last week. The rates were the highest since Dec.  26. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.94%  for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,805.90 and 7.95% for  a six-month bill selling for $9,618.80. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than their  face value.  </P></p>

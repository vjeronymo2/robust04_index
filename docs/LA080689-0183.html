			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: YOUNG TRIBUTE:  </P> <P> Leading alternative artists sing a collection of well-known and obscure Neil  Young songs on the newly released album "The Bridge." Among the acts  represented on the package distributed by Caroline Records: the Pixies, Soul  Asylum, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth and Victoria Williams &amp; the Williams  Brothers. A share of the proceeds will be donated to the Bridge School near San  Francisco, a special education facility for physically and mentally challenged  children that was founded by Young and his wife, Pegi.  </P> <P> Ringo Starr let all kids under 12 in for free at his recent concert in Dallas,  the start of his U.S. tour. No word if he's going to repeat the practice when  his tour touches down at the Pacific Amphitheatre on Sept. 2 and the Greek  Theatre the following night. . . . Ronnie James Dio selected a 17-year-old from  England, Rowan Robertson, as his new guitarist. . . . You've heard of  singer/songwriters -- how about roadie/songwriters? Jimmy Harnen co-wrote four  of the songs on his new album with members of his road crew. The roadies --  P.J. Williams and Tommy Owens -- aren't giving up their day jobs. When Harnen  goes out on tour to promote the album -- which includes the Top 15 hit, "Where  Are You Know" -- they'll be handling his equipment.  </P> <P> Carole King gives her '60s classic "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" a contemporary  twist in concert, doing a rap about the repercussions of unprotected sex. King  closes her 25-city tour with dates at the Pacific Amphitheatre on Aug. 16 and  the Universal Amphitheatre on Aug. 17.  </P></p>

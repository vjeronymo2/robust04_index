			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Judges 'plotted against Gardini' INVESTIGATIONS into Italy's political corruption scandal could take a new turn this week following testimony claiming Mr Raul Gardini, the entrepreneur who killed himself in July, was the victim of a plot between politicians and corrupt judges, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial intermediary who acted as go-between for Mr Gardini's Montedison group at the time of the Enimont chemicals joint venture with the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals concern, has allegedly accused Eni's then-management of colluding with Mr Diego Curto, a senior Milan judge. Mr Curto, arrested earlier this month, was responsible for the controversial November 1990 ruling to freeze Eni's and Montedison's shares in Enimont at a crucial stage in the battle for control of the public-private joint venture. The new allegations were made in a leaked 14-page document by Mr Cusani, in jail in Milan, to magistrates investigating Mr Curto on corruption charges. According to the leaks, Mr Cusani claims the decision to freeze the Enimont shares was made in collaboration with Eni and senior politicians to force Mr Gardini to sell out. A number of former Montedison executives now under investigation have claimed the share freeze was a deliberate signal to Mr Gardini from Italy's main political parties that his ambitions would be thwarted and that the only way to unblock the situation was to arrange a deal with Eni. Until then, Mr Gardini had waged a campaign to win control of the joint venture.</p>

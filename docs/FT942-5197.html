			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Shell/Montedison The European Commission's approval for their joint venture in plastics is probably more important to Montedison than to Royal Dutch/Shell. While the latter would dearly love to cement its position in polypropylene - one of the fastest-growing plastics - Montedison is counting on the opportunity to inject Dollars 2bn debt into the new company. That would help relieve pressure following the financial restructuring of its parent, Ferruzzi, last year. After three years of detailed planning, though, failure to gain approval this week would be a blow to both prospective partners. It is hard to see the joint venture as inherently anti-competitive. While it would account for about 24 per cent of European polypropylene capacity, prices are set in the world market. Imports of either raw plastic or simple finished goods would be sucked in if European prices were pulled out of line. Neither is Shell/Montedison's dominance in technology as threatening as it might first appear. About 70 per cent of world polypropylene capacity is based on technology licensed from Shell or Montedison, but alternatives are available. BASF, which bought ICI's polypropylene interests earlier this year, uses technology licensed from the UK company. Besides, the joint venture would encourage restructuring in an overcrowded market by reducing the number of producers and allowing overheads to be cut. On that view it is in the wider interests of the European chemicals industry that an acceptable deal can be struck.</p>

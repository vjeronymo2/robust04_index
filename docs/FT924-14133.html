			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Nameless body to save the public face of Japan's banks: A plan to relieve the burden of non-performing loans is near completion In a comment by Mr Atsushi Takahashi describing the proposed land buying body that is supposed to come to the rescue of Japan's troubled banks, 'We don't want it to seem a paper company, and then again we don't want it to be too large', the word 'seem' is one of the most important. Appearances are an important issue in the design of the new body, a task now close to completion. The banks wish it to convey the message that they are solving the problem of non-performing loans. These unsightly assets, gathered during the 'bubble' years of the late 1980s, will be transferred to the collectively run company and off the banks' books. Japanese banks argue that while these property-backed loans are a burden, the impact on the banking system and their balance sheets has been overstated. However, they are rushing to get the new body in place so that transfers can begin well before the close of the financial year in March. But there are serious doubts that the body - its formal name is yet to be decided - will achieve its stated aims. There are two objectives to the new body: to relieve the burden of non-performing loans; and stimulate the country's ailing property market, the weakness of which is one cause of that burden. It is unclear how long the burden of non-performing loans will limit the banks' lending ability and retard Japan's economic growth. Estimates of the size vary. At the end of March the finance ministry estimated a figure of between Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn (Pounds 39bn); Sumitomo Life Insurance, a leading Japanese financial institution, estimated Y22,000bn; while some analysts put the figure at Y50,000bn-plus. The ministry is revising its estimate for the half-year just ended, and its new figure is likely to be between Y10,000bn and Y12,000bn for the 21 leading banks. It will announce the figures later this month. The burden is certainly larger than the official figure suggests. Japan's definition of a non-performing loan is one on which interest has not been paid for six months, compared with the 90-day period used in US definitions. The official figures also exclude the problem loans held by bank affiliates, many of the so-called 'non-banks', who were large property-related lenders during the financial excesses of the late 1980s. In the worst case, the failure of a large regional bank or of an institution with close links to a leading bank could create a crisis of confidence in the banking system. While the banks concede they are weighed down by the non-performing loans, they have remained confident that a crisis will not arise. As Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's top corporate bank, confidently suggests, banks don't go bust in Japan. But banks with bad loans are limited in their ability to provide new finance to corporate customers, who are now unable to tap the equity market for funds. The weakness of the banks has itself cast a shadow over the stock market. Although the market recovered strongly in the summer from its lows of early in the year, it has started to look a little fragile in recent days. Japanese bankers insist that the scale of their problems is far less than that which caused the collapse of savings and loans institutions in the US. American experience has, however, been closely studied during the discussions in recent weeks over what form the land purchase agency should take. Interviews with a range of officials involved in the planning of the new body suggest that it may work something like this: Participating banks will provide capital for the agency and then give it concessional loans. These loans will provide the agency's working capital, and enable it to earn income from the gap between its cut-rate borrowing and its market-rate lending. Non-performing loans and the property used as collateral will be bought by the body as a package from a bank. The property will be valued by an 'independent' assessor, a process that the banks hope will set a floor for property prices, which have fallen almost 40 per cent over the last two years. Banks will write off the difference between the amount at which the transferred property is assessed and the value at which it is shown in their books. The new body will then begin the task of gradually selling the properties. Sumitomo Trust, a leading trust bank, says the whole process could take as long as 10 years; the amount of property to be sold is estimated at Y10,000bn. In carrying out this scheme, appearances are important in another way. The new body must be seen to be funded by the banks and not by the public. In reality, the Bank of Japan is likely to increase the amount commercial banks can borrow from it at cheaper rates on the understanding that the funds are pumped indirectly into the new company. As well as this indirect assistance, the banks would like tax concessions on write-offs from the Ministry of Finance. If things go terribly wrong, they would probably attempt to hold Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to his statement that he favours the use of public funds to support the banks. However, such support, for an industry popularly perceived to have pumped much money and air into Japan's financial bubble, would be very unpopular. Sumitomo Trust expects the body will be ready to begin taking on the troubled collateral by January, giving the banks plenty of time to shift assets off their balance sheets before the end of March. Standards set by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) require them to have capital equal to 8 per cent of their assets on this date. If all goes according to the banks' plans, the BIS's ratios will be met, non-performing loans and unsaleable property will be removed from their books, and they will benefit from a hoped-for recovery of the Japanese economy, which would itself push up stock and land prices. Such hopes may be overly optimistic. The banks admit that property market turnover is 'dead', and concede that prices still have a way to fall. Mr Kurosawa at the IBJ forecast a further 10 per cent fall, but another IBJ official said perhaps '20 or 30 per cent'. The government has promised to increase its land purchases over the next year, but there are few other willing buyers at present. The big private buyers of the past, particularly developers and ambitious manufacturers, are drawing up their own reconstruction plans. Instead of a neat, quick solution, there is likely to be a more long-drawn-out consolidation of the banking system. Some smaller financial institutions may disappear, while the larger banks will have to ensure their profitability by cutting costs and improving their risk management. And the new land purchase company may discover that it needs more than indirect government help. If the issue of direct government aid arises, there is likely to be an awkward public debate. As Mr Kurosawa says: 'Bankers are very unpopular now. We are like tax collectors in the days of Jesus.'</p>

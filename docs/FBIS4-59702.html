			<p>BFN     [Text] Officers from Jericho's Palestinian police force  said there were several stone-throwing incidents today and that  they immediately returned the situation to normal quiet, our  correspondent Moti Amir reports:    The Jericho police commander complained to the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] commander in the Jericho area that armed people  entered the town's synagogue. The IDF representative retorted  that under the agreement with the PLO, Israelis are permitted to  enter the synagogue armed.    Our correspondent Gil Litman reports from Jericho's ancient  synagogue that 50 students of the yeshiva which had operated  there, led by Knesset Member Hanan Ben-Porat, and including  several members of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, studied there at noon today. Porat  said he would try to make sure that the students remained there  overnight.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola set to close deal in Mexico COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks manufacturer, appears to have reached a deal with Fomento Economico Mexicana, under which the US group will acquire a large minority stake in the Mexican company's soft drinks division. Coca-Cola has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning in Mexico. Speculation last night suggested that details of the agreement would be revealed then, although Coca-Cola itself declined to comment. Femsa is Mexico's largest drinks company. Last month, it confirmed that Coca-Cola was seeking to buy between 30 and 49 per cent of the soft drinks division, which would then be spun off from Femsa and listed separately on the Mexican stock market. At that stage, Femsa and Coca-Cola were said to have reached agreement on a business plan for the new company, but the price which the US group would pay for its interest remained under negotiation. Analysts have suggested that Coca-Cola could pay as much as Dollars 500m.</p>

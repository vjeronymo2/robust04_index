			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / UK Company News: ICI falls to Pounds 364m and 5,000 more jobs to go ICI yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 down from Pounds 420m to Pounds 364m. Sales increased from Pounds 6.15bn to Pounds 6.34bn. The figures include a five-month contribution from Zeneca and six months from the nylon operations that have been sold to Du Pont of the US. Trading profits from continuing operations rose from Pounds 149m to Pounds 180m. Turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 4.17bn (Pounds 3.82bn). Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said he viewed the performance of his continuing businesses as solid. 'I think that our profitability relative to our competitors on the Continent is quite good. But in absolute terms it is not good enough.' Favourable currency rates added Pounds 50m to the results. A further Pounds 50m was added through the restructuring. Earnings for continuing business before exceptional items were 12.4p (11.2p). The interim dividend is 10.5p. ICI's shares advanced 16p to 666p. Zeneca, during its last five months within ICI, contributed Pounds 329m (Pounds 326m). Fibres suffered a Pounds 21m loss, compared with a profit of Pounds 13m. Total trading profit was Pounds 488m (Pounds 473m). Loan repayments from Zeneca allowed ICI to cut gearing from 33.4 per cent to 23 per cent, according to Mr Colin Short, finance director. Mr Hampel said that since the end of 1990, staff numbers had been cut by 22,000 and a further 5,000 would follow, not including the 5,000 who transferred to Du Pont. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said: 'The outlook continues to be uncertain in almost all the markets in which we operate, with the possible exception of the Asia Pacific area.' The industrial chemicals business lifted operating profits to Pounds 60m (Pounds 32m) on turnover up from Pounds 1.77bn to Pounds 1.89bn. The paints division reported trading profits of Pounds 50m (Pounds 61m) on sales of Pounds 856m (Pounds 814m). Weak demand in Europe and the US was offset by buoyant demand in Asia. Mr Hampel said a cash payment of Pounds 25m had been made to Lilly Industries when ICI had swapped its packaging coatings business for Lilly's industrial coatings operations. Materials raised operating profits by Pounds 2m to Pounds 13m on turnover up from Pounds 656m to Pounds 743m. Trading profits at the explosives division fell to Pounds 20m (Pounds 24m) on sales of Pounds 318m (284m). Regional businesses raised profits to Pounds 29m (Pounds 15m) on sales of Pounds 690m (Pounds 664m).</p>

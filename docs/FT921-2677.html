			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC and US 'upbeat' on air subsidy talks EUROPEAN COMMUNITY and US trade officials continue talks today aimed at ending their long-running row over aircraft manufacturing subsidies, following 'positive' discussions yesterday. Negotiators for the two sides refused to comment last night on details of the talks, but one US official said the mood was 'upbeat'; a Brussels official said it was a good sign the talks had focused on technical issues. 'When both sides are discussing technicalities, it's because they have the political consensus to go on.' The US and EC are trying to find common ground before their self-imposed deadline of the end of the month. If they succeed, the agreement will form the core of a new Gatt code on aircraft subsidies; but if they fail, the Gatt panel may have to rule on the dispute. The row revolves round American accusations that Airbus Industrie, the EC manufacturing consortium, received subsidies from EC governments, and Community counter-accusations that US manufacturers benefited from subsidies disguised as space or defence research grants. US negotiators are seeking EC pledges on cutting Airbus subsidies. The meeting has been looking at a German scheme under which the German partner, Deutsche Airbus, was protected from exchange rate fluctuations. The Gatt disputes panel has already condemned the scheme on the grounds that it constitutes an export subsidy.</p>

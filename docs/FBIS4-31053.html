			<p>BFN     [Text] In a letter addressed to the chairman of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Miro Lazovic, the Serbian Civic  Council proposed that the next session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly includes a debate about the strategy toward the Serbian  question and the constitutional position of the citizens of  Serbian ethnicity on the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation.    The Serbian Civic Council proposes that the amendment to the  constitution of the federation that was proposed at the last  session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly forms the basis for  the debate at the next session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly. The Serbian Civic Council believes that Legislation  Minister Kasim Trnka, one of the authors of the Constitution of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and one representative of the  Serbian Civic Council should speak about the position of the  Serbs within the federation. It would be imperative to obtain  the views and opinions of the constitutional commission of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and Government prior to the assembly  session, is stated in a letter of the Serbian Civic Council to  Miro Lazovic.</p>

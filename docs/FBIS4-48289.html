			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephane Bothma] </F>   [Text] Oman has placed an order for up to 24 long-range G6  155mm self-propelled artillery systems from Denel, JANE'S  DEFENCE WEEKLY reported. The order was part of a larger  programme to upgrade the Omani armed forces.    Oman became the second Middle East country to select the G6.  Abu Dhabi ordered 78 in 1990.    The G6 can fire an extended range full-bore projectile to a  range of 39km. A 155mm, 52 calibre version was being developed  with a range of more than 40km. The G6 is based on the  self-propelled G5.    Meanwhile, Denel subsidiary Kentron, which manufactures  missiles, would soon begin carriage tests of an enhanced variant  of the Darter infrared guided air-to-air missile, the U-Darter,  on the Northrop F-5 light-weight fighter aircraft.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cairns Group has been holding secret meetings.  Sources attending the meetings told EL OBSERVADOR that some  members reported that many developed countries are not  fulfilling their commitments to liberalize trade as agreed at  the end of the Uruguay round of GATT talks in April.    During the meeting members reproached each other for their  attitude during and after the Uruguay round of talks.    The sources added that during the Cairns Group meeting in  Montevideo on 19 and 20 May, some delegates claimed to have  reliable information on unfair trade practices, which were  thought to have been overcome but which are still being used.    Representatives of agricultural country agreed that the  failure to fulfill GATT agreements hurt the agricultural  countries that do not subsidize their products. Representatives  agreed on the need to follow developments in order to guarantee  respect for international agreements.    "The clause referring to subsidies for producers must be  supervised carefully. We must follow its implementation closely  to prevent its use against our interests," the Brazilian  delegate said during the secret meeting.    He added: "I have very clear information that some countries  will not fulfill their commitment to the Uruguay round of GATT  talks because their budgets will be affected. This is very  dangerous and we must be very careful."    Various speakers had similar complaints. They all agreed "to  follow" developments within the economic policies of other  blocs, seeking to detect failures to fulfill their agreements in  the area of agriculture.    The Argentine representative said "we must become a thorn in  the side of Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo; if we do not, the  Cairns Group could become a bureaucratic mess and disappear. We  must pack our bags, go there, and needle them."    The Uruguayan delegation indicated that "the schedules for  implementing the commitments of the Marrakech Declaration do not  coincide with our timetable," warning that "the implementation  of the Uruguay Round commitments must not be postponed."    The private sessions of the Cairn Group ministers meeting  did  not run in perfect harmony even though an attempt was made to  present a united front.    Argentina took advantage of the situation to criticize  members of the group that indulge in the practice of subsidies.  The innuendo was directed mainly at Brazil and Canada with whom  Argentina had a controversy regarding the trading of wheat.    The meeting's most tense moment came when Australian Trade  Minister Bob McMullan, who presided the sessions, implicitly  acknowledged that Australia had individually negotiated  agricultural matters with the United States and the EU [European  Union] without informing other Cairns Group members. The  situation is serious because Australia exercised the Group's  presidency during the Uruguay Round.    An Argentine petition to include in the agenda a common  strategy regarding a common agricultural policy motivated  McMullan's acknowledgement.    McMullan, notably perturbed, admitted that the document was  Australia's, but indicated that his country was still  negotiating with the United States and Europe and did not want  the Cairns Group to follow it up if the proposal did not have a  chance of being successful.    The topic was not discussed any more during the meeting but  several South American diplomats later commented that McMullan's  answer suggested a deceitful form of conduct by Australia and  highlighted the lack of a total cohesion within the group.    During the final secret session, the Australian  representative recommended that the delegations should exhibit  an image of internal consensus and imply that the Cairns Group  obtained concrete achievements during the Uruguay Round.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Keeping Sweden in the family / Analysis of the power of the Wallenberg empire If anyone thought the Wallenberg family's grip on corporate Sweden might have been weakened by the country's deepest recession since the 1930s, last week they learned otherwise. The country's most famous industrial dynasty signalled it was back on the offensive when Incentive, one of its key companies, launched a Pounds 600m (SKr8.4bn) bid for the investment group Cardo. A successful strike would give it control of Gambro, a medical equipment specialist and one of Sweden's fastest growing companies. The impact of this spectacular Wallenberg foray, after several quiet years, has been accentuated by the refocusing strategy just unveiled at Volvo, Sweden's leading industrial group. Volvo has abandoned the empire-building strategy of its former chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar. It no longer makes any pretence to being a counterweight to Wallenberg influence, as it was in the 1980s when the two titans were at each other's throats in their drive for corporate dominance. 'The Wallenbergs are relatively speaking in a much more dominant position today than they have ever been,' says one close observer of the family's activities. No doubt it will have given Peter Wallenberg, dynasty patriarch, considerable satisfaction that the Cardo bid came after Incentive had first snapped up a 44 per cent stake in the group from Volvo. Volvo used to be one of the few Swedish multinationals from which Wallenberg influence was excluded. Even that changed earlier this year with the appointment of two Wallenberg men to the Volvo board - including its chairman - following Mr Gyllenhammar's resignation last December. Today the only grouping that provides any sort of counterweight to the Wallenbergs is Svenska Handelsbanken, which through Industrivarden has big stakes in telecommunications giant Ericsson, forestry concern SCA and Aga, the industrial gas group. However, Handelsbanken's influence is modest by comparison. The scale of the Wallenberg empire is clear from the large number of Swedish blue-chips either directly controlled or influenced. One estimate suggests the family controls as much as 40 per cent of the Stockholm stockmarket or companies with total annual sales of SKr450bn. This strength is entrenched in a two-class share system which gives one class much bigger voting powers than the other. Hence Wallenberg companies can control 94.1 per cent of Electrolux, Europe's leading maker of white goods, with only 6.4 per cent of the capital. By contrast, foreigners, who have been huge buyers of Swedish shares in the last two years, gain only 2 per cent of the votes in Electrolux with 32.4 per cent of the capital. The Wallenbergs have shrugged off the Swedish recession and financial sector crisis much more quickly than anybody expected a year ago. In early 1993 Investor, the flagship holding company, was saddled with huge debts and losses within Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned automotive and aerospace unit. Many analysts felt a big sale would be needed - possibly the company's stake in high-flying pharmaceutical group Astra - to restore its battered balance sheet. The big sale never materialised. Debts were driven down sharply, but through a series of smaller disposals, which did very little to erode the group's overall voting power. At the year-end Investor's net debt had fallen to SKr4.85bn from SKr8.7bn. Further strengthening of the balance sheet came in March when the group launched a SKr3.45bn bid for its stablemate Export-Invest in what was essentially a giant share issue. Incentive's strike for Gambro emphasises a new Wallenberg strategy. It aims to shift the family's basic industry bias, through investments in forestry, engineering and so on, towards high-growth areas. Investor's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in TV4, Sweden's only commercial terrestrial television channel, is another example of this trend. More acquisitive moves will follow, but they will be accompanied by further streamlining as the Wallenbergs respond to intensified competitive pressures across their empire. The sheer range of their businesses, and the need to supply capital to them, will almost certainly force them to be more selective. They are, however, in much better shape to meet the challenge with many of their companies benefiting from restructuring and the weaker krona and with dividends flowing into Investor again on the back of corporate profitability. The question remains, can it be healthy for Sweden to have one family so dominating the corporate landscape? One commentator has suggested 'pluralism in Swedish industry is disappearing and that will influence corporate culture and leadership style'. Surprisingly, perhaps, Wallenberg influence does not stir much controversy because the family is widely admired for taking a long-term investment perspective. It is also respected for having avoided the speculative financial investments that characterised Sweden's bubble economy in the late 1980s. More recently, perhaps, a third factor has come into play. With foreigners owning 25 per cent of Swedish shares - more than double the level of two years ago - the Wallenbergs are seen as a stronghold against a foreign takeover of corporate Sweden.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                     THE WALLENBERG INFLUENCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------                    Capital (percent)        Votes (percent                 Wallenberg     Foreign   Wallenberg   Foreign  --------------------------------------------------------------- Asea                25.0        16.7      32.9        6.9 Astra               10.2        37.9      12.0       33.6 Atlas Copco         16.5        25.4      23.4       24.7 Electrolux           6.4        32.4      94.1        2.0 Ericsson            43.8         3.4      38.9        0.6 Esab                42.7         1.8      48.6        2.7 Incentive           28.7         5.2      37.6        1.5 Investor            24.2        10.2      41.0        4.7 OM Gruppen          20.9        12.5      20.9       12.5 SE Banken            8.0        19.9       8.1       20.2 SKF                 14.1        40.2      31.9        2.2 Stora               22.4        16.4      27.2        9.3  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: 'Owners and Power in Sweden's Listed Companies' by          Sven-Ivan Sindqvist  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

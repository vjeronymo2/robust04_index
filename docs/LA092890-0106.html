			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL WOULD OUTLAW GOP'S DONOR CHECK-OFF TACTIC  </P> <P> Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.) of the House Banking Committee introduced  legislation Thursday designed to outlaw a Republican fund-raising tactic he  says is deceptive.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent $25 checks  to a million prospective contributors. Fine print on the back of the checks, if  they are endorsed, authorizes the GOP committee to deduct $12.50 a month from  recipients' checking accounts.  </P> <P> Vento's act would amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to ensure that the  endorsement, cashing or deposit of a check cannot be used to authorize  automatic withdrawals from a checking account.  </P> <P> "If left unchecked this new bait-and-hook gimmick will become the scam artist  dream of the '90s," Vento said.  </P> <P> Democratic attorneys general in Alabama and Illinois have filed suit to stop  the Republican committee's solicitation. Republican attorneys general in  Wisconsin and Oregon and the Democratic attorney general in Minnesota have said  they were investigating the tactic.  </P> <P> Wendy Burnley, a spokeswoman for the Republican committee, said the  fund-raising letter accompanying the checks clearly explained that endorsing  them would authorize automatic withdrawals.  </P> <P> She said that only the first two withdrawals were mandatory, that further  withdrawals could be stopped and that a full refund could be obtained by  calling a toll-free number provided in the letter.  </P> <P> However, some recipients have complained that they did not realize that they  were authorizing deductions.  </P> <P> Burnley said the Republican committee has agreed to meet with state officials  objecting to the solicitations, after the election.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Democrats asked the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to halt  a Republican fund-raising scheme they said could illegally raise millions of  dollars for GOP Senate candidates.  </P> <P> The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asked the commission to stop the  Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, which already has disbursed about $1  million to dozens of candidates.  </P> <P> Republicans defend the Inner Circle as a legitimate joint fund-raising  operation exempt from contribution limits.  </P> <P> Federal law allows party committees to give candidates $17,500 and spend an  additional amount on their behalf according to individual state populations.  </P> <P> A federal judge last year ruled in a lawsuit filed by Common Cause that the  National Republican Senatorial Committee illegally funneled $2.7 million in  individual contributions to a dozen 1986 Senate candidates through a maneuver  known as "bundling."  </P> <P> The differences between the 1986 and 1990 operations "are no more than  cosmetic," the Democrats said.  </P></p>

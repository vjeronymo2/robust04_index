Authoritative sources cited Li Peng's speech at the national  work meeting on politics and law: The central authorities are  urging the departments of politics and law to study the history  and conditions of the formation of triad society inside and  outside China and to move to fight against it. Triad society is  a major force of disruption -- not only does it constitute an  element hostile to social order on its own but it will also be  able to collude with other hostile elements in the future. We  must mobilize all social forces to nip every kind of triad  society in the bud.</p>

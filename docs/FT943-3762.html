			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Strike hits car output in Brazil The main unions in Brazil's vehicle industry went on strike yesterday for an immediate pay rise, in the first serious threat to a wage freeze introduced under the government's anti-inflation plan. Production at all large factories, based in Sao Paulo state, was much affected. Union officials said nearly half their 150,000 members had stopped work yesterday morning. Autolatina, Brazil's biggest carmaker and a joint venture of Volkswagen and Ford, said production had 'almost totally stopped'. Anfavea, the car-makers' association, said that, if the strike lasted more than a few days, it would seriously disrupt sales because demand is high and stocks are 'non-existent'. Unions are calling for salaries to be increased monthly so as to make up for losses in purchasing power through inflation. Such monthly increases were common before the introduction, on July 1, of Brazil's new currency, the Real, under the anti-inflation plan. The government has now ruled that wage increases can only be granted once a year. Union leaders argue that official inflation indices show an 11.9 per cent increase since the new currency was launched. They also argue that a 1992 agreement by labour, car-makers and the government guaranteed monthly increases. Mr Ciro Gomes, the new finance minister, opposed a compromise by unions and car-makers which would have allowed a one-off pay increase. He said any rise had to wait until the unions' annual pay round in April. The government is concerned that, if car-makers agree to union claims, other sectors will push for regular pay adjustments. Any rise could also be inflationary since it would mean higher car prices and increased spending by workers. The government criticised the strike as 'political' and claimed it was designed to undermined the Real and the government candidate in the presidential election next month, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister who hatched the plan. The strike is led by metalworkers unions linked to the left-wing Workers' Party of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Mr Cardoso's main opponent. Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of the CUT union assembly, denied the strike was politically linked. See Sao Paulo survey</p>

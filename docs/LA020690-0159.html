			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SUCCESS 'A BURDEN' TO MCFERRIN  </P> <P> Success can have its drawbacks, says singer and Grammy award winner Bobby  McFerrin.  </P> <P> "It can be a burden," the soft-spoken McFerrin said. "People want you to repeat  what you've already done. You have to watch that you keep growing, stretching.  </P> <P> "I found myself getting bored," the San Francisco-based singer said. "I'd begun  to pander to the audience -- they wanted 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' and 'The  Wizard of Oz.' It was all getting too easy."  </P> <P> McFerrin and his 11-person all-vocal ensemble "Voicestra" are here preparing  for a sold-out concert Saturday.  </P> <P> "Don't Worry, Be Happy," was McFerrin's 1989 Grammy hit.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED IN SLAYING OF 2 STUDIO GUARDS  </P> <P> A former mental patient was ordered Friday to stand trial in the slayings of  two Universal Studios guards he reportedly said God told him to kill.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge Elva R. Soper ordered Nathan N. Trupp, 42, to stand  trial after a one-hour preliminary hearing in which a security guard and a  sheriff's deputy described the Dec. 1 shootings and recounted Trupp's  explanation.  </P> <P> Soper ordered Trupp to be arraigned Thursday on charges that he killed Jeren  Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles after they  had turned him away from Universal Studios.  </P> <P> Trupp is also accused in the slayings of three people in a bagel shop near  where he lived in Albuquerque, N. M., two days before the Universal Studios  killings. The Los Angeles case will proceed first.  </P> <P> Authorities said Trupp opened fire on the guards at Universal's main gate  shortly after they turned him away when he asked to see actor Michael Landon.  </P> <P> Abelardo Solarez, another guard, testified Friday that he saw Trupp pacing  Lankershim Boulevard near the studio entrance. Then Trupp casually approached  the two guards, pulled a gun and opened fire without breaking stride, Solarez  said. The guard said Trupp shot Beeks three times and Torres once before  walking back to Lankershim, then west on Bluffside Drive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fired a Shot  </P> <P> Solarez said he began following Trupp but then saw a sheriff's car, which he  flagged down. Deputy James Campbell said he and Solarez followed Trupp a short  distance but when the deputy stopped the car to talk to Trupp, the suspect  fired a shot at him.  </P> <P> Campbell, unhurt, threw himself to the ground and shot Trupp in the side and  arm. Campbell and Solarez testified that as they waited for paramedics to  arrive, Trupp repeatedly talked of the shooting and asked the guard and deputy  to kill him.  </P> <P> "He kept saying that someone sent him to kill the two guards," Solarez said. "I  asked him who it was and he said, 'God.'  </P> <P> "He wanted us to finish him off because he was in pain. He said, 'Kill me, kill  me, it hurts.' He was crying at the time."  </P> <P> Authorities said Trupp was under the delusion that the victims killed in  Albuquerque, the two guards and Landon -- star of the TV series "Highway to  Heaven" -- all were Nazis conspiring against him.  </P> <P> Trupp, who was treated at a New Jersey mental institution in 1988 and at a  Maryland institution in the early 1970s, was originally ruled mentally  incompetent to stand trial. However, in June a Superior Court judge held that  treatment with drugs and therapy had restored his competency.  </P> <P> In court Friday, Trupp sat calmly, handcuffed to a chair, and did not speak.  </P></p>

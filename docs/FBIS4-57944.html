			<p>BFN     [Text] Still within the framework of enforcing the embargo  against Haiti, eight U.S. warships are crisscrossing one another  offshore. Six U.S. Coast Guard ships have also been  crisscrossing off Haiti in an effort to intercept Haitian boat  people. The eight U.S. warships in charge of enforcing respect  for the embargo are supported by frigates from the Canadian and  Argentine navies.    Last Saturday and Sunday, according to the Pentagon, the  U.S.  Navy fired warning shots twice at ships that were ignoring the  orders of the ships that are enforcing the embargo. One of the  ships succeeded, however, in reaching the Haitian coast.</p>

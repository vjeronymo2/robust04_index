			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: BA 'needs 600-seat superjumbo' BRITISH AIRWAYS is putting increasing pressure on commercial aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing of the US and the European Airbus partners, to develop a new 600-seater superjumbo aircraft for delivery around the turn of the century. Mr Alistair Cumming, BA's director of engineering, told a Financial Times aerospace conference at the Dubai Airshow that BA needed such a large aircraft to reinforce its global strategy. Increasing airport congestion, especially at BA's home base of London Heathrow, could severely handicap the airline's future, Mr Cumming warned. 'So much so that we have concluded that we will only be able to satisfy future traffic demands and maintain market share on intercontinental routes with larger aircraft,' he explained. Boeing is currently studying with the four Airbus partners, British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain, possible joint development of a superjumbo. Both the US company and Airbus are also conducting separate studies of their own for a large aircraft. But in the worst post-war recession in the airline market, manufacturers are reluctant to commit themselves on a programme expecting to cost well over Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in research and development. However, Mr Cumming said manufacturers 'had to listen' to their customers and their future equipment requirements. The consolidation of the airline industry around a number of giant airline groups was likely to change the relationship between airlines and manufacturers, giving a few big airlines a much greater voice in future product decisions than in the past. 'If you put BA and all its airline partners together you are talking of. . . about 1,000 aircraft of 40 different types,' he said. There was likely to be some rationalisation of this global fleet in the shorter term but in the longer term, as BA develops its integrated global airline system, there would be a huge aircraft re-equipment need for the group which could potentially involve as much as Dollars 50bn of procurement, he said. BA is building up its integrated global system through its equity partnership in US Air, Qantas and some smaller European carriers. Other airlines are also forming global groups expected to seek to rationalise their fleets and eventually re-equip them on a more integrated basis. BA has already established a special study team to work with airframe manufacturers to help design a superjumbo. Initial designs envisage a 600-seat multi-deck aircraft in which the different levels, including the underfloor belly, could be used by passengers. 'Designs also allow for a quick change of cabin configurations because, in a global airline, an aircraft travelling predominantly westbound re-quires a daytime atmosphere, while one flying eastwards requires a configuration more suited to rest and sleep,' Mr Cumming explained. With the new large aircraft BA is seeking a 20 per cent cut in operating costs compared with the Boeing 747 through better fuel efficiency, longer service life and reduced downtime.</p>

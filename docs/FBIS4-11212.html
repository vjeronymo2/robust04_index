			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raul Kollmann] </F>   [Text] "The Communist Party will not live forever." With  this sentence one of the main PC [Communist Party] leaders  suggested there is an ongoing process to dissolve the party in  order to be reborn as a new leftist faction within the Grand  Front. The basic objectives are three: rejuvenate the Communist  identity, which has always been associated with the former  Soviet Union's model; reduce the target for the government's  strong McCarthyism, which had an impact inside the front; and  concentrate on the development of the Grand Front -- not as a  party -- taking into account the notable result of the 10 April  election. This new force would present a battle on programs  within the Grand Front "to defend leftist positions." PAGINA 12  spoke with PC national and federal district leaders. In both  cases the leaders consulted spoke about the same schedule for  reconversion: "six months at the most."    According to the party's jargon, the PC's transformation is  defined as "the establishment of a political movement within the  Grand Front." The partners in the PC's refounding would be some  former leaders of other factions within the Grand Front --  People's Encounter members and trade unionists affiliated with  the Grand Front -- who would propound a congress for launching  the party's refounding.    A leader close to PC General Secretary Patricio Echegaray  said: "We are not disguising ourselves under false colors. The  progressive space has become wider with the 10 April elections,  and this would not only entail a change of name but also  constitute a way of strengthening a left-wing trend within the  Grand Front."    [Kollmann] Has the offensive against the Grand Front for  having included the PC had a bearing on this refounding?    [Echegaray] It is true that some leaders were ill at ease  because, as they contended, there were no Communists among the  front ranks of the FG [Grand Front] ticket. Anyhow, it was  precisely during the McCarthyist campaign when voters massively  turned to the FG. Therefore, it is possible to state that  nobody opted to vote for other parties instead of the FG on  account of our presence. There are those who argue that the FG  wants to expel us, but not a word has ever been said to that  effect. The process that is about to start has nothing to do  with McCarthyist pressure.    [Kollmann] Buenos Aires City Communists -- who are the most  enthusiastic about dissolving the PC to establish a new movement  -- recall two recent events that strained relations within the  Grand Front: Echegaray was to have stood as a FG candidate in  the Constituent Assembly elections, but FG leaders vetoed his  candidacy. Following a tense meeting at the Communist Central  Committee, the party acquiesced to the FG's demand and Echegaray  was replaced by Eduardo Barcesat, who was then elected to the  Constituent Assembly. The other conflict arose from the calling  of a PC rally to close the election campaign last 5 April.  Buenos Aires Communist leaders opposed the rally and some of  them did not even go to the Swiss House, where the meeting took  place. From the viewpoint of Buenos Aires PC leaders,  refounding the party would constitute a way of putting an end to  those comings and goings and putting one's shirt on the Grand  Front.    The other thorny issue still pending is the FG platform.  Echegaray's entourage gave vent to their annoyance with the  economic and methodological statements made by Carlos "Chacho"  Alvarez during two interviews published by PAGINA/12. One  Central Committee members explained: "We do not agree with that  but, precisely, the establishment of a left wing within the FG  will enable us to wage the platform battle." Buenos Aires  Communists interpret things differently: "Echegaray should not  tolerate Chacho's speaking about repaying [as published] the  external debt or accepting privatizations. We believe the party  should be dissolved to establish a new movement, and that  positions should be changed. It is no longer possible to speak  about defaulting on external debt payments."    Both Central Committee and Buenos Aires Committee members  are  of one mind about the fact that the process they are about to  undertake may cause a rift within the party. They foresee that  "there are some stick-in-the-muds who will cling to their old  views, and there is no way they can see the political reality  any other way. In any case, they are a minority." Other PC  leaders have a different diagnosis: "The party's transformation  will by no means be easy. It will meet fierce opposition, but  this is the only way out."</p>

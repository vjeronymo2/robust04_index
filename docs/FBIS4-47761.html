			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 2 SAPA -- Vote counting pressed ahead in  KwaZulu/Natal on Monday afternoon behind schedule, amid  predictions that a final tally could be delivered by Tuesday  afternoon.    Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Spokesman Glenn  McDougall said staffers from counting stations which had  completed their tally would be moved to slower stations to beef  the process up.    He said Durban was among the slowest stations, because of  its  late start after a labour dispute on Saturday. By late  afternoon, over 600,000 votes had been counted in KwaZulu-Natal,  but this represented only about 12 per cent of the total ballot.  At this stage the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] led the electoral  race with 53 per cent.    But the African National Congress was still confident of a  victory in the province, saying support would swing in the  party's favour as counting drew to a close. The ANC had 30.7  per cent at the time. Spokesman Themba Rubushe said he was  confident the ANC would gain more than 50 per cent of the vote.  "We expect to come back comfortably."    IFP Spokesman Peter Smith said it was still too early to  predict the outcome of elections in the province, with a  relatively small percentage of the regional vote counted.    Meanwhile, the counting process in Natal was labelled as  "chaotic", by the National Party's [NP] Natal InFormation  Chairman Renier Schoeman. "It's thumb suck. In KwaZulu/Natal  there is an endless irritation about the way (counting) has been  handled. This is gross inefficiency." He said the current  figures were "mickey mouse" and did not reflect even remotely  what his party would achieve when counting was completed. At  the time the NP enjoyed just over nine per cent support in the  province.    The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], which emerged with two  per  cent of the provisional results on Monday afternoon, boasted it  would win as much as five per cent support in KwaZulu/Natal.  Spokeswoman Siphiwe Sithole said the PAC -- not recognised as  much of a contender in the regional race -- had benefited from  rural support because of its land policies.    The PAC was on Monday afternoon ahead of the Democratic  Party  [DP], which was largely expected to pick up good support in this  historically progressive province. But it had 1.7 per cent on  Monday afternoon.    Following the DP in sixth position in KwaZulu/Natal was the  Freedom Front with 1.1 per cent.</p>

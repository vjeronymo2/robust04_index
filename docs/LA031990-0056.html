			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT / MIDWEST REGIONAL AT INDIANAPOLIS;  </P> <P> GEORGETOWN, PURDUE JOIN RANKS OF STUNNED TEAMS;  </P> <P> TEXAS: BOILERMAKER COACH CRITICIZES OFFICIATING AFTER TRAVIS MAYS MAKES TWO  FREE THROWS WITH SEVEN SECONDS LEFT TO GIVE LONGHORNS A 73-72 VICTORY.  </P> <P> While Texas celebrated its 73-72 upset victory over No. 10-ranked Purdue Sunday  in the second round of the NCAA Midwest Regional, Boilermaker Coach Gene Keady  launched into an obscenity-laced tirade against the officiating.  </P> <P> "We've got good kids who work hard and they're in there crying their eyes out  because we've got guys (officials) who don't understand the game," he said.  </P> <P> Travis Mays knew exactly what he had to do when he stepped to the free-throw  line with seven seconds left. He made two free throws and then Guillermo Myers  blocked a shot as time ran out, sending Texas into the regional semifinals in  Dallas Friday against No. 25 Xavier (Ohio), which upset No. 8 Georgetown,  74-71.  </P> <P> Mays' shots hit nothing but net despite hoots and howls from a mostly Purdue  crowd of 40,000 at the Hoosier Dome.  </P> <P> "When I got to the free-throw line I wasn't nervous at all. I thought I was  going to knock them down," said Mays, who committed a turnover on the previous  Texas possession.  </P> <P> "I was nervous when the ball went out of bounds (on the previous possession). I  was just hoping we could regain possession."  </P> <P> Mays grabbed his own missed shot and was fouled as he went back up. Tony Jones,  who missed a three-point attempt with 25 seconds left, then drove the lane only  to encounter Myers, who knocked away Jones' jumper.  </P> <P> "We've been coming from behind all year long and somebody always has to come up  big," Texas coach Tom Penders said.  </P> <P> It was the second loss in eight days for Purdue, which lost a chance to tie  Michigan State for the Big Ten championship, 72-70, the previous Sunday.  </P> <P> Keady, who didn't say he was upset about anything in particular, was just angry  about the officiating in general.  </P> <P> "People cheat and you can't get calls," he said. "They charge and you don't get  calls.  </P> <P> "The same thing happened in the Michigan State game. It gets old. We run a  program, graduate all your kids, you don't cheat. You do things right and the  referees are all the same."  </P> <P> The Longhorns (23-8), who trailed, 56-47, with 12 minutes left, capitalized on  missed free throws and Purdue turnovers.  </P> <P> The Boilermakers (22-8) missed the front end of three consecutive one-and-one  opportunities while the Longhorns kept getting closer.  </P> <P> A jump shot by Joey Wright, who led the Longhorns with 20 points, gave Texas  its first lead of the second half, 69-68. The lead changed hands three times  before Mays, who finished with 16 points, made the free throws.  </P> <P> Stephen Scheffler led Purdue with 18 points. But he was ineffective against the  aggressive, physical Texas defense, making only six of 16 shots. But he  finished his career with a shooting percentage of .686, breaking the NCAA  record of .678 set by Steve Johnson of Oregon State.  </P> <P> Scheffler made two free throws to put Purdue ahead, 72-71, with 1:47 remaining.  The Boilermakers then seemed to have the victory when Mays dropped the ball and  it went out of bounds with 1:22 left. Purdue was unable to get the ball inside  before Jones put up his shot from three-point range.  </P> <P> Jones couldn't get his last shot past Myers.  </P> <P> "I saw an opening, tried to penetrate and took it," Jones said, adding that he  didn't feel any contact from Myers.  </P> <P> Lance Blanks scored 19 points for Texas before fouling out with 1:47 left.  </P> <P> The Boilermakers, playing patiently on offense as opposed to the Longhorns'  run-and-gun style, built a 35-33 lead at halftime following two free throws by  Jones with 51 seconds remaining.  </P></p>

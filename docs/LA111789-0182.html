			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> REDGRAVE DAUGHTER SPEAKS OUT  </P> <P> As the child of the outspoken Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson found the  easiest thing was to keep her opinions to herself, steering clear of the  controversy that surrounded her mother.  </P> <P> But with an increasing profile of her own that may have to change, the  26-year-old actress says in the December issue of Mademoiselle.  </P> <P> "It was hard growing up and seeing all this press against your mother,"  Richardson said. "I'd be sitting next to a girl in chemistry, and she'd say,  'Your mother's a commie.' "  </P> <P> But her roles in "Fat Man and Little Boy," which deals with the making of the  atomic bomb, and in "The Handmaid's Tale," about a make-believe society that  executes women who have abortions, have forced Richardson to speak out.  </P> <P> "I'm not a feminist in any way at all, at all. But the abortion issue is  different. When men say that women shouldn't be allowed to choose. . . . It  just makes my blood boil," said the actress, whose father is director Tony  Richardson.  </P></p>

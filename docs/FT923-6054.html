			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Tornados to record military activity in south Iraq BRITAIN IS sending six Tornado aircraft to the Gulf today to help enforce the allied 'no-fly' zone in south Iraq. Three will be equipped with television cameras to record Iraqi military activity against the Shia rebels in the south of the country. The pilots and navigators, including some who served in the Gulf war, left the UK yesterday with logistic support equipment and supplies. They are to monitor the region south of the 32nd parallel for both aircraft movement, banned under the 'no-fly' zone rules, and for military action against the Shias. They will not try to prevent ground attacks that Iraq might launch on Shias. Television recordings taken of any attacks will be presented to the UN Security Council and some might be made public. The allies will, however, take 'appropriate action' to prevent breaches of the 'no-fly' zone. The six Tornado aircraft should arrive in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, by 3pm today, just 30 minutes before the 'no-fly' zone comes into effect. Dhahran is 600km south of the main Shia region. Three of the aircraft are Tornado GR1 reconnaissance aircraft which will fly 'at medium height' - above 20,000ft. They are equipped with TIALD - thermal imaging and laser designating - observation equipment used in the Gulf war. This time they will also be fitted with television cameras accurate enough, for example, to pick out the number of wheels on a road vehicle. The other three are Tornado GR1A bomber aircraft fitted with sensors designed for low-level flying. They will be used in conjunction with French Mirage 2000 and US fighter aircraft, possibly F15s and F16s. All three countries co-operate on patrols over the Kurdish region of Iraq, north of the 36th parallel, where a 'no-fly' zone already applies. UK defence experts said yesterday that Iraqi aircraft flew over the southern region as recently as Tuesday. They said that Iraq was also involved in heavy construction work in the region but that it was not possible to tell whether this was a canal being dug to drain the marshland in which the Shias are based, or if a road was being built to take heavy armour deep into this difficult terrain. The construction might be preparation for an Iraqi push into the marshlands within days. One source said Iraq had attacked the region roughly once a month since spring 1991 and the last such sortie took place at the end of July. More than 75,000 men from 10 Iraqi divisions are based around the Shia area.</p>

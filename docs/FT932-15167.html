			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / VAT may finance US health plans VALUE added tax is back as an option for financing the Clinton administration's healthcare reform plan, senior US officials said yesterday. Ms Alice Rivlin, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, told a Washington conference that VAT or some other form of national sales tax was 'clearly a possible candidate' for financing the overhaul of the healthcare system. 'Certainly, we are looking at a VAT,' added Ms Donna Shalala, health and human services secretary, interviewed by the newspaper USA Today. VAT, common in most other developed countries, is backed by several US senators and seen by others as inevitable in the long run. Most advocates, however, have argued it should be introduced as part of a comprehensive reform of the US tax system, in place of a considerable portion of the revenue now raised from income taxes. President Bill Clinton said two months ago that he did not want to complicate his economic plan with such a radical change as the introduction of VAT, ruling the idea out for at least the next four or five years. White House officials have also said in recent weeks that VAT had been explicitly ruled out as a way of financing the healthcare reform. But Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House spokesman, confirmed yesterday that the idea of VAT was again under consideration, although Mr Clinton had made no decision. White House officials say at least 20 different tax options are still on the table for financing the healthcare reform, with 'sin taxes' on alcohol, tobacco and guns especially favoured because they curb unhealthy habits that burden the medical system. Ms Rivlin said yesterday that a national VAT had 'a good deal to recommend it' because of the US need to boost investment rather than consumption. On the other hand, it would be regressive in its impact, and could also hurt states' revenues from local sales taxes. A White House task force is still at work on the administration's healthcare reform plan, expected to be completed in mid-May. The core goals of the reform plan are to ensure all US citizens have some form of health coverage and a guarantee that this not be jeopardised if they change jobs or become sick. All that is almost certain to cost the government a great deal more than the current system, where most people have health insurance provided by their employer. At least in the short term it will prove expensive to extend coverage to the estimated 37m people who have no employer-provided health insurance but do not qualify for the government's Medicaid or Medicare schemes, which cover the poor and the elderly. Over the longer term the administration hopes that the reforms will pay for themselves by bringing medical costs under control. Administration officials say the outlines of their plan include a health security card that would guarantee every citizen access to a standard package of health benefits.</p>

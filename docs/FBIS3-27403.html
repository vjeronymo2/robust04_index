Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between  China  and Brunei Darussalam, friendly relations and cooperation  between the two nations have developed smoothly. In particular,  your successful state visit to China last year elevated  relations between the two nations to a new stage.    I am confident that friendly relations and cooperation  between the two nations, China and Brunei Darussalam, which were  established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence, will be further developed.    May the State of Brunei Darussalam prosper and its people be  happy.    [Signed] Jiang Zemin, president of the People's Republic of  China.    [Dated] 22 February 1994.</p>

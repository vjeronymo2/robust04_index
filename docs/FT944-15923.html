			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Property: Country life - in town - Winter can sour that romantic rural idyll. Gerald Cadogan has an alternative When winter comes, romantics living in the English countryside often find that life in a picturesque village or down a long lane has severe drawbacks. You can be blocked in by snow for days at a time. And you must drive substantial distances to reach the services you need, from doing the shopping to visiting a library or the doctor. Drivers can clock up 20,000 miles a year like this - often in treacherous conditions. Thus, those experienced in country ways tend to reject homes in remote areas in favour of old market towns where all the advantages of country life exist and a substantial house is often cheaper than a village rectory or farmhouse of the same size. Mud-free and comfortable, these properties are just too sensible to be ignored - as older people, in particular, appreciate. But the Barbour and wellie brigade, looking for the 'real' country, has virtually ignored them. The prices tend to reflect it. Many of them date from the 18th century when England settled down after the civil and religious strife of the 17th century. As prosperity spread, the middle classes built homes to show their improved position. Sometimes, this involved adding a box-like, large-windowed Georgian facade to a Tudor or medieval gabled house. Such places have a comfortable, reassuring feel. Here, then, is a selection of good country-town houses. Generally, they are Georgian, with walled gardens of manageable size. WALES: Cantre Selyf is a substantial Georgian house in the centre of Brecon with a walled garden big enough to keep all the family busy when not walking in the Beacons. Its asking figure looks particularly attractive compared with similar houses in England. Price: Pounds 200,000. Agent: Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. SUFFOLK: Bury St Edmunds is a cathedral town with wide streets (and the Georgian Theatre Royal) in the East Anglian region. No 17 Westgate Street is large, Georgian and built of red brick, with a separate access from Friars Lane. Price: Pounds 395,000. Agent: Bedford. COTSWOLDS: You do not expect houses to be cheap in Chipping Campden, especially if they are two knocked into one with a total of eight bedrooms and Corinthian pilasters on the front. Bedfont &amp; Woodward House reflects the wealth of the wool merchants who built it 250 years ago. Price: around Pounds 950,000. Agents: KFR, James Martindale or Savills. EAST SUSSEX: Lewes is among my favourite towns, with its smart houses on the high ground along the High Street, dominated by the castle. Down below, Southover used to be a separate village before being absorbed into the main town. Southover Cottage, in Southover High Street is a good example of the traditional Sussex style of building, which involves a cladding of hanging tiles on the upper floor, Yet, it was put up as recently as 1920. Price: Pounds 225,000. Agent: Humberts. In the same street, The Gables was the main Tory coffee house in 1800, a time when Lewes returned two MPs to Westminster. Price: Pounds 375,000. Agents: Rowland Gorringe or Humberts. HAMPSHIRE: Lymington is famous as a centre for sailing. No 5 Quay Hill is a bow-fronted town house facing on to a cobbled pedestrian street. Price: Pounds 190,000. Agent: John D. Wood. The same agent is also selling 24 Church Lane, an end-of-terrace, grade II cottage. This still has an outside lavatory - besides, of course, the one in the house. Price: Pounds 90,000. In the large village of Wickham, near Southampton, two stately 18th century houses on The Square, both in blue brick with red-brick trim, are for sale. Wickham House (Pounds 410,000) is offered by Lane Fox while Havelock House (Pounds 275,000) is on the books of John D. Wood. LEICESTERSHIRE: Oakham is the county town of what used to be Rutland and has a public school, a market twice a week and a splendid, 12th century castle. Yule House is a classic example of a town house that began as a cottage. Then, an imposing Queen Anne front was added and, eventually, a Victorian bay. Probably the best house in town, it was for a long time the lodgings for the visiting judge who conducted the local assizes. Today, it is listed grade II*. Price: Pounds 375,000 (down from Pounds 395,000). DEVON: White Hart House in Okehampton is a medieval property with much of its original architecture surviving. Indeed, it was once a pub, as the name suggests. Now, it has plenty of bedrooms, an adjoining listed barn and views of Dartmoor from the overgrown garden. Price: Pounds 135,000. Agent: Millerson. HERTFORDSHIRE: At Sawbridgeworth, a bijou white house by the old bowling green and the church is for sale. Trevarthen is basically late-17th century, but it was improved with a Georgian Gothic front early in the 1800s. Price: Pounds 325,000. Agent: Mullucks Wells. DORSET: Sherborne is a delightful town noted for its abbey, castle and schools. The Red House in Long Street, listed grade II*, is a red-brick gem with a stone trim and dates to around 1700. It is among the best houses in town. Price: Pounds 485,000. Agents: Humberts or Michael de Pelet. The same agents offer St George's which, not surprisingly, is Georgian and on the edge of the town with a small paddock behind the garden. Price: Pounds 265,000. LINCOLNSHIRE: Spalding, Britain's home of bulbs, straddles the river Welland. No 8 Welland Place, yet another Georgian house, is on the south side. The asking figure looks especially attractive. Price: Pounds 98,500. Agent: Carter Jonas. NORTH YORKSHIRE: In York, a late-18th century brick house is on the market. It has a bowed back wing added about 1830, and a studio in the walled garden. No 8 Clifton is just five minutes' walk from the centre of town and the minster. Price: offers over Pounds 295,000. Agent: Jackson-Stops. Nearby is 22 Clifton Green, a superior cottage dating to 1839 at the start of the Victorian Gothic style. Price: Pounds 210,000. Agent: Carter Jonas. Jackson-Stops also offers 127 The Mount, a Regency villa that is slightly further out but close to the racecourse. Price: Pounds 325,000.

			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The burgeoning presidential campaign of  Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac was discussed  in the French press.  <H5>  Chirac Delays Announcement of Candidacy </H5>   According to Gilles Bresson writing in the 9 May Paris daily  LE MONDE, Chirac is profiting from the drop in Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur's popularity, which is affording him a margin  of maneuver he had been unable to achieve since last summer. A  "pragmatic" Chirac who is "ill at ease in the domain of ideas"  is at tempting to give the impression he can "offer a dream" by  affirming that he is working on a program out lining the France  of the year 2000, Bresson wrote. This initiative is supposed to  lend him the "aura of a visionary" and elevate him above the  other candidates and Edouard Balladur who, according to Chirac,  "still has his hands in the grease." The RPR leader has decided  to reveal his vision of the future piecemeal during his trips to  the provinces, a move allowing him to dominate headlines in  local papers and television news for months. When Balladur was  high in the polls Chirac had planned to go on the offensive by  unveiling his entire program at the end of June. He has now  decided against this strategy for fear of moving too soon.  Bresson quoted a close Chirac aide as saying that "Chirac is  afraid of declaring himself a candidate at the wrong time and  trusts no one." Chirac is currently courting centrists by  accepting Dominique Baudis as head of the majority list for the  European Parliament elections and making overtures to his  partners, such as his promise to consider centrist Pierre  Mehaignerie for prime minister if he were elected president.  Chirac aides are also recruiting French Democratic Union (UDF)  deputies, who would give official support to a Chirac candidacy.  <H5>  Chirac Choices Assessed </H5>   Chirac is facing a number of decisive choices, Frederic  Gerschel writes in the 12 May Paris weekly PARIS MATCH. The  first is finding a "propitious" time to declare his candidacy,  which could be at the beginning of September. However, a number  of his aides argue that a premature disclosure could favor  Balladur, who has long maintained he will not discuss the issue  before January 1995. Gerschel cited a Chirac aide as saying  that "Balladur will entertain ambiguity as long as possible  because he knows that a declared candidate immediately becomes  suspect." A second choice centers on the attitude Chirac must  adopt. Chirac wants to be seen as above "pedestrian" matters,  to put the finishing touches on his image as a politician  concerned with major problems. A third focuses on the program  he will present to the French people. Chirac has set up a group  of about 60 experts and parliamentarians to formulate proposals.  Unemployment will be a major issue, Gerschel noted, citing  Chirac's entourage as declaring that the difference between  their man and Balladur may well reside in "the primacy of the  social field over the economic." While Balladur has maintained  that one should not get caught up in such a debate because  "there is no social progress without a strong economy," Chirac  has been advocating a "new social contract that would break with  the status quo." Noting that Chirac has twice "rendered homage"  to Philippe Seguin, the declared adversary of the prime  minister's economic policies, Gerschel concluds that a possible  Chirac-Seguin ticket is increasingly being considered.</p>

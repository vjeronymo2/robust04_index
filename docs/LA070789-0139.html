			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHALLENGE BY MCENROE ENDS ON RAINY COURT IN 3-SET VICTORY BY EDBERG  </P> <P> John McEnroe's Wimbledon challenge ended on a rainy Centre Court today, shot  down by the thundering serve and volley of defending champion Stefan Edberg.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old American, a three-time Wimbledon winner playing his first Grand  Slam semifinal in almost four years, was always a step behind as the  second-seeded Swede muscled to a 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 victory.  </P> <P> McEnroe showed no ill effects from the shoulder-muscle tear that forced him out  of the men's doubles Thursday and -- aside from a brief complaint about wet  turf in the very first game -- kept his temper in check.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outplayed McEnroe  </P> <P> Edberg just outplayed him and won in the third-set tiebreaker with a  lightning-quick backhand return of a mighty McEnroe second serve.  </P> <P> "Basically, I did the best I could. It just wasn't good enough," McEnroe said.  "The key thing was his volleying. He volleyed fabulous  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed. I felt like I could have won this tournament. Things just  didn't work out."  </P> <P> Edberg said there was no one area where he had the edge.  </P> <P> "There were small things to make me win," Edberg said. "I hit some good shots  when I really had to. There was not a lot of difference between us."  </P> <P> The match was interrupted for almost 3 1/2 hours by rain early in the third  set, and that delay caused officials to postpone the second semifinal between  Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker until Saturday.  </P> <P> The women's crown will also be decided Saturday in a rematch of the 1988 title  match, with defending champion Steffi Graf meeting eight-time winner Martina  Navratilova.  </P> <P> The last time a semifinal was staged the same day as a final was in 1985, when  Anders Jarryd and Becker finished a rain-interrupted semifinal before the  women's championship.  </P> <P> The last time McEnroe played in the final four of a Grand Slam was at the U.S.  Open in 1985. The last time he reached the semis at Wimbledon was 1984, when he  won his third championship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeded Fifth  </P> <P> A sabbatical from tennis, marriage and fatherhood have intervened, and while he  was seeded fifth this year, no one forecast a late round for "Mac the Mouth."  </P> <P> No one except McEnroe.  </P> <P> "I'm one of the four or five people who can win this," McEnroe said before the  103rd edition of the grass-court tournament began.  </P> <P> He did his best to back up his boast, escaping a two-set deficit for the first  time in his career to beat Darren Cahill in the first round, fending off  challenges all through the early matches and finally beating fourth-seeded Mats  Wilander of Sweden in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> One more Swede was too much. Although he had problems with his first serve,  McEnroe played what may have been his best overall match of the tournament.  </P> <P> But Edberg had the answer for every drop shot, every change of pace, every  inside-out forehand that McEnroe previously used to such advantage.  </P> <P> That answer was power and quickness.  </P></p>

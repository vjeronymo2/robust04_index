			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Contract boosts Manders' shares SHARES IN Manders (Holdings) rose 20p to 221p on news that the paints, inks and property group which fought off a hostile Pounds 86m bid from rival paint-maker Kalon in August, had won a contract to supply own-brand paint to the Wickes Group, the DIY multiple. Mr John Gerry, managing director of Wickes Retail, said that paint was a major product category for the 67-store chain. Wickes had chosen Manders 'to ensure competitively priced, high volume and quality production'. Mr Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, said that Wickes had embargoed publicity on both how long the contract would run and how much it was worth because it was sensitive about that information as far as its competitors were concerned.</p>

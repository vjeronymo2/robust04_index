			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Undecided position on rent reviews Sir, I read with interest Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint, 'The 'upwards only' price mentality' (August 6). In it he states that 'a county court has recently held an upwards-only rent review clause void'. Since I suspect that this relates to the recently much-publicised case between Boots and UK Land concerning a shop unit at the Elephant and Castle Shopping Centre, in London, I would like to clarify the position. The clause was not declared void. Boots was applying to renew its lease. The old lease did not contain a rent review clause. Boots, on advice, accepted that it was now the norm to have a rent review clause, but argued that it should not be an upwards-only clause. The judge accepted this and quoted a previous decision: 'What is sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the gander.' The case in fact did not change the law. It confirmed the previous position: where a party to a lease wishes to change the terms of that lease on renewal, it is for that party to show that the change either reflects modern terms or is just and reasonable in the circumstances. What was left undecided is the position when the tenant seeks an upwards/downwards rent review clause instead of an existing upwards-only rent review clause. The tenant will have to prove that either it is now the general trend for rent review clauses to allow both upwards and downwards reviews, or that it is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of that particular case for the change to be made.

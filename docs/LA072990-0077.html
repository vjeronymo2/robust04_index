			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE SCRIPT -- IT MAY HAVE THE LONGEST LIST OF CREDITS  </P> <P> For businessman Tom Byron, it loomed as the springboard that could one day take  him from manufacturing pneumatic car seats in Sun Valley to molding screenplays  in Hollywood.  </P> <P> For screenwriter Sara Lou O'Connor, it was a chance to share her script with  about 100 other writers as they took turns tapping out movie scenes on a  computer.  </P> <P> And for high school senior Eboney Bradley, the Great American Script-athon was  an opportunity to receive financial help for some filmmaking classes as well as  to experience her first taste of deadline writing.  </P> <P> "I was so nervous at first, I went to the bathroom three times before I could  write all my scenes," Bradley said. "Now, I'm just anxious to see how they  read. I just want to know what's going to happen with the script."  </P> <P> Spoken like a true screenwriter. And on Saturday, it seemed everybody was a  writer for this 48-hour type-till-you-drop-while-everyone-shops screenwriting  session at the Century City Shopping Center.  </P> <P> In a marathon effort to produce a salable movie script in two days, more than  100 writers from the nonprofit Independent Writers of Southern California  organization and a dozen passers-by willing to plunk down $10 for 10 minutes at  the computer churned out a screenplay called "Hot Property."  </P> <P> Just how hot it will be remains to be seen. But for some collaborators like the  50-year-old Byron, just participating on a movie script and contributing two  scenes and two sentences of dialogue was enough to echo the Hollywood dream.  </P> <P> "Who knows?" Byron said smiling. "Someone might look at this and use it as a  springboard for me."  </P> <P> Other collaborators shared that sentiment, if not for themselves then at least  for their collective screenplay: a "light romantic comedy" about an eccentric  elderly man who wants to bestow his house -- the last affordable house in Los  Angeles -- on a deserving young couple.  </P> <P> The screenplay has a villain -- a sinister land developer named Marvin  Montebank -- and a heroine named Allison Jessup who was thrown out of the  Police Academy for refusing to learn how to drive and is now facing eviction  from her home.  </P> <P> Will there be a happy ending?  </P> <P> Cheryl Crooks, president of IWOSC, said she hopes so -- not only at the end of  the 200 pages that are expected to be finished by this morning's 6 a.m.  deadline but also after the screenplay is polished and edited by a committee of  writers.  </P> <P> "I think we can auction it to a movie studio or (independent) filmmaker," said  Crooks, adding that a special auction will be held in mid-September to  entertain bids. "We hope to create the longest line of screenwriting credits in  history."  </P> <P> If the screenplay sells, Crooks said the proceeds will go to IWOSC, which was  founded in 1982 as a nonprofit association and includes free-lance  scriptwriters, journalists, authors, publicists and poets among its 450  members. And she remains optimistic.  </P> <P> "Everything is possible in Hollywood," said Crooks.  </P> <P> One studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not so sure. "I  think it's a creative idea, but we'll have to see just how good a script it is  and how it sells," she said.  </P> <P> Selling the screenplay was only one of Saturday's goals, however. Money raised  during the marathon -- through corporate pledges and from individuals who paid  to write a scene -- will go to pay for inner-city high school students to  attend a special film workshop at the USC School of Cinema-Television, Crooks  said.  </P> <P> Another goal was to entertain. And as the writers pounded away at their  computers, actors -- including a canine actor -- performed finished portions of  the script on a nearby stage, all to the delight of an audience of shoppers and  tourists.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FOX FEARS THE DARK SIDE OF FAME  </P> <P> Although fame and fortune have brightened the future of Michael J. Fox, the  "Back to the Future" actor does admit success has a dark side.  </P> <P> "After Rebecca Schaeffer was killed, people said, 'Doesn't that scare you?' Of  course it scares me," Fox said, referring to the actress who was gunned down,  allegedly by a disturbed fan.  </P> <P> "But I'm not lunatic about it," Fox said in the Dec. 4 issue of People  magazine. "We lock the doors like everybody else. But who wants to live in a  cocoon?"  </P> <P> Last year, while Fox was shooting "Casualties of War" on location in Thailand,  his wife, Tracy Pollan, began receiving threatening letters. The woman who  allegedly wrote them is now in a California psychiatric facility awaiting trial  on five counts of making terroristic threats.  </P> <P> "You can't just shrug it off and say, 'Well, I'm a celebrity. It comes with the  territory,' " Fox said.  </P> <P> He said he has hired bodyguards, but added: "It's key that you live as normal a  life as possible. I don't subscribe to the theory that you surround yourself  with a phalanx of meat and guns."  </P></p>

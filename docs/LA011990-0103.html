			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON IVORY TRADE TAKES EFFECT; SOME NATIONS TO DEFY IT  </P> <P> An international treaty to protect the dwindling herds of African elephants by  banning trade in ivory went into force Thursday, but leading producing and  consuming nations refused to be bound by it.  </P> <P> Five African nations that regularly cull their elephant populations have filed  for exemption, while China has said that it will continue importing tusks.  </P> <P> Britain has asked for a six-month trading extension for Hong Kong to allow the  colony to sell off its ivory stockpile of 670 tons.  </P> <P> The trade ban was agreed upon after bitter debate at an October meeting of the  103-nation Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. Countries had until  Thursday to file for an exemption to enable them to continue trade with those  members who also filed reservations or with the 60 countries outside the  convention.  </P> <P> South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Malawi submitted reservations by  the deadline, said Jean-Patrick Le Duc, spokesman for the Swiss-based  convention secretariat.  </P> <P> South Africa and Zimbabwe, which both have large, well-managed elephant  populations, have argued that they need revenue from ivory sales to continue  protecting the animals successfully.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea will uphold  the amendment to the global agreement on protecting the ozone  layer this June pushing up the date banning all use of  chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.    The Copenhagen Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, signed by  20 countries, goes into effect June 14 and South Korea will  submit to the amendment soon afterwards, the ministry said.    The revised version sets down an earlier date to eliminate  all use of chemicals destructive to the ozone layer such as CFCs  and halon.    These chemicals are used as coolants in refrigerators and  air  conditioners. CFC use will be banned as of Jan. 1, 1996, while  use of halon was to cease Jan. 1 this year.    South Korea, however, belongs to the developing nation  category and is exempt from these deadlines. The Copenhagen  Amendment excludes a ban date for developing countries and  members are to decide next year on another set of guidelines.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Off target Sir, Rejoicing over the early retirement of Ros Hepplewhite ('Child Support Agency chief quits post early', September 3) is misplaced - in fact and in law. By convention, ministers are responsible, not civil servants or ministerial appointees. This time they have conveniently passed the blame on. It is the flaws in the original legislation - and the directions given by minister to the Child Support Agency - which has led to the problems and consequent mess. Ms Hepplewhite may have gone, but the problems remain. David Morgan, 232 Spinney Hill Road, Parklands, Northampton</p>

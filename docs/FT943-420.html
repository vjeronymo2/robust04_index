			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Alcatel Alsthom The news at Alcatel Alsthom goes from bad to worse. Not only were net profits for the first half of 1994 a third lower than in the first half of 1993; the group expects second-half profits to stay at the same depressed level. This means full-year profits will be down 40 per cent or more - much worse than the 10-20 per cent decline forecast by the group in January. The problems are in telecoms equipment, particularly in Germany. Deutsche Telekom, which in the past has been an easy source of profits for Alcatel, is driving harder bargains with suppliers as it prepares for privatisation. Capital expenditure is being reined in and margins are being squeezed. The snag is that margin pressure is not confined to Germany. It is only a matter of time before other large Alcatel customers such as France Telecom and Telecom Italia demand similar price cuts. As competition spreads through the telecoms services market, operators can no longer afford to feather-bed their suppliers. The long-term prospects are not all bleak. Alcatel has a good position in broad-band technology, which should prove a growth market as the race to build multimedia superhighways gathers pace. It has also gained a leading position in China, another fast-growing market. But China is a fiercely competitive market with slim margins. Moreover, despite recent cost cutting, Alcatel's organisation remains bloated. The group's shares, which have dropped 37 per cent from their January peak, still look overvalued.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / US economic expansion slows in second quarter THE US economy expanded in the second quarter of this year by less than half the revised rate of the first, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Gross domestic product rose at a real annual rate of 1.4 per cent, somewhat worse than expected and down from the revised 2.9 per cent increase of the first three months. This potentially negative news for President George Bush's re-election effort was partly mitigated by other data published yesterday, showing a surge in new house sales in June and a reduction in unemployment claims during the middle week of this month. Also, the Senate finance committee agreed on Wednesday night a Dollars 21.8bn (Pounds 11.4bn) tax bill containing some elements of the president's economic recovery plan, among them the creation of 25 urban enterprise zones, a 15 per cent tax allowance on new investment undertaken over the next year and a Dollars 2,500 tax credit for new home buyers. However, the proposed bill made no reference to a general capital gains tax reduction that had been favoured by Mr Bush. Campaigning in Texas yesterday, Mr Bush said that the economy was 'not growing fast enough'. Yet again he ascribed the blame to 'dillying and dallying' in Congress, but he made no direct reference to the Senate committee's bill. The bipartisan opinion on Capitol Hill is that he would probably accept it. The principal depressant in the preliminary GDP figures was consumer spending, down 0.3 per cent in the second quarter after a healthy rise of 5.1 per cent in the first. Business inventories rose by 20.7 per cent in April-June, compared with a 3.7 per cent advance in the first three months.</p>

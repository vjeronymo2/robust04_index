			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Strong opening for privatised IMI issue Shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Italian financial services group privatised last week, opened at a 32 per cent premium on their first day of trading yesterday. IMI's stock, which also made its debut in London and New York, settled at L13,430 by the close, marking a 23 per cent premium over the L10,900 offer price. The heady performance will come as a boost to the Italian treasury, which is embarking on an ambitious privatisation programme. IMI is the second big public sell-off, after Credito Italiano last December. It will be followed by Banca Commerciale Italiana later this month. Mr Luigi Arcuti, IMI's chairman, acknowledged the strong demand for the company's shares had exceeded even his most optimistic expectations. By the end of the last week's offer period, closed early because of oversubscription, IMI received applications from almost 375,000 domestic retail investors for nearly 378m shares - more than five times the 75m on offer. Separately, more than 1,800 institutions applied for almost 1.6bn shares - almost 13 times the 125m available to them. The demand means it will be easily Italy's biggest company, in terms of the number of shareholders, eclipsing the likes of Fiat and Generali. To fulfil the unexpectedly strong retail demand, the treasury will redirect to the domestic offering 18.75m shares previously earmarked for institutional investors. The latter's original allocation will be maintained, however, by allocating a similar number of shares originally held back for market stabilisation purposes. As a result, the combined public-sector stake in the bank will fall to about 25 per cent from more than 60 per cent previously. Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general of the treasury, confirmed the state's remaining shares would also be sold. He gave no indication of when the second tranche would go.</p>

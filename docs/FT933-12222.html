			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Francis Bouygues - concrete king: Obituary MR FRANCIS BOUYGUES, one of France's most powerful industrialists and founder of Bouygues, the world's largest construction company, died at the weekend of a heart attack at his country home in Brittany. Known in France as the 'concrete king', Mr Bouygues, 70, was a figure noted as much for his powerful personality as his business skills. He was one of the handful of autocratic industrialists, or patrons, who dominated the industrial development of post-war France. The prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, described him at the weekend as a 'man of remarkable intelligence, dynamism and imagination'. Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and prospective president, praised his 'imagination, creativity and tenacity'. Mr Bouygues was born in Paris in 1922 and, after studying engineering, founded Bouygues in 1952. The company flourished during the buoyant post-war era and, helped by Mr Bouygues' political contacts, became a power in the construction industry. However, he also had the vision to expand the business internationally. This strategy has been continued by his son, Martin, who took over as chairman in 1989. Bouygues has made its mark with a series of grandiose projects both inside and outside France, including the construction of Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris and the futuristic Grande Arche at La Defense, as well as being a big contractor for the Channel Tunnel.</p>

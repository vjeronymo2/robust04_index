			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Continental Bank Stock Sale: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to sell  up to 9 million shares of Continental Bank Corp. common stock in another step  to return the Chicago-based bank to public ownership, according to Securities  and Exchange Commission documents. The sale, which would raise about $230  million, would reduce the FDIC's direct and indirect control of the bank to  about 26%. Shares of the bank company were up 12.5 cents at $25.50. The FDIC  put up $4.5 billion in 1984 to rescue the bank, then known as Continental  Illinois, which was threatened by a run on deposits. After the sale of the  remainder of the stock, probably later this year, the FDIC's losses are  expected to total about $2 billion.  </P></p>

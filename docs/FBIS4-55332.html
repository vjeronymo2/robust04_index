			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed HINA article: "Croatia Has Citizens, Not the </F> Istria Zupanija"]    [Text] Minister of Administration Davorin Mlakar on  the reasons for initiating proceedings to assess the  constitutionality of the zupanija statute; many provisions of  the Istria Zupanija's statute regulate issues which, on the  basis of the Constitution and the law, are only within the  state's purview; the zupanija does not have the right to  introduce another official language; the Republic of Croatia has  citizens, while the zupanijas have residents.    Zagreb--So far the Ministry of Administration has received  most of the zupanija statutes. Of the 12 statutes analyzed to  date, in the statute of the Istria Zupanija the ministry has  identified many provisions in conflict with the Constitution of  the Republic of Croatia and the law. As a result, implementation  of that statute has been halted, and at the proposal of the  Ministry of Administration, the government has initiated  proceedings before the Constitutional Court to assess its  constitutionality and legality.    According to the words of Minister of Administration Davorin  Mlakar, many provisions of the Istria Zupanija's statute  regulate issues which, on the basis of the Constitution and the  law, are only within the state's purview. Thus, Mlakar stated,  that statute violates several laws, such as, for instance, the  Law on Local Self-Government and Administration, the Law on the  Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and Municipalities, the Law on  Health Care, the Law on Industrial Ownership, and other separate  laws.    "We believe that provisions of the Constitution have also  been violated, and we therefore proposed to the government that  proceedings be initiated before the Constitutional Court to  assess the constitutionality and legality of the Istria  Zupanija's statute. The specific result of our work is only that  we have stopped that statute from being implemented, and that it  is not possible to act in accordance with it, nor can general  acts that would cite it be adopted. It is up to the  Constitutional Court to adopt the final decision and say whether  we were right or not," Mlakar said.  <H5>  Violated Regulations </H5>   As an example of inconsistency with the Constitution and the  laws, Minister Mlakar cited article 13 of the statute, which  provides that the Istria Zupanija independently adopts  regulations in specific legal areas. "That means, in other  words, that it can adopt regulations in areas for which separate  laws provide that they are to be adopted by the Assembly of the  Republic of Croatia," Mlakar said. He explained that with the  independent adoption of regulations, the Zupanija is  establishing its jurisdiction in violation of the provisions of  article 128 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and  articles 13, 14, and 15 of the Law on Local Self-Government, as  well as the provisions of the Law on Specifying Matters Within  the Self-Governing Jurisdiction of Units of Local  Self-Government and Administration. "That means that three  fundamental regulations have been violated by that norm in the  statute. Thus, for example, article 7 of the Law on Local  Self-Government and Administration regulates the content of the  zupanija statutes and states definitely what should be regulated  by the zupanija statute, and no general act can go beyond that  legal norm and remain consistent with the law," Mlakar  emphasized.    Next, he stated that contrary to the Constitution's  provisions, article 13 of the Zupanija statute prescribed that  the Zupanija independently adopts regulations governing the  status of employed personnel. Specifically, article 54 of the  Constitution prescribes the right to work and freedom of work as  one of the economic, social, and cultural rights, and article 56  of the Constitution establishes that employees' rights to social  security and insurance are regulated by law and a collective  contract. That means, according to Mlakar, that employees'  status anywhere, including in the Zupanija's bodies, is  regulated solely by law and a collective contract.  <H5>  Use of Language </H5>   Article 15 of the statute, which, as Mlakar stated, says  that  the Zupanija has decentralization as the principle of its own  structure, and that it formulates administrative procedure on  the basis of the principles of simple and public operation, is  contrary to articles 18, 19, and 88 of the Croatian  Constitution, since the Zupanija does not have the  constitutional or legal right to formulate administrative  procedure. "On the basis of the above-mentioned constitutional  provisions, it is exclusively the Assembly's right, because the  working methods of state bodies and units of local  self-government can only be regulated by law," Minister Mlakar  said.    He also warned about article 16 of the statute, which  establishes the possibility of changing the area and  headquarters of the Istria Zupanija. "The areas and headquarters  are determined by the Law on the Areas of Zupanijas, Cities, and  Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia, and can only be  changed in the manner prescribed by the law. That cannot be  transferred by any means to a lower unit, or to lower general  acts," Mlakar specified.    He added that the statute also regulates the introduction of  another language, in addition to Croatian, for official use.  That right, by law, is only exercised by units of local  self-government--municipalities, cities, and districts--which  can decide in their general acts that a minority language can  also be in official use, along with the Croatian language and  the Latin alphabet. The Zupanija, Mlakar emphasized, does not  have that right, because according to the Constitution and the  laws it is a unit of local administration and self-government.    Article 1 of the statute only cites precise provisions of  the  Constitution, and thus says that "The Istria Zupanija is a unity  of local self-government and administration, within the  framework of the united and indivisible Republic of Croatia."  With the opposite order, which is not unimportant (because it  should say "unit of local administration and self-government"),  Mlakar pointed out that certain attributes of the state are also  left out, because according to article 131 of the Constitution,  the Republic of Croatia is a united, indivisible, democratic,  and social-welfare state.  <H5>  Citizens' Rights </H5>   The statute says that the Istria Zupanija is a unit of local  self-government and administration of all of its citizens, and  that the Zupanija protects the freedoms and rights of its  citizens. That is a right that is only exercised by the state,  Mlakar warned. "Only the Republic of Croatia has citizens, and  units of local self-government, municipalities, and cities have  residents. Consequently, zupanijas do not have their own  citizens; they are exclusively citizens of the Republic of  Croatia and it guarantees them all civil rights and freedoms and  human rights. That is a right reserved for the state alone, and  in comparison with other countries' constitutions, one can reach  the same conclusion--it cannot be left to the units of local  administration and self-government to protect citizens' rights  and freedoms, because that could ultimately mean that they could  be protected differently," Mlakar said.    "We are not disputing a single one of those citizens'  rights,  and we are not questioning that part, but instead we are  maintaining--and we have a basis for doing so in the  Constitution and the laws--that these are rights that are  exclusively within the state's purview. The state has specified  by laws which form and part of legal regulations it will leave  to the zupanijas, and which part the state, in order to  guarantee the equality and rights of citizens before the law and  the Constitution, will regulate uniformly for the entire  territory of the Republic of Croatia," Minister Mlakar concluded.</p>

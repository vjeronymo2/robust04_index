			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / N-power contracts pressure resisted THE GOVERNMENT has had only limited success in trying to persuade the electricity industry to cancel supply contracts with state-owned Nuclear Electric to make room for more coal-based power, David Lascelles writes. Only one of the 12 regional companies is believed to have responded to government pressure by seeking a possible renegotiation of its six-year nuclear contracts. Renegotiation is likely to present difficulties, however, as Nuclear Electric is considering the legal implications and the question of compensation if the contracts are ended.</p>

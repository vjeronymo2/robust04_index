			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Voronin, chief designer, Federal </F> Nuclear Center, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for  Experimental Physics; Viktor Voronov, chief, Department for  Problem Analysis for Nuclear Armaments, All-Russian Scientific  Research Institute for Experimental Physics; and Sergey Brezkun,  researcher, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute for  Experimental Physics: "Why Is the Nuclear `Diad' Destructive to  Russia?"; first three paragraphs are introductory paragraphs]    [Text] The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II)  concluded by Russia and the USA in January 1993 has still not  been ratified by either the Russian or the American side. In the  course of the Treaty's hearings in the Russian parliament in the  spring of 1993 a number of arguments were put forward against it  and they still define the critical attitude towards START II on  the part of some Russian politicians, military brass and  representatives from the military-industrial complex. Proceeding  from the need for debate on this issue, MN has decided to  publish an article received by the newspaper from three experts  in this sphere. The article also raises a highly important  question bearing on the further development of Russia's  strategic nuclear forces.    The opinions in this article are solely the authors' and in  no way reflect MN's position on the Treaty. By printing the  article, MN hopes that the discussion of this issue will  continue.    Recently, growing importance has been placed on the need to  elaborate the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). We are  well aware of the fact that such ideas quickly travel from the  pages of academic journals to official doctrines, accords and  programs and this is why we consider it important to understand  a likely result of all this.    While all past mutual agreements between the USA and the  USSR  on nuclear armaments stipulated a mere reduction in the number  of strategic armaments, leaving each side free to decide on the  structure of its strategic nuclear forces, START II for the  first time outlines requirements on their qualitative and  strategic performance. This treaty envisions a dramatic  reduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) with  multiple independently targeted warheads but the ideas for  future elimination of land-based ICBM's and a transition to a  certain nuclear diad consisting of strategic aircraft and  nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles on board.  <H5>  What Does START II Have in Store for Us? </H5>   The implementation of START II allows the USA to preserve a  "triad" structure relying heavily on the submarine fleet, which  reasonably serves the interests of a major sea power. As for our  country, according to the treaty we are to eliminate our  land-based ICBMs, a measure which would hardly be reasonable or  well-founded from the point of view of Russia, a major land  power. The gist of all this can well be shown by comparing the  structural composition of strategic nuclear forces of each side  (in terms of combat charges) prior to the implementation of  START II -- 1991, and following it.    It is obvious that should land-based intercontinental  ballistic missiles with multiple independently targeted warheads  be eliminated, Russia would lose a large part of its strategic  nuclear forces which were most reliable, i.e. strategic rocket  troops (SRT). If START II is implemented, SRT will be left with  only "Topol" (SS-25) ICBMs which carry only a single warhead.    The USA, according to START II, also must sharply reduce its  strategic ICBM's including its "MX" missiles. One should not  forget the following however, First, the land-based missiles  have never been of the utmost importance to the USA. Second, the  American strategic nuclear forces still keep the "Minuteman-3"  ICBMs which are capable of carrying multiple warheads, but under  START II will be allowed to carry only a single warhead. This  will allow them to be reequipped with a separating head section  carrying three warheads, since START II does not stipulate any  measures for preventing an inversion of those missiles.    Also, one should not forget the plan to replace the outdated  warheads on 500 Minuteman-3 ICBMs with the 500 modernized  warheads which are being removed from 50 MX missiles (each of  them carries ten warheads). This actually means a planned  replacement of old ammunitions with modernized ones.    As to the rest of the components of the nuclear triad  affected by START II, the matter is as follows. The USA has  traditionally had powerful strategic aircraft which successfully  combine the advantage of heavy aircraft-carriers with the  possibilities of medium-speed low-flying and difficult-to-detect  ALCM strategic rockets.    The USSR strategic aircraft existed just "for show" and what  Russia has today is not even worth taking into consideration:  only several dozen out-of-date Tu-95 heavy bombers and only two  modern Tu-160 aircraft.    As to the sea-based component of the strategic nuclear  forces, Russia's marine constituent of the triad is largely  inferior to America's with respect to the accuracy of the  submarine ballistic missiles, the noise level of the submarines  themselves and their deployment. Suffice it to say that less  than 30 percent of Russian submarines are on combat duty at a  given moment, this figure for the USA is 80 percent. In  addition, the USA possess a most powerful anti-submarine network  covering practically all the regions where our submarines  conduct patrols. It is also noteworthy that the American attack  submarines act, let us say frankly, quite brazenly in Russia's  territorial waters, close to the Northern Fleet.  <H5>  What Does the Nuclear Diad Have in Store for Us? </H5>   One should be aware of what we give up and what we get if  the  diad is implemented.    First, Russia would be deprived of its traditionally most  significant and essential component within the strategic forces,  i.e. strategic rockets.    Second, due to the physical and moral wear-and-tear of  strategic aircraft and submarine fleets we would be forced to  spend large sums on building new bombers and nuclear submarines,  as well as on the renovation of their infrastructure (land, air  and sea). The best proof for this can be found in the figures:  the cost ratio of a missile fired from a land-based ICBM and  that of a submarine-launched ballistic missile is approximately  1:10. This means that an ICBM is ten times as cheap to launch.    Third, the ecological risk will still be with us since  constant combat patrolling and training flights of heavy bombers  as well as the presence of nuclear submarines in the world's  seas threaten with disasters such as the "Palomares" (the loss  of an atom bomb from an American bomber in Spanish waters in  1960s), or our "Komsomolets" submarine or the American  "Thresher" and "Scorpion" submarines.    Fourth, the structure of the strategic nuclear forces of  Russia and USA will gradually stabilize owing to the  qualitatively different performances of strategic aircraft and  attack submarines, and discrepancy between Russia's diad and its  geopolitical features: US aircraft and submarines can be  deployed secretly and are capable of delivering a surprise and  uncontrollable attack. Nor should one forget about the US air  bases beyond its national borders, nuclear weapons mounted on 18  aircraft-carriers, as well as about sea-based rockets mounted on  submarines of the US Navy.  <H5>  What Is the Solution? </H5>   Thus, additional measures would leave us with less mutual  security rather than more. This can be argued with the fact that  the above concerns could be justified only by a confrontational  approach to the issue. We do not insist on our concerns being  absolutely justified. However, if Russia and the USA retain warm  relations and trust, wouldn't it be better if we do otherwise:  completely liquidate our nuclear-powered air and submarine  fleets retaining only ICBMs on our respective territories. The  remaining ICBMs of a single-warhead type would be easy to  mutually control since they are deployed on national  territories. Their maintenance is relatively inexpensive. What  is more, their warheads can be removed for better confidence and  greater security. This would also mean that the marine component  (cruise missiles and nuclear aircraft on the aircraft-carriers)  is no doubt, to be destroyed too. All this should result in  maximum confidence and equally ensured global stability with the  lowest level of nuclear armaments.    With other nuclear powers being prepared to adequately  reduce  their nuclear arsenals, one could also ponder on lowering this  level to 500 ICBMs. It goes without saying that the option would  stabilize the international situation as a whole: if only Russia  and the USA would set a strong example for other members of the  "nuclear club," the latter would find it hard to refuse from  adequate moves.    In addition to apparent political and moral gains one can  discern many others. First of all, the sides would enjoy a huge  savings of money, eliminating the expenses on production,  testing, maintenance, and subsequent retiring the aircraft and  submarines (as well as their nuclear armaments), and on the  maintenance and development of all kinds of infrastructure for  the air and submarine fleets, etc. (Incidentally, the USA could  gain a great deal since they would be able to save on a most  powerful system of anti-submarine defence.)    What is more, by abolishing the air and sea nuclear  components, Russia and (especially) the USA would relieve the  territories beyond their borders of a potential threat -- by  eliminating a network of foreign bases.    No doubt, these possibilities could be realized in an  atmosphere of genuine and equal partnership and sincere  intentions. But if this raises questions, then is it right to  initial START II and destroy the missiles which can be kept even  under this treaty and to proceed to a diad?</p>

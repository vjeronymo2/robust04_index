			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (15): Crucial transition period - Abbey National The company treasurer, once a rather marginal figure within an organisation, has grown in status in recent years. The growing complexity of the financial markets and the increasing range of sophisticated instruments available have made his task more difficult and more highly valued, while a series of well-publicised losses on derivatives by treasury departments have also resulted in closer scrutiny of the treasury operation. This is particularly true of bank treasurers, whose activities are even more central to the wellbeing of their institutions than those of corporate treasurers. Gareth Jones, Abbey National's treasurer since the building society acquired bank status in 1989, has seen his department through a crucial transition period. Since becoming a bank, Abbey has been more active in using international capital markets. Its treasury is considered one of the more aggressive and professional operations in the financial markets, in its activities as an issuer and as an investor. Last year, it raised Dollars 5.5bn in the international bond markets. So far this year the total is Dollars 5bn, of which Dollars 4bn was completed in January, before the markets turned sour. In addition, Abbey also has a Dollars 4bn US commercial paper programme, of which Dollars 2.5bn is drawn, and a Dollars 10bn medium-term note programme, of which Dollars 8.5bn is drawn. Part of the challenge has been to raise the international profile of the company. 'We have had a pretty good reception in the long-term debt market - we have achieved quite good rates in lira,' said Mr Jones. Nevertheless, in a market where perception often lags change, it has been a battle to convey the message abroad that Abbey is now a bank, rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's and AA2 by Moody's, rather than a building society, considered a more esoteric breed by overseas investors. Abbey National has therefore held a series of roadshows in Europe, aimed at the banks which manage local retail distribution. As well as tapping retail demand, Abbey has also built a stronger institutional base, by issuing large liquid transactions. So far this year, Abbey has launched Dollars 1bn offerings of fixed and floating-rate bonds. Last year, Abbey issued a 10-year eurobond in the sterling market which, after the second tranche was launched, totalled Pounds 1bn, equalling in size the largest deal in the sector. As well as being a sizeable issuer, Abbey National's treasury is also active as an investor - it is the largest investor in the sterling mortgage-backed bond market, but it runs investment books in a number of currencies, the largest of which are sterling and dollars. Abbey has also bought bonds in the US mortgage-backed market, and is keeping track of developments in the European asset-backed market. In a radical departure, Abbey has also set up a joint venture in derivatives with Baring Brothers. Abbey National Baring Derivatives was set up last year as a branch of Abbey National Treasury Services - a move which caused concern about the potential risks of derivatives business, although Abbey insists its strategy is conservative. Unlike most corporate treasuries, Abbey National Treasury Services is run as a profit centre: pre-tax profits in 1993 reached almost Pounds 200m, having shown consistent growth since 1989. The arguments against running a treasury department as a profit centre are strong for industrial companies, where the treasury is mainly designed to service other business areas. But a bank treasury is an integral part of the main business. Nevertheless, despite the strong performance of Abbey National Treasury Services, Mr Jones believes that a purely profit-oriented approach is potentially dangerous for a treasury operation. 'We are a profit centre but the chief executive is not pushing for additional profits from treasury,' he said. 'If things go wrong in treasury it will have a disproportionate effect on the public perception of the business.'</p>

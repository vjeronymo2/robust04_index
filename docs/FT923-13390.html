			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: English farm survey shows big switch to contracting MORE THAN 40 per cent of the farms in England's central counties have embarked on programmes of diversification, but the most popular new business is that which trades on existing assets: contracting for other farmers. This emerges from a survey of more than 1,100 agricultural, horticultural and other rural businesses in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire. The survey was carried out for the local training and enterprise councils, the Heart of England Agricultural Training Board and the Rural Development Commission. The results not only indicate the speed of change on British farms, stimulated by European Community attempts to bring price support spending under control, but also imply that the moves towards farm diversification have made only limited progress towards stabilising the rural economy. Analysis of response to questions, relating to business, the rural workforce and training failed to establish the extent to which diversification activities 'either increase employment opportunities or fully employ existing labour'. Nearly half of the diversified farms had become engaged in contracting, the survey showed, as farmers sought greater use from existing investment. Indeed, the report noted, 'the most popular diversifications appear to be those trading on existing assets rather than those requiring high capital outlay'. Against the background of steady decline in the farm workforce - a 9 per cent reduction over the last five years in the three counties - farmers are using more outside labour. The survey showed that over two-thirds of farms used contractors, just under a half used casual labour and that a fifth used self-employed workers. But Mr Nigel Gaynor, director of the Heart of England Agricultural Training Board, has doubts about how far contracting can be taken as a diversification. 'A big question arises: there must be a finite amount of work that can be done by contracting,' he said. More certain is the fact that farmers in Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire are engaged in a continuing search to reduce fixed costs. This prompted the report both to predict an increase in the use of outside labour and to note the introduction in the area of machinery rings. After contracting, the most common farm diversification is retail outlets (provided by 27 per cent of farms), followed by the provision of holiday accommodation and leisure activities. But all these activities are at least partially dependent for their success on consumer spending, which has been flattened by the recession.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia de Souza: "South Africa and Vietnam: New </F> Business Fronts for Brazilian Firms"]    [Text] Sao Paulo--The Brazilian businessmen's mission to  South Africa, consisting of a group of 25 representatives of  private and government-owned firms, will leave for that country  this coming Friday. Its purpose is to explore business  possibilities, and it hopes to find opportunities for Brazil not  only to expand its investments and trade with that  country--currently totaling around $300 million--but also to  sound out the markets in neighboring countries.    The Odebrecht Group, for example, which is part of the  expedition, has become accustomed in recent years to  participating in bidding and sounding out opportunities not only  in South Africa, where it has an office in Johannesburg, but  also in neighboring countries that are considered promising,  such as Swaziland and Tanzania, as well as Angola and  Mozambique, where the group has been active in the past.    "This is an exploratory trip," editor Fatima Belchior was  told yesterday by Jose Coutinho, vice president of Braspetro.  That Petrobras subsidiary explored the possibility of building  oil tanks in the country last year, but was unable to sign any  exploratory risk contracts.    Even the approaching date for the first elections and the  uncertainties regarding the first government of national  integration's chances for economic and political stability are  not diminishing the optimism of the Brazilian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs concerning the prospects for increased business  with that country. The head of the Trade Promotion Department,  Minister Celso Marcos Vieira de Souza, says that even though 47  percent of South Africa's manpower is unemployed, that fact is  offset by other, positive indicators: a recent revival of the  economy, with the gross domestic product expected to grow by 3  percent this year; inflation of around 9 percent per year; and  the willingness of the South Africans to encourage investments  in the form of joint ventures both locally and in third  countries. This will allow Brazilian businessmen to open new  business fronts in the neighboring countries. The mission  chief's schedule includes a meeting with Nelson Mandela's  economic team.    The Trade Promotion Department of the Brazilian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is making arrangements for a similar mission to  Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia in April. That delegation will  include, among other companies, construction firms such the  Odebrecht Group (which is already active in Singapore), the  Maxion farm implement firm, and Petrobras, which will sound out  the opportunities for offshore risk contracts in the region.  Braspetro's Coutinho is not ruling out the possibility that the  firm will operate under the risk contract system in Vietnam,  although he feels it is too early to make any definite  statements.    "Vietnam needs everything" is how Vieira de Souza sums it  up.  During that same visit, the Brazilian Government is scheduled to  pick the residence where it will install its embassy in Hanoi.</p>

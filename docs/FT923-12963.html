			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Hooper in the red CLARKE HOOPER, the troubled USM-traded sales promotion company, yesterday announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.45m for 1991-92 as trading losses due to the recession were compounded by exceptional losses from rationalisation. The loss for the year to end-April compared with a Pounds 2.05m profit last time. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 44.5m as clients cut marketing budgets. Pressure on margins resulted in swing from operating profits of Pounds 2.18m to losses of Pounds 880,000. Interest charges increased to Pounds 315,000 (Pounds 131,000) as net borrowings rose to Pounds 3.97m (Pounds 2.66m). The company's bankers, Robert Fleming and NatWest, commissioned a review of working capital requirements and have renewed Clarke Hooper's facilities until June 1993. The rationalisation programme led to exceptional items of Pounds 2.26m. The workforce has fallen from 381 to 209. Ms Sue Archer, group finance director, said no further cuts were planned. Losses per share emerged at 12.9p (earnings 8.4p). No dividend is proposed - a 4.4p total was paid previously. The sale in May of Schmidt-Cannon International, a US marketing company, for Dollars 2m (Pounds 1m) led to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 3.37m for goodwill previously written off. Retained losses for the year totalled Pounds 6.05m (profit Pounds 601,000).</p>

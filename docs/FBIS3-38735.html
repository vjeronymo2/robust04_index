			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Foreign Ministers Meet"] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 7 Feb (ANSA) -- The Bosnian crisis topped  the agenda as European Union foreign ministers gathered for two  days of talks here this morning, amid lingering worldwide shock  at the Saturday [5 February] mortar attack that killed 68 and  wounded 200 in a Sarajevo market, and progress in the push to  have Sarajevo de-militarised.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd reiterated London's  caution over NATO air strikes against Serb positions around the  Bosnian capital, stressing that the indications of UN commanders  on the ground should be the prime consideration. Hurd said that  a NATO meeting to answer UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali's air strike preparation call would take place on  Wednesday [9 February] -- while German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel told German radio that the meeting could come "as early  as tomorrow. Everyone agrees that the order to attack must come  from Butrus-Ghali," Kinkel said, adding that even with air  strikes "the situation cannot be improved overnight," and  recalling that U.S. President Bill Clinton has "given priority  to a peaceful response."    A spokesperson for Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  said he had been in close telephone contact with U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, adding that air strikes against any  of the three sides in Bosnia "would only make sense if there is  a good chance of them forcing the sides to compromise." In the  present situation, their likelier effect would be the opposite,  she said.    International mediators Lord David Owen (for the EU) and  Thorvald Stoltenberg (for the UN) announced in Belgrade that  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had agreed to talks,  beginning in Geneva Thursday (when the broader peace talks  resume), on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo to place the city  under UN control.    Bosnian (Muslim) state radio accused the Bosnian Croats of  "taking advantage of the attention focused on Sarajevo" to step  up bombing of the Herzegovina capital Mostar, where it reported  80 mortars falling during the night (one dead, several wounded)  and heavy Croat use of surface-to-surface missiles this morning.    Fighting was also reported in central Bosnia (where a  general  alert was sounded at Zenica) and in the north, around the Muslim  enclave at Maglaj, where Serb and Croat forces are reported to  be operating jointly against the Muslims. After a night of calm,  the Serb artillery barrage of Sarajevo resumed this morning,  hitting the suburbs of Zuc and Dobrinja.    NATO diplomatic sources said later that for the moment no  meeting of NATO foreign ministers is planned to discuss a  response to Saturday's atrocity. There will probably be  meetings of NATO's 16 ambassadors ahead of their scheduled  meeting on Wednesday in the Atlantic Council, they said, while  not ruling out a foreign ministers' meeting being decided at the  EU meeting today and tomorrow.    "Not only the honour, but the very future of the European  Union is at stake in ex-Yugoslavia," French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe told his confreres at the start of today's session,  calling for a "clear stance" in favour of ordering Serb  artillery to stay out of a 30-km radius around Sarajevo on pain  of being hit. "France is ready to take on this responsibility,"  he said.    But Greece, the one Balkan country in the European Union and  the holder of the EU's rotating presidency, expressed opposition  to air strikes or other military options for fear of igniting a  full-scale Balkans war.    Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta expressed  support for the French idea of creating a security perimeter  around Sarajevo, saying that "we have to use all instruments,  political and military, to ease the situation in Bosnia before  the Spring offensives."    (In London, British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said  that the use of military force would "endanger" aid supplies.  He called on the international community to show "strong  political determination.")    (In Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel appealed to  the international community to decide military action against  the Serbian "aggressors" and lift the arms embargo preventing  the Bosnian Muslims from properly defending themselves.)</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps TT improve 44% to Pounds 24m Profits from TT Group were helped by the turnround at AB Electronics, acquired at the start of the year, and full year contributions from businesses bought in 1992, and showed a 43.8 per cent rise at the pre-tax level to Pounds 23.9m. The figure for the year to December 25 was struck after a Pounds 397,000 goodwill write-off relating to the sale of the natural twine business. Mr Timothy Reed, chairman, said 1994 had started ahead of expectations. The UK and US economies were now coming out of recession. Group turnover more than doubled to Pounds 357.8m, with Pounds 156.7m coming from AB. Operating profits rose 42.4 per cent to Pounds 27.7m, of which AB made Pounds 5.49m. AB was losing about Pounds 1m a month when bought, for Pounds 13.6m plus the assumption of Pounds 25m of debt, but was into profit by April. Operating margins for the group were down at 7.7 per cent (11.4 per cent) as AB made a much lower margin of 3.5 per cent. The group aims for a 10 per cent return on sales from operations. The electronics and industrial division, into which AB falls, increased profits to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 10.3m). Packaging profits were barely ahead at Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 8.1m) after significant costs in moving three factories to one site. The building services division suffered a downturn in profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 800,000, feeling the recession in the construction industry as its products are used late in the building cycle. Interest charges rose Pounds 551,000 to Pounds 3.35m as a result of the AB borrowings, in spite of the Pounds 51.4m proceeds of last summer's rights issue which were received in September. At the year end the group was cash positive. Mr Nicholas Shipp, joint chief executive, said TT had the resources to make a Pounds 50m acquisition but that prices of UK companies had risen sharply over the last year and were out of the group's range now. A deal in the US was more likely, although not until later this year or early next. A lower tax rate, of 23.9 per cent (26.2 per cent), helped offset some of the dilutive effect of the rights issue, and earnings per share were 19.3p (16.2p), or 19.8p excluding the goodwill write-off. A final dividend of 4p is proposed to give a total of 6.6p (6p). COMMENT TT is at last gaining the rating it deserves. Those who took up last year's rights at 240p will be pleased with a share price up 12p to 384p yesterday . The management's skills at turning round lossmakers have been proved once again with the performance at AB. The only question might be whether there are enough reasonably priced targets these days for TT to buy. But with many companies divesting businesses and TT looking in the US and Europe, as well as the UK, it should find some gems among the hundreds it looks at every year. On forecasts around Pounds 30m pre-tax and a continuing low tax rate, the prospective p/e is around 17 1/2 which leaves something more to go for.</p>

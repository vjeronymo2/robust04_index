			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Markets: What should we tell Sid now? - The Bottom Line SID, the unseen star of British Gas's advertising campaign before privatisation in 1986, may be wondering whether he was right to hold on to his shares. He has seen the company plunged into a year of uncertainty by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission review of the UK gas market, and this week reporting a one-third fall in profits for the first half-year. But BG shares have their advantages. They offer the security of a utility, and are yielding 8 per cent - matched by few other stocks in the market. Philip Rogerson, finance director, has also reiterated the company's commitment to increasing its dividend in real terms. Moreover, while some analysts predicted the share price would begin to slide after the MMC inquiry was announced, it has held its value. Paul Spedding, analyst with Kleinwort Benson, says it could even rise if investors continue their dash for safety into the utilities sector. He adds that this week's fall in half-year profits to Pounds 778m from Pounds 1,156m on a current cost basis, was disappointing, but well above the more pessimistic forecasts. The most important question is whether the security factor is undermined by the regulatory pressures on earnings and, ultimately, whether these pressures will be eased by the MMC inquiry. British Gas presently finds itself between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, it must abide by the tough formula it agreed with Ofgas, the industry regulator, limiting price rises to five percentage points below the rate of inflation. This has already brought price cuts totalling 5 per cent to domestic customers - lopping Pounds 300m off sales values over a full year. On the other, an agreement with the Office of Fair Trading means BG must watch its share of the industrial market progressively eroded. Competing marketers now supply more than 30 per cent of the firm contract market. Meanwhile, scope for cost-cutting to protect margins has been severely limited by the MMC inquiry. Cedric Brown, chief executive, said this week BG was not prepared to undertake radical measures when the whole regulatory framework could change in a year's time. 'Sid bought the shares for their core utility earnings,' says Simon Flowers, analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh. 'But those earnings are being gradually eaten away by the edicts of the regulators.' He adds that while BG aims to replace lost profits by enlarging its exploration and production and global gas businesses - with a target of increasing their combined contribution to group earnings from around 20 per cent to 60 per cent - this will take some years. In the short-term, only a colder-than-usual second half year is likely to allow full-year year earnings to reach last year's level. Most analysts see after-tax income of around Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.1bn, compared with last year's Pounds 1,164m. They believe the interim dividend of 6.4p points to a yearly pay-out of 14.2p, up just under 6 per cent from last year's 13.4p. As BG's business begins to tilt towards exploration and production, however, there may be less scope for dividend growth. Exploration and production businesses cannot afford to pay out such a high proportion of their earnings in dividends as utilities, due to their greater investment needs. Looming large over all these considerations is the MMC inquiry. This could rewrite any of the agreements on prices and market share, but what BG wants most is to be allowed a fair rate of return on its pipeline and storage business. Analysts suggest that the MMC may agree, recognising that adequate returns on investment not just for BG but for its competitors are needed to safeguard the growth of the industry. It could, of course, go further and recommend the break-up of BG. Analysts are divided on whether this could unlock shareholder value. Spedding says the real decision for small investors is not whether to move out of British Gas and into other stocks, but whether to switch from equities into bonds or cash. 'I view British Gas almost as a kind of index-linked gilt,' he says, 'but at a yield of 8 per cent, I'm getting a lot better return than I would from a gilt.' Don't forget to tell Sid.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Nafta's future in balance over side deals THE FUTURE of the North American Free Trade Agreement is in the balance, pending decisions by the US, Canada and Mexico on a handful of politically sensitive side deals on labour and the environment. The uncertainty was summed up by a Canadian official yesterday who said the three countries were 'very, very close' to an agreement, but that 'there are a couple of really tough issues which people have to think through'. After almost two weeks of talks in Washington, which ended on Monday afternoon, negotiators are now reporting back to their governments on the remaining obstacles. The three countries' trade ministers met for more than five hours on Monday. Senior negotiators may meet again tomorrow, depending on the prospects for breaking the deadlock. One official said it had become impossible to look more than '24 or 36 hours ahead'. The most intractable issues remain enforcement of the two side agreements and the sanctions which would be applied for non-compliance. Canada, in particular, is resisting US efforts to penalise violations of environmental and labour standards with compulsory trade remedies. 'We see protectionism written all over that,' one Canadian official said. The Mexicans, who have more at stake in Nafta as a whole, are understood to be taking a more flexible line on the sanctions issue. A number of alternatives have been proposed, including fines levied against violators, and a 'menu' of sanctions from which the parties could choose in the event of a dispute. Another possibility is that the US will conclude separate enforcement agreements with Canada and Mexico. On the labour front, the three countries have yet to agree on the scope of domestic labour legislation. A strong political element is clouding the closing stages of the Nafta talks. The Clinton administration cannot afford to sign a deal which does not have a reasonable chance of being ratified by the two houses of Congress. In Canada, the Progressive Conservative government faces a general election within the next three months. Free trade is not popular among Canadian voters, and Prime Minister Kim Campbell is unlikely to approve any deal which can be interpreted as 'caving in' to the Americans.</p>

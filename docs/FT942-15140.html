			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: JFK: the hidden force moving the Dow - Wall Street When facts are scarce, superstition tends to fill the vacuum: and in the absence of any clear indication of which way the US stock market is headed next, Wall Street is being entertained by a number of more-or-less crackpot theories purporting to forecast trends. One of the more enchanting propositions to have been aired this week was the one that pointed to an astonishing parallel (shown in the chart above right) between the market's performance since Bill Clinton's election as president and its behaviour during John F Kennedy first years in office. Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the securities house First Albany, pointed out in a Wall Street Journal article on Thursday that both Clinton and Kennedy were young, untested Democrats and in both cases, stocks slid during the election campaigns as investors braced themselves for an adverse change in the financial climate. Yet in each case, stocks pulled out of their decline shortly before the election and rose steeply during the presidents' first year. Then, near the end of the first year, the trend came abruptly to a halt, and decline set in. In the second year of the Kennedy administration stocks slid steadily from March to June, so if history continued to repeat itself, today's market could expect a good deal more of a drubbing before the next upturn. Indeed, Ned Davis, the Florida market researcher who first remarked on the parallel, thinks the downturn will be even worse this time because peak valuations are higher. Is it all nonsense? Sooner or later, these parallels usually break down. But Johnson points out that there are similarities in the fundamentals, too. In both cases, the economy was improving after a recession, the stock market had just had an unusually strong decade, and the Federal Reserve was leaning towards restraint. Parallels notwithstanding, some analysts at least cling to the hope that the first-quarter earnings figures will give the market a lift as investors see how quickly corporate profits are rising. But even that hope looked forlorn when Motorola, the electronics and semiconductor company, brought out its figures on Monday. Continuing last year's rapid growth, Motorola reported net profits of Dollars 298m for the quarter, an increase of no less than 46 per cent from the comparable period. But even that was not enough for a jaded market: investors decided it was time to take profits and flee, prompting a run on the technology sector as a whole. In one sense, you can hardly blame them when you look at the fragility of the profits reported by companies hitherto regarded as bastions of integrity. Two of the biggest companies in the US this week confessed to bizarre goings-on that affected their bottom lines. One was Woolworth, the five-and-dime store operator that is trying to transform itself into a niche retailer with subsidiaries such as the Foot Locker sports shoe chain. After earlier warning that it had launched an investigation into the accuracy of last year's quarterly figures, it confirmed on Wednesday that the tiny profits it reported for the first two quarters were illusory. The explanation, it seems, is that costs which should properly have been taken in the first two quarters were actually deferred until later in the year. Still to emerge is whether it was done accidentally or on purpose, and how many heads will roll. But if a company of Woolworth's stature cannot be relied upon to report its figures properly, who can investors trust? The Woolworth announcement came only a day after Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, announced that it would be taking a charge of Dollars 102m to net profits in its quarterly results to cover its losses on two highly-leveraged interest-rate swap contracts that came unstuck when interest rates rose in the US and Germany. It is one thing for Wall Street investment firms or hedge fund operators such as George Soros to gamble away hundreds of millions of dollars by speculating on high-risk financial derivatives, but investors may feel things have gone too far when a soap and nappy manufacturer starts getting involved, too. Procter &amp; Gamble said it was terribly sorry and would not do it again, 'reassigned' its treasurer, and said it was considering legal action against its financial adviser, Bankers Trust. But it was all a case of shutting the door after the horse had bolted, as far as shareholders were concerned. Years ago, when Procter &amp; Gamble launched the world's first fluoride toothpaste under the brand name Crest, it coined the famous slogan: 'Look, Mom - no cavities]' If only the same could be said of its profits today.  ----------------------------------------------------- Monday                 3688.83  + 14.57 Tuesday                3681.69 -  7.14 Wednesday              3661.47 - 20.22 Thursday               3663.25  +  1.78 Friday                 3661.47 -  1.78  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope fails to dispel gloom - Group's shares continue to fall as prospect of viable rescue wanes Stanhope's share price fell 26 per cent yesterday, after the heavily indebted property developer revealed that potential rescuers were unlikely to match last Friday's depressed share price. The share price has almost halved in the past two weeks, and closed 5p lower yesterday at 14p. The price has been hit by share sales from a former director, but also by growing evidence that refinancing discussions have not progressed, and that Stanhope's time is running out. The group has Pounds 130m of bank debt, and insufficient revenues to fund it. It needs to sell assets - primarily its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate Properties, the City of London property company - or secure refinancing, before a hands-off agreement with its banks expires on December 19. Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive and owner of 29 per cent of Stanhope, said yesterday that whatever happened, the company would be forced to sell assets. The company has had a number of approaches, and Mr Lipton said there remained three bidders, but he said negotiations were at both a 'preliminary and conditional stage'. It is understood that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which both run substantial property funds, are now waiting on the sidelines after expressing initial interest. Stanhope's banks, led by Barclays, are currently reviewing a new set of financing proposals presented by the company, but have given no response. Mr Lipton said it was too early to say 'whether a recapitalisation would be more or less beneficial for shareholders than the terms that might be available from a possible offer'. The company's difficulties will play into the hands of British Land, which has secured a ringside seat at the auction by buying 30 per cent of Stanhope's shares. British Land would not comment on the state of negotiations, but said: 'If there is someone who is interested out there, they would be wise to come and talk to us, both because of our known interest in Broadgate and our major shareholding in Stanhope.' The initial share purchase by British Land resulted in the collapse of negotiations that had been taking place earlier this year with a south-east Asian investor which wanted to take a majority stake in the company. One property banker said: 'Stanhope has been sitting there waiting for a fairy godmother to come out of the wings and rescue it. It is finally sinking in that this is very unlikely to materialise.' Analysts suggest that Broadgate would fetch less than Pounds 1bn, almost certainly leaving Stanhope with a negative net value. The alternative of bank refinancing would result in high costs, and the falling share price would make it difficult to pursue a debt-for-equity swap.</p>

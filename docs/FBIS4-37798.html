			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The entire West Bank has been the scene of bloody  demonstrations against the Zionist usurpers on Wednesday [23  June]. The demonstrations have been staged at a time when  thousands of Palestinians in the Zionist regime's prisons are  staging a hunger-strike to protest against the anti-human  policies of that regime. Hundreds of Palestinians in Nablus,  Ramallah, Jerusalem, and Bethelem cities staged demonstrations  in support of the Palestinian prisoners protesting against the  Zionist usurpers' policies of detaining and suppressing the  Palestinians. Tens of Palestinians were subjected to the burst  of machine gun fire during clashes between the Israeli troops  and the Palestinian protesters and a large number of them were  wounded.    At this important juncture what we are witnessing is the  fact  that the peace-seeking mask has fallen from the face of the  Zionist usurpers. As a matter of fact, despite its earlier  commitments regarding having negotiations with all the Arab  delegations within the framework of the Security Council  resolutions, the Zionist regime concluded the Gaza-Ariha  (Jericho) accord by violating the commitment; the accord, that  on the basis of international law, has no legal link with the  principle of autonomy.    Despite Israel's commitment thousands of Palestinians are  still being detained in the dreaded Israeli prisons. The  Israeli officials have informed the PLO of their conditions,  saying the Palestinian prisoners should sign undertakings in  confirmation of the Gaza-Ariha accord and following their  release they will not be permitted to return to their  birth-places. They can only live in Gaza and Ariha. There is  no doubt that the announcement of these conditions by the  Zionist usurpers is a breach of international agreements,  especially the fourth Geneva convention which rejects any  disrespect to life and property of a nation under occupation and  condemns the same.    On the other hand such a move by the Zionist regime is a  blatant violation of all the commitments signed by the regime  which has promised to free all the prisoners unconditionally.    Now in light of these facts the world opinion is once again  confronted with the reality that it is the inefficiency of the  world bodies, especially that of the UN in dealing with the  regime firmly that has encouraged the Zionist regime to continue  the massacre and suppression of the innocent Palestinian nation.</p>

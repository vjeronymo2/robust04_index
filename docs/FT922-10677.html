			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Nurses concerned at role of pay body DIFFERENCES emerged yesterday between the Royal College of Nursing and the government over how National Health Service trusts should interpret recommendations from the independent nurses' pay review body. Mr Phil Gray, RCN director of labour relations, told reporters at the annual congress in Blackpool trusts should use nationally recommended pay levels as a baseline on which they could improve if they wished. The Department of Health believes trusts should use national rates as a 'benchmark', or rough guide. Trusts in theory are able to offer lower rates at the local level. Earlier this week, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, addressing the congress, refused to bind NHS trusts to observe pay levels set by the pay review body. It would be kept as a benchmark but trusts 'must be free to fix their own rates,' she said. No trust has yet offered rates of pay lower than those set by the review body. The vast majority have this year stayed with nationally recommended rates, although some have varied national terms and conditions of employment. Some 90 per cent of nurses are still covered by the terms of the pay review body, because staff who have transferred from local health authority control to trusts can retain their terms and conditions of employment. Mr Gray warned of chaos if there were wide variations of pay in a locality.</p>

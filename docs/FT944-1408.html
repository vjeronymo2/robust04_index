			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eni sees profit rising to more than L2,500bn Eni, Italy's state-owned chemicals and energy group, said yesterday it was heading for a net consolidated profit of more than L2,500bn (Dollars 1.53bn) for 1994. The announcement was made to 100 top managers of Eni at a convention last week, and is the latest in a series of optimistic statements intended to smooth the way for partial privatisation of the group next year. Eni said turnover would rise to L54,500bn for 1994, in spite of the continuing programme of asset sales and winding-up of subsidiaries. The group, still burdened by debt, returned to profit in 1993 when it made L419bn after tax, on turnover of L53,900bn. The Italian government has put the most profitable oil and gas divisions of Eni on the list for privatisation during 1995, but the timetable is crowded by other proposed sell-offs. However, Eni said the group had 'the wind in its sails'. Its divestment programme has raised some L4,100bn since September 1992, helping reduce debt in 1994 by L3,000bn to L25,000bn. The quoted chemicals subsidiary, Enichem, had returned to operating profit following an extensive restructuring.</p>

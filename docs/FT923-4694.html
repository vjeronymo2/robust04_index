			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lose headway on Italian, US blows BOURSES turned down again in the course of yesterday, reflecting a lack of buying enthusiasm, the Italian discount rate increase and the US jobless figures, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS remained volatile although traders were encouraged by what was felt to be a strong performance from President Francois Mitterrand during Thursday night's televised debate on Maastricht. Some analysts said that the current view was that the referendum, which opened officially for campaigning yesterday, would result in a Yes vote. The CAC-40 swung between a day's high of 1,803 and a low of 1,751 before settling to close 1.48 lower at 1,778.98, but 5.4 per cent stronger on the week. Corporate news provided a number of features with Euro Disney and Carrefour both prominent. Shares in the theme park operator were boosted in early trade on news of better-than-expected attendance figures but later fell back after Paribas in London said that it had reiterated its sell recommendation. Euro Disney shares, which had seen FFr88.00 early on, fell back to FFr77.50 before bargain hunters stepped in, bringing the shares up 10 centimes on the day to FFr82.00. Volume was heavy at 745,000 shares. Trading in Carrefour was suspended at FFr2,300, down FFr179 or 7.2 per cent ahead of an announcement from the group after the market had closed. There were rumours, later substantiated, that the retailer would report a serious decline in first half earnings, and that Mr Michel Bon had resigned as chairman. MILAN moved from in-session stability, with the Comit index 0.08 higher at 371.51 (if 5.6 per cent down on the week) into further decline in the post bourse. The MIB all-share index was an indicated 1.8 per cent lower in the later afternoon, following the 1.75 percentage point lift in the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 15 per cent. Fiat fixed L102 firmer at L3,873, then tumbled L258 to L3,615 on the kerb. Pirelli dropped L65 to L1,074 while the computer company, Olivetti, fell L66 to L1,970 and Mediobanca, having broken through technical support at L10,000 earlier this week, shed another L495 to L8,600. FRANKFURT showed some deterioration in the post bourse, but damage had already been done when the DAX index closed just 5.75 higher at 1,536.50, nine points off its high and 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Turnover rose from DM4.3bn to DM4.9bn. Dealers said that a further fall in west German industrial orders had added to mounting evidence of a stagnating economy and built up the pressure on the downside, but that more significant pressure had come on talk of a substantial earnings downgrade for Volkswagen by Morgan Stanley. VW dropped DM4.20 to DM315.80 on the day, and was quoted at DM314 in London later. In steels, Thyssen suffered from talk of a downgrade by another securities house, and closed DM6.90 lower at DM196.50; dealers said that investors dumped Thyssen, and bought Mannesmann which closed DM5.50 higher at DM238.00. AMSTERDAM fell back slightly, in line with the weaker dollar. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.4 to 109.9, marginally lower on the week. Impressive results from Elsevier early in the session lifted sentiment as its first half figures exceeded most analysts' forecasts. Its shares closed Fl 2.60 firmer at Fl 112.20. Heineken closed 70 cents up at Fl 172.70 ahead of its interim results, announced after the close. BRUSSELS managed a slight gain ahead of the weekend. The Bel-20 index rose 3.5 to 1,070.36, up 0.7 per cent on the week. Petrofina advanced BFr110 to BFr8,670 while Solvay went against the trend, closing BFr125 lower at BFr11,750 with some 2,850 shares traded. Delhaize put on BFr6 to BFr1,500 before announcing a 3.6 per cent rise in first half profits, after the close. MADRID was distinguished by its relative calm, the general index closing 0.12 higher at 216.42 and consolidating a rise of 5.3 per cent on the week. Nordic markets were volatile, COPENHAGEN featuring a fall of another DKr5 to DKr59 in East Asiatic in a continued reaction last week's loss announcement as the CSE index rose 2.82 to 271.75. Meanwhile, Aker remained OSLO's latest open wound, the A falling NKr2.5 more to NKr30 in a flat market. Aker closed 40 per cent down on a week which took in a costly costs debacle for its Norwegian Contractors subsidiary. VIENNA was firmer with the ATX index gaining 9.32 to 730.53, a 1.8 per cent rise on the week. Wienerberger, the building materials supplier, was one of the most active issues, up Sch100 at Sch3,200.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 4                             Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm   2 pm**    3 pm     close 1036.64  1034.18  1032.32  1029.50  1030.34  1022.17  1025.63  1029.27               Day's High  1036.74    Day's Low  1017.92          Sep 3       Sep 2      Sep 1       Aug 28      Aug 27        1031.46     1011.19    1007.79      1013.54     1017.14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Indicative.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

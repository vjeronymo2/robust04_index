			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  Government has lodged a strong protest with the Government of  Burkina Faso and declared the suspension of China's diplomatic  relations with Burkina Faso.    According to reports from Ouagadougou, Li Yongqian, Chinese  ambassador to Burkina Faso, made serious representations with  the Government of Burkina Faso yesterday. He solemnly stated  that as the Government of Burkina Faso had "restored" the  so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities,  the Chinese Government lodged a strong protest with the  Government of Burkina Faso and declared the suspension of  China's diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso.    Li pointed out that by doing so, the Burkina Faso Government  had gone back on its solemn commitment contained in the  communique of September 15, 1973 on the establishment of  diplomatic relations between China and Burkina Faso that it  recognized the Government of the People's Republic of China as  the sole legal government representing the entire Chinese  people, seriously undermining the existing friendly relations  and cooperation between the two countries and the friendship  between the two peoples.    He announced that the Government of the People's Republic of  China decided, therefore, to suspend its diplomatic relations  with Burkina Faso as of that day.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Teams tackle 'market access' THE US and the European Community have set up technical teams to study their different interpretations of 'market access', Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said yesterday. Market access, or the lack of it, has been a serious stumbling-block in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks held under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The decision to set up these teams was reached in recent talks in Brussels with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner. The teams are expected to complete their task before the G7 meeting in Tokyo in July. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said on Wednesday that US and EC trade negotiators had made 'some progress' in talks to produce a 'large market access package'. The two are negotiating in 12 industrial product areas, and in most of them they are 'getting very close' to agreement to reduce the tariffs on both sides to zero. Last November, the US and the EC ended a five-year bilateral row over oilseeds when the EC agreed to limit its planted acreage. Under the accord - the so-called Blair House agreement - there would be an output limit of 9.7m tonnes on this year's crop yields, or 11m tonnes on the basis of last year's yields. Mr Espy said he regarded the Blair House accord as a 'bilateral discussion' but one which was 'already concluded'. But the definition of market access remained 'very vague'. If it was not clarified, the Uruguay Round would not pass through the US Congress. But progress towards broader enactment of these reforms would be 'a slow journey'. He criticised French opposition to the Blair House agreement, although the approach under the new government of Mr Edouard Balladur had been more restrained. 'The angriest protesters, ' Mr Espy said, 'are ones with tractors - especially if those protesters speak French'.</p>

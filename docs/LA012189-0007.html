			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUPLE IN LA JOLLA CRY FOUL OVER STATE DENIAL OF ELDERLY-CARE LICENSE  </P> <P> Mary O'Rourke has her Irish up over governmental bureaucracy in general and  over the people in particular who have labeled her gracious home "unfit" and  claimed she's running the "Worst Little Boarding House in La Jolla."  </P> <P> The fact is, she claims, state officials are trying to run her out of business  so that her "guests" will be forced to move to the large, new nursing homes  that have opened in recent years and are lacking patients.  </P> <P> O'Rourke and her husband, Raymond, opened O'Rourke Residential Care Home in the  shadow of the posh La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club in 1975 and, for five years,  did a thriving business in caring for the elderly under a residential care home  license.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ambulances Not Welcomed  </P> <P> She acknowledges that her enterprise creates a bit of disruption in the quiet  La Jolla Shores neighborhood just a block or so from the palm-lined beach. The  inevitable emergency ambulance arrivals in the wee hours of the night haven't  been welcomed on the otherwise-quiet Lowry Terrace.  </P> <P> There's no love lost between O'Rourke and her neighbors, but she says she has  no proof that they are using their considerable influence to prevent her from  running her care home.  </P> <P> "There's another Mary O'Rourke living around here," she said. "Maybe they have  the two of us mixed up. Maybe we are being blamed for things that she did."  </P> <P> In 1980, O'Rourke said, the state Department of Social Services took over from  the county the enforcement of licensing for residential care homes, and she  found herself in instant trouble. But state officials say they have always  issued the licenses.  </P> <P> "I was a teacher of handicapped children before I retired and had thought to  open my home to them," O'Rourke said. But county welfare officials urged her to  turn her energies to the elderly because of the great need for small,  neighborhood-based care facilities.  </P> <P> When the state took over the inspections and licensing, O'Rourke said, she  found that her spacious La Jolla Shores residence wasn't up to par, despite its  million-dollar view and its half-acre of pines and landscaping.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renewal Refused  </P> <P> When her license came up for renewal in November, 1981, the state inspectors  refused to grant her another. Since then, O'Rourke said, "I've been harassed  and driven crazy by inspectors and court hearings and such."  </P> <P> In the seven years since she lost her license, O'Rourke has continued to care  for elderly people in her home.  </P> <P> "I rent rooms," she said.  </P> <P> State licensing inspectors say a residential care home, by any other name, is  still a care home when its guests require aid in everyday activities such as  dressing, walking or maintaining cleanliness. And a residential care home  requires a state license.  </P> <P> Mary O'Rourke now has as guests a woman, bright-eyed and cheerful, who will  soon celebrate her 102nd birthday, and another elderly roomer in her 80s, a  former dancer and the spitting image of Martha Graham, who is confined to a  wheelchair.  </P> <P> "We had seven fire inspections one year, when there is only supposed to be  one," O'Rourke complained. "They want us to have an 8-foot-wide hallway. Who  has an 8-foot-wide hallway? And why?"  </P> <P> Licensing inspectors visited the O'Rourke home this week, asking the elderly  guests whether they were happy, asking them if they knew what day it was and  where they were.  </P> <P> "It upsets my guests terribly, and those people shouldn't be coming out here  while this matter is in court," O'Rourke said.  </P> <P> Mary Delmast of the state licensing office in San Diego differs with O'Rourke's  assessment. It is the care that the elderly are, or are not, receiving that is  causing the state to try to close down the O'Rourkes, she said.  </P> <P> Tom Hersant, the licensing office bureau chief, agrees. It is not the sumptuous  surroundings that do not measure up, it is the level of care required by the  O'Rourkes' tenants. And these elderly people require aid that is not being  provided, he said.  </P> <P> John H. Sanders, the state deputy attorney general who has been trying to shut  down the O'Rourkes' care home for more than three years, said the battle has  been frustrating.  </P> <P> Although the state denied renewal of the license in 1981, he explained, the  actual closure order was not issued until Sept. 6, 1985, because of appeals  filed by the O'Rourkes' son, Albert.  </P> <P> "Most families, confronted with the inevitable, would have given up and found  some other way to earn a living. But not the O'Rourkes," Sanders said.  </P> <P> After the O'Rourkes continued to operate a residential care home despite a  court injunction against it, Sanders filed a criminal contempt-of-court  complaint against them.  </P> <P> During the contempt hearings, Judge Richard Huffman -- then a Superior Court  judge who has since been elevated to the appellate bench -- became concerned  that Mary O'Rourke was mentally incapable of understanding the charges against  her and ordered her to submit to a psychiatric examination, which she failed.  </P> <P> The judge declared a mistrial and ordered a re-examination of O'Rourke in six  months. Earlier this month, attorney Albert O'Rourke said his mother had not  kept the appointment for a re-examination in December because she was  physically unable to. Superior Court Judge Michael Greer set a new examination  date for Feb. 3 and continued the case until March 7, Sanders said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, O'Rourke continues to play hostess to her elderly guests,  convinced that she, not the state, knows how to keep them healthy and happy.  </P> <P> For $65 a day, she is supplying a fine home, plenty of food, lots of tender  loving care to her guests, she claimed, and "I don't think the state has any  right to stop me."  </P></p>

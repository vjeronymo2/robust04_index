			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Building output at two-year high Construction output in the second quarter of this year was the highest for more than two years, figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show, Andrew Taylor writes. Contractors, which this week reported sharp falls in construction profits for the first six months of the year, said overcapacity in the industry had meant profit margins remained very depressed in spite of an increase in orders. The total value of output in constant 1990 prices rose 4 per cent in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year. It rose 1 per cent against the first quarter of this year. Private-sector housing was 14 per cent higher than the same period last year and 3 per cent higher on the previous quarter. Private industrial output was 11 per cent and 8 per cent higher respectively while private commercial output rose 6 per cent and 1 per cent. Infrastructure work was down 13 per cent on the same period last year but rose 4 per cent over the first quarter. Too many chasing too little; Costain results, Page 8</p>

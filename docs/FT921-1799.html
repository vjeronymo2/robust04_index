			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (7): Entry may not be so rapid  -EC membership CYPRUS IS closer to Baghdad than to Brussels, but that is all the more reason for Cypriots to feel strongly about joining the European Community. Political as much as economic considerations were behind the decision by President George Vassiliou's internationally recognised government to seek EC membership in July 1990, on behalf of both the island's communities. Mr Vassiliou was under strong domestic pressure to carry out his campaign promise of two years earlier, especially since the list of countries seeking membership was rapidly growing. Still, there was a marked lack of enthusiasm among larger EC member-states over the timing of the application. Moreover, Mr Rauf Denktash, leader of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot republic in the north of the island, who was not consulted, was so annoyed at the move that he broke off official contacts with the Greek Cypriots for months. It was only to be expected that the de facto partition of Cyprus after 1974, resulting in increased economic disparity as the north stagnated while the south maintained a growth rate comparable with countries in south-east Asia, should loom as an almost insurmountable obstacle to accession. An EC working group headed by Mr Abel Matutes, the commissioner for Mediterranean affairs, is to issue a formal opinion on the Cypriot bid for membership by the end of this year. But after the collapse last month of President George Bush's reunification initiative, it is not even certain whether the EC officials will be welcome in northern Cyprus. Greek Cypriot officials like to point out that on their side of the island, per capita income is higher than in Greece and Portugal, both EC members, while the growth rate in the 1980s was well above the Community average, with inflation only now slightly higher. 'If you factor in the figures for the north, the economy still compares favourably those of Mediterranean members of EC,' says an economist who follows developments in northern Cyprus. A customs union agreement signed in 1987 with the EC provides for gradual lifting of most import duties by 1998, though some manufacturing industries will continue to be protected from the effects of European competition. A full customs union is due to come into effect five years later. At that time, quotas on Cypriot farm exports popular in western Europe, such as potatoes and grapes, will be removed. The Community has long been the biggest trading partner for internationally recognised Cyprus, although its share of Cypriot trade overall has shown only a slow rise since the tariff agreement was introduced in 1988. In 1990, 52.9 per cent of imports originated in the EC, while 47.4 per cent of exports went to Community members, mainly Britain and Greece. Government planners say they are structuring economic policy as if Cyprus were to join the EC later this decade. Value-added tax is to be introduced on July 1, at a single-tier rate of 5 per cent, though it is forecast to rise sharply in 1993. The Cyprus pound is to be unofficially pegged to the Ecu later this year. However, if this commitment is to be followed through, it would involve some politically wrenching decisions over lifting exchange controls and the 9 per cent interest rate ceiling. The island's future as an offshore business centre, together with its flourishing international shipping registry, would also start to look uncertain. On the political front, Cyprus would almost certainly have to give up its prominent position in the non-aligned movement in order to fulfil the obligations of European political union. That, if nothing else, could make some of the island's well-travelled politicians think twice about supporting a quick entry to the Community.</p>

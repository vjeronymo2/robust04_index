			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / China warns against more HK democracy JIANG ZEMIN, secretary general of the Chinese Communist party, yesterday ensured Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor designate, a bumpy introduction to the colony when he warned against any interference with the smooth transfer of sovereignty to China. His comments come as Britain is under pressure from liberals in the colony to press China to allow an increase in the number of elected seats in the Legislative Council. Britain's agreement with China does not allow the introduction of a fully democratic system. Jiang's intervention, taken with the difficulties over the financing of the colony's multi-billion dollar airport project, marks a significant raising of the diplomatic temperature between Beijing, Hong Kong and London. The impasse over the airport's financing is beginning to affect share prices in Hong Kong. Confidence in Hong Kong is more than usually fragile and brokers said that although they thought the project would proceed, the delay was starting to take its toll on sentiment. Mr Alan Lee, a member of the Executive Council, the colonial cabinet, met Jiang yesterday with 19 of his conservative supporters, who like China, want a smooth handover in 1997. Afterwards Mr Lee quoted the Chinese leader as saying 'there should not be chaos but a smooth transfer of sovereignty with a stable political system' in the colony. By raising the issue of Hong Kong's politics at Jiang's level the Chinese are indicating to London that it will face some hard talks on the issue of local democracy. Britain has said it will take up with the Chinese the question of more elected seats in the Legislative Council for the 1995 elections, and is expected to do so around the turn of the year. But it is far from clear if Mr Patten will have the whole community behind him when he raises the issue. As Mr Lee's visit to Beijing underlines, such a move is losing support among conservative political interests in the colony. Mr Lee, who is also an unelected member of the legislature, has virtually broken with the British government over its promise to approach China about increasing the number of elected seats. In London Baroness Dunn, the senior non-official Executive Council member, indicated her disapproval with UK policy when she told a House of Lords debate on Hong Kong yesterday that talk of more seats 'revives uncertainty, tension and discord in our community.' The Hong Kong branch of Beijing's Bank of China (BoC) is scheduled to issue Hong Kong dollar bank notes in 1994, three years before the British colony returns to China, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported yesterday, Reuter adds.</p>

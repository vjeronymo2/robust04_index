			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Gardening: Believing in life everlasting - Arthur Hellyer considers plants grown primarily for drying THIS HAS been a remarkable year for everlasting flowers. In part, this was because there was a very large trial of these in the Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley, Surrey - a total of 274 species and varieties, many new to me. But I also found them much in evidence when I visited trials by some of the seed firms, including Unwins and Suttons. This, I was told, was because of increasing interest by home gardeners. Flower arrangers already are seeking much greater variety. At Wisley, there were 10 varieties of nigella, the pretty, cornflower-like Love-in-a-Mist of which the old favourite, Miss Jekyll (now available in separate colours of blue, rose and white) is still the best. There was also the popular mix of colours sold as Persian Jewels. I would have regarded all of these normally as mainly flowers for the border and for cutting fresh, not drying; but evidently they are very good for that, too. The same goes for the seven varieties of annual larkspur on show. But the true everlastings, the plants that always have been grown primarily for drying because of their chaffy petals, were still on view most widely. There were 64 varieties of helichrysum, filling several beds and making a most impressive display. I particularly liked Bright Bikini Mixed, which is a fine mixture of most of the available colours, but I would award even higher marks to Hot Bikini, which is entirely dark red and a little shorter in height. There was also a very pretty pale sulphur-yellow variety called Frosted Sulphur, which is in some of the seed catalogues, plus a big selection of other separate colours from white through lemon-yellow and orange to silvery rose and rose pink. Until I saw this trial, ammobium had been no more than a name to me. It turns out to be a rather odd-looking plant, around 2 ft high with winged stems and small yellow and white, daisy-type flowers. At first sight I thought it rather gaunt, but it improved on acquaintance and is certainly a plant that will bring an unusual element into any flower arrangement. It is a perennial but usually is raised annually from seed and will survive mild winters outdoors. Ammobium alatum seems to be the only species, and Grandiflorum the best variety to grow. I can understand the enthusiasm for gomphrena, popularly known as the Globe Amaranth. This is a bushy annual, up to 2 ft high with small, globe-shaped clusters of flowers which, at a short distance, look rather like those of clover. There are two species: Gomphrena Globusa, which is a true annual, and G. haageana, which is a perennial grown almost invariably as an annual. As plants for cut flowers, there does not seem a lot to choose between them. Colours include pink, red, apricot-orange, purple, violet and white, and most flower arrangers probably will be suited best by a mixture of all these shades. What gardeners usually call statice is, in fact, limonium. There were many varieties of these at Wisley, mainly forms of Limonium sinuatum which is the commonest annual kind. What struck me was the number of unusual colours, especially in shades of pink. One was called Apricot, which describes it fairly well, but another called Peach was named less happily (still, breeders must be allowed some latitude in this respect). A third that I rate highly was called Roseum Superbum and there also was an excellent variety of the odd-looking L. suworowii, named Pink Pokers, which was a good, deep, rosy pink. What I liked most, though, was a very small white-flowered plant called L. sinense Confetti. The second name does not seem to be recognised by any authority, but Confetti should be sufficient for identification and I have come across it in the Unwin seed trials. It is very free-flowering, and the effect is rather like that of a single-flowered perennial gypsophila. There was also some confusion at Wisley in the naming of amaranthus, different species of which are known by gardeners as Love Lies Bleeding and Prince's Feather. Both types are popular for summer bedding, the first having long trails of catkin-like flowers, the second with erect branch spikes of flowers. Once again, it is safe to bypass the second botanical names and go direct to the garden name since, by the internationally approved rules governing such matters, each of these can apply only to one distinct variety. Using this shorthand form of naming, I have no doubt that the three best varieties of Prince's Feather at Wisley were Oeschberg, which is deep crimson, grows 4 ft high and makes a bushy plant; Red Cathedral, which is very much like Oeschberg; and Bronze Standard, an unusual colour described as grey-bronze. The best Love Lies Bleeding was Viridis, with long trails of green flowers; but for those who lack room for such a large plant, there was Green Thumb, with erect 12in spikes of green flowers. I had not seen this before and thought it very distinctive.</p>

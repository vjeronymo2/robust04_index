			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Staff report: "Extremists Join Ilinden United Macedonian </F> Organization"]    [Text] On 23 March it became clear that activists of the  Union for the Prosperity of Pirin Macedonia [SPPM] have joined  the illegal Ilinden United Macedonian Organization [OMO].    The SPPM secretly decided in Blagoevgrad to dissolve itself  and join the OMO, where it "could be more useful" in the  struggle for the autonomy of Pirin Macedonia. SPPM leader Alan  Andonov had already resigned.    The SPPM has about 1,500 members and its ideas are similar  to  those of the OMO. However, its independent activity was  aggravated by the investigation of the regional security service  and attacks in the Bulgarian press.    The organization gained some prominence when the Russian  nationalist Zhirinovskiy visited Sandanski. Then it became  clear that Ossetian Alan Andonov was the commissary of the  illegal "red units" in Bulgaria. They were established in  Sandanski in 1992 to protect the interests of the Bulgarian  Communist Party [BCP] and the struggle against U.S. imperialists  and bourgeois ethics. However, later on relations between  Andonov and Vladimir Spasov, chief of the BCP Central Committee,  cooled, and the Ossetian now embraces the ideas of nationalism.  The SPPM supported the recognition of Macedonian, Pomak, and  Slav-Muslim minority rights in Bulgaria, in accordance with the  program adopted at the end of September.    The scandalous news conference in Sofia of OMO Secretary  Jordan Kostadinov galvanized the most right-wing elements in the  Pirin region. The one-man organization, Slave Makedonski,  considered until now the chairman and member of several  organizations hitherto considered moderate, also joined the OMO.  On 23 March his newspaper MAKEDONETS carried the illegal  SKORNUVANE (AWAKENING) as a supplement. Its previous issue had  been confiscated for its anti-Bulgarian propaganda.    The newspaper, written in a mixed Macedonian-Bulgarian  dialect, points out that from 22 to 24 May militant nationalists  intend to organize an international symposium of the  "Macedonians of Pirin Macedonia." The Initiative Committee has  reportedly invited emigrees from Australia, Germany, and Canada.  They were supposed to come with their pockets full of money to  finance the symposium. The delegates will visit Melnik and  sample the famous wine made in this town.</p>

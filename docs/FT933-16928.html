			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Letter: US labour market trend offers no solution for EC unemployment Sir, You report that, to deal with the EC unemployment problem, John Major and others have argued for less regulation of EC labour markets ('Major fires broadside at social policy', June 22). Within the news story and your editorial ('EC plan from Mr Delors') the US is presented as an example of a country where a 'flexible' labour market has allowed more job creation than in the EC. The intentions of Mr Major's government further to deregulate labour markets were made clear in the report on the upcoming Trade Union Reform and Employment Bill ('A-Z of the new law for employers, workers', June 22). The law, by allowing employers to pay more to workers who forego collective bargaining rights and accept individual contracts, aims seriously to undermine the influence of unions by allowing workers to be penalised for choosing to be members of legal organisations. The fact that anyone can present the US as an example of labour market practice astounds me. Yes, the strength of unions has diminished over the last 20 years. An importantcause has been the loss of unionised manufacturing jobs and their replacement by low paying, insecure service jobs lacking union protection. Nearly everyone agrees the overwhelming majority of jobs created in the US in the last decade have been of this type rather than of jobs allowing the middle-class existence and prospects which an earlier generation took for granted. The declining or stagnant real US wages of the last 15 years, and growing inequality, are the direct results. Is this the shining star that EC policy makers want to follow? This is not to belittle what is a real problem. Unemployment is rife in all the industrialised countries but its solution must be coupled with moves to guarantee living standards, security and maintenance of workplace standards. How to do this is a big task requiring innovative thinking by governments, unions and employers. This is not made easier by focusing on ideological solutions or ignoring the inequality and injustice 'flexible' labour markets create.

The FCCC, promoted by the United Nations as an environmental  protection measure and based on conclusions reached during the  1992 earth summit, went into effect Monday.    Under the FCCC, emissions of carbon dioxide and other  "greenhouse" gases are to be limited to their 1990 levels.    The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously estimated that  the carbon dioxide level in Taiwan in 2000 would be up 109  percent over the 1990 level.    EPA officials said that although Taiwan is not a UN member,  it would not turn away from its responsibility as a member of  international community and observe the convention.    They noted that Taiwan is prepared to submit a report on its  progress in reducing carbon dioxide emissions during the first  FCCC conference to be held next March in Berlin.</p>

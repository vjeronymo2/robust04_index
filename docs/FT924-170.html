			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Personal View: Time to open EC door The fifth Danish presidency of the European Community - and the third for the present Danish government - begins on Friday. I am looking forward to being in the chair again, because we are living in 'interesting times', as the old Chinese curse goes. When Denmark joined the European Community 20 years ago, the world was dominated by two superpowers. Since then a global revolution has taken place. One superpower has gone, and everyone is looking anxiously for a new order. The most important question, therefore, during the Danish presidency is: how should the EC respond to that challenge? The answer will be decisive, not only for the EC 12, but for the rest of Europe. All the other European countries are looking to the EC as the framework through which economic success and political stability can be achieved. Our answer must be an open EC. We must cease looking inwards, spending most of our time with the EC's own institutional problems. We must offer membership right away to the most advanced of our neighbours, and support others in preparing their entry through extensive EC agreements. At the same time, the EC must continue its process of integration in order to strengthen economies and democratic institutions. Following the Edinburgh summit in October, the agenda for the Danish presidency is more or less set. An important task will be to implement the Edinburgh decisions on subsidiarity and transparency. Denmark should know the importance of this even better than its 11 colleagues, since it has experienced the widening gap between political decision-takers and their constituencies with regard to the EC. The result of the Danish referendum last June - and the debate since then in most other member states, not least the UK - has underlined the need to react to the widespread popular apprehension that the EC has become increasingly centralised and closed. Therefore nearness and openness have to be keywords in the future development of the EC. As decided at Edinburgh, one of the tasks on the Danish agenda in the next six months will be the start of enlargement negotiations with Sweden, Finland and Austria - and very soon Norway. It will be up to the Danish presidency to organise the talks in such a way that the EC can increase its membership from 12 to 16 in 1995. Another significant result at Edinburgh was the agreement on financial reform for the period 1993-99. This agreement will have to be implemented in the necessary legal acts. January 1 marks a symbolic milestone in the Community - the formal realisation of the internal market. The original 300 proposals for implementing the internal market have almost all been adopted - the internal market, therefore, already has a history of success. But it is a process that will have to be continuously developed and adapted. For this reason, it is important to read the clear political messages from all member countries: something more must be done for promoting employment for the almost 16m unemployed in the Community. A growth policy will therefore have to be established. Another important concern will be environmental policy - Denmark will stress that the principle of subsidiarity should not be abused to carry through inappropriate re-nationalisation. The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will also be a priority. We shall try to secure a speedy and well-balanced Gatt agreement. When it comes to European political co-operation, there is no doubt that the situation in the former Yugoslavia will be the most demanding task. The need for progress is increasingly evident. Central and eastern Europe are also not stable. A worsening of economic crises there could easily have political consequences leading to new confrontations and conflicts. These countries are our immediate neighbours. We have a special responsibility towards them. Therefore it was agreed in Edinburgh that, at its next meeting in Copenhagen, the European Council will decide on preparations for accession to the EC of countries from central and eastern Europe. In the former Soviet Union, the potential for conflicts is large. Here an active effort to promote the reform process is needed. The remaining superpower, the US, will change its administration in January. It is important that good relations with the incoming American president are fast established. A well-functioning transatlantic alliance is a precondition for an effective performance, when it comes to the international challenges we are facing. It will also be Denmark's task to speak on behalf of the 12 in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, while the Middle East peace conference and Africa are other priorities. The agenda is full indeed. This presidency is going to be the most demanding Denmark has ever held. The author is foreign minister of Denmark.</p>

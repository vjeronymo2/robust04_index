			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Veselka Damyanova and Lidiya Lecheva] </F>   [Excerpts] A check by specialists from the Kozloduy  Nuclear Power Plant in the public health protection zone around  the nuclear plant established that milk produced at the dairy  farm of the labor collective farm (now in liquidation) in the  town of Oryakhovo was radioactive. The milk was found to  contain radioactive cesium-137, and the degree of radioactive  contamination was found to be 30 becquerels per liter. The  results of measurements taken on two successive days -- 23 and  24 March -- were the same. On 30 March, the instruments  established the presence of cesium in the milk with a  radioactivity of 60 becquerels per liter. The source of the  contamination proved to be silage pit that had been sealed off  some time ago. A lack of food for the animals obliged the dairy  farm workers to resort to the feed buried in the pit. On 1  April, measurements taken showed that the fodder had a  radioactivity of 800 becquerels per kilogram. [passage omitted]    On 4 April 1994, a commission comprised of representatives  from the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Kozloduy  Nuclear Power Plant, and other authorities with an interest in  the problem decided on measures to render the area safe.    The specialists assert that no one has consumed the  contaminated milk and that it did not enter the commercial  market. [passage omitted]</p>

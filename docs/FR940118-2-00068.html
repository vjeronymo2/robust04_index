			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The divestiture requirement will be satisfied if the defendants have entered a binding contract to sell Baroid's diamond bit business by July 1, 1994, as long as the divestiture will be completed by September 1, 1994. Also, if the defendants have not accomplished the required divestiture by July 1, but demonstrate to the United States' satisfaction that they are then engaged in negotiations with a prospective purchaser that are likely to result in the required divestiture, the United States may extend the time period for divestiture up to three more months. The defendants are prohibited by the proposed Final Judgment from selling Baroid's diamond bit business to their major competitors in the diamond drill bit market: Baker Hughes, Inc., Smith International, Inc., and Camco International, Inc. That prohibition lasts for the life of the decree. The purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business is also prohibited from combining that business with the diamond drill bit operations of any of those companies or Dresser for the life of the decree. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish both divestitures quickly, and shall cooperate with bona fide prospective purchasers by supplying all information relevant to the proposed sale. Should defendants fail to complete the divestitures by the specified deadlines to purchasers approved by the United States, the proposed Final Judgment provides for the appointment by the Court of a trustee or trustees to accomplish either or both of the divestitures. Section VI relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee to sell the drilling fluid business, and section VII relates to the selection and appointment of a trustee to sell Baroid's diamond bit business. Following the trustee's appointment, only to trustee will have the right to sell the assets to be divested, and defendants will be required to pay for all of the trustee's sale-related expenses. Should the trustee not accomplish the divestiture it is empowered to make within six months of appointment, the trustee and the parties will make recommendations to the Court, which shall enter such orders as it deems appropriate to carry out the purpose of the trust, which may include extending the trust or the term of the trustee's appointment. If a trustee is appointed to sell Baroid's diamond bit business, that business will include a license to manufacture and sell Baroid's steel-bodied diamond bits anywhere in the world, including The People's Republic of China. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment requires that the defendants or the trustee, whoever is responsible for accomplishing the divestiture at the time, notify the United States when a binding contract has been entered so that the United States has an opportunity to evaluate the purchaser. This section gives the United States the right to obtain information about the perspective purchaser. Absent written notice that the United States does not object to the proposed purchaser of the drilling fluid business, a divestiture of that business under section IV cannot be consummated. Upon the United States' objection to the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business under section V, the transaction cannot be consummated. Should the United States object to a sale of either business by the trustee, the divestiture cannot be consummated unless approved by the Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IX of the proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to submit monthly reports to the United States regarding its efforts to divest the drilling fluid business and Baroid's diamond bit business, including the status of discussions or negotiations with any person. Section X states that defendants may finance part of all of either divestiture with the prior consent of the United States. Under section XI of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants must take certain steps to ensure that, until the required divestiture has been completed, Baroid Drilling and DBS will be held separate and apart from Dresser and that both businesses, as well as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> M&hyph;I, will be maintained as viable competitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment also contains provisions designed to ensure that the purchaser of Baroid's diamond bit business will have the opportunity to hire a work force sufficient to maintain that business as an effective competitor in the United States. Under section XII of the proposed Final Judgment, defendants are required to encourage and facilitate employment by the purchaser of all Baroid employees in the United States, the preponderance of whose duties relate to Baroid's diamond bit business, and will be prohibited from employing these individuals for one year after the divestiture unless those individuals are terminated or not hired by the purchaser. In addition, defendants are required to assist the purchaser so that the purchaser may determine if it would like to hire other Baroid sales, marketing and research and development employees, the preponderance or whose duties do not relate to Baroid's diamond drill bit business. This assistance consists of providing information and consultation regarding the employees' relative job duties and performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, section XV provides that the proposed Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniversary of its entry by the Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

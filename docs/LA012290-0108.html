			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'RAINMAKER' BECK LEFT TRAIL OF LIES -- REPORT  </P> <P> Investment banker Jeffrey Beck, who helped negotiate some of the biggest  takeovers of the 1980s, continually lied about his past, fabricating stories  about his background and military service and claiming to work for the Central  Intelligence Agency, a published report said today.  </P> <P> Beck, a member of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s mergers and acquisitions  department, allegedly told friends and colleagues over the years that he had  served in the Army's Special Forces in Vietnam, that he did intelligence work  for the U.S. government and that he would inherit a family fortune of $2  billion, the Wall Street Journal reported.  </P> <P> However, the newspaper said after interviewing friends, family, colleagues and  acquaintances of the investment banker, none of the stories apparently was  true. Drexel and Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which was Beck's previous employer,  kept him in their mergers and acquisitions departments although many of his  co-workers did not believe his stories, the report said.  </P> <P> Beck could not immediately be reached today to comment on the story; his office  said he was out.  </P> <P> The newspaper said that during an interview Beck backtracked on some of his  prior claims, categorically denying that he had told most of the stories  attributed to him by what the newspaper called business associates, friends and  others.  </P> <P> "This is getting wilder and wilder," he told the newspaper. "I am beyond  shock."  </P> <P> Beck acknowledged there were no official records of his Vietnam service, but  said he had made trips to Vietnam, the newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The article also said Beck claimed he had done years of intelligence work, but  denied having told people he worked for the CIA or that he would inherit a  $2-billion fortune.  </P> <P> Beck, nicknamed "Mad Dog," is a "rainmaker," one who drums up takeover business  for investment firms. He has been highly successful, working as an adviser to  the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. on a number of deals,  including its record $24.53-billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.  </P></p>

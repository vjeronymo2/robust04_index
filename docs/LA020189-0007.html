			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> About 80 prisoners on a weeklong hunger strike were badly beaten by guards at  Cuba's biggest jail last week, human rights activists said in Havana. The  incident at the Combinado del Este jail, on the eastern outskirts of Havana,  pitted guards armed with truncheons and steel bars against inmates jailed for  attempting to leave the country illegally, according to a letter distributed by  the activists to foreign reporters. The inmates were seeking  prisoner-of-conscience status and the right to receive mail and to have regular  family visits, among other demands, the letter said. Government officials were  not available for comment, but they routinely refuse to answer queries on such  matters.  </P></p>

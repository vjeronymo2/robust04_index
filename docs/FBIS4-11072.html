			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with International Economic Relations Under </F> Secretary Jorge Campbell by Claudia Boragni; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Boragni] Was the previous Radical administration  also concerned about exports?    [Campbell] There has always been a need to boost exports.  Argentina has a closed economy.    [Boragni] How can this trend be turned around?    [Campbell] We need a cultural change. There are very  concrete cases that point to the ongoing reversal of this trend.  I am referring to relations between Argentina and Brazil, in  which bilateral trade rose from $1 billion yearly to $6 billion.    [Boragni] Does the trade deficit constitute a source of  concern for the government?    [Campbell] It depends on how we analyze it. From the  viewpoint of imports, they are composed to a great extent of  capital goods. This means that investments are being made in the  country. But it is also true that we have to boost exports.    [Boragni] Are you thinking about instruments for export  promotion?    [Campbell] Those of us who work at the Foreign Ministry do  not design instruments. That is incumbent upon the Economy  Ministry. We work at trade promotion through the Argentine  Export Foundation.    [Boragni] Are you not concerned about the 26 percent drop in  commodity exports in January?    [Campbell] Under no circumstances would I draw conclusions  based on the results of only one month. Concerning January's  exports in particular, the largest importer of Argentine  commodities was Brazil. Exports to Brazil have grown  considerably.    [Boragni] Is not January's $585.6 million trade deficit a  cause for concern when we compare it with January 1993's deficit  of $136.6 million?    [Campbell] The trade deficit is, undoubtedly, weighty, but I  reiterate that it is not worrisome from the standpoint of  imports. As long as the exchange rate remains stable, there will  be an inflow of capital.    [Boragni] Is it not incompatible to contemplate joining  NAFTA  when the United States and Canada are Argentina's competitors  with regard to agricultural products?    [Campbell] One must bear in mind that when countries sit at  the negotiating table, they discuss all these questions.  Compromise always comes later.    [Boragni] While at the beginning it was said that Argentina  would try to join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], now everybody talks about unilateral negotiations with  the United States.    [Campbell] At the beginning, we devised the so-called "Four  Plus One" strategy, which led to the beginning of talks between  Mercosur and the United States. Nevertheless, this does not  prevent any country from negotiating on an individual basis.    [Boragni] NAFTA offers a huge market but also entails keen  competition.    [Campbell] Argentina has been making headway in its trade  standards. When a country wants to compete, it can do so.</p>

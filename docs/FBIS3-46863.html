Delivery will be immediate.    A Rice Exporters' Association source said the price of  fragrant rice was about US$530 a ton and 100 percent white B  grade rice was US$450 a ton. After the sales agreement was  signed on Monday the local price of fragrant rice increased by  about 20 baht a picul (60 kilos) to reach 720 baht yesterday.    The price had risen since a rumour began that Japan would  buy  fragrant rice from Thailand after earlier buying 263,000 tons of  100 percent white grade B rice or glutinous rice.    The total bought from Thailand by Japan will be 417,000 tons  of 100 percent white B grade rice, 43,000 tons of glutinous rice  and 50,000 tons of fragrant rice. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: YOUNG PASSENGERS CAN MAKE WAVES  </P> <P> Although children are becoming increasingly welcome on board cruise liners,  before booking a cruise find out if the line offers programs for kids and  whether there will be other children on the voyage.  </P> <P> Even well-traveled youngsters can get bored on board.  </P> <P> Don't expect free 24-hour baby-sitting. Youth counselors are aboard to enrich  your child's vacation, not take him off your hands.  </P> <P> If you think you'll need a baby-sitter, before booking the cruise ask if crew  members will be available for baby-sitting duty, and inquire about the fees.  </P> <P> Avoid booking a family trip on a line that does not offer free or discounted  travel, counselors and special programs for children. The lack of such is  usually a tip-off that the line prefers adult clientele.  </P> <P> Lines offering special summer prices and programs for children include American  Hawaii, Carnival, Chandris, Commodore, Costa, Delta Queen Steamboat Co.,  Dolphin, Norwegian Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean, Premier and Regency.  </P> <P> Until last year Sitmar had the most active shipboard program for children.  However, since Sitmar was absorbed by Princess there seems to be decreased  emphasis on youth programs.  </P> <P> Premier, Costa and Regency offer discount prices for single-parent families by  charging the parent a per-person, double-occupancy rate and the child a lower  third- or fourth-passenger fare.  </P> <P> Premier also offers a seven-day package with a Bahamas cruise and Disney World  stay. The price ranges from $595 to $1,095 per person, double occupancy, for  adults, depending on accommodations; $225 to $295 for children in the same  room.  </P> <P> It will be copied by Carnival for February, 1990, when the Carnivale will be  repositioned to Port Canaveral for three- and four-day Bahamas sailings  packaged with Disney World programs.  </P> <P> This summer Carnival's fare for children sharing a cabin with two full-fare  adults is $395 on all seven-day cruises, $190 and $250 on three- and four-day  cruises. In some cabins Carnival can add a fifth berth.  </P> <P> Cribs and high chairs are available on all ships, and baby-sitting is offered  at a nominal charge.  </P> <P> In addition, Carnival's "Junior Cruisers" program has been extended from  limited sailings to sailings year-round.  </P> <P> Regency Cruises offers free Caribbean sailings between June 18 and Aug. 27 for  the child who shares a cabin as the third passenger with two full-fare adults.  The fare for another child, traveling as the fourth passenger, is $195.  </P> <P> Regent Star seven-day sailings depart on Sunday from Montego Bay, Jamaica, with  two itineraries. One includes Costa Rica, Cartagena, Aruba and a partial  transit of the Panama Canal. The other includes Ocho Rios, St. Thomas, St.  Barts, St. Martin and San Juan.  </P> <P> Special shore excursions for young people will be available, including a  snorkeling safari, as well as shipboard disco parties, games, crafts and  special children's videos.  </P> <P> Single parents and single grandparents also get a fare break from Regency for  Regent Star sailings. The parent or grandparent pays the per-person,  double-occupancy rate on the three lowest-priced categories available (from  $1,065 to $1,315). Children under 12 travel for $665 to $695.  </P> <P> Adult air fare is included, but children fly for $195 to $395, depending on the  gateway city.  </P> <P> A children's counselor offering programs on American history will be aboard  seven-day cruises on the paddle-wheeler Mississippi Queen, departing New  Orleans Aug. 11, 18 and 25; Sept. 1 and 15, and Nov. 24.  </P> <P> Children through 16 years can travel free with two full-fare adults booking a  cabin from a minimum of $2,065 per person, double occupancy. Two additional  children under 16 will be accommodated free in a separate cabin, if space is  available.  </P> <P> Costs include free round-trip air fare for parents. For more information, call  the Delta Queen Steamboat Co. toll-free at (800) 543-1949.  </P> <P> Between Thursday and Sept. 2 American Hawaii will allow up to two children, 16  or younger, to cruise free in any cabin costing $1,725 per person, double  occupancy, and higher, when accompanied by two full-fare passengers.  </P> <P> Kids can cruise free with Chandris on all Bermuda sailings this summer, if they  are under 12 and share a cabin with two full-fare adults. Air fare is extra.  </P> <P> The line charges children $499 to $799 for other seven-day cruises. This  includes air fare for travelers under 12 who share a cabin with two full-fare  adults. Children under 2 years travel free.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Spoilt for choice Canary Wharf's plunge into administration stems in part from the UK government's dithering over whether to relocate its civil servants to the 4.5m sq ft development in the London Docklands. The delay is more than just an illustration of the slow pace of government decision-making. The Conservative government, which faces considerable embarrassment over the plight of the Docklands because of its strong ideological and fiscal support for the region, has been anxious not to appear to be bailing out a bankrupt developer. For the government, the need to obtain value-for-money in its choice of office space for Whitehall-based civil servants has been all important, prompting a careful consideration of other potential accommodation in the Docklands Two weeks ago Sir Terence Heiser, permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment, and a score of his most senior civil servants went on a tour of the Docklands in search of offices to house some 2,000 civil servants. The senior civil servants' visit underlined one of the most remarkable features about the parlous state of Docklands: the abundance of empty, modern buildings that are large enough to accommodate an entire government department. There are three premises - besides Canary Wharf - on the civil servants' list of potential new homes for Department of Environment staff. All are large, audacious schemes. In the middle of the Isle of Dogs, the half-empty Harbour Exchange is a 1m sq ft behemoth of dark, mirrored glass. East India Dock, on the eastern edge of the enterprise zone, is a light, neat edifice totalling 600,000 sq ft. Thomas More Square, a pale elegant structure on the western fringe of Docklands, contains 550,000 sq ft of space of which 80,000 sq ft has been let. Three out of the four schemes have been built by non-UK developers - as good a sign as any of overseas developers' more adventurous outlook towards the Docklands. East India Dock was developed by the Swedish partnership of NCC and SPP. Thomas More Square was built by Skanska, the Swedish developers. Canary Wharf is, of course, the work of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer which has sought protection from its creditors. Harbour Exchange has been built by Charter Group, a private UK property company, which was once one of the most successful Docklands developers, although it has recently run into difficulties. Like O&amp;Y, Charter Group was admired by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former UK prime minister, who wrote the foreword to one of its marketing publications. The claims made by the developers are depressingly interchangeable: 'A magnificent building with facilities unmatched in London'; 'an unrivalled modern office scheme'; 'the quality of the buildings surpasses that of any other office accommodation in the capital.' Most property experts undoubtedly believe the quality of the Canary Wharf buildings is a cut above other Docklands competitors. And Canary Wharf is likely to be favoured by the government in its final selection of a new home for Department of Environment civil servants if a deal is struck with O&amp;Y's bankers over the Jubilee Line extention. Whichever of the quartet is selected, the new premises would be a huge improvement on the crumbling hulk of the Department of the Environment's current offices at Marsham Street in Victoria. The four buildings' location and facilities differ substantially. East India Dock is surrounded by traffic, a housing estate and the Financial Times's printing plant. Both Canary Wharf and Harbour Exchange are in the heart of the Isle of Dogs with a reasonable selection of shops nearby. Thomas More Square, to the east of St Katherine's Dock by the City, is 10 minutes walk to the nearest tube station. The government has said that its final decision will rest on value for money. Canary Wharf's owners are believed to be asking Pounds 15 per sq ft; the government has been offering only Pounds 13 per sq ft. O&amp;Y's move into administration could lower asking rents in the area still further. Arriving at a swift decision over the Department of Environment's new home has been a prime concern for the government. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the government's adviser, has argued it needs more detailed negotiations before it can come to a conclusion over which is the most suitable site. Yet the decision to move to the Docklands is by no means cut and dried. Certainly, the outcome is likely to be jeopardised by the cancellation of the Jubilee Line extension, following O&amp;Y's move into administration. One alternative for the government would be to consider using those central London premises made vacant by the relocation of civil servants from other departments. 'There is a possibility that the government could take the option of using the existing government estate,' says Mr Michael Soames of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The Department of Transport, which shares the Marsham Street premises with the Department of Environment, is undertaking separate reviews of its relocation needs and is thought to be unwilling to make any rapid decision to move staff to the Docklands. Civil servants would welcome any proposal that avoids the Docklands. Many staff are incensed by the prospect of being sent to an area that has been largely spurned by the private sector. The civil servants' unions are seriously concerned about the impact on staff of splitting up the department, longer journeys to work and the relative shortage of facilities in the Docklands. 'The effect on staff morale will be devastating,' says Mr John Rouse of the First Division Association. Mr John Delaney of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants goes further. 'It could well lead to industrial action,' he says.</p>

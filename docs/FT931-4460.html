			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Pressure on UK to alter system for EC elections THE European parliament yesterday approved proposals for a uniform electoral system, stepping up pressure on the UK to accept a form of proportional representation in elections to the EC body. The UK, which has fought for 10 years against proportional representation to the parliament, seems certain to exercise a veto. Under the Maastricht treaty the 12 member states must approve the measures unanimously in the council of ministers. The proposals approved in Strasbourg yesterday were a carefully crafted compromise aimed at accommodating British objections so that at least partial proportional representation could be introduced in time for the 1994 elections. According to the resolutions approved, the UK would be able to retain at least two-thirds of seats under its present 'first-past-the-post' electoral system. The remaining one-third would be elected using national or regional lists of candidates. A separate measure allows member states to introduce a minimum 3-5 per cent threshold which parties must cross to gain seats in Strasbourg. The minimum hurdle is designed, as in Germany, to prevent the rise of extremist parties. MEPs also approved a clause allowing special arrangements to ensure representation by regional parties such as the Scottish and Welsh nationalists - provided they do not violate the principle of proportional representation.</p>

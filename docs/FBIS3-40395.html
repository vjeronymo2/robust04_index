			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Restructuring: Descarpentries </F> Breaks up Bull into 12 Divisions"--first paragraph is 01  INFORMATIQUE introduction]    [Text] Jean-Marie Descarpentries is restructuring Bull and  strengthening its management. His priorities: to restore  operational balance by the end of 1994, and to boost the  manufacturer's sales.    Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who was appointed Bull's chief  executive officer [CEO] a little over 30 days ago, decided to  reorganize Bull's operations in 12 divisions (see chart): seven  for products and services, four for sales (organized in regional  networks), and one for the group's industrial operations. Each  division is responsible for its results worldwide and in charge  of the partnerships required for its development. As a result of  this rationalization of operations, research and development,  and probably marketing and communications as well, will be split  among the various entities. The new structure still has to be  ratified by customers who, among other things, wish to deal with  a single entity.    The reorganization also separates Bull's various service  activities, which has the advantage of making it easier to sell  some high technology activities (such as artificial intelligence  [AI], electronic data interchange [EDI], and micropackaging) or  to assign them to future subsidiaries. The sale of Bull's  in-house print shop is also being considered, as are the  creation of a financial company and that of a logistics  subsidiary.    In singular contrast with his predecessor's style, the new  CEO has engaged in psychological warfare with the market to  persuade his customers that Bull is going to change. Never mind  that Bull's reorganization project had been in the making for  several months already: it now bears the Descarpentries imprint.  "Daring to change Bull," such is the management's new motto, and  to prove that they mean business they put forward the men who  will effect the change. Actually, these are the same men as  before, except for Thierry Breton who was appointed special  advisor to the president, in charge of strategy, and head of the  FM [facilities management] branch. An odd appointment,  considering that he is also advisor to Alain Madelin, the  minister of business and economic development!    The group's new executive committee, renamed Bull Executive  Board (BEB) for the occasion, will expand from nine to 11  members. Besides Thierry Breton, the newcomers include Alain  Couder, Charles Dehelly, and Herve Hannebicque; Albert  Levy-Soussan and Jacques Weber are leaving, the latter being  appointed to the strategy department. The "commando" men will be  supported by the Bull Operating Council (BOC), an advisory board  consisting of up to 100 members, to be appointed on 26 November.    This energy concentrate is expected to meet Jean-Marie  Descarpentries' two challenges: to restore operational balance  by the end of 1994, and to boost sales. In view of Bull's result  for the first half of 1993 (1.98 billion francs [Fr] in net  losses), this is a tall order, and one that will require  overhauling the company's financial structure.    Thus, around mid-December, Bull is expected to call in some  capital in order to reduce its debt from Fr9.45 billion to  Fr2.44 billion. Although the State and France Telecom promised  to pay respectively Fr8.6 billion and Fr2.5 billion, the other  two shareholders, NEC and IBM, reserved their decision until the  end of the year. According to the NIHON KENZAI SHIMBUM, Bull  asked NEC to increase its participation (currently 4.4 percent).  The information was not confirmed.    For the time being, the Bull CEO, who swore to improve the  workforce productivity ratio (sales per employee amounted to  Fr850,000 in 1992), will have to tackle layoffs and cost  cutting. The management, which counted a net balance of 992  departure under its 1993 "employment plan," will not cancel the  2,850 layoffs planned in France by Bernard Pache; the program  was implemented on 22 November. In addition, Jean-Bernard  Pinatel (a member of the Bull Operating Council) was asked to  prepare a plan to reduce non-wage costs.  <H5>  Bull's New Organization </H5>       -  Bull Executive Board: Jean-Marie Descarpentries plus 10  members.    -  Bull Operating Council: up to 100 members.    -  Departments:    -- Human Resources: Herve Hannebicque;    -- Strategy: Thierry Breton, Jacques Weber;    -- Financial, Legal, and Information Systems Development:  Jacques Lebhar  %Seven Products/Services Divisions:    Corporate Servers: Francis Ackermann;    -- Open Systems: Alain Couder;    -- Software: Alain Couder;    -- Microcomputers: Jacques Noels;    -- Systems Integration: George McNeil;    -- Maintenance and Multivendor Services: Herve Mouren;    -- Facilities Management: Thierry Breton.  %Four Geographic Areas:    -- Bull France: Herve Mouren;    -- Bull Europe: George McNeil;    -- Bull North America Pacific: Axel Leblois;    -- Bull Overseas: Jacques Lebhar and Andre Martinez.  %One Industrial Division:    -- Industrial Operations, Logistics, Bull Electronics:  Charles Dehelly.

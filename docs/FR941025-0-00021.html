			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America states that, while its members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not opposed to accomplishing periodic operational tests of the sync-lock following its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation [proposed in paragraph (d) of the AD] as part of their maintenance programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these members are opposed to accomplishing the tests as part of the requirements of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD. The ATA members believe that the requirement for operational tests is equivalent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA adds that, if the FAA finds sufficient justification to include the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for operational tests in the AD, an alternative to accomplishment of the tests should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in the final rule. ATA reasons that an alternative is justified because no data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist to show that repetitive tests of a modified thrust reverser cannot be handled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately through an operator's maintenance program. The suggested alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows: Within 3 months after accomplishing the sync-lock installation, revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program to include an operational test of the sync-lock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial test would be accomplished within 1,000 hours time-in-service after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification. The AD would no longer be applicable for operators that have acceptably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised the maintenance program. Operators choosing this alternative could use an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative recordkeeping method in lieu of that required by &sect;&sect;91.417 or 121.380 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be defined as the cognizant Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes the concerns of the commenter regarding the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periodic operational tests of the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that these tests are necessary to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recommendations of the task force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA acknowledges that the operational tests specified in this AD and CMR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock to correct that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational tests is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition. This determination is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not result in activation of the sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to accomplishment of the operational tests would permit each operator to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether and how often these tests should be conducted. In light of the severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that operators accomplish tests of the integrity of the sync-lock installation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common manner and at common intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters question why the proposed operational tests would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at more frequent intervals following installation of an additional safety feature than prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to its installation. One of these commenters suggests that Boeing should prove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliability of the system prior to its operation, and that the operational tests should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required at intervals not to exceed 3,000 hours time-in-service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a move to defuse the crisis with Greece,  Albanian President Sali Berisha said today that he is ready to  discuss last Sunday's [10 April] border incident, in which two  Albanian soldiers died. In a letter to the European Union [EU]  demanding an investigation, the Albanian president stresses that  Athens may not be directly responsible for the incident.    ATHENS NEWS AGENCY reported from Brussels that the European  Union received the proposal for dialogue between Athens and  Tirana outlined in Berisha's letter with satisfaction. This  comment was made at noon today by a source close to EU  Commission President Jacques Delors. The same source added that  there are clear concerns among the EU members for possible  negative developments in Greek-Albanian relations that could  deteriorate and end in a new big crisis in the Balkans. We have  to deal with many sources of conflict in the former Yugoslavia,  the same source stressed and added that there is no need for  another crisis at the border of an EU country member with  Albania. Things, the source concluded, now appear to be heading  in a better direction.    Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou referred to the  Albanian president's letter after his address at PASOK's  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] congress today. Papandreou  said that the letter is a good step, and expressed the hope that  the issue will be resolved.</p>

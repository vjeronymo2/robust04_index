			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mitel posts best profit for quarter in 11 years MITEL, the Canadian tele-phone equipment maker, has posted its best quarterly profit in 11 years. The result raises a question mark over the timing of British Telecom's sale last June of its controlling stake in the Ottawa-based company. Mitel's improved performance is also reflected in a surging share price. Its stock was trading at CDollars 3.40 on the Toronto exchange before the close yesterday, more than double the maximum of CDollars 1.64 per share which BT realised from the sale of its 51 per cent stake. Net earnings for the fiscal year to March 26 were CDollars 2.6m (USDollars 2.06m), equal to a loss of 1 cent per common share, compared with a loss of CDollars 5.7m, or 12 cents, the previous year. Sales rose by 4 per cent to CDollars 423.4m. Fourth-quarter earnings, however, were CDollars 11.9m. The improvement was partly due to favourable exchange rate movements and a CDollars 3.5m research grant from the Canadian government. Mr John Millard, president, cautioned that the fourth-quarter performance was unlikely to be repeated in the first half of this year. However, the company said that US sales of office switchboards had picked up, and that its semi-conductor revenues had also risen sharply. A recent CDollars 52m share issue has strengthened its balance sheet, leaving it with long-term debt of only CDollars 26m. BT suffered a loss of at least CDollars 256m on its seven-year investment in Mitel.</p>

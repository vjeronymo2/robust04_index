			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Hanson makes Pounds 90m disposal Hanson's disposal programme continued yesterday with the Pounds 90m sale of 11 companies to a management buy-out team backed by the venture capitalist group, Electra. The deal brings the total raised through disposals this year to Pounds 250m. Hanson is understood to have targeted a range of non-core businesses for sale to raise more than Pounds 500m to reduce its Pounds 3.4bn debt. The 11 disparate businesses, with total net assets of Pounds 40m, include SLD Pumps, the UK's largest pump hire business with 40 per cent of the market. This is thought to have been the main target for Electra and the MBO team, along with two other plant hire operations. It is expected that these will be floated in roughly three years' time. SLD Holdings, the buy-out vehicle, is also acquiring a range of manufacturing and other companies which are likely be sold in the longer-term. The shares defied the buoyant market, rising just 1p to 273 1/2 p. This may have reflected unhappiness with the price, according to analysts. The deal will be marginally dilutive, although it will result in an exceptional profit of Pounds 45m. 'One would have thought they could have got more than Pounds 95m if they had floated, given the current market conditions,' said Mr Mike Murphy, an analyst with SG Warburg Securities. However, Hanson defended the deal, saying the disposal carried the group some way towards 'tidying up' its non-core UK operations. The Electra-backed team is paying a multiple of just over seven times, based on annual operating profits of Pounds 12.2m. Mr Tim Syder of Electra, who will sit on the board of SLD Holdings as a non-executive director, said the team was planning to invest in the businesses, which were all cash generative. Electra is providing Pounds 31.8m in funds and will have an 80 per cent stake. The management team, led by Mr Les Ashford, chief executive of Hanson Industrial Services (HIS), and Mr Neil Wilkinson, finance director of an HIS subsidiary, is investing Pounds 400,000 for 20 per cent. The balance of the payment will be met by Bank of Scotland and UBS, providing senior debt of Pounds 47.5m, and Intermediate Capital Group, with mezzanine debt of Pounds 6m.</p>

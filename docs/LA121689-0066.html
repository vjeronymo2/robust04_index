			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC CHURCH AND POLITICS  </P> <P> It's high time the Catholic Church got off its high horse! And, for that  matter, any other religion that does not support birth control, "safe sex," and  pro-choice.  </P> <P> If Killea's support of pro-choice put her over the top and resulted in her  victory -- then, amen! I applaud her courage to take a stand for what she knows  in her heart is right.  </P> <P> One only needs to glance around to realize that our worst problems are the  result of overpopulation and unwanted children -- with, as usual, the children  suffering the most.  </P> <P> DEBORAH V. SUTTON  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Colonel Ye. </F> Vostrikov under the rubric "Flight Safety: Special Case":  "Pickup"]    [Text] An Su-17MD fighter/bomber taxied out to the runway.  Major A. Koval, military pilot 1st class, was to make a flight  in the aerobatic area.    Takeoff, climb and arrival at the zone. Out of a steep  climb,  the pilot went into a wingover and created an angle of attack  when pulling out of the descent that was close to the maximum  allowable so as to come out with the minimal loss of altitude.  He felt increasing G-forces, however, at an altitude of 2,800  meters at a speed of 800 km/hr and an angle of dive of 30  with a virtually immobile control stick. He looked at his  instruments--the indicator for the angles of attack was off the  scale.    He needed only a few seconds to assess the situation and  make  the correct decision. Through the vigorous pushing of the stick  away from himself, he brought the aircraft out of the area of  supercritical angles of attack and thereby averted entry into a  stall mode. He reported what had happened to the flight  operations supervisor, and on command curtailed his fulfillment  of the assignment and returned to the airfield.    The aircraft had still not landed and specialists had  already  begun to discuss the possible causes for what had happened. Some  suggested that the aircraft could have gotten into wake  turbulence. Others felt that a G-force pickup had occurred,  which was possible in this flight mode with vigorous piloting  and the pulling of the stick toward oneself at a rapid rate.  Reference was made to instructions. The opinion was expressed  that an unsanctioned triggering of an SAU [automatic control  system] actuator had occurred. The final answer, however, should  have been provided by the "black box"--the on-board recording  device (BUR).    The section of the flight where the precondition to a flight  accident arose (Fig. 1, AB) was carefully analyzed in the  decoding of the entries. The aircraft, at an altitude of 5,100  meters at a speed of 590 km/hr, went into the wingover (Fig. 1,  1-1) with the creation of a roll angle of 180 and the  pulling back of the stick. The aircraft, in an upside-down  position, began to curve in trajectory energetically through the  large angles of attack. In a near-vertical dive (Fig. 1, B) the  angle of attack increased to the maximum allowable value in  operation (Fig. 1, C) owing to the movement of the stick for  pitch. It later increased to a critical value (Fig. 1, K) with a  virtually immobile stick. The aircraft was in the area of  supercritical angles of attack for about three seconds, and only  thanks to the pilot's vigorous pushing of the stick from 15  to 8 did he get out of it.          That is the general picture of the dynamic of the aircraft's  behavior on the section of the flight under consideration, but  the causes were still not clear. The specialists carefully  checked out all the variations. Analogous situations were  considered to confirm the first variation-- getting into wake  turbulence. The typical traits of that are arbitrary changes in  the normal G-forces, and chaotic changes in G-forces and speed  within small limits of about their average values, conditioned  by the effects of disturbances from the wake turbulence. A  comparison of the recordings (Figs. 1 and 2) made it possible to  be convinced that the overshoot of the angle of attack was not  caused by wake turbulence.          As for the second version--a manifestation of G-force  pickup--the data from the recording gear testified that there  had been no vigorous movements of the stick for pitch before the  arbitrary increases in the values of the angle of attack. This  version was thus also invalid.    The third version--violations of the functioning of an SAU  actuator, which could have deflected the stabilizer into a  non-standard position and created angles of attack greater than  those allowable--was rejected after the decoding of the entries  for the movement of the stick for pitch X[.sup]p[/] and the  angle of deflection of the stabilizer [.sup]st[/], as well  as a comparison of their values with standard ones (Figs. 3, 1   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-21A>           Fig. 1. </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-21B>           Fig. 2. </FIG>  and 2). Analysis showed that the control system was functioning  normally, and the stabilizer had not been deflected by the SAU  actuator mechanism.     <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-22A>             Fig. 3. </FIG>      Continuing the research, and in particular analyzing the  materials of flight testing, specialists established that such a  phenomenon had taken place, but at angles of attack greater than  allowable ones. They were within the permissible angles on this  aircraft, but close to the maximums. What was the essence of  this feature?    It can be observed only at Mach values less than the unit  value, and is characteristic of aircraft with a swept wing at  large angles of attack, when the linear dependence between the  coefficients of the longitudinal moment M[.sup]z[/] and the  lift force Cy is disrupted (Fig. 4). These phenomena, as flight  practices show, are manifested most often at Mach values of  0.7--0.9. The aircraft was at Mach 0.76 in this instance. An  involuntary pull-up is an outward manifestation of instability  in G forces n[.sup]y[/]. The cause of this is an  impermissibly strong displacement forward of the center of  pressure as a consequence of the development of a tip stall in  the flow on the wing, as well as interference between the  fuselage, wing and empennage. A tip stall on a swept wing causes  a redistribution of loads across its span, which leads to an  increase in the lift factor of the blade-root cross- sections  and a decrease at the wingtips. The pressure center of the wing  and the aerodynamic focus are thus displaced forward. The latter  causes changes in the coefficient M[.sup]z[/][.sup]Cy[/]  and the appearance of neutrality and instability in the  aircraft. A number of design refinements have been made to  eliminate them, making it possible to delay the development of  tip stall in the flow. These include the installation of special  fences on the wing, the geometric and aerodynamic twisting of  the wing, the use of leading-edge flaps, deflectable tips etc.     <FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-22B>             Fig. 4. </FIG>      These measures made it possible to obtain satisfactory  characteristics for longitudinal stability and controllability  up to the maximum angles of attack in operation. This case,  however, which has received the name of "stall pickup" in the  technical literature, has called into question the completeness  of the research that was conducted in the past, and has brought  about the necessity of additional work to evaluate the behavior  of the aircraft at maximum angles of attack.    Local G-force instability is an undesirable phenomenon in  the  operational realm of flight modes. It creates preconditions for  unintentional losses of speed, transition to supercritical  angles of attack and the entry of the aircraft into intolerably  large G-forces. Enhanced attention of the pilot and great  precision in actions with the control surfaces in piloting are  required in this case. It should be remembered that countering  the arbitrary fluctuations of the aircraft using deflections of  the ailerons or control surfaces when getting into a "pickup"  mode and stall not only do not have any impact, but can also  lead to a spin. It is thus essential, when reaching angles of  attack greater than those allowable, to leave the ailerons in  neutral position and not to permit any slip using the rudder.  Only the vigorous pushing of the stick away from oneself can  bring the aircraft out of the critical zone. These were indeed  the actions that were recorded by the on-board recording gear in  this instance. This confirmed the good training of the pilot and  his profound knowledge of the practical aerodynamics of the  aircraft.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

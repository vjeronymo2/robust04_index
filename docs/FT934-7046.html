			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Management: What about the carpet colour? - Mick Newmarch, chief executive of the Prudential Corporation, offers advice on how to move head office / Tips from the top Having emerged only recently from a daunting array of storage crates, I am now free to assess the Prudential's recent move and to offer some advice for those contemplating a similar step. The corporation left its ancestral home, 142 Holborn Bars, London, in 1988 in anticipation that the building would re-emerge, after restoration and modernisation, stripped of its more arcane features but retaining its Gothic fenestrated charm and tradition. Despite many false dawns, we have not been disappointed. We have returned and have been on the site for all of eight weeks. A successful move is built upon a monument of planning activity. Equally true, as we have learnt, this monument must be constructed like a piece of Lego, so that as expectations change or deadlines shift it can be quickly reassembled in a different configuration. Our planning process was based upon a top-level committee, myself included, which contemplated an enormous variety of seriously important decisions ranging from the colour of the carpet to the shape of the dining chairs and the location of the coffee machines. The committee was served by a professional project manager with the backing of a full-time team. However mundane each small decision may appear, co-ordinating them is a task to rank with re-designing the space shuttle for complexity. It quickly became apparent to us that a pint of Prudential employees in 1988 equalled a substantial quart in 1993 owing to the growth in the business. I believe this is an inevitable feature of any move: the space is never quite as intended nor the numbers quite as anticipated. As a result, we took the opportunity to harness the talents and energies of our employees in adapting our working styles and developing ingenious responses to the problems presented by our new environment. Each area had its own move co-ordinator who added the seasoning of commercial realism required to the plans for their own space. Clearly, a move on this scale risked dislocating our business operations completely. We could scarcely close down our investment operations for a day to move the furniture or tell our customers their maturity cheques must wait until we found the crate containing the file. Hence the move was staggered over three weekends and handled entirely by professional movers. As a result, everything in sight was labelled, to the point where I wondered if I might be date-stamped and tied up with sticky tape for the duration. This was time-consuming, required discipline, but was extremely worthwhile. We also took care to consider the sense of well-being of the staff, many of whom had never worked in the old building or in the 'foreign' territory of Holborn. We provided maps and guides and a personal welcome pack tailored for each person. An army marches on its belly so we provided free sandwiches to maintain blood sugar levels. For us, the most positive catalyst to a successful move was the prospect of a visit from the Queen to open the building, only two weeks after our arrival. This galvanised the otherwise jaded into bursts of vacuuming, tidying and urgent activity to control our errant fire alarms. Finally, it is worth remembering that however detailed the plans, some elements will inevitably escape, just as some carefully chosen furniture will look uncomfortable in its new home and no one understands how the waste bins came to be that perplexing shape. I am looking forward to the day when we at last locate the keys to the monstrous, but impressive safe in my office, to allow exploration of its contents, untouched since 1988, or even before. I feel, however, a genuine sense of rejuvenation in our new environment: the move for us has been a positive and co-operative opportunity. I encourage others to look on theirs in the same light.

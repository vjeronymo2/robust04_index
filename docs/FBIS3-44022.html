However, the management of the country's largest  harbor is determined to get over those problems as rapidly as  possible.    The year of 1994 offers Lobito commercial harbor new  prospects because the blockade [bloqueio] which was in force  between April and August of last year has now been lifted. Only  800 ships docked at that harbor in 1993, but it is expected that  those figures will double by the end of this year. The  management of Lobito Harbor has already been given permission to  open an account with Totta e Acores Bank so it can manage its  foreign currency earnings with complete autonomy. This is what  Lobito Harbor Director Carlos Gomes had to say:    [Begin recording] [Gomes] There is some optimism now because  the World Bank has made available a certain amount of money to  see if we can deal with these problems as urgently as possible.    [Unidentified reporter] How much has it made available? How  much?    [Gomes] It has made available $7 million, but we know how  the  World Bank operates: now, there is still bound to be some red  tape and there will be other difficulties before the money gets  here.    [Reporter] You did say it was $7 million?    [Gomes] Well, what I am pinning my hopes on is that there  will be more ships docking here to see if we can consolidate our  gains by our own means, thereby getting shipowners and shipping  agencies to deposit currency in the bank we have indicated.

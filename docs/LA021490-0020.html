			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPECTING NATURE  </P> <P> So the Lancaster City Council is considering building two new streets through a  desert woodlands area to protect children walking to school (Part B, Feb. 7).  We get this news on a page filled with news about a drive-by killing near  Carson High School and another in Sylmar.  </P> <P> The next page relates the trial of a man who drove into a group of pedestrians  in Glendale and killed four people. So the parents want two streets built to  protect their children?  </P> <P> This brings to mind the time in Manhattan Beach when parents complained about  the dangers of Polliwog Pond, a small body of water once big enough for small  boats and fishing. Parents feared a child might drown, so the pond was fenced  off, partly filled in, and became a murky, trash-filled swamp. All this within  one-half mile of the ocean. Were they to fence and fill the ocean as well? Kids  climbed the fence and went polliwog catching. To my knowledge nobody drowned.  The city fathers eventually saw the light. They created a park and re-created  the pond as a place for fish, wild birds and people to enjoy.  </P> <P> Why do we fear our natural environment? Training people to know how to interact  with Mother Nature is a better solution than to destroy the natural  surroundings. Beach kids learn to swim and to respect the ocean and the pond.  Desert children can learn to respect the desert and its wildlife and walk  safely to school.  </P> <P> LAURA SCHOLTZ  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

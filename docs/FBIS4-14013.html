			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fatah Tunis Meetings Criticize Sha'th </F> Negotiation Performance"]    [Excerpt] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Palestinian sources  have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Fatah preparatory committee  meetings held in Tunis last night and the evening of the day  before yesterday sharply criticized 'Arafat adviser Nabil  Sha'th's performance in the negotiations currently being held in  Cairo.    According to the sources, al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, member of  the Fatah Central Committee and PLO ambassador to Jordan,  demanded that confidence be withdrawn from Sha'th, while Major  General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian police and  security, attacked him.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim  surprised participants by his reservations about what is  happening in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, as he was  considered until recently one of the supporters of the course of  the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Some observers do not  rule out the possibility of Arab influences behind this position.    The sources also said that Sha'th was criticized almost  unanimously for his performance in the negotiations and for his  statements to the press.    The most marked criticisms aimed against Sha'th are his  failure to adhere to the foundations, from which he must not  deviate in any negotiations with Israel, and also his media  performance following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron,  whether because of his statement that this massacre would not  affect the peace process, or the permanent broad smile that  appeared on his face, even amid the Palestinian people's grief.

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Danish treaty doubts LESS THAN two weeks ahead of a second referendum on closer European union, Danish support for the Maastricht treaty has dropped to less than 50 per cent, according to a survey published yesterday, AP reports from Copenhagen. The Gallup Institute said 46 per cent of voters polled backed the treaty, down from 51 per cent a week ago. The number of opponents swelled to 34 per cent from 30 per cent during the same period. The trend is in spite of the treaty exemptions granted to Denmark. These include staying out of a common currency and joint defence policy. The referendum is scheduled for May 18.</p>

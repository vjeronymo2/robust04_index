			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. CHILDREN'S MUSEUM BURGLARIZED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Children's Museum was burglarized sometime Friday night, the  third time since November that the facility has been broken into.  </P> <P> In the latest break-in, a burglar threw rocks through a 15-foot-high office  window on the building's west side. About $3,000 in office equipment was  stolen, including five typewriters and a computer terminal, said museum  spokeswoman Tisa Armendarez.  </P> <P> Armendarez said the nonprofit organization has been unable to afford a burglar  alarm system for the large building at 310 N. Main St.  </P> <P> This latest burglar apparently left no fingerprints and no one in the area  reported seeing anything suspicious, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Barry Staggs said.  </P></p>

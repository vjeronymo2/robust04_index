			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Daewoo Motor drives into untapped markets - The South Korean carmaker is focusing on the Third World Daewoo Motor's recent purchase of the Romanian car company Oltcit is the latest step in its strategy to operate assembly plants and establish distribution networks in developing countries. South Korea's third-largest car company, which had a 1993 turnover of Dollars 2.7bn, is gambling that it can achieve higher sales and earnings in the relatively untapped markets of the Third World rather than in advanced industrial countries, where competition among carmakers is fierce. It is a strategy that has also guided its parent Daewoo group, which built an industrial empire in Korea by taking over and reviving bankrupt companies, and aggressivelymoving into emerging foreign markets from Burma to Sudan. Mr Kim Woo-choong, the founder and chairman of the Daewoo group, announced last year that he wanted to transform the unprofitable and unlisted Daewoo Motor into one of the group's main companies. The group, Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, already owns leading shipbuilding, electronics and financial services companies. He plans to quadruple Daewoo Motor's output from 550,000 to 2.2m vehicles by 2000, with almost half the production located over-seas. Daewoo Motor's purchase last month of 51 per cent of Oltcit, Romania's second-largest motor company, for Dollars 156m provides it with its first production base in eastern Europe. The region is already emerging as one of Daewoo's biggest overseas markets, accounting for 15 per cent of car exports last year. This follows the signingof several other contracts for joint venture car plants abroad last year. They include a Dollars 630m project in Uzbekistan to produce 200,000 vehicles beginning in 1996, and a Dollars 600m assembly plant in Iran that will start operation in late 1995. Daewoo also expects to begin assembling cars in the Philippines and Vietnam. Other projects are being negotiated in Libya, Peru, Pakistan and Tatarstan, Russia. In China, considered its biggest potential market, Daewoo has established a joint venture factory for bus production, but Chinese officials have indicated that they will not allow new foreign car joint ventures until 1996. Daewoo Motor's export drive follows the collapse of its eight-year-old 50-50 partnership with General Motors in 1992. Daewoo supplied the LeMans, the US version of the Opel Kadett, to GM on an original equipment manufacturing basis, but is now barred from exporting cars to western Europe and the US until 1995 under its divorce agreement with GM. Daewoo plans to use the Oltcit plant as a springboard into western Europe, with production expected to reach 200,000 vehicles by 1998. But there are other advantages in using developing countries for production. It is able to acquire existing factories at a relatively cheap price, and marketing costs in these countries are low. 'It's probably their best option,' said Mr Don Lee, motor analyst for BZW Securities in Seoul. 'They don't have a product that is really competitive at home. Markets in the developing world are less demanding than in Korea.' Although Daewoo car sales in Korea rose by 47 per cent to 210,000 vehicles last year, this wasprimarily due to extremely favourable consumer financing being offered by the company. Daewoo cars still suffer a quality image problem and the company lacks the up-market models being produced by its bigger Korean rivals, Hyundai and Kia. Exports increased by 83 per cent to 100,000 vehicles. But other analysts believe that Daewoo is making a mistake in expanding too quickly abroad. 'Themoney would be better spent in investing at home, because they need to improve their product quality to compete against Hyundai and Kia. If they perform poorlyin Korea, export sales will not save them,' said Mr Chung Tae, vehicle analystat Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul.</p>

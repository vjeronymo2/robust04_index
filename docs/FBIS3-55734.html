As a Russian officer reported to  Interfax, the rear of the 12th outpost of Moscow's Border Unit  came under fire from mortars, recoilless guns, and rocket  installations.    A Russian border outpost on Turg mountain and Parvar and  Arvar villages were also attacked. The servicemen suffered no  casualties. Counter strikes were delivered on the militants'  positions.    The officer also reported an attempt by a gang of militants  to break through a border section guarded by the 3rd outpost of  the Pyanj Border Unit. After a clash with guards, the gang  retreated back into Afghanistan.    Stepped-up militant activity is linked to better weather  conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

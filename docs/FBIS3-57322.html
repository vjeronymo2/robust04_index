			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oksana Boyko: "Let's Hope"] </F>   [Text] William G. Miller, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, held  a news conference in the just-renovated American House on 19  January devoted to the tripartite Declaration signed by  Ukrainian, American, and Russian presidents in Moscow last week.  As expected, the ambassador highly praised this document and  the efforts by the leaders of the three countries -- especially  the courage displayed by President Kravchuk -- directed at  nuclear disarmament. The ambassador also recalled the history  of nuclear disarmament dating back to late 1960's. William  Miller himself has been working on this problem for a long time,  and he also personally knew Andrey Sakharov, the father of a  hydrogen bomb who ardently fought to rid the world of nuclear  weapons.    The signed tripartite Declaration, stated the ambassador, is  seen by the United States as an important element in  intensifying and strengthening bilateral relations with the  United States, especially in the economic and cultural spheres.  In the words of the American diplomat, the entire list of the  conditions put forward by the Supreme Council regarding the  ratification of START I and the Nonproliferation Treaty was  included in the agenda of Ukrainian--American-Russian  negotiations. And all of them have been fulfilled. Of course,  the ratification of the Moscow agreement by the Supreme Council  is an affair of the Supreme Council itself and the Ukrainian  people. However, Mr. Miller believes that when they understand  all provisions of the document and the scale of events it  affects, everything will be fine and the agreement will be  ratified. An interesting discrepancy should be noted here.  Both the American ambassador and Russian officials refer to the  document as an "agreement" [preceding word published in English]  and talk about the need to ratify it. On the other hand,  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry officials explained that the  Declaration signed by the presidents is not subject to  ratification. What should be ratified is START I and Ukraine's  adherence to the Lisbon Protocol. The Declaration simply points  to a mechanism for their implementation. Russians have already  started to talk about the scrapping of Ukrainian nuclear weapons  as an accomplished fact. Does this mean that each side sees in  the document what it likes?    The issue of money was also brought up at the news  conference. Why so little (in our opinion, of course)? Mr.  Miller assured that the United States would not stop at the $175  million earmarked by the U.S. Congress for the dismantling and  removal of the missiles. The United States will now orient its  foreign policy toward expanding comprehensible contacts with  Ukraine and establishing closer cooperation with it.    Asked about nuclear security of a nonnuclear Ukraine, the  ambassador gave a very diplomatic answer. As for actions by  international organizations and the United States in the event  of an assault on Ukraine by some nuclear state, Mr. Miller said  that in this hypothetical case, the mechanisms established by  the UN and CSCE Statutes would be initiated. "Let's hope that  these international organizations will prove strong enough and  be able to put in motion all powers that they have." A very  promising perspective, considering the UN's smashing success in  settling conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia, etc. --  not to mention indirect aggressions in the sub-Dniester  Republic, Southern Ossetia, or Abkhazia, which received its own  powerful Armed Forces out of nowhere -- as well as the great  respect for international public opinion exhibited by such  politicians as Zhirinovskiy elbowing his way to the Russian  leadership. Yes, let's hope that nothing will happen to us --  just like in that famous Russian fairy tale.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Respect for DPRK's Unique Status, Key Factor of Fair </F> Solution to Nuclear Issue; Memorandum of DPRK Foreign Ministry"  -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today published a memorandum throwing light on the major  obstacles to a solution to the nuclear issue and the truth  behind them in view of the current situation.    Follows the full text of the memorandum:    Memorandum    of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of    the Democratic People's Republic of Korea    The current international relations evolving over the  nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula have assumed dimensions of serious  confrontation. The situation has presented much greater  complexity particularly after March 31 when the United Nations  Security Council announced its "presidential statement" imposing  unreasonable follow-on inspections on the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK).    The United States and its satellite forces have resorted to  the one-track course of pressure by enjoining the safeguards  agreement-bound fullscope inspections on the DPRK with disregard  to the unique status of the DPRK which has temporarily suspended  the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the treaty on  the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT/the treaty), and  such action has placed grave difficulties in the way of efforts  for resolving the nuclear issue.    The nuclear issue today stands at the crossroad where the  issue can be resolved through dialogue and negotiations in  keeping with the DPRK's unique NPT status or the issue will  remain unresolved permanently because of strong-arm actions and  confrontation.    In view of the current situation, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issues this  memorandum in order to shed light on the major obstacles  blocking a resolution of the nuclear issue and the truth behind  them.  <H5>  1. The Origination of the DPRK's Unique NPT Status and Its </H5> Essence    The key factor in resolving the nuclear issue includes  acceptance of the DPRK's unique status based on its temporary  suspension of the effectuation of the announced withdrawal from  the NPT and adoption of a step-by-step process toward a fair  solution befitting the unique status.    The DPRK finds itself in a unique status of having  temporarily suspended the effectuation of its announced  withdrawal from the NPT.    As is known already, the DPRK Government announced its  decision on March 12, 1993 to withdraw from the NPT in order to  safeguard the supreme state interests in accordance with  Paragraph 1 of Article X of the treaty. The DPRK's decision to  temporarily suspend the effectuation of its withdrawal from the  NPT, as contained in the June 11 1993 DPRK-USA joint statement,  was a provisional measure which the DPRK undertook unilaterally  on the premise that the DPRK-USA negotiations for a peaceful  resolution of the nuclear issue will continue on an equal and  unprejudiced basis. This bespeaks that the legal parties  responsible for the suspension of the effectuation of the DPRK's  withdrawal from the treaty are clearly the DPRK and the United  States.    As far as the safeguards agreement is concerned, the  agreement was concluded pursuant to Paragraph 4 of Article III  of the NPT, and therefore the legal validity of this agreement  has been as good as suspended since June 12, 1993 when the  DPRK's withdrawal from the treaty was to come into force because  of absence of any subsequent particular agreement thereof  between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA/the agency). This notwithstanding, the DPRK and the IAEA  have so far managed to reach bilateral agreement on the limited  scope inspection activities which have been carried out  accordingly. This was possible entirely thanks to the voluntary  and well-intentioned steps taken by the DPRK in order to  demonstrate the transparency of its nuclear activities.    The United States and the IAEA Secretariat, too, have  recognized the DPRK's unique NPT status.    At the DPRK-USA working-level contact in New York on  December  10 1993, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia  and Pacific Affairs Thomas Hubbard said that "the United States  understands the DPRK's unique status resulting from its  temporary suspension of the effectuation of the declared  withdrawal from the NPT," and that "we want the DPRK to accept  technical requirements for maintaining the continuity of  safeguards, not the agency's legal requirements." Assistant  Secretary of State for Political-military Affairs Robert L.  Gallucci, head of the USA delegation to the DPRK-USA talks,  addressed a message on February 2, 1994 to his DPRK counterpart,  in which he said that "We understand that inspections sought by  the IAEA for the continuity of safeguards are designed to ensure  non-diversion of nuclear material since the previous full  inspection." This is a de facto acceptance by the United States  that the inspection needed for the continuity of safeguards is  not routine or ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement,  but an inspection limited only to the purpose of verifying that  there has been no diversion of nuclear material in the DPRK  since February 1993 when the inspections required by the  safeguards agreement were suspended. At the same time, this  also serves as a clear evidence that the United States has  accepted and respects the DPRK's current unique NPT status.    The IAEA, too, has recognized the DPRK's unique status in  the  practice of its inspection activities. In his March 24 1994  report to the United Nations Security Council on the results of  the agency's March inspection activities in the DPRK, the IAEA  Director-General Hans Blix said that the DPRK says it needs only  to ensure the continuity of safeguards because of its unique  status, and in this sense the DPRK accepted the agency's  inspections in May and August 1993 for the servicing and  reloading of the surveillance equipment. This is none other  than an acceptance by the IAEA itself of the DPRK's unique  status. Had the IAEA Secretariat had any competent reasons or  grounds to urge the DPRK to fulfill its obligations under the  safeguards agreement, it would never have agreed to such an  extremely limited inspection aimed only at servicing and  reloading the surveillance equipment as the agency's  director-general referred to.    The same is the case with the March 1994 inspection of which  the agency has made an "issue." In his above-mentioned report,  the agency's director-general said that in reaching the  DPRK-IAEA agreement on 15 February 1994, which became the basis  for the latest inspection, "We discussed only the contents of  the inspection needed, at the present juncture, for maintaining  the continuity of safeguards, not the legal grounds for the  inspection." In the final analysis, the IAEA Secretariat has  proved by itself that it could not deny the DPRK's unique status  in relations to the safeguards agreement but accepted and  tolerated its unique status and, on this basis, has performed  its inspection activities.    Despite these facts, the United States and the agency  Secretariat are still talking about the "non-compliance with the  safeguards agreement" and "full inspection," stressing that the  DPRK should yet fully live up to its obligations under the  safeguards agreement. Such action clearly shows that they are  using the safeguards agreement as a leverage for attaining their  dishonest political objectives of strangling the DPRK's  political system.    Masterminded by the United States, the IAEA Secretariat  convened the meeting of the agency's Board of Governors on March  21, 1994 to deal with the DPRK's so-called "nuclear issue" and  engineered the adoption by the board of a "resolution," which  says that the DPRK "is in further non-compliance with its  safeguards agreement by not allowing IAEA inspectors to conduct  indispensable inspection activities to verify that there has  been no diversion of nuclear material."    In its "Presidential Statement" dated March 31, 1994, the  United Nations Security Council "calls upon the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea to allow the IAEA inspectors to  complete the inspection activities as a step in fulfilling its  obligations under the safeguards agreement and in honouring  non-proliferation obligations of the treaty." This is also  clearly nothing but simply a demand that the DPRK agree to full  implementation of the safeguards agreement.    The persistency with which the United States and the IAEA  have called for the DPRK's full implementation of the safeguards  agreement is based on their intention to categorically negate  the legality of the DPRK's current unique status and to justify  their machinations of strangling the DPRK.    Even in the light of the premise on which the safeguards  agreement was approved, the legal effect of the agreement is, in  fact, as good as suspended. On April 9, 1992, the third  session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK  deliberated on the safeguards agreement to be concluded between  the DPRK and the IAEA and adopted and announced its resolution  on "approving this agreement on the premise that none of the  depositaries of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear  weapons will either deploy nuclear weapons on the Korean  peninsula or resort to nuclear threat against us."    But, the elimination of the nuclear threat by a depositary  of  the treaty against the DPRK -- which is included in the  above-stated premise -- remains yet to be achieved, and the  United States, one of the depositaries, is on the contrary  further increasing its nuclear threat against the DPRK  particularly by openly disclosing its intention to resume the  "Team Spirit `94" joint military exercises, a nuclear test war  targeting the DPRK, and massing its Armed Forces on and around  the Korean peninsula. Such actions on the part of the United  States destroy the legal basis of the DPRK's approval of the  safeguards agreement and create circumstances that prevent the  DPRK from implementing the safeguards agreement.    The IAEA Secretariat is a party to the safeguards agreement,  but the partiality and injustice in its actions give the DPRK  unambiguous grounds to withhold full implementation of the  safeguards agreement. The "Vienna Convention on the Law of  Treaties" provides in Paragraph 1 of Article 60 that "a material  breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the  other to invoke the breach as a ground for terminating the  treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in part."    The IAEA Secretariat has fundamentally breached the  safeguards agreement when it artificially fabricated the  so-called "inconsistencies" and, on the basis of the  intelligence information forged by the United States, triggered  an agency "resolution" calling for "special inspection" aimed at  opening up the "two military sites" of the DPRK, another party  to the safeguards agreement. Therefore, it follows, as a matter  of course, that the DPRK, as another party to the agreement, is  entitled to the legitimate rights to suspend the effect of this  agreement in whole or in part.  <H5>  II. The Consistent Efforts by the DPRK Government for the </H5> Continuity of Safeguards    Despite the extraordinary situation characterized by its  unilateral decision to suspend temporarily the effectuation of  the announced withdrawal from the NPT, the DPRK Government has  provided its sincere cooperation in the IAEA inspection  activities needed for the continuity of safeguards at its  nuclear facilities, as an expression of its good will to  demonstrate the transparency of the DPRK's peaceful nuclear  activities.    In keeping with its promise to the United States, the DPRK  Government has placed the nuclear activities within the DPRK's  territory strictly under the IAEA's surveillance.    At present, the IAEA-installed containment devices at the  DPRK's five-megawatt experimental atomic power plant and the  radiochemical laboratory alone include over 40 metal seals and  more than 10 paper seals, gamma mappings at 20 points, over 50  sheets of status change identification photographs and the spike  liquid for freezing processes at five vessels, and the agency's  surveillance devices installed at these facilities are six  surveillance cameras, one spent fuel rod counter and three  thermal luminescence detectors. This is an unquestionable  evidence that the DPRK's nuclear facilities remain under the  double and triple system of the IAEA's strict containment and  surveillance.    In early December 1993, an IAEA spokesman admitted that the  continuity of safeguards is maintained at the DPRK's nuclear  facilities, saying that "the surveillance system is in operation  with double and triple backup system of complementary facility  containment and surveillance devices, and its unique character  is that any malfunction of certain device falls short of  determining the interruption of the continuity. Therefore,  absence of inspection cannot lead to a total impossibility of  safeguards surveillance." Even at present, the surveillance  cameras and containment devices installed by the IAEA still  remain in place at the DPRK's nuclear facilities.    Whenever the IAEA Secretariat proposed to send inspection  teams for the purpose of maintaining the continuity of  safeguards, the DPRK agreed to receive the inspection teams and  allowed them to replace the tapes and accessories of the  surveillance equipment, to identify the seals and to conduct the  physical inventory verification activities required for the  continuity of safeguards surveillance. Such sincere efforts by  the DPRK resulted in successful inspections by the agency for  the continuity of safeguards in May and August of 1993 when the  agency inspectors serviced and reloaded containment and  surveillance equipment at the five-megawatt experimental atomic  power plant and the radiochemical laboratory, the two facilities  to which the IAEA attach importance.    In view of the size and present conditions of the DPRK's  nuclear facilities, the containment and surveillance devices  installed at these major facilities alone are enough to fully  verify non-diversion of nuclear material to other purposes in  the DPRK.    In his telex dated September 14, 1993 to the director of the  General Department of Atomic Energy of the DPRK, the IAEA  director-general pointed out that the inspection activities in  May and August of 1993 helped to maintain the continuity of  safeguards knowledge.    Even in the extraordinary circumstances following its  temporary suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from  the NPT, the DPRK Government took goodwill steps of accepting  the IAEA inspections necessary for the continuity of safeguards  of its nuclear facilities.    Motivated by its desire to fulfil in good faith both the  DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement, the  DPRK received the agency inspection team on schedule in March of  1994 and allowed the inspection team to perform its inspection  activities sufficient for maintaining the continuity of  safeguards at the declared seven facilities. These activities  include the servicing and reloading of the containment and  surveillance devices as well as the "verification of physical  inventory" of nuclear material. Such inspection activities have  helped to fully verify non-diversion of nuclear material from  the DPRK's nuclear facilities and to provide firm assurances of  the continuity of safeguards.    The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA," dated March 29, 1994, said  that the "IAEA has no evidence that North Korea has breached the  international rules in the field of nuclear technology" and  commented that "the inspectors did not find out anything to  prove their blame for an alleged military orientation of the  research work there."    South Korea's "Radio No. 1" quoted on March 16, 1994 the  IAEA  inspection team as reporting that during the just concluded  inspection in North Korea... They carried out inspection  activities including the reloading of the surveillance equipment  on a more progressive scale than the previous inspections.    On February 28, 1994, a U.S. Government official told a  press  interview that "the infrared photographs from the American  reconnaissance satellite have revealed mostly that North Korea  did not extract plutonium over the past one year."    Leonard Specter, senior researcher at the U.S. "Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace," said that "as for my  understanding, there has been no problem at the reactor. After  the inspection was complete, there has been no indication that  the fuel was removed," and added that "they would not have this  plant opened up for the world to see, if they wanted first and  foremost to try to build up their nuclear weapons program."    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific  Affairs Winston Lord and other American officials concerned also  said that "Through the agency's inspection, it is almost certain  that North Korea has not engaged in any further reprocessing  activities since it announced its decision to pull out of the  treaty."    The restriction of the inspection of the DPRK's nuclear  facilities to a limited inspection only for the continuity of  safeguards is an inevitable case befitting the DPRK's unique  status.    During the March 1-15, 1994 period when the inspection  activities took place, the DPRK did not allow smear-taking in  the glove-box area and gamma mapping for the filtering device at  the radiochemical laboratory requested by the inspection team  because it was an inordinate demand going beyond the scope of  maintaining the continuity of safeguards.    If, at this point of time, the DPRK allowed the requested  samplings and measurements unrelated to the continuity of  safeguards, then the IAEA Secretariat would play on it to frame  up "inconsistencies" again, as it did previously, and would  complicate the matter by talking about "special inspections" and  so forth. In reality, the IAEA Secretariat is now raising a hue  and cry, as if the DPRK's alleged restriction of the scope of  the recent inspection activities were responsible for a  so-called non-implementation of the February 15, 1994 DPRK-IAEA  agreement. This shows that the agency Secretariat continues  seeking its dishonest political purposes by distorting the truth  in an attempt to impute all the responsibilities to the DPRK.    The agency Secretariat's unwarranted demand for samplings  and  measurements at the radiochemical laboratory during the recent  inspection constitutes a clear violation of the February 15,  1994 agreement designed exclusively for maintaining the  continuity of safeguards. And, as for the disputed smear-taking  in the glove-box area of the radiochemical laboratory, for which  the agency Secretariat insists on the "completion of  inspection," the smear-taking has no relevance at all to the  continuity of safeguards but falls into the category of the  verification of correctness and completeness of the initial  report on nuclear material. The smear-taking in this area is  directly related with the so-called "inconsistencies" which  still stand unresolved between the two sides, and this is what  the agency already knows well. However, the DPRK side showed  highly cooperative spirit by recommending a sample-taking of the  spike liquid for the inspectors to conduct an effective  verification in the glove-box area and assisting them in  sampling the spike liquid. Analysis of this sampled liquid  alone is more than enough to determine non-diversion of nuclear  material.    Despite these facts, the agency Secretariat made an unjust  and unilateral conclusion that it "remains unable to verify that  there has been no reprocessing activities at the radiochemical  laboratory" and referred the DPRK's "nuclear issue" to the  United Nations Security Council, an action which cannot be  viewed otherwise but clearly as a calculated anti-DPRK  stratagem. Any inspections under the safeguards agreement will  never be allowed, as long as the current situation continues  with the DPRK's unique status based on its temporary suspension  of the effectuation of the declared withdrawal from the NPT.    The inspection activities that befit the DPRK's current  unique status are only the inspection activities necessary for  maintaining the continuity of safeguards. The case is the same  with an inspection of the DPRK's normal peaceful nuclear  activities.    How long the DPRK's unique status will last depends entirely  on when the United States renounces its nuclear threat against  the DPRK and its policy of antagonizing and strangling the DPRK  and, at the same time, when the agency redresses its partiality  and injustice to the DPRK. The DPRK's unique status would  naturally terminate if further round of DPRK-USA talks take  place and the simultaneous action steps are carried into  practice with a view to resolving the nuclear issue once and for  all on the principle of the proposed package solution.  <H5>  III. The Injustice of Applying the Double Standards to the </H5> DPRK's "Nuclear Issue"    At present, the IAEA Secretariat and the United Nations  Security Council, both in support of the U.S. policy of  antagonizing and strangling the DPRK, are openly applying their  extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standards to the  DPRK's "nuclear issue."    Under the U.S. manipulation, some officials of the IAEA  Secretariat manoeuvred the adoption of the unjust anti-DPRK  "resolutions" one after another charging the DPRK with the  so-called "non-compliance with the safeguards agreement" and  systematically tried to bring the DPRK's "nuclear issue" to the  United Nations.    The United Nations Security Council, also under the U.S.  behind-the-scenes manipulation, is used as forum for an  unwarranted discussion of the DPRK's "nuclear issue" against the  purposes and principles of its charter.    International law must be applied without any prejudice to  all the states, irrespective of the size of their territories or  the number of their population. The international organization  connives at the United States posing nuclear threat against the  DPRK and instead brings unilateral pressure to bear upon the  victimized DPRK. This is a clear example of application of the  double standards.    Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat are unreasonably  provoking the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities, while  conniving at the U.S.-patronized countries developing nuclear  weapons.    In the practice of its inspection activities, the IAEA  defends some countries using their nuclear facilities for the  military purposes, saying "those are undeclared facilities," or  "they are the buildings about which there is no other available  information related to the existence of nuclear materials." Some  officials of the IAEA Secretariat have conducted more than 100  rounds of inspections in other countries but never made an issue  of the telltale nuclear weapons development programme in some of  these countries. But, after six rounds of inspections only in  the DPRK, they fomented suspicions about alleged "nuclear  weapons development" in the DPRK and pushed through a Board of  Governors' resolution calling for "special inspection." This is  a graphic illustration of how far their double standards policy  has gone against the DPRK.    On April 1, 1993 the editor of the Tanzanian newspaper  "MOTOMOTO" said that the United States feigns ignorance of the  nuclear development programme in some countries, but on the  other hand it "persists in its efforts to fault North Korea's  alleged `nuclear development' and its declared intention to  withdraw from the NPT despite its faithful implementation of the  NPT obligations because, in a nutshell, that nation is regarded  as a cancerous entity hampering the U.S. attempts to establish a  new global order."    The Thai newspaper "BANGKOK POST," dated April 15, 1993  carried an article entitled "Why Nuclear Arms Race Is Based on  Racial Discrimination?" which says the double standards are now  applied clearly toward the attitude of North Korea that has  expressed its displeasure over the NPT's discriminatory nature  and announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty on the  one hand and toward the attitude of certain countries that have  acknowledged having produced nuclear bombs with equivalent fire  power to that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima of Japan during  World War II on the other.    The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA" dated March 30, 1993 also  reported that "many observers are highly suspicious of the  nuclear programmes of a number of countries, which remain out of  sight of the United States and the IAEA," and deplored "the U.S.  demand for North Korea to accept inspections of its military  sites to be astonishing."    The abnormal situation is such that the nations on which  sanctions should be imposed go unchallenged while pressure is  imposed on an innocent nation.    Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat connived at the  nuclear weapons development programme by the U.S.-patronized  countries, but in case of the DPRK, they did not hesitate to use  openly the forged intelligence information and satellite  photographs from a third country which are forbidden to be used  for inspection activities, in a desperate attempt to create a  "suspicion about the nuclear development" in the DPRK.    None of provisions in the IAEA statute and the safeguards  agreement stipulate usability of a third country's intelligence  information to the agency's inspection activities. However,  some officials of the IAEA Secretariat have breached the IAEA  statute and the safeguards agreement by systematically using the  falsified intelligence information from a third country for  their inspections at the DPRK's nuclear facilities. On November  16, 1990, the Japanese "JIJI" news service disclosed that, in a  bid to arouse suspicion about the DPRK's nuclear activities, the  United States "adventurously faked up reconnaissance satellite  photographs and circulated them among the IAEA Secretariat and  the Western countries" to peddle around the "suspected nuclear  arms development programme" in the DPRK.    The American newspaper "WASHINGTON POST," dated April 27,  1993 acknowledged that "the Clinton administration provided the  IAEA with photographs from the U.S. reconnaissance satellite as  evidence of `North Korea's nuclear weapons development  programme.'"    A British newspaper "DAILY AFFAIRS INTERNATIONAL," dated  April 4, 1994, carried an article by its Deputy Editor Keith  Bennett, entitled "Why Should the Third World Nations Defend  North Korea?" which says "The International Atomic Energy Agency  has conducted inspections in this country and given it a `clean  bill of health' that the nuclear facilities in the country are  used only for peaceful purposes. But, when the U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency presented photographs from its  eye-in-the-sky satellites, the IAEA made a surprise move by  pressing North Korea to accept `special inspection,' in wanton  violation of the IAEA statute providing against the use of  information from extraneous sources to the purpose of its  inspection activities. This is an example of the double  standards applied by the IAEA."    In reality, during the February 1993 meeting of the agency's  Board of Governors, the IAEA director-general screened the slide  films of the forged satellite picture provided by the United  States in an attempt to create a suspicion that certain military  site in the DPRK is a "nuclear waste storage". In his address  on April 14, 1993 to a conference on atomic industry in Yokohama  of Japan, the IAEA director-general even stated openly that he  would "continue using the U.S. intelligence information about  the two locations around Yongbyon for the agency's inspections  and go on obtaining North Korea's nuclear-related information  from third countries even if North Korea may protest."    As seen in the above, the previous routine and ad hoc  inspections conducted by the IAEA were not inspections aimed at  verifying the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial  report on nuclear material but they were, from the outset, the  IAEA-coated U.S. inspections to fabricate pretence for  strangling the DPRK on the basis of the intelligence information  forged by the United States.    Moreover, some officials in the IAEA Secretariat have  systematically dished out to the United States and other hostile  forces the confidential information to which they had obtained  access in the course of the inspections at the DPRK's nuclear  facilities. These actions constitute a gross violation of the  provision of the safeguards agreement on protecting secrets and  other confidential information coming to their knowledge during  inspections. After all, the inspections at the DPRK's nuclear  facilities were, in the true sense of the word, "no-secret  inspections" and "open inspections," and they were "joint  inspections" and "cooperative inspections" under the  "quadripartite system of coordination" of the United States,  Japan, South Korea and the IAEA.    All the above-cited facts show that the double standards  policy pursued by the United States and the IAEA with respect to  the DPRK's nuclear issue has reached its culmination and such  policy has topped the height of injustice.    As can be seen in the above, the attempts to force the DPRK  to fully implement the safeguards agreement-bound obligations at  the present stage are motivated by the malevolent purposes to  destroy the basis of the DPRK's declaration of its decision to  withdraw from the treaty in the long run, by stretching the  truth to make an impression that the DPRK still remains a full  state party of the NPT.    As the DPRK has stated in no uncertain terms the reasons for  declaring its decision to withdraw from the NPT, unless the  United States renounces its policy of hostility and nuclear  threat campaign against the DPRK and unless the IAEA Secretariat  redresses its partiality and injustice to the DPRK, the DPRK's  reinstatement in the treaty will remain absolutely inconceivable  and, therefore, full implementation of the safeguards agreement  will have no sense of word at the present stage.    Inspection limited strictly to maintaining the continuity of  safeguards alone is what the DPRK can accept in keeping with its  unique status based on the temporary suspension of the  effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the NPT and  contingent on the progress of the DPRK-USA talks.    The DPRK's unique status was not of its own making intended  for its selfish purposes, but it was imposed on the DPRK,  against its will, by the United States and the IAEA Secretariat  due to the abnormal situation resulting from their unjust  actions. The DPRK sincerely wants such an extraordinary  situation to be straightened out as soon as possible and the  nuclear issue to be resolved impartially. To this end, the  United States and the IAEA Secretariat must clearly realize  their responsibility for the origination of the nuclear issue  and for its current complexity, stop resorting to the  unreasonable and contradictory method of the double standards  and pressure, and must seek unprejudiced and substantial ways to  resolve the nuclear issue once and for all.    The current developments give serious lessons that dialogue  and negotiations are the only way to attain an early resolution  of the nuclear issue and to achieve detente and peace and that  pressure and "sanctions" are the path of unpardonable notorious  crimes of whipping up conflict and confrontation and thus  blocking permanently the possibility of resolving the nuclear  issue.    If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat continue to  resort to unreasonable pressure campaign ignoring such lessons  of history, the nuclear issue will remain unresolved  indefinitely and it will only entail irretrievable consequences  jeopardizing peace and security in Asia and the rest of the  world.    All the facts show that if they try at the present stage to  restore confidence on a step-by-step basis through inspection  designed for the continuity of safeguards in line with the  DPRK's current unique status and at the same time take a serious  approach to the DPRK-USA talks, the matters related to the  implementation of the safeguards agreement will be sorted out in  due course, and eventually the nuclear issue will be resolved  once and for all.

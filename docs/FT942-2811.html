			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Observer: In their court When is Sir Michael Richardson, Lady Thatcher's favourite corporate financier, going to retire as chairman of Smith New Court, the City stockbrokers? He turned 69 in April and he could bow out with pride following yesterday's sparkling figures from the firm. Sir Michael, who gets into the office before 8 am and works a full five-day week and sometimes more, has told Observer that he has no intention of soldiering on till 1997, like his old chums Lords Hanson and White. Then again, he has no plans for quitting this year. Even so, his eventual retirement raises the question of whether Smith New Court will pick another outsider to be chairman - Sir Michael was the first  -or return to its old ways of promoting someone from the shop floor. It will be an interesting test of the firm's maturity.</p>

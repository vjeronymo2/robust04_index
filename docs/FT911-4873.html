			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Brady takes wider view of bank's operations THE US treasury secretary, Mr Nicholas Brady, emphasised yesterday the strong role of the board of directors in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 'We do not view the activity of the board as an advisory one, but, instead, as a critical element of the bank's operations,' he said in a speech to the EBRD inaugural meeting. His speech reinforced the differences in approach to the bank by the US and some other shareholders (which see a relatively narrow focus for the bank in encouraging the private sector in east Europe), and the broader view of the bank as the first truly pan-European organisation being taken by others, including its president, Mr Jacques Attali. 'We believe strongly that the EBRD's focus should be private sector development and the financing of infrastructure which directly supports private sector activity,' Mr Brady said. Reinforcing the message, a senior US Treasury official said afterwards that it was the job of the shareholders to set the policy of the bank 'and it's down to the management to carry out those policies.' In his speech, Mr Brady said the bank would need to keep in mind the activities of other bilateral and multilateral donors to the region 'in order to avoid duplication and conflicting operations.'

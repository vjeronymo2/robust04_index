			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Granada pledges to honour commitment to quality TV GRANADA GROUP gave a written commitment to the Independent Television Commission last week that Granada Television would honour the terms of its licence in spite of the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright as executive chairman. The pledge by Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman of the parent company, was submitted in case Granada's undertakings on programme quality in its successful application for a new 10-year licence were called into question. Mr Plowright was told on January 27 by Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's new group chief executive, he would have to resign. His effective dismissal was announced on Monday. Mr George Russell, ITC chairman, signalled the commission's concern over the licence terms last week when he warned that the decision to remove Mr Plowright was a mistake that could perhaps have serious commercial implications for Granada. The remark was made, it is believed, at a private meeting held at the ITC between Mr Russell, Mr Plowright and Mr Andrew Quinn, who becomes chief executive of Granada TV after Mr Plowright leaves at the end of this month. Mr Plowright had led Granada's successful application for a new licence in spite of being heavily outbid by Mr Phil Redmond's Northwest Television. He is one of the most respected figures in British commercial television and has worked for Granada for more than 30 years. He was so devastated when told he would have to resign that he asked Mr Quinn, who was not involved in the decision, to take over the post immediately. Mr Quinn, who has worked at Granada for the past 27 years, argued that the ITC had to be informed and a meeting with Mr Russell took place on Thursday. The ITC was clearly shocked by the move to oust Mr Plowright so soon after the company was given its new licence. In spite of the ITC's misgivings, his removal was accepted on the grounds that a broadcasting licence was awarded to a management team and not to an individual. The ITC last night declined to comment on what had been discussed. On Monday, senior programme executives at Granada said that the peremptory removal of their chairman had 'undermined the confidence of the senior programme management in the intentions of Granada Group to honour the licence commitments required by the ITC'. Mr Bernstein, clearly irritated that Mr Plowright's removal was being interpreted as a case of 'profits before quality', said yesterday: 'I am surprised that people assume we are going to stop making quality television and stop making a major contribution to the ITV network. We will continue to do both.' Little-known group makes top bid for national radio channel, Page 8</p>

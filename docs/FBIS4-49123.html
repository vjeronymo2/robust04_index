			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- A prosecutor in the central  Taiwan city of Chiayi charged 15 people with either vote-buying  or graft during the city and county council speaker and deputy  speaker elections that culminated on March 1.    The prosecutor recommended 34 months in jail for speaker  Hsiao Teng-wang and five years for Deputy Speaker Chen Chun-kui  for vote- buying if they are found guilty.    An investigation showed that Hsiao and Chen had offered NT$1  [new Taiwan dollars] million (US$37,878) and NT$800,000,  respectively, to each councilor who would vote for them.    The prosecutor also proposed a jail term of two years for  councilors Chang Tung-kun and Li Tien-lang, who were suspected  of buying votes on behalf of Hsiao and Chen.    Eleven other people face proposed jail terms of between  eight  months and 18 months for their roles in the nation's worst  election scandal.    At least 360 people around Taiwan, including 13 speakers,  nine deputy speakers and 185 councilors, have so far been  indicted on graft charges as the investigation into the scandal  continues to unfold.    The Chiayi County Council on Monday emerged unscathed from  the scandal when the Chiayi prosecutor's office concluded an  investigation into the election of the council with nobody being  charged.    The ruling Kuomintang won all 23 city and county speaker  positions at stake in the polls.</p>

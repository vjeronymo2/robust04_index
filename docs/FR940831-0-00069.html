			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, the command to regulate the transportation of ``each hazardous substance'' need not be read to require the regulation of hazardous substances transported in any amount or concentration. In view of the costs attending regulation, &sect;9656(a) is best read to require the regulation of hazardous substances in transportation only in amounts that, if spilled, require notification of the National Response Center. For shipments in a single package of 50,000 pounds or less, the &sect;171.8 rule for mixtures and solutions is a simple means to determine that the lading does not amount to an RQ of a hazardous substance. A small number of shipments of more than 50,000 pounds of a hazardous substance in a mixture or in solution may be excluded from regulation despite containing more than an RQ of the hazardous substance. A regulation that implements a general statutory command, however, cannot avoid some degree of both over- and underregulation. In light of the operator liability concerns underpinning the &sect;9656(a) mandate, underregulation was remedied by the EPA's concurrence in the rule, and its issuance of a notice that carriers complying with reporting requirements in accordance with the RSPA rule would be deemed to have met FWPCA reporting requirements. 45 FR 61617 (Sept. 17, 1980);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see also <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  45 FR 74642 (Nov. 10, 1980). The two limitations of 49 CFR 171.8 establish, directly or by approximation, a regulatory threshold at the RQ, and are a reasoned interpretation of the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) mandate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA treats mixtures and solutions of a hazardous substance differently under CERCLA than RSPA treats them under 49 CFR 171.8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  40 CFR 302.6. RSPA's and the EPA's approaches differ not because RSPA is second-guessing the EPA as to the health and environmental risks posed by hazardous substances in mixture or solution, but because the agencies simplified in different ways the operator's determination of whether an RQ of a hazardous substance is present. Congress amended &sect;9656(a) in 1986 to correct RSPA's failure to regulate hazardous substances with statutory one-pound RQ's, but did not take issue with these two aspects of 49 CFR 171.8. This is further evidence that the regulation is consistent with statutory intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the allocation of authority between RSPA and the EPA, these two elements of &sect;171.8 are consistent with the principle set forth in section III.B, above. The RQ is the regulatory threshold for all hazardous substances; the treatment of hazardous substance mixtures and solutions makes distinctions only between hazardous substances with different RQ's. Each element fully respects the EPA's hazardous substance and RQ designations and its assessment of the comparative health and environmental concerns of each hazardous substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, the action that petitioners ask RSPA to take is not within RSPA's discretion in either respect. Petitioners concede that RSPA is obligated to list lead sulfide as a hazardous material with an RQ of 10 pounds, but ask that certain lead sulfide mixtures be designated as hazardous materials only at a concentration of 10 percent or greater, while other lead sulfide mixtures, as well as other mixtures containing a hazardous substance with an RQ of 10 pounds, are hazardous materials at a hazardous substance concentration of 0.02 percent. Contrary to the section 9656(a) mandate, this would permit the transportation of up to 500 times the RQ of lead sulfide in a single packaging (more, if concentrates are transported in bulk in a quantity above 50,000 pounds) without requiring identification of the lading as a hazardous substance. Carriers nevertheless would remain subject to the CERCLA reporting requirement, and to civil and criminal sanctions for failing to comply with it. As well, it would convert the &sect;171.8 mixture rule from a means to simplify the operator's computation of whether an RQ is present to a means of disregarding the EPA's conclusion, expressed in the designation of a 10-pound RQ, as to the relative risks that lead sulfide poses to the public health and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The foundation of petitioners' claim is that the lead sulfide in their copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates is not bioavailable, and that these concentrates are being subjected to a regulatory regime not warranted by the public health and environmental risk that they pose. RSPA's discretion does not extend to excepting lead sulfide from the hazardous material designation on the basis of its own assessment of health and environmental risks. Petitioners' claim properly was before the EPA during its rulemaking to consider adjusting the RQ for lead sulfide. In that rulemaking, the issue of lead sulfide bioavailability was directly raised by commenters and considered by the EPA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  letters in EPA Docket 102RQ&hyph;31L from the American Mining Congress (July 7, 1992; document 3&hyph;22); Hecla Mining Company (June 17, 1992; document 3&hyph;6); Lead Industries Association (July 7, 1992; doc. 3&hyph;21); Charlotte Biblow (July 7, 1992; doc. 3&hyph;13); EPA responses to comments at document 4&hyph;1 and 58 FR 35319&hyph;20. The EPA determined not to except petitioners' form of lead sulfide from designation as a hazardous substance, and assigned lead sulfide in all forms, including petitioners', an RQ of 10 pounds. 58 FR 35314. RSPA may not revisit the EPA's conclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok Land's debut confounds sceptics  -Its success coincides with record trading volume on the exchange The holiday atmosphere of the Chinese New Year was not enough to prevent Thailand's determined punters from crowding into stockbrokers' offices as usual yesterday to bet on a market which has seen record trading volumes in the past few weeks. Yesterday's main attraction was the newly-listed property shares of Bangkok Land, which immediately became the largest company on the exchange by capitalisation and accounted for around one-third of the day's turnover. Investors crowded around the brokers' price screens, gasping and biting their lips as the shares, priced at Bt90 each at the initial public offering four months ago, opened at Bt150 (Dollars 6), jumped to Bt161 and then settled back to close at Bt154, valuing the company at Bt92.4bn (more than Dollars 3.6bn). It was otherwise an unremarkable day, and the SET index closed down 6.31 at 763.41. But the market has been humming with activity since the end of last year, a trend best illustrated by the change in sentiment about Bangkok Land; four months ago, at Bt90, the underwriters had trouble selling the 60m shares on offer (10 per cent of the equity), a problem which is now earning them handsome profits as they unload the stock. 'Three months ago everyone hated the stock because conditions were all wrong for it,' said one broker yesterday. The revival of the Thai stock exchange was led by the banks. They had been shunned by many investors because of their repeated forays into the market to raise capital as their business expanded. But a decision by the Thai authorities to apply Bank of International Settlements regulations on capital ratios in the near future is expected to allow them to include property as part of their second-tier capital, and so slow down the dilution of their earnings per share. At the same time, local investors have been encouraged by rumours of 10-for-one share splits, which would make the expensive counters much more liquid for the country's numerous small-time speculators. The banks were followed upwards by the volatile financial and securities stocks; they benefit from increased market activity and provide a leveraged bet on the market as a whole. Lower interest rates and better-than-expected company results also contributed to a rise in the SET index, which was languishing below 700 until December. 'Often in Thailand it goes sector by sector,' said one broker yesterday. 'There is still potential in other sectors.' Volume has been boosted since last year by the computerisation of trading on the exchange, by the increasing input from provincial brokers and speculators, and by renewed foreign interest in January. The exchange is expected to lengthen the trading time to four hours from three later this year by introducing an afternoon session. At present the exchange is open between 9 am and midday. Interest in the market is likely to be maintained by the privatisation and flotation of Thai Airways in the next few months, although foreign brokers say they cannot understand why the government is suggesting a price which would give the company a price/earnings ratio of nearly 13, higher than rival regional airlines which are regarded as better quality investments. In the meantime there are suggestions that the rally of the last few weeks may already have run out of steam with the approach of the March elections and the political uncertainty that they imply.</p>

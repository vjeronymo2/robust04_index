			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Names get a boost Lloyd's Names do not need reminding about the perils of trading on the basis of unlimited liability. This week, Citibank unveiled an innovative - but inevitably complex - scheme that could offer existing members of the insurance market a way of switching to limited liability for future trading. The scheme, drawn up in conjunction with agents representing Names' interests, could prove attractive. And while it would be impossible to buy complete protection for liabilities arising on policies underwritten in the past, Citibank's plan would, in effect, 're-insure' those liabilities into an individual company for each Name - a NameCo. At the same time, it would use a separate re-insurance deal to provide extra funds at Lloyd's. This means that although companies are allowed generally to underwrite policies worth twice the value of the funds they hold at Lloyd's, the gearing of some NameCos could be boosted to 3:1. Tax and other details have still to be thrashed out but the scheme has a good chance of being approved by Lloyd's authorities, which appear to regard the switch away from unlimited liability as inevitable and almost certainly a good thing. Patrick Hanratty, a vice-president of Citibank, says setting-up and running costs should not be 'onerous'. Whether the scheme can offer real protection against losses incurred on past policies will depend on the extent to which Lloyd's succeeds in subsuming pre-1986 liabilities into NewCo, the company it has set up for that purpose. Meanwhile, the timing of Citibank's announcement means few Names are likely to be able to convert for the 1995 underwriting year. The road to conversion is not going to be a high-speed freeway.</p>

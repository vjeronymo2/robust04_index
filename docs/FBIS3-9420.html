			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, March 21 (TANJUG) -- Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman told the United Nations Security Council on  Monday that Croatia would accept an extension of the UNPROFOR  mandate provided the U.N.-protected area of the republic of Serb  Krajina be incorporated into Croatia.    Next week, U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is to  ask the Security Council to extend the mandate of the U.N.  protection force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), which is due  to expire on March 31, for another year.    Speaking at a session held behind closed doors, Tudjman said  that the argument that a framework for a comprehensive political  solution to the problem of this UNPA [UN protected area] has yet  to be found no longer stands. He said that the political  framework had been precisely set through the international  recognition of the Republic of Croatia and its outside borders.    The argument which no longer stands is one of the points of  the plan made by international mediator Cyrus Vance, under which  Krajina was proclaimed an UNPA in the spring of 1992 and  according to which peace-keepers have been deployed there.    The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in  their  ethnic and historical territories in Croatia in answer to the  forcible secession of this former Yugoslav Republic from the  former Yugoslavia and the degradation of their civil and  national rights by the Croatian authorities.    Despite the fact that Krajina is an UNPA, Croatia attacked  it  four times, as Butrus-Ghali himself said in a report for the  Security Council, in attempts to reinstate its authority there  by force.    Tudjman said that Croatia was suffering huge economic losses  because of the current situation in the UNPA and that it could  not tolerate the "inefficiency" of the UNPROFOR indefinitely.    Tudjman set out that the only matter that could be discussed  was the degreee of autonomy for the Serb population in areas  where they were the majority before 1992. He said that this  meant only the districts of Knin and Glina.    The Krajina population has held two referendums so far and  opted against reintegration into Croatia? Krajina President  Milan Martic on Sunday said that Krajina Serbs would not yield  their right to self-determination.    Tudjman urged the quick return of refugees to the UNPA and  said, in threatening tones, that Croatia would not be able to  prevent thousands of refugees from trying to return to their  homes if they could no longer control their desperation.    Croatia fears that this could have undesired consequences on  the peace process which is underway, Tudjman said, in an evident  desire to find an alibi for possible future Croatian attacks on  the republic of Serb Krajina.</p>

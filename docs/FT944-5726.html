			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Coats Viyella to get works council Coats Viyella, Britain's largest clothing and textiles group, has agreed, in principle, to the creation of a works council for its 34,000 employees inside the European Union. The company and the British unions involved hope to announce a formal agreement by next March. This follows the announcement two weeks ago that United Biscuits had decided to establish a works council under a new EU directive, the first British-owned company to do so. The move by Coats Viyella is a further sign that a growing number of large British companies with widespread European business activities intend to ignore the UK's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, achieved by Mr John Major, the prime minister, nearly three years ago. This would have allowed them to exclude their UK employees from the consultation and information arrangements which will be required under European law for their employees outside the UK. Coats Viyella has proposed the creation of a two-tier system of councils for its employees. A group forum will meet once a year under the chairmanship of the company's chief executive, Mr Neville Bain. This would include key managers of the group and around 50 employee representatives from the company's European plants. Consultation and information committees are also to be established for each of the company's six divisions. The proposed committees of managers and workers would discuss a wide range of areas including economic performance, financial issues, the environment, human resource management and health and safety. Coats Viyella has 27,000 employees in the UK and 7,000 in other EU countries.</p>

The individual petitions are described below, including the party seeking relief, the regulatory provisions involved, and the nature of the relief being requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before, October 31, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9:00 a.m._5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The individual petitions seeking an exemption or waiver of compliance are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;93&hyph;13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Metra seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229) for Electric MU Locomotives and Non-MU Control Cab Locomotives. Metra is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. Metra requests that the compliance date be extended to July 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. The railroad states that event recorders will be installed on existing equipment by retrofit and by an outside rebuilding program. In addition, new cars to be delivered will be equipped when built. The schedule for these activities extend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1996, making the May 5, 1995, compliance date unattainable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SEPTA seeks a permanent waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229). SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirement of &sect;229.5(g) that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Event recorders monitor and record data: over the most recent 48 hours of operation of the electrical system of the locomotive on which it is installed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SEPTA states that a railroad supervisor can get to the scene of any accident on their system within one hour. They feel that 8 hours of recorded information is sufficient for any accident investigation on their railroad. SEPTA's event recorders are solid state devices which record each change in state. With their present recorder system a printed copy of the stored information fills about 73 pages. To accommodate 48 hours of recorded information would result in a very extensive printed copy with no additional useful information. FRA has previously ``grandfathered'' event recorders which were in service on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 8, 1993, and which recorded only 8 hours of data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver Petition Docket Number LI&hyph;94&hyph;8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SEPTA seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Locomotive Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 229) for Electric MU Locomotives. SEPTA is seeking relief from the requirements of Section 229.135 that all trains operating over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 mph shall be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. SEPTA requests the compliance date be extended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 7, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Locomotive Safety Standards were revised on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 8, 1993, to require each lead locomotive of trains operating over 30 mph to be equipped with an event recorder by May 5, 1995. The railroad states that off-the-shelf event recorders will be installed on conventional (non-MU locomotives) locomotives within the specified time, however, new design event recorders will be required for the Electric MU Locomotives. SEPTA is requesting seven additional months for the design, manufacture and installation of event recorders on their MU locomotive fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

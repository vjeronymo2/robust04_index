			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 14 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Monday,  the Ramiro de Leon Carpio administrtaion and the Army spoke out  against negotiating with URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity] guerrillas on the creation of a commission to investigate  human rights violations during the 33 years of armed conflict in  Guatemala.    While the government considers that the time is not right to  discuss forming a commission called the "Truth Commission" or  "Commission of the Past" with its immediate international  verification, the Army flatly rejected "any possibility" of  doing so.    The "Truth Commission" and the participation of  international  agents are things the URNG guerrillas have demanded as part of  the peace discussion with the various governments over the past  decade.    Copaz [Peace Commission], a government sponsored  organization, President Hector Rosada, admitted today in a  meeting with foreign journalists that "there are military  sectors who are unhappy" about reaching an agreement on human  rights and the creation of the Truth Commission. Deputy Defense  Minister General Julio Fidencio Otzoy told ACAN-EFE today,  during a visit to El Salvador, that "we do not accept the  so-called Truth Commission or Commission of the Past, under any  circumstance. The commission is definitely bad because we are  searching for peace and reconciliation, but the commission seeks  to reopen wounds; it brings out the bad side of people, bad  blood, which in turn causes violence and instability," stressed  Otzoy.    The military leader, nevertheless, considered positive the  fact that the government and the guerrillas reached a framework  for agreement in January for the resumption of peace talks,  possibly next month. "Our position is to immediately seek peace,  but unfortunately the URNG is not interested in peace; what they  are interested in is a political aspect," stated Otzoy.    According to the military leader, the URNG "has already  militarily lost the war" and is now fighting "tooth and nail" to  ensure political recognition so that "their effort is not  described as useless and so the situation does not turn against  them."    Copaz President Hector Rosada said the government "is not  refusing" to discuss the creation of the commission at another  time in the peace process, but stressed that the Army believes  this affair "seeks to weaken or blame the Armed Forces."    The government representative denied that an Armed Forces  purge or reduction will be discussed in the negotiations with  the URNG "because these are military affairs; civilians have no  business discussing them. These are matters that depend on  geopolitical reasons."    Hector Rosada, an expert sociologist in military topics,  stressed that "by dividing the Army all that will be gained is a  coup d'etat," therefore, he warned that the government is not in  "position to unnecessarily relinquish political opportunities"  to the guerrillas. "The Truth Commission," he added, "is a  verification mechanism not a human right commission, therefore  we will discuss it when the time comes." Rosada insisted that  the government "is not refusing" to discuss this affair.    Rosada maintains that the United Nations cannot adapt the  mechanisms used in El Salvador to Guatemala because it is not  the proper procedure and in addition, he stressed, "I have my  reservations" about the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal).    To his way of thinking, the Truth Commission should be an  educational and political instrument so the population can learn  that "the politics of animals were used throughout 20 years" and  so sectors learn not to hide in impunity. Rosada believes this  commission should take the most representative cases of  genocide, kidnappings, and murders to demonstrate that "what  happened when the country was a mess."    Copaz has requested President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and  Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez not to change any of the  three high-ranking officers who comprise it, given negotiations  with the guerrilla are due to begin in the next few weeks with  UN mediation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by General Director, DGP [State geophysics </F> enterprise] ``Ukrgeofizyka'', M.V. Kivshyk under the ``Oil and  Gas Geology'' rubric    [Abstract] Problems of geophysics are closely related to  the extremely urgent problem of increasing oil and gas reserves  in Ukraine. The current status of geophysical methods for oil  and gas prospecting in Ukraine has been determined to a large  degree by the status of geophysical service in Ukraine within  the former Soviet Union and the level of geophysics in the  latter. As a result, in terms of geophysical instrument building  and geophysics technology Ukraine is lagging substantially  behind highly developed countries. This becomes clear from the  comparison of technical and technological means used in Ukraine  and in the West. For instance, equipment for recording seismic  information can record information in 48 or 96 channels at a  time, whereas equipment used in the West and USA can record  information in 960 channels plus. The best computers used in  Ukraine for processing geophysical information have an 8 MB RAm,  2-4 GB hard disk and operate at 2 million operations per second,  while in the West these parameters are 80-100 MB, 12-16 GB and  100 million operations per second, respectively. The use of  personal computers in Ukraine is in its initial stage due to the  lack of money for buying them. Oil and gas geophysics in Ukraine  is in critical state. Immediate retooling of geophysical  operations in Ukraine is mandatory. The author suggests measures  aimed at solving this problem.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> OLDIES BRIGHTEN JACKSON BROWNE'S DARK MOOD  </P> <P> Singing an updated rendition of the old blues song "Cocaine" at the Universal  Amphitheatre, accompanied by his pal David Lindley on violin, Jackson Browne  recently brought along a few new verses to fit his coke-free,  consciousness-raised life style:  </P> <P> "I wouldn't have been a user even one more day/If you'd shown me how I was  helping turn a profit for the CIA," went one couplet. And: "Look at me, I'm as  sharp as a tack/Except for a few million brain cells I wouldn't mind having  back."  </P> <P> Ah, but Browne's memory is still in dandy shape. At one point he good-humoredly  brought up a review that suggested one of his Central American-themed  compositions sounded "more like a speech than a song." This was a review that  ran in The Times nearly three years ago to the day, mind you.  </P> <P> In the intervening 36 months, Browne's new material has only gotten more, not  less, pedantic. Which doesn't mean that it's never effective. That's been three  more years to get used to the idea of his shift from a confessional style to a  sharply oratorical one -- and, more significantly, three years of disturbing  congressional hearings to make his protest songs seem less paranoid and more  palpable.  </P> <P> Still, fans cheered the pre-social conscience oldies loudest, which is  understandable; seven nifty numbers on which opening act and longtime cohort  Lindley guested were reminders of just how listless much of Browne's  Lindley-less arrangements have become.  </P></p>

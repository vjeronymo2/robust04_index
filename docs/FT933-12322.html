			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: An essential reading list for the hols - London WITH summer holidays upon us, thoughts are turning to reading material for those long, lazy days on the beach. Here is a selection of the latest business books which should ensure that the time is productively employed. The View from Number 11, by Kenneth Clarke Not the memoirs of the same name by Nigel Lawson, but an instant book from the new chancellor containing his views on the economy, as related to the Treasury select committee. He believes Britain is experiencing 'an all-round recovery'. But Clarke recognises the problem of the Pounds 50bn budget deficit, hinting that tax increases are to come? Drawing on positive recent economic statistics, such as the rise in retail sales and the strength of exports in June, Clarke propounds his theory that the recovery is 'incipient'. His views have since been confirmed by second quarter growth figures showing a rise of 0.5 per cent. A revised edition of this book will be published on November 30. Privatisations. The Warburg guide to selling state assets. At last the definitive work on the subject. But sadly this book appears after the completion of the last UK privatisation of any size for some years to come, though the book is being translated into French. Taking the BT3 sale as its example, Warburg shows how a privatisation can be played to give investors a premium on day one, without falling into the selling-assets-on-the-cheap trap. Some private investors who bought through share shops and have been unable to sell without their share certificates, may not agree with the Warburg thesis that perfection in privatisations has been reached. Is the Stock Market going up? by A Guru, of Puffit and Floggit, stockbrokers. Despite all this good economic news the equity market has been doggedly refusing to rise. A leading stockmarket commentator explains why he thinks the market is still cheap - based partly on the technical view that the Footsie index is oversold, and 2800 provides a floor. Friday's recovery from an opening 20 point fall backs up that idea. Guru also suggests that strong export growth will begin to show up in corporate earnings figures in the coming interim results reporting season, underpinning p/e ratios. Further, the UK market is looking cheap compared to other European stock markets. However, he admits, loss of momentum in the gilt-edged market is not helping the equity market. Free the Belgravia One by Asil Nadir. Unfortunately legal restricitions prevent us disclosing anything about this book, published and distributed at the author's own expense. Drug Research: is it worth the candle? by Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots A bitter man, Sir James. But who could blame him? After pouring over Pounds 100m into researching Manoplax, a drug for heart failure, and finally getting it to the market he then had to withdraw the drug within months. His only consolation must be that the stock market had long since given up the idea that Manoplax would be the motor for Boots profit growth in the 1990s and Boots shares actually rose on the publication. But will Boots now give up ethical drug research altogether? We will have to wait for the sequel. Up like a rocket, down like a stick, by Bernard Taylor and Bill Rooney. Why is it that the most spectacular rises so often lead to the most uncomfortable falls? Taking Medeva and Spring Ram as examples - with Sage Group, the software company, covered in a footnote - the authors completely fail to explain what went wrong. Ian Gowrie-Smith, Taylor's associate at drugs company Medeva, remarks: 'We are still en route to being one of the most successful companies in corporate British history.' This is in spite of the halving of the share price on the day the company warned on current year profits. Meanwhile, Bill Rooney, of Spring Ram, was still clutching the jar of magic beans to which he attributed the group's earlier success as institutional investors in the kitchen and bathroom company kept up the pressure for him to stand down. A postscript from Taylor admits Medeva needs to 'rebuild investor confidence', hardly a profound conclusion. How to make a Billion in Property, by George Soros and Alastair Ross Goobey, with a foreword by Gerald Ronson A sequel to Soros's bestseller, How to make a Billion in the Foreign Exchanges, this book will be of particular interest to those convinced that what comes down must go up. Aside from Ronson's quip in the foreword - start with two billion - Soros and Ross Goobey set out their view that the property market is cheap. Putting their money where the mouths are Soros has already backed a deal with British Land, and Ross Goobey has rescued Greycoat. This week Ross Goobey used another Pounds 62m of the Postel pension fund to buy three of Ronson's properties. The House of Fraser Sale, published by SG Warburg. And finally, one for next year's holiday. Promised by the publishers this week, the history and prospectus for this long established department store group, although omitting the tale of Harrods, the best known of all. It is to be hoped the book will answer the many questions which have surrounded this business. Just who are the mysterious, eastern, Fayed brothers? Why do they want to sell this prestigious business which they acquired only eight years ago? How has it performed under their leadership? Can Tiny Rowland, of Lonrho, put a spoke in the wheel? What will readers discover in the small print at the back of the book? A thriller destined to become a bestseller. Good reading and happy holidays.</p>

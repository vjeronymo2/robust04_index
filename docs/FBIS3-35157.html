The Israeli delegation was instructed by the  government to turn down the request. According to Israel, the  matter should only be discussed when the two sides come up with  a draft for a peace agreement between Israel and Jordan. Talks  on the Israel-Jordan track will resume Tuesday [22 February] and  will focus on security arrangements.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: M&amp;S caution Caution about second-half trading from high street retailer Marks and Spencer saw shares in the group surrender an early advance that followed the release of favourable interim figures. Profits rose 15.1 per cent to Pounds 354m, beating the most optimistic of the market's forecasts, and the stock initially rose to 413p. However, the company hinted that the market should not to be over-optimistic about the second half. Researchers pointed to uncertainty over Sunday trading, and lower than expected sales in women's clothing because of continued mild weather. The general tone remained positive and BZW, which held its full-year forecast at Pounds 970m, retained the stock as a core holding in the sector. The shares closed 5 1/2 off at 404p after heavy trading of 8.7m. Elsewhere, Boots ended 3 ahead at 520p following a press report that it was about to accept an offer of nearly Pounds 900m for its pharmaceuticals division from BASF, the German chemicals group. SmithKline Beecham remained in positive territory as Goldman Sachs reiterated its positive stance on the stock. The US investment bank believes that the effect of the US patent expiry of Tagamet is entirely discounted in the current share price. SmithKline closed a penny up at 409p. Pilkington, the world's biggest glass maker, slipped 3 to 192p, with dealers saying that Cazenove attempted but failed to place some 20m shares. Composite insurer Commercial Union held its ground ahead of third-quarter figures today as Smith New Court cited it as its preferred stock in the sector. The shares firmed slightly to 543p, although a number of analysts expect CU's exposure to a weak London market to result in disappointing figures. Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson fell 16 to 176p after the group announced that its main subsidiary has been named as a defendant in legal proceedings. Continued speculation that Unigate was about to sell its 34 per cent holding in Nutricia, the Dutch food company, boosted the shares 7 to 358p. Associated British Foods succumbed to switching into conglomerate Tomkins. The former closed 10 down at 547p, while the latter gained 4 at 215p in busy trade of 6.9m. Bumper second-quarter profits put some thrust behind British Airways, sending full-year profit estimates racing upwards and lifting the shares 8 to 365p in 7.9m turnover. The statement made gloomy allusions to USAir, but it was the rapid progress within the underlying business that captured analysts' imaginations. UBS upgraded their 1994-95 forecast by Pounds 29m to Pounds 439m and are confident that the airline - following the 10 per cent interim payout increase - will pass some of the goodwill on to shareholders via a chunky final dividend. Anglian Water helped stir up the water sector, jumping to 541p on news of robust interim results and dividend before lapsing back to 534p, down 4 on the day. Hoare Govett is looking for Pounds 225m this year, up from an earlier Pounds 213m estimate. Hoare Govett also expects strong interims from Northumbrian Water tomorrow. But given its solid earnings cover, the main focus is likely to be on Northumbrian's dividend. The company has French-owned North East Water as a neighbour and some brokers see takeover fears putting some real zing into Northumbrian's dividend this year. The shares lost 4 at 705p. News that British Aerospace and GEC had negotiated an agreement not to bid for each other until July 1995 added fresh impetus to the VSEL takeover saga. BAe slipped 2 to 452p, shading the value of its all-share offer for VSEL to 1243p a share. GEC has a cash bid on the table worth 1400p. VSEL closed 12 lower at 1358p, which suggests that the balance of probabilities - at this stage - lies with the GEC deal not facing a monopolies reference. Equally, the betting among analysts yesterday was that BAe will come up with an increased offer later this month. Several stocks in the property sector were hurt by a property bulletin from James Capel entitled 'mid-term blues'. MEPC lost 5 at 415p and British Land relinquished 6 to 382p, after the broker said: 'The rating of MEPC ahead of its finals allows for no disappointment. In spite of its dividend support we would be sellers and would sell the stock to below 400p. Equally, the rating of British Land is very forward looking, with little yield support.' Oil recovery group Greenway rose 5 to 98p as it was appreciated that interim profits were substantially higher once the boost from a one-off disposal had been discounted.

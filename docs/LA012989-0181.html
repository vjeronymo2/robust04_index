			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ANTLEY COMING BACK FROM DRUG PROBLEM  </P> <P> During 1988, 22-year-old jockey Chris Antley rode Private Terms to victory in  the Wood Memorial, rode in his first Kentucky Derby, suffered a severe  concussion in an accident at Belmont Park, lost a one-punch decision to William  Fox Jr. in a fight at Aqueduct, rode in the Japan Cup in Tokyo and, on the last  day of November, was suspended by the New York State Racing and Wagering Board  for cocaine use.  </P> <P> The highest and lowest points of Antley's boundlessly promising career, a  career that seemed during most of 1988 to be tethered to a rollercoaster gone  haywire, were separated only by months.  </P> <P> His mounts won more than $7 million and his career total surpassed $30 million  by the time Antley was suspended after his second positive test for cocaine.  "We don't view this as punishment," his agent, Drew Mollica, had said while  making arrangements for Antley to enter the Smithers Alchoholism and Treatment  Center here. "This is a blessing."  </P> <P> Having completed the in-patient phase of his treatment to the satisfaction of  racing board officials, Antley has undertaken a heavy schedule. He rode six  horses Wednesday at Aqueduct in New York. Mollica had him on nine Thursday, and  Antley finally broke the ice aboard Slick Jack in the sixth race -- his first  victory of 1989. He also won the ninth on True Royalty and is named on six  Friday.  </P> <P> Antley would not discuss his drug problem Thursday while rushing breathlessly  from one race to prepare for the next. But his return has gone smoothly. The  public, which tends to be harsh toward riders at New York tracks, has greeted  him warmly. His riding services are in demand among trainers. "I'm riding every  race. It just feels good to be back out there," he said.  </P> <P> Staying out there is now his primary objective. To that end, Antley's recovery  continues in an aftercare program. He will be subject to frequent testing and  has no margin for error. Another positive test will result in revocation of his  license.  </P> <P> "From what I've seen," said Dominick Bologna, who heads the racing board's drug  abuse and testing programs, "Chris Antley will be in aftercare for a long, long  time."  </P> <P> Bologna is optimistic that Antley will conquer his drug problem now that he  realizes he has one. "When they say 'cocaine lies,' what they mean is that  cocaine lies to the user," Bologna said. "And it lies to the user more  dangerously when he says, 'I don't have a problem. I can handle it myself.'  That's the most dangerous lie. And the biggest lie of all prevents these  individuals from seeking help. That's the power of the drug. Chris Antley  suffered from that lie. He didn't think he had a problem. He thought he could  handle it. Hopefully, now he realizes otherwise.  </P></p>

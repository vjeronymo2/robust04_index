			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Working Meeting Between Foreign Affairs </F> Department and Heads of Foreign Missions"]    [Text] President Suharto opened a working meeting attended  by senior officials of the Foreign Affairs Department and 103  heads of Indonesian missions abroad on Monday 21 March. The  meeting, which was also attended by Consul Generals and Consuls  designate, ended on 26 March. We feel that the working meeting  is an important event because it was held at the time when the  Indonesian people and nation are about to enter into the Sixth  Five-Year Development Plan, which marks the beginning of the  Second 25-Year Long Term Development Master Plan (PJP II)  effective 1 April 1994. The event is also relevant to our  national development and the fast-changing global political map  now or in the future.    Over the past several weeks, Indonesia's political policy  had  been viewed and criticized by several local observers of  international politics. They consider Indonesia's international  relations to be rather passive in determining an approriate  course of action to keep pace with the fast-changing global  political climate, which is becoming more complex.    The current trend of international relations has expanded to  include various concerns and activities that cover all divisions  in the Foreign Department and which can transform it into an  executive branch. The time has come for the Indonesia's Foreign  Department and its diplomatic representatives abroad to change  their image to suit new global needs and changes that give  priority to economic interests [preceding two words in English]  and all issues related to it.    As a consequence of this meeting, our diplomats abroad will  now realize that they have to be knowledgeable in national  politics and be a "spokesmen" on issues relating to the economy,  development, trade, privatization, capital investment, and other  matters to tactfully "sell" Indonesia to countries they are  accredited to.    Indonesian diplomats should be able to act as traders who  can  "sell" Indonesian products abroad and act as guides who can show  their way around Indonesia to boost tourism and promote  investment, or they can act as "shields" to smash negative  reports on Indonesia.    In line with the current level of national development, the  government's effort to eradicate poverty, and improvement to the  people's welfare, our diplomats abroad are no longer required to  merely attend formal functions and receptions for diplomats.    It has been mandated in the 1993 Broad Outline of State  Policies that the ability to anticipate and comply with the  unpredictable changes of a new world order should be stepped up  through an appropriate diplomatic approach for the sake of  national interest.    We hope that the meeting between senior officials of the  Foreign Department and the heads of Indonesian missions abroad  will not be a routine session or just an activity held once  every five years. It should be a meeting that will really bring  about plans in anticipation of current and future global  changes. We also hope that the meeting would adopt relevant and  practical decisions to cater to national development in the wake  of the take-off period for the implementation of the PJP II.    In his keynote address at a similar meeting several years  ago, President Suharto called on all Indonesian envoys to carry  out the nation's "diplomatic struggle" when executing their  duties abroad. In this context, the term " diplomatic struggle"  has a wide-ranging interpretation. It is aimed at protecting  national interest, as well finding ways to create a new world  order based on sovereignty, peace, and justice.    In view of this, Indonesia's efforts to achieve the goal  would make its position as the current chairman of the  Nonaligned Movement, NAM, more significant. The NAM  chairmanship is not merely an honorary post or a symbol of  confidence given to Indonesia. It is more a challenge that  requires strong backing, especially from the NAM-member  countries.    Thus, the Republic of Indonesia is not isolated. It is  supported by hundreds of countries that need to benefit from the  "diplomatic struggle" carried out by its diplomats wherever they  are accredited to.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRODUCERS SUE TO BLOCK SAG TAKEOVER OF L.A. EXTRAS' GUILD  </P> <P> The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers has asked a federal  court to bar the Screen Actors Guild from taking over representation of  Hollywood extras, court papers revealed today.  </P> <P> A suit filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday claims that SAG's proposed takeover of  the Screen Extras Guild's union jurisdiction violates SAG's agreement with the  producers' association.  </P> <P> SAG agreed in its 1989 contract with the producers "that it no longer has  jurisdiction over extra work" performed in and around Los Angeles County,  according to the suit.  </P> <P> The takeover would cause "substantial and irreparable injury" to the producers'  association, and the court should issue an injunction barring it from taking  place, the suit said.  </P> <P> SAG spokesman Mark Locher said SAG officials had not seen the producers' suit  and could not respond to its charges.  </P> <P> Although SAG represents both actors and extras nationwide, extras in the Los  Angeles area have been represented by the Screen Extras Guild since 1945,  Locher said.  </P> <P> But that guild has fallen on hard times, Locher said. He said it has been  unable to negotiate and enforce its contracts with producers and has been  unable to pay dues to the Associated Actors and Artists of America, the parent  organization of the two unions.  </P> <P> At a January meeting of the parent organization, officials of the extras' guild  sanctioned the proposed takeover. Since then, SAG members have approved the  takeover overwhelmingly in a mail-in vote.  </P></p>

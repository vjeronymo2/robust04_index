			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: A mind of their own - The Professionals / Credit Suisse / Last in a series by Joanna Slaughter on fund managers Credit Suisse Asset Management is the London-based investment management arm of the mighty Swiss bank. Nicolas Bowater, head of the private client division, says: 'The Swiss parentage brings to us an enormous amount of resources that are not available to others. 'You are talking about an institution with a huge amount of assets under management. It is the second biggest in Europe.' Senior executives draw upon the information and forecasts supplied by 20 UK investment houses and many overseas brokers at CSAM's monthly investment strategy meetings. The global network of 500 Credit Suisse offices also act as intelligence centres on their behalf. 'We believe that asset allocation is a large part of the success in the management of the portfolios of private clients,' says Bowater. 'A private client strategist sits on the asset allocation committee, and the committee's views are disseminated to the portfolio managers very rapidly. Managers will then look at these recommendations and see if they are acceptable from the individual client's viewpoint.' Credit Suisse acquired a controlling interest in stockbroker Buckmaster &amp; Moore in 1986, and the firm was re-born as CSAM five years later. But suspicions that the Swiss influence would result in private client portfolios being weighted heavily towards international bonds proved unfounded. More than half the 16 private client fund managers have been with the firm since Buckmaster days, and Bowater stresses: 'We are not a branch of Credit Suisse and we don't have an investment method imposed on us to which we must work. We are totally autonomous. 'Outside Switzerland and Germany, there is much more of a penchant for equities, and head office appreciates the way clients in different centres want to have their money managed.' The recommended asset allocation for a private client growth equity portfolio is: UK, 58 per cent; Japan, 6 per cent; North America, 7 per cent; Europe, 11 per cent; Asia, 10 per cent; index-linked gilts, 2 per cent; and sterling cash, 6 per cent. Bowater explains: 'Our present macro view is that the world is moving into a period of global growth, and that this is going to be a period that favours an investment in equities. 'We have been running down our bond exposure and increasing our equity exposure, and we have also been moving a little bit into overseas markets.' Indeed, CSAM held a zero position in Japan at the start of the year. Nearly 90 per cent of private clients have their portfolios managed on a discretionary basis, and Bowater places great emphasis on establishing strong personal relationships with them. All the firm's fund managers travel the country in order to service clients. There is no fixed rule about the amount of money a private client needs to secure the firm's services, but Bowater suggests Pounds 100,000 probably is the minimum sum acceptable for a portfolio of equities, on grounds of both risk and cost. 'It depends on a client's risk tolerance,' he says. 'With Pounds 100,000, he could have 15 to 20 stocks and diversify away 90 per cent of the risk.' The fund managers work to a preferred list of stocks but the house approach does not appear to be doctrinaire. Bowater says: 'We seek to be expert in a manageable number of stocks but, clearly, if a client asks us to buy something, we do so. In the main, we stick to the high capitalisation stocks.' Within asset classes, the firm favours active management. 'One would expect to see a portfolio turn over in four to five years,' says Bowater. 'What we try to do is to identify situations that are under-valued and hold them for the long term.' There is considerable expertise within the group in using derivatives. Bowater believes it is logical to use these investment techniques on a private client portfolio for 'insurance' purposes. Clients also can benefit from access to the group's other resources. Bowater argues: 'The range of services we can provide through our sister companies is a genuinely full list of private banking services.' Where expertise is not on tap - for instance, managing investments in agricultural land - the firm acts as an homme d'affaires on a client's behalf. Bowater describes the CSAM name as 'marvellous. It tells people who owns us; where they come from; and what we do'. But he concedes that, in Britain at least, it is a name synonymous with big corporate deals rather than private wealth management. 'I think the growth in private clients will come from satisfied clients, the intermediaries and our marketing techniques,' he adds. 'And, as the name becomes better known, I believe we will start to benefit from that pool of non-UK domiciliaries who use London as a centre of excellence.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: factfile 10  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Credit Suisse Asset Management Established: 1895  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: SFA Number of offices in UK: 1 Number of offices worldwide: 500 (17 private banking) Funds under management: Pounds 8bn of which Pounds 1bn private clients (group funds, Pounds 175bn) Number of UK private clients: Nearly 3,000 Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 165 Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 100,000 Current asset allocation for private clients: UK equities, 58%; overseas equities, 34%; bonds and cash, 8% Average annual portfolio turnover: 25% Fees: 1% a year on portfolios up to Pounds 250,000; 0.45% on the next Pounds 750,000; 0.3% on any balance over Pounds 1m.

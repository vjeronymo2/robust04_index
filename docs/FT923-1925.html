			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: Winners and losers in the French campaigns THE biggest gamble of President Francois Mitterrand's career looked set to succeed by a small margin last night, but it has been a costly victory on both the European and domestic scene. As expected, the initial returns indicated the French electorate had approved the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political union by a whisker, with a 51-51.5 per cent majority in favour of the treaty on an unusually high 70 per cent turn-out, according to exit polls. The French electorate flirted with the unthinkable, and it was only after intense campaigning from national political leaders of all parties and several European heads of government that they shrank back from the brink at the last minute and voted for the treaty. Yet the project has already been battered, as has the reputation of many of those who sought to save it. Maastricht had already suffered perhaps irreversible damage from last week's currency crisis. Now it has received only grudging approval from one of Europe's two main pillars. A Yes under these circumstances can hardly be read as a boon to European integration. On the contrary, it confirms that the pace of European construction will now go ahead more slowly and cautiously. Last night's result could also introduce a chill into France's relations with Germany, whose leaders have had to swallow their irritation in recent weeks as both Yes and No campaigners have played on fears of German domination to bolster their cases. The Franco-German alliance is intact, but weakened by the doubts exposed during campaign. The other important lesson driven home by yesterday's referendum is that the French political establishment is out of touch with a large part of the electorate. Sensitive to this, the current Socialist government has already promised that European matters will be debated more thoroughly in the National Assembly. When Mr Mitterrand called a referendum in early June, he knew he would spark off an intense debate. Indeed, he claims to have welcomed the opportunity for the French to have its first in-depth debate on Europe for four decades. Yet the government gave the impression, by starting off its campaign on an easy-going, if not complacent, footing, of having no idea of the sheer strength of the opposition to Maastricht. The other Yes campaigners, the RPR, the centre-right UDF and the Generation Ecologie, also had to work far harder than they imaged to get the Yes vote into the bag. But the strength of opposition to Maastricht was not the only surprise to come from the French campaign. It also unearthed general anxiety about the costs and obligations of European Community members, from agricultural policy reform to industrial competition, plus widespread provincial resentment of the Parisian governing class. So where do the main players stand in the wake of last night's marginal Yes vote? Mr Mitterrand can claim that his authority is just about intact, even if his illness casts uncertainty over how long he will be able to stay. Former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of the UDF, one of the two main opposition rivals to succeed Mr Mitterrand, has emerged strengthened from his part in the Yes campaign. Mr Giscard d'Estaing's main opposition rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, president of the Gaullist RPR, has been weakened by supporting Maastricht when most of his party oppose the treaty. Yet the campaign has also showed that the RPR has no other leader capable of handling - even if not reconciling - its internal splits. The leading anti-Maastricht RPR rebels, Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, both ended their campaigns admitting that Mr Chirac was the RPR's best potential presidential candidate. The outcome of all this is that the two right-wing parties, which have agreed to choose a single presidential candidate, are now very likely to field a pro-Maastricht leader - either Mr Giscard d'Estaing or Mr Chirac - for the next presidential campaign.</p>

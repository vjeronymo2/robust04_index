			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: A Victorian viewer tunes in - Television To return to regular viewing after a break of several weeks spent reading books and listening to music in a house without a television set is to feel a little like a stern Victorian. Why are these television people behaving in such a manic fashion? Whence these false grins? Why the obsession with speed? If the aim is to entertain, why this fixation upon the criminal, the violent, and the distastefully abnormal? Do the people who make these programmes believe their audience consists exclusively of morons? Why don't they calm down, pipe down, give the monotonous disco drumbeat a rest (having ruined so much sport it is now creeping into serious current affairs) and stop the incessant high-pressure trailers? The week began with an edition of Horizon called 'Wot U Lookin At?' which was said to be the most common phrase immediately preceding an outbreak of violence. We were treated once again to the old nature/nurture debate: are people born with criminal tendencies or is their upbringing responsible? Predictably enough the programme itself appeared to side with the politically correct nurture faction and the last line of the script - 'Should we look to the structure of society and not to the structure of our brains for the solution?' - came out sounding more like a statement than a question. When a black man in the US was shown vehemently opposing any statistical analysis of race and crime nobody even went so far as to ask whether it was the facts he feared or their misinterpretation. Criminality is no doubt a subject of concern to many, yet it seems clear that fear of being the victim of violent crime, especially among the elderly, is absurdly disproportionate to the real risk - thanks largely to television. Do broadcasters never look across their own schedules and wonder at their perpetual obsession with the criminal? On the same night as Horizon BBC2 screened a pastiche game show called It's A Stitch-Up, which successfully highlighted some of the iniquities of British justice, and a repeat episode of the prison comedy Porridge. ITV showed the real crime game show Cluedo and an unsuccessful American cop-show pilot, Mr Inside/Mr Outside. Channel 4 repeated the excellent ITV drama Hard Shoulder, about stolen fire extinguishers, blackmail and thuggery. On BBC1, in addition to an episode of the American crime series Cagney And Lacey, there was a Panorama devoted to 'The Beast Of Corleone', Mafia boss Salvatore Riina. Apart from a nastily glamorised reconstruction of a murder, with natty blue back-lighting, this was one of the better Mafia programmes, but even if they were working for an Italian audience British broadcasters would be paying undue attention to this subject. In the hill villages of Umbria they do talk about organised crime, but they talk much more about the weather, the vines, and football. Next night, presumably in case we had missed the previous two dozen, 40 Minutes (BBC2) treated us to yet another prison documentary about the mind of the psychopath. Perhaps I am taking my social obligations too lightly, but this programme told me more about Al's rough, rude, violent proclivities than I wished to know. I am probably lacking in sympathy for transexuals and transvestites, too, because I feel as though I have seen enough programmes about these saddening people to last me a lifetime. In part this is a result of attending international television festivals where such programmes are a great favourite, but even without leaving Britain it is quite easy to have seen more programmes about these people than their tiny numbers and tinier significance in the grand scheme of things can possibly justify. Which is not to say that Under The Sun: Boys From Brazil (BBC2) was a bad programme; on the contrary it was well made and moderately revealing. However, the programme that is still missing is the one that explains why South Americans with silicone breasts and hips, lots of lipstick, stockings, suspenders, and penises have had such remarkable success working as prostitutes in Paris and Rome during the last 10 years. That might tell us more about the generality of men (and as much, or more perhaps, about modern women) but making such a documentary would be much harder work, of course, because there are fewer exhibitionists among punters than among transvestites. At least these programmes were all reasonably long and hefty and assumed a degree of intelligence in the viewer. Elsewhere it is striking to notice, coming back to television after a break, how often we are treated as complete nitwits. It is not simply that broadcasters are busy turning the 'three minute culture' myth into a self-fulfilling prophecy by making shorter and shorter programmes or items, it is also the attitude of the presenters. BBC2's sequence of item-ettes, Nightshift was a prime example, so bad it was hilarious. In the past, live coverage from night-sight cameras designed to show the activities of foxes or badgers has disappointed when the animals failed to co-operate. For Nightshift the BBC tried to avoid that by setting up several cameras in different places, but this proved far from infallible. However, instead of accepting this and admitting it, the presenters, especially the chief female presenter seated at a farmhouse table, attempted to disguise the lack of interest with gushing enthusiasm. The more murky and banal the forthcoming pictures, the more burblingly intense her introductions became. Similarly wrong-headed is so much of ITV's sports coverage. Increasingly this brings to mind supermarket sales of hamburgers where it is not the meat that counts but the packaging. It is bad enough that, having bought the rights to the Lions' tour of New Zealand, ITV should shoe-horn a match as magnificent as that against the Maoris into an 80-minute programme which was also packed with several commercial breaks and another entire match. Far worse was the agonising waste of time as we were subjected to a travelogue about totem poles and antipodean scenery. To find, having got past such packaging, that even then we were not to enjoy the match properly but merely to be given bite-sized rugby 'Mc-nuggets', with every try repeated three times, was appalling. Once again the attitude is that the poor, dim, viewer cannot be expected to survive a whole rugby match: he must be babied along with bite-sized spoonsful of pap. So, was there not a single programme in the week worth watching? Naturally there were several. Channel 4's adult American comedy series Dream On (adult by television's standards, anyway) was as funny as usual. In its repeat run of 10 x 10 BBC2 showed a jewel of a film called 'Beigels Already' about a famous all-night baker in London. This week's episode in Edgar Reitz's account of Germany in the 1960s, Die Zweite Heimat, was less impressive than some, yet still engrossing. On the same night the same channel (BBC2) screened a programme which seriously considered British party politics outside a general election and outside a 'balanced' series: in Fight Again Roy Hattersley discussed Labour's fortunes with other supporters of the party. Above all there was Tom Bower's account of the life of Tiny Rowland in BBC1's Inside Story, a remarkable programme in which Bower managed to persuade a succession of former Lonrho directors and employees to blow the gaff on film. Perhaps the lesson that has to be re-learned is that, unlike print or music, television is a medium that shovels everything into your house, the good and the bad, the condescending and the more demanding. Consequently much more discrimination is needed than with the older communications media.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Weinong (3769 3634 6593), Zhou Haichun </F> (0719 3189 2504), and Wu Xiaohua (0702 2556 5478), affiliated  with the State Planning Commission's Economic Studies Taskforce:  "China's Agricultural Development From 1996 to 2010"]    [Text] At the beginning of the 1990s, China's  industrialization entered an intermediate stage, with our  national economic growth order also experiencing corresponding  changes, and industry becoming our national economic growth  subject. But while this new stage of growth has brought a clear  decline in the share of our agricultural output value and of  agriculture in our national income, this certainly does not  imply a weakening of the position and role of agriculture as the  basis of our economic growth, the guarantee of our social  stability, and the root of our national prosperity and might.  Precisely the opposite, the arrival of China's intermediate  industrialization stage means that agriculture not only  continues to contribute to China's industry, but also will play  an active role in the thorough conversion to marketization of  China's economic reforms. The fundamental standing of  agriculture will grow more important, with agriculture  undergoing this crucial stage and withstanding severe trials in  the midst of these profound changes. During the crucial stage of  the next 15 years (1996-2010), when our national economy is  fully developing and making the transition to a market economy,  our agricultural development state will directly affect our  economic growth and system conversion. So when drawing up  long-range development plans for our future national economy, we  need to give key importance to agriculture.  <H5>  I. The Features, Issues, and Conflicts Involved in Our </H5> Agricultural Development from 1996 to 2010    In order to understand the features of Chinese agriculture  from 1996 to 2010, it will be necessary to grasp the development  phases and trends of our whole national economy, as well as the  relations between industrial and agricultural development, in  this stage. Various studies show that China's national  economic growth has entered this intermediate industrialization  stage, which China's national economy will remain in from 1996  to 2010, and which will pose a series of new demands on our  agricultural development.    Based on our studies of this intermediate industrialization  stage, Chinese agriculture will show the following features in  this stage:    1. Agricultural-product demand will grow faster. While the  cries about the "problems in selling" agricultural products are  now loud, this certainly does not mean that agricultural-product  demand has reached its peak. The most crucial cause of these  "selling difficulties" is that agricultural-product demand is in  a structural-adjustment stage since the resolution of our food  and clothing problem. As to the cities, this is mainly that the  conflict between our farm-product supply and demand structures  has resulted in inadequate direct demand for traditional farm  products; and for rural areas, since the food and clothing  problem was solved, the traditional low-value farm-product  (mainly grain) demand-elasticity has declined quickly, while  high-value farm products are in surplus. But the next 15 years  of population growth, higher incomes, and particularly higher  peasant incomes and changes in our urban-rural population  structure, will bring a sharp growth in farm-product demand,  which growth will be concentrated in animal foods, such as meat,  eggs, milk, poultry, and aquatic products, as well as in areas,  such as fruit, beverages, and processed foods. Our studies show  that average incomes of 1,000-2,500 yuan (at 1990 prices) are  the stage in which food-spending grows quickest, which fast  spending-growth results mainly not from increased consumption,  but rather from consumption of high-value foods. Projections  for the next 15 years are that average Chinese incomes will be  in this stage, meaning that demand in the next 15 years for  high-value foods, such as meat, eggs, milk, and poultry, will be  in a high-growth stage. As consumer demand for high-value  foods higher on the food chain will be much larger for  indirectly-consumed primary farm products than for directly  consumed ones, this means that demand in the next 15 years will  grow faster from primary farm products, such as grain, to  high-value farm products.    2. Agricultural development will be faced with a severe  protracted warfare with market economy. The next 15 years of  this intermediate industrialization stage will bring a clear  pickup in nonfarm-industry technological advance and structural  conversion, sharply raising our resource-return rate and labor  productivity. But on the other hand, as a traditional  industry, agriculture will certainly not see a clear improvement  in its rate of technological advances and higher labor  productivity before its industrialization is completed as  compared to its initial stage. Particularly, China is short    on agricultural resources and has a weak agricultural base,  in addition to our current agricultural-operating form of  sharing cultivated land equally, which further sharpens our  conflict of slow rates of agricultural technical advances and  higher labor productivity. This means that agriculture's  profit-making capability will unavoidably be clearly lower than  that of nonfarm industry so that, under market-economy  conditions, unless the state intervenes, the market-economy  principle of profit maximization will drive a sharp loss of  agricultural factors, on a scale highly likely to be far larger  than at present, thus posing a severe protracted warfare to  agricultural development.    3. Agricultural growth will quickly increase material-input  demand. In Comparative Studies of Industrialization and  Economic Growth, Chenery and others conducted a simulated  analysis of input-output relations for countries in varying  stages of industrialization. This shows that in the initial  stage of industrialization, when per capita GNP is $100-$200 (in  1964 dollars), the ratio of agricultural material consumption to  gross agricultural output is 16.4 percent, which ratio rises to  32.2 percent after per capita GNP reaches $400, and again to  45.8 percent when GNP grows to $1,500 in the latter stages of  industrialization. A regression analysis that we conducted of  GVAO [Growth Value of Agricultural Output] to agricultural  material consumption in China for the 1979-1989 time series and  for a cross-section of 30 provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions in 1991, shows that the elasticity of China's  GVAO to agricultural material input was up from 0.86 for  1979-1989 to 0.91 by 1991. This change was absolutely  predictable. The arrival of the intermediate industrialization  stage meant that our national economic development had reached  such a stage, that our form of relying on simple development and  utilization of natural resources to drive economic growth was  over, and that our economic growth was increasingly dependant on  increased input of reproduceable resources which, reflected in  agriculture, was naturally increased material input. The  appearance of this feature requires industry to provide the  material guarantees for agricultural growth on one hand, while  requiring agricultural fund-input to be raised to a new level on  the other.    4. Agricultural growth will tend to become more difficult.  One of the key features of structural conversion in the  intermediate industrialization stage is that while the  industrial-agricultural structural conversion proceeds, the  structural conversion within industry clearly accelerates. This  results in resources flowing on a larger scale toward nonfarm  industry, making growth harder for agriculture -- as the  traditional industry -- due to the impact of this large-scale  loss of resources. In order to confirm this assessment, we  analyzed agricultural growth in the industrialization process  for the five countries of the United States, Britain, France,  Germany, and Japan, as well as using World Bank data to conduct  a cross-section analysis of industrialization and agricultural  growth in over 60 countries. This showed that both the  experiences of the first countries to industrialize and the  practices of comtemporary countries prove that in the  intermediate industrialization stage, agriculture is  characterized by a strong stagnation trend (See the research  task entrusted by the State Planning Commission's Economic  Studies Center to the State Planning Commission, Economic  Studies Institute, Rural Economic Research Office:  Agricultural Growth Patterns in the Intermediate  Industrialization Stage). Due to the following factors,  Chinese agriculture is highly likely to grow slowly or even  stagnate in the intermediate industrialization stage, just as in  the first countries to industrialize.    A. Once in the intermediate stage, the quantity and quality  of agricultural natural resources will tend to decrease to a  greater extent, sharply exacerbating China's conflict of a  severe shortage of agricultural resources.    B. China launched its industrialization on a quite weak  base.  As China chose the route of very rapid industrialization  slanted toward heavy industry, we have never been able to  rectify the problem of our weak agricultural base. And with  the arrival of our intermediate industrialization stage, our  national economic focus will shift toward nonfarm industry,  making this problem an even more glaring one.    C. Our traditional agricultural-growth pattern of a large  input of live labor to make up our resource-input shortage has  reached the critical point, so that our abundant agricultural  workforce not only is no longer an advantage, but even is  threatening our agricultural growth.    D. Our agricultural S&amp;T and technology-dissemination  system  is also facing a stiff test from the market-economy tide.    The above analyzes China's agricultural-development  possibilities for the next 15 years from a quantitative  perspective. This section will set forth a simple quantitative  description.    Based on China's real agricultural-development achievements  since the founding of the PRC, particularly since 1978, combined  with the model we chose to analyze our agricultural-development  features and the key problems and conflicts we will face in the  next 15 years, we have projected our key agricultural indexes  for 1996-2010.

By the year 2000, China will have a cultivated  land area of 1.368-1.373 billion mu which, at a population of  1.3 billion, will average out to about 1.05 mu per person. As  to grain production, this will reach 495.9 million tons by the  year 2000, for an average increase of 1.34 percent a year,  giving us 381 kg of grain per person, still under the 1984  level; by 2010, gross output will reach 576.33 million tons, for  an average increase of 1.51 percent a year, to give us 412 kg  per person, slightly higher than the minimum of 800 jin  [one-half kg] per person.  <H5>  II. Our Agricultural Development Strategies for 1996-2010 </H5>   It is not hard to see from the above analysis that China's  farm-product supply and demand situation will be quite grim from  1996 to 2010. Unless we resolve this matter appropriately, it  will very likely affect China's industrialization progress, our  realization of a comparatively well-off economy, and our rural  and even overall national stability. So to ensure that our  agriculture in this period is as suited as possible to our  national economic-growth needs, we need to take corresponding  countermeasures starting now. As to the conflicts and problems  that our agriculture will face in this period, we hold that our  basic agricultural-development guiding ideology for this period  should be to adhere to the principle of developing but not  depending wholly on markets and, with state support, to focus on  structural adjustment, by relying on S&amp;T, policy, input, and  service to promote agricultural growth, on which basis to  appropriately regulate and guide farm-product demand.    In the next 15 years, as our farm-product demand will have  been converted from the traditional quantitative demand to  qualitative and variety demand, making our traditional planned  guidance hardly suited to diversified and frequently-changing  market demand, we will have to persistently move ahead with  agricultural market-reform. Meanwhile, we need to soberly  understand that as agriculture is a traditional industry, it  will suffer much more heavily from the adverse impact of a  market economy than other industries. Particularly as Chinese  agriculture is so short on resources and weak in base, so will  be in a very adverse position in market competition, we will  have to accompany our adherence to market reforms with a great  emphasis on state support for agriculture, instead of trying to  push agriculture completely into markets as in the previous  stage.    With state support, structural adjustment will be our key  agricultural-development mission for the next 15 years.  Structural adjustment will enable us to adapt to demand changes  and achieve overall growth. In farming, structural adjustment  will raise our percentage of high-yield, quality crops, giving  us overall farming growth, on which basis we can focus on  developing livestock, aquatic products, and famous, specialty,  and superior farm products.    Based on the above guiding ideology, we are making the  following strategic suggestions:    1. We should continue to move forward resolutely with market  reform.    A. We need to accelerate our development of diversified  circulation subjects. Farm-product circulation is a problem  obstructing our current agricultural development that is in  urgent need of solution. As the key to rationalizing  farm-product circulation is to establish plural circulation  subjects in equal competition, the government needs to avoid  direct participation in circulation, to treat equally all  economic entities taking part in farm-product circulation.  Equal competition among circulation subjects of all components  will promote market development. The government's key future  intervention in farm-product circulation should be: 1) To  establish and perfect market-order and transaction rules, and to  draw up scientific laws and regulations for farm-product trade.  2) To set up a regulatory system for staple farm products,  particularly grain reserves, using this system's volume to  balance farm-product market supply and demand. So we are  suggesting the establishment of a Central Grain Reserves  Regulation Bureau to be directly subordinate to the State  Council, independent of the commercial system, and fully  independent in financing, storage capacity, and operation.    B. We need to establish a diversified rural money market. We  need to separate out the policy-bank functions of the  Agricultural Bank [AB], by upgrading the AB to a genuine  commercial bank, and upgrading credit cooperatives to a  peasant-owned and businesslike cooperative bank, while  supporting rural cooperative foundations and other private  financial organizations in the formation of a diversified rural  money market under Agricultural-Policy-Bank leadership.    C. While developing a diversified agricultural capital-goods  market with equal competition, the state needs to enhance its  management of the agricultural capital-goods market. As to the  production and sale of important agricultural-use manufactured  goods, it must exercise the necessary licensing system, do a  good job of technical oversight, and stop agricultural cheating  and swindling at the production and sale source.    D. We need to establish rational flow mechanisms for our  cultivated-land resources, to encourage the right scale of  operation. We suggest strengthening the authority of collective  economic organizations to allocate cultivated land and, based on  collective economic organizations developing jobs to transfer  surplus agricultural manpower, paving the way for the remaining  agricultural workforce to contract enough cultivated land.  Meanwhile, to keep our cultivated land from being adjusted too  frequently and steadily downsized in operating scale, our future  land-contract terms could be extended to a fixed 30-50 years on  the principle of "adding people but not land, and reducing  people but not land," with contract rights being inheritable and  allowed to be sold at value.    2. The state should support farm-product supply. State  support should be aimed at promoting agrotechnology advances,  raising agricultural productivity, and improving to a certain  extent the adverse position of agriculture in market competition.    A. Revenue investment in agriculture should go mostly to  maintain stable economic growth, with profitmaking investment  reduced as much as possible, and revenues invested mainly in  basic industries that are unprofitable but play a key role in  maintaining stable economic growth, thus preparing the material  foundation for revenue support of basic industries, such as  agriculture.    B. The state needs to include agroscience research and  S&amp;T  dissemination in basic academic disciplines, suitably increasing  its investment and providing priority support, instead of  overemphasizing the marketization route for agricultural S&amp;T  dissemination.    C. We need to establish and perfect state credit-support for  agriculture. Once the State Agriculture Policy Bank is  established, it should apply a preferential interest-rate policy  to agricultural loans.    D. The state should continue to focus some financial  resources on large-scale water-conservancy capital construction  on farmland. We need to upgrade our old irrigated zones, by  giving priority support to the restoration and completion of  irrigation and drainage projects. Future state investment in  farmland capital construction of water conservancy works should  grow faster than or at least as fast as revenue growth.    E. For farm-product purchasing, we should practice a minimum  protective-price system.    F. We need to continue to build commodity bases for farm  products, particularly grain. We could select 500 large  commodity-grain counties throughout China for preferential state  funding and technical support.    3. With state support, we should turn S&amp;T advances into  this  stage's agricultural-growth leader.    A. We need to make breakthrough advances in cultivating  farm-product varieties. The state ought to organize the  agricultural S&amp;T sector to tackle key S&amp;T problems, by  developing a batch of high-yield and quality varieties among  staple farm products, such as rice, wheat, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops, in order to meet the needs of structural  change in farm-product demand during this period.    B. We need to focus on developing resource-conservation,  particularly land-conservation, agroproduction technology, with  our main lines of attack, in addition to breeding, being areas,  such as planting patterns, cultivation (breeding) technology,  fertilizer-application technology, crop protection, and  epidemic-disease prevention and control, to form a  comprehensive, complete, and mature technology model for  dissemination and application.    C. We need to raise our farmers' S&amp;T levels to new  heights.  We should develop agricultural high schools faster, utilizing  all forms to run agrotechnology training classes. Through these  measures, we should strive to raise in this period our ratio of  agricultural growth from S&amp;T applications to all agricultural  growth from its current 30-40 percent to 50-60 percent.    4. We should set up a sound socialized-service system for  agriculture. In the next 15 years, the state should vigorously  support the building of a pre-, mid-, and post-production  agricultural service-organization system. We suggest that the  state select 100 counties a year from now on, with the  Agricultural Policy Bank arranging 10 billion yuan in special  loans, to be specially used to help all rural service  organizations set up a group of service entities that integrate  trade, inndustry, and agriculture, as well as cultivation,  breeding, and manufacturing. This should promote the  development of our whole rural economy.    5. We should open up small- and medium-sized cities faster,  build small cities and towns in a planned way, and speed up the  conversion of our agricultural workforce, to pave the way for an  agricultural economy of scale.    6. We need to guide residents in a planned way to evolve a  food-consumption structure with equal emphasis on plant and  animal foods. Our studies show that as the economy develops,  food-structure changes are roughly from mostly plant foods to  mostly animal foods and then to an equal emphasis on plant and  animal foods. But in order to resolve China's conflict of a  shortage of agricultural resources while taking health into  consideration, we suggest purposely detouring the mostly animal  foods stage to go straight into the one of equal emphasis on  plant and animal foods. So we suggest speeding up reform of  our subsidized supply system for urban life-service facilities,  to lower farm-product demand. This will include matters, such  as thoroughly reforming our low-price consumption system for  farm products, speeding up our housing commercialization, and  raising our consumer prices for items, such as health care,  urban transportation and communications, and nongovernmental  energy use.</p>

He said security in these areas was  good by virtue of SNA supporters discharging their  responsibilities towards the Somali people's unity and love of  peace. He said: It is important to note the existence of  bandit gangs taking advantage of the difficult times in the  country to rob and kill Somalis. He called on the bandits to  stop causing chaos in Mogadishu, the capital, and in the regions  and on the people collectively to counter the bandits.    Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid also said the United States and  other forces were about to leave the country at the end of this  month. It was now time for the Somali people to decide their  destiny. He said: It is our duty to respect the departing  forces, as well as other foreigners and foreign journalists,  while upholding the Somali people's dignity and rights. Somali  people must stop shooting and killing, which is illegal.    He also referred to the formation of SNA district councils  which was at an advanced stage and complete in some regions,  such as Shabeellaha Hoose and Benaadir. He said some had been  illegally formed by UN Operation in Somalia, but most Somalis  realized that was a mistake. By contrast, the other district  councils were formed according to the SNA leader's circular of  28 October 1993.    Referring to the confusion at Mogadishu port over taxes,  Abdi  Qaybdid said: It is illegal and irrelevant in the absence of  [words indistinct] that can guarantee the collection of taxes,  adding that no foreign company had the right to levy taxes at  Mogadishu port.    On the drought in the central regions, he said: Lack of  water and food combined with ill health is killing five to 10  people a day. He appealed to the relief organizations, the  Somali people and the international community to help these  areas by sending food, water and medicine to save the community  which is on the verge of death.    In conclusion, Abdi Hassan Awale Qaybdid, the chairman of  the  higher committee for internal affairs, called on the Somali  people to reconcile and unite to achieve progress and justice.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri has confirmed that the  Italian contingent in Somalia will be withdrawn by the end of  March. Fabbri also said he is worried by the worsening of the  conflict between the Somali factions.    [Begin Fabbri recording] The army and defense chiefs of  staff  have planned our homecoming in agreement with UNOSOM [UN  Operation in Somalia] and have taken the needs of the other  contingents, such as the German one, into consideration, in  order to be able to guarantee an environment of maximum security.    In order to verify from the ground that everything is  proceeding according to plan, today I made arrangements for a  mission [as heard] under the command of Deputy Chief of Staff  General Zoldan. I have confirmed that a naval flotilla will be  sent offshore near Mogadishu, and that aircraft will be  redeployed in Nairobi. We are doing everything we can think of  to guarantee maximum security during the withdrawal phase. The  mission is practically over. There are some technical time  limits which are obligatory in relation to agreements that we  have made with the United Nations. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du  Burkina Radio in French at 1300 GMT on 18 January reports that  financial backers and government officials met in Ouagadougou on  18 January to discuss the country's national environmental  action plan. According to Roch Marc Christian Kabore, minister  of state in charge of finance and planning, the aim of the  meeting was to exchange views with partners on the environmental  action plan as well as to improve consultations and coordination  with cooperation partners for better implementation of the plan.  He said the meeting was also intended to make the international  community aware of government efforts to establish and implement  the national action plan. However, the major objective of the  meeting was to mobilize funds for the plan and to serve as a  reminder that natural resources are exhaustible and therefore  need protection.</p>

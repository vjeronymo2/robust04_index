			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Honda sees further fall after 32% drop in profit HONDA, the Japanese car manufacturer, yesterday announced a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits and warned that results for the current year were also likely to show a significant fall due to the difficult trading environment. The sharp decline in Honda's profits reflects the persistent weakness in the Japanese car market, the slow recovery in the North American market and the impact of a strong rise in the value of the yen which depressed overseas revenues. Honda said that a sharp fall in car sales was largely responsible for a 5.9 per cent drop in consolidated revenues from Y4,391.9bn (Dollars 39.7bn) to Y4,132.4bn in the year to March 1993. Pre-tax profits fell to Y88.6bn from Y130.8bn while net profits declined 41 per cent to Y38.3bn from Y64.9bn. In North America, a market which Honda depends on for over 40 per cent of sales, the company has faced intensified competition from both US and other manufacturers over the year. Last year, Honda faced the disappointment of seeing its Accord model lose its title of best-selling car to Ford's Taurus. Meanwhile, the yen's 6 per cent appreciation over the period had shaved off about Y70bn from revenues, Honda said. In contrast to its car business, where revenues declined 9 per cent to Y3,280bn, Honda's motorcycle sales rose nearly 10 per cent to Y569.5bn. The upturn in the motorcycle business, where operating profit of Y45.3bn almost matched operating income of Y49.2bn from the car business, was supported by strong demand for motorcycles in China and south-east Asia, Honda said. Demand in the Japanese market was still unpredictable with a rise in car sales in March offset by a downturn in April, Honda said. The recovery in the US market, meanwhile, was still very slow, it said. Honda expects the launch of new models later this year to spur demand for its cars. However, the company expects continuing weakness in world markets. It predicts that the impact of the yen's appreciation and other 'unpredictable factors' will result in a further 3 per cent fall in revenues and a 40 per cent decline in net profits for the year to March 1994.</p>

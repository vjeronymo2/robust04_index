			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Canadian government will allow Ben Johnson to return to competition, but  according to the Canadian Olympic Assn., his eligibility to join teams  sanctioned by the COA has not been determined.  </P> <P> The association, which has jurisdiction over Canadian participation in the  Olympic Games and the Pan American Games, said it reserves the right to extend  any suspension imposed by national or international federations.  </P> <P> Federal Sport Minister Marcel Danis announced Thursday that while the  government's lifetime ban on funding to the Toronto sprinter would remain in  effect, any decision on competitive sanctions would rest with the sport's  national governing body, Athletics Canada.  </P> <P> Johnson's two-year suspension from international competition ends Sept. 24, and  Athletics Canada says he will be welcomed back, provided he meets qualifying  standards.  </P></p>

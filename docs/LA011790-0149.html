			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LURIE WANTS TO MOVE GIANTS TO SANTA CLARA  </P> <P> Bob Lurie, owner of the San Francisco Giants, told a packed meeting of the City  Council his team wants to move to Santa Clara.  </P> <P> "I am here to tell you directly, formally and publicly that the Giants would  like to move to Santa Clara," Lurie said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Many in the audience wore Giants colors and displayed placards in favor of  moving the National League champions to Santa Clara, about 30 miles south of  San Francisco.  </P> <P> Lurie cited fan support, good weather, freeway access and plentiful parking as  assets in favor of moving to Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Although Lurie said after the meeting that he plans to continue talks with  cities around the country in case the Santa Clara plan falls through, the City  Council voted unanimously to explore the costs of locating the team here.  </P> <P> San Francisco voters narrowly defeated a ballot measure last November that  would have approved the building of a new downtown ballpark. Lurie had said a  new park is necessary for the Giants to stay in San Francisco. The team now  plays at Candlestick Park.  </P></p>

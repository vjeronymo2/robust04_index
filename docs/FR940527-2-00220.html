If an application is hand-delivered to either the New York or Buffalo Offices, the application must be delivered by 4:00 p.m. on the application deadline date. Applications must be submitted to the appropriate HUD office at the address listed above in Section A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above-stated application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is not received on, or postmarked by July 26, 1994. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

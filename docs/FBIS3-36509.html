He announced that on February 7, the Abkhazian army  continued  to eliminate Georgia's bandit formations. Some of them have  been pressed into the mountains, while others have been  encircled or taken prisoner. Georgia has lost about 60 men near  the village of Okumi.    Mikanba alleged that there had been about 1,500 Georgian  militants in the Gali Region, who had been given the order to  seize the Gali region and the city of Ochamchira.    He also announced that the Georgian formations located on  the  left "Georgian" bank of the Inguri River opened artillery fire  to support their units stationed in Abkhazia. Abkhazian forces  did not open fire at the left bank, he said.    He denied the reports by the Georgian media about the  execution of Georgian civilians in the Gali region's village of  Bagdadi.    According to sources in Sukhumi, since September 30, 1993,  when the Georgian troops had to leave Abkhazia, combat  operations in its territory have not been as fierce as they are  now. Abkhazians are using tanks and artillery.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAR FIRE SCORCHES COSTA MESA HOME;  </P> <P> BLAZE: THE TROUBLE BEGAN WHEN OWNER TURNED IGNITION IN VEHICLE SHE HOPED TO  SELL AND IT BURST INTO FLAMES. DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT $150,000.  </P> <P> A fire that started inside a used car up for sale caused about $150,000 in  damage to a home Saturday morning.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported in the fire, which damaged the garage and  second-story master bedroom as well as three cars inside the garage.  </P> <P> Fire officials said the blaze started about 8 a.m. when Jackie Peters, the  owner of the home, turned on the ignition to her 1979 Mercury Cougar in  anticipation of the arrival of a potential buyer later in the morning.  </P> <P> The car's catalytic converter overheated, sending flames and smoke out of the  car. Peters, 59, and her son Scott Peters, 30, were able to douse the flames  with a garden hose, but the converter continued to overheat, starting a second  fire that quickly began to burn the garage and master bedroom directly above  it, according to Susan Mora Wood, spokeswoman for the Costa Mesa Fire  Department.  </P> <P> Firefighters arrived at the Mandarin Drive home about 8:40 a.m. and had the  fire under control within 40 minutes. Twenty-six crew members fought the blaze.  </P> <P> The Cougar, which had 40,000 miles on it and was being sold for $3,000, as well  as a Volkswagen Bug and a new Honda Accord were damaged in the fire.  </P> <P> Greg Peters, the owner's son, said her mother has both home and auto insurance.  </P> <P> "I had just talked to her 10 minutes before the fire," said Greg Peters, who  had planned to bring his son to stay the day at the home. "When I turned the  corner, it was quite a mess."  </P> <P> The American Red Cross provided clothes, food and prescription glasses to the  victims.  </P></p>

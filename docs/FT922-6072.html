			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Pounds 1m gems in BCCI dispute WHILE depositors with Bank of Credit and Commerce International attempt to increase their compensation from Abu Dhabi, a fresh legal battle has started in London - over the fate of jewels belonging to Mrs Rabia Abedi, wife of the bank's former president. The tug-of-war over the collection of diamonds, emeralds and South Sea Island pearls, valued at almost Pounds 1m, started yesterday at City of London magistrates' court but must now go to the High Court for a resolution. The gems, seized by police last year and displayed in court, include a pair of gold earrings, each inset with 16 Indian rose-cut diamonds, with nine-diamond pendants and three-pearl tassels. The police seized them as part of the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the collapsed bank and were yesterday asking for a court order over who should maintain possession of the collection. They were supported by lawyers for Touche Ross, the official liquidators, who argued that they had a claim on the jewels since Mr Agha Abedi, the former BCCI president, had purchased them with the bank's money. The liquidator's counsel told the court that both the Abedis were now resident in Pakistan. Should the jewels be allowed out of UK jurisdiction, they might never return. Counsel for Mrs Abedi said the police had seized the collection illegally. Mrs Abedi had issued a writ against the SFO for their return and proceedings would start in the High Court, he said, arguing successfully for the magistrates' court proceedings to be adjourned indefinitely. Detective Superintendent Jerry Ohlsen of the City fraud squad said an order was necessary because of the cost to the City police of keeping the jewels in a Barclays Bank vault. The police had decided that, in the circumstances, their own vault was too insecure.</p>

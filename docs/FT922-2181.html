			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Casualties and rewards on eastern tack  -Emerging markets divided along geographical lines last month Casualties among the emerging markets in May were to be found in South and East Asia and in the eastern Mediterranean, while Latin America as a region held steady. The biggest falls came in India and Turkey, two long-term sufferers, although the Philippines produced the biggest gain on the month, reaching record levels following the largely peaceful presidential election. Mr Michael Paterson, a director of Asia Equity, believes that Philippine equities are due for a period of consolidation after the recent rally, but that their long-term prospects are favourable. 'The market is poised to go higher,' he says. There is considerable excitement in the oil sector following the recent discovery by Royal Dutch and Occidental in the Malampaya oilfield. The discovery is expected to make a considerable contribution to the country's energy requirements. First Philippine Holdings is expected to buy into the Royal Dutch/Occidental joint venture. Increased political confidence following the victory of Mr Fidel Ramos in the presidential race, as well as an improving economic performance - merchandise imports, a leading economic indicator, jumped 52 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the year-ago period - should attract foreign investors back to the Philippines. News yesterday that the capital's two stock exchanges had agreed to merge is also seen as a positive move. Political uncertainty, on the other hand, has upset the Athens stock market, which dropped 11 per cent in dollar terms last month. Having reached a 1992 peak of 1,009 in early February, the general index has since fallen to around 800 as individual investors, troubled by Yugoslavia's claim on Macedonia, switched into government bonds, which are tax free. Mr Stuart Harley, part of the Greek team at Schroder Securities, says the ill-health of the president, Mr Constantine Karamanlis, is compounding the country's political unease. The government's narrow majority in parliament, which traditionally elects the country's president, is seen as a potential difficulty and could prompt a general election. As a result, investors are ignoring the improving economic and corporate news, and the arrival of summer is likely to delay any recovery in the stock market until the third or fourth quarter. Good first-quarter results have also gone largely unnoticed in Turkey, which has suffered from a heavy fall in the lira and the dashing of the government's unrealistically high expectations on inflation. The surprisingly good headline figure for April is unlikely to revive the market, since it was kept artificially low by the decision of state enterprises not to raise prices ahead of local elections.</p>

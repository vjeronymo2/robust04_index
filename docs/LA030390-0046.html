			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' DIVISION V BASKETBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN CHANCES BEGIN, END WITH CLARK  </P> <P> Christian High Coach Randy Wright promises no gimmicks on offense against  Calipatria in the San Diego Section Division V boys' championship basketball  game this morning at 11:30 at Golden Hall.  </P> <P> "We're not too complicated," he said.  </P> <P> Christian's offense begins and usually ends with Tony Clark, the state's  leading scorer at more than 44 points a game.  </P> <P> In Christian's three playoff games, Clark has averaged 50 points, including a  section record 64-point performance last week. In Wednesday's 57-50 semifinal  victory over Bishop's, Clark scored 40.  </P> <P> What kind of defense does Wright expect Calipatria to play against Clark?  </P> <P> "We've seen it all this year," he said. "We're ready for anything."  </P> <P> Wright said he has felt a lot better since off guard Brad Fox returned from a  thigh injury that caused him to miss more than half the season.  </P> <P> "He's the glue that holds us together," he said. "He also gives us another  threat on offense."  </P> <P> Since Fox returned to the lineup a month ago, Christian (15-11) has lost only  to St. Augustine and Kearny, both Division III quarterfinalists.  </P> <P> Wright said Christian has also been getting fine play from forward David  Piester, who had nine points against Bishop's.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Calipatria (21-3) advanced to the finals by defeating Marian, 47-39,  in the semifinals. Raul Novarro was the team's leading scorer with a 15-point  average.  </P></p>

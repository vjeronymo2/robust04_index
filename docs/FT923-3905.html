			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / EC to propose common air pacts THE European Commission will next month launch proposals for the European Community to negotiate as a bloc the civil aviation agreements which each of the 12 member states now arranges bilaterally with non-EC countries. The plan has acquired urgency in the light of last week's bilateral 'open skies' agreement between the Netherlands and the US, which senior Commission officials believe could distort the EC's own air transport liberalisation programme and complicate restructuring of the depressed airline industry. The idea of a common aviation policy was mooted over a year ago by Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC transport commissioner, and floated by transport ministers of the 12 in July. The EC finalised most of its own 'open skies' programme in June. As part of the single market that starts next year this will liberalise air fares and open up routes across Europe hitherto dominated by national flag carriers. Mr Van Miert said yesterday he could 'not criticise the Netherlands for getting the maximum advantage out of the existing situation', enabling KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, to obtain virtually unrestricted access into the US market. But he warned that the US was trying to divide and rule EC aviation, and the question was whether this would lead to 'discrimination between ourselves in our own market'. The commissioner also suggested the US was considering whether it would be better to negotiate certain agreements with the EC as a whole, particularly as airlines in Europe will be forced by increased competition to merge and regroup on a European scale. KLM, for example, is still thought likely to seek a European partner, so it could be a much strengthened company to which the US has opened its market. Mr Van Miert added that he did 'not think Community carriers are going to get cabotage rights in the US unless we unite our efforts'. Cabotage is the right to ply another country's internal routes, when the flight does not originate outside that country. He stressed, however, that the Commission would not propose that it negotiate all external aviation accords, much less renegotiate all bilateral agreements between EC member states and third countries, of which there are nearly 800.

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOXER TELLS HER TO STAY AWAY;  </P> <P> SHOE-WIELDING MOM BARRED FROM BOUTS  </P> <P> The shoe-wielding mom of British boxer Tony Wilson has been barred by her son  from throwing any more knockout blows.  </P> <P> Minna Wilson, who burst into the ring last week and whacked her son's opponent  over the head with one of her high-heeled shoes, has been told to keep away  from future fights.  </P> <P> "I've banned her from watching me again," Wilson, a light heavyweight, said  today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investigation Under Way  </P> <P> British boxing officials are investigating how Wilson, 62, managed to clamber  over rows of spectators, squeeze past security officials into the ring and end  her son's bout in round three by clouting Steve McCarthy.  </P> <P> The incident occurred Thursday at the Guildhall in Southampton. Wilson and  McCarthy were fighting for the right to stay in contention for a shot at the  British light- heavyweight title, held by Tom Collins.  </P> <P> McCarthy had knocked down Wilson and had him pinned against the ropes when he  felt the full force of Minna Wilson's shoe. The blow opened a gaping wound that  required hospital treatment.  </P> <P> The referee's decision to award the fight to Wilson after McCarthy refused to  return to the ring sparked an uproar among the crowd of about 1,000.  </P> <P> Wilson said he could not understand why his mother intervened after peacefully  watching him fight numerous times since he was 10 years old.  </P> <P> "I just don't know why it happened," he said.  </P> <P> His mother was unavailable for comment. She was said to be "relaxing at home."  </P> <P> But her actions were defended by Wilson's manager, Jimmy Tibbs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Shouldn't Be Ashamed'  </P> <P> "She's been quoted in the paper as saying she is ashamed, but she shouldn't be  ashamed," Tibbs said. "She's done what any mum would do under the  circumstances. She just blacked out. She didn't know what she was doing."  </P> <P> The British Boxing Board of Control declared the fight a no-contest and ordered  a rematch.  </P> <P> This time, Minna Wilson will not be there, but Tibbs wishes she could trade  punches legally, just like her son.  </P> <P> "I've tried to sign her up, but the (British) Board won't grant me a license,"  Tibbs said with a smile.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Theo Waigel by Christiane </F> Oppermann; place and date not given: "Period of Grace for  Heirs"]    [Text] [Oppermann] Taxes have reached record heights. And  it is continuing: the solidarity surcharge as of 1995, the  petroleum tax as of 1996. Where else do you want to cash in?    [Waigel] It is true that we have reached the climax of the  tax quota, and the overall burden must not rise any further. By  the way: I have never talked about the petroleum tax.    [Oppermann] Thus, there will not be any additional burdens  on car owners?    [Waigel] It was clear from the very start that the railroad  reform would produce deficits that must be covered. The raising  of the petroleum tax in January was a first step toward paying  the debts of the railroads. I do not accept that, despite the  privatization of the railroads, there will still be an  8-billion-mark [DM] deficit each year as of 1996. Here the  transportation politicians must make proposals to cover this  deficit. For instance, one could think of privatizing the  highway net. But this is possible only if fees can be levied  for private road construction. This is the point.    [Oppermann] Fees for using roads instead of higher petroleum  taxes?    [Waigel] I do not commit myself to that. The proposals must  come from the transportation politicians. On the other hand, I  have always taken care that taxes also have a guiding function  in the spirit of environmental protection.    [Oppermann] Thus, the only way that remains is once again  putting your hands into the taxpayers' pockets?    [Waigel] Right after reunification many people who now  criticize me advised me to raise taxes. There would be  readiness to make sacrifices for a national task, they said.  This was one of the biggest lies of life that have been  repeatedly invented in Germany. There has never been any such  solidarity. Man makes sacrifices only if his own existence, his  own job is at stake.    [Oppermann] There are also other tax sources that you could  tap much more strongly than in the past. Inheritances, for  instance.    [Waigel] I warn against tapping inheritance taxes as a  source of income. The people would consider this as cold  expropriation.    [Oppermann] There will be no raising of the inheritance  taxes with you?    [Waigel] I have always said that we need a differentiated,  constitutional adjustment of the basic values, which date back  to 1964....    [Oppermann] ...which automatically means higher inheritance  taxes....    [Waigel] ...not necessarily. This depends on the tax credits  and the rate of taxation that would be valid then. Raising  inheritance taxes would have disastrous effects on medium-sized  companies, in trade, and in agriculture.    [Oppermann] And what have been the results of taxes on  interests? Are you happy with that?    [Waigel] No one asks whether the finance minister is happy.  Here, too -- as I feared -- there was capital flight....    [Oppermann] ...with the help of the bank, which advised you  for the draft.    [Waigel] Everyone tries to make a profit -- also the state  banks, allegedly because otherwise they would suffer  disadvantages in competition. Even though a large amount of the  money is coming back to Germany via investment funds, the topic  of tax flight is so unpleasant that we must find a European  settlement with the inclusion of some OECD states, such as  Switzerland. During the second half of 1994, when we take over  the presidency of the European Union, I will turn this into a  focal issue.    [Oppermann] You want to put an end to Luxembourg as a  paradise for capital flight?    [Waigel] Quite certainly. Luxembourg must come to  understand that, in the end, nobody benefits from that.    [Oppermann] Tax on interests does not yield what you have  hoped. You need money and you must save. The state quota is 50  percent, in 1989 it was only 45 percent. How is it supposed to  go down?    [Waigel] In 2000 we want to be back at the level of 1989,  that is, the year before unification. The state's share in the  people's income has not been raised just out of fun or because  of a policy of excessive expenditures but because an entire  national economy was grafted onto ours. After the  transformation of the eastern state economy into a private  economy and through consolidation and limitation of expenditures  -- the federal budget must not grow more quickly than the GNP,  that is, it may increase by 3 percent at the most -- the state  quota will go down again.    [Oppermann] Why do you not tackle subsidies and abolish, for  instance, half of the subsidies for the coal mines?    [Waigel] I admit that more should have been done regarding  the reduction of subsidies because of economic reasons and that  too much time has been taken and too many social considerations  were made. If North Rhine-Westphalia had had the same amount of  money available for restructuring instead of for coal, everyone  would probably be better off. Coal subsidies remain on the  agenda. Displeasure is growing in the Bundestag. The southern  laender no longer have any understanding for the special role of  North Rhine-Westphalian coal mining and already last year they  wanted to abolish the coal pfennig. The eastern laender do not  understand why their mines are restructured with small financial  subsidies while those in the west get billions.    [Oppermann] And what about the billions in subsidies to  industry?    [Waigel] Just a moment. In the west we have reduced  financial subsidies by one-quarter. The total of subsidies have  increased only because we are spending more in the east to  guarantee economic reconstruction.    [Oppermann] Does Germany not urgently need further  reductions of the interest rates to get out of the economic  crisis?    [Waigel] Reductions of the interest rate must be achieved by  hard work. This is possible only if the public sector does not  use the capital market so much. In 1995 we will have a year of  consolidation, in which the raising of loans on the capital  market will go down by one-third. This is a decisive step to  safeguard the stability and the exchange rate of the German  mark. The course set by financial policy and the moderate wage  agreements give the Bundesbank leeway for lowering the interest  rates.</p>

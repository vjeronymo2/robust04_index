			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  Chongqing City Government recently allocated special funds for  the establishment of a major commodities reserve grain and  nonstaple food risk fund system in a bid to stabilize the market  supply of vegetables, grain, and edible oils, which are closely  related to the livelihood of residents.    It is thought that major commodities to be reserved  throughout the year will include grain, vegetable oil, pork,  sugar, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, coal for civilian use,  clothing material, and cotton. In case fluctuations in market  supply occur in the future, the government will sell reserved  commodities to curb price rises.    The Chongqing City government has put aside 10 million yuan  as a risk fund for grain and 7 million yuan as a risk fund for  nonstaple foods. These funds will be used to make up for price  differences and other costs to curb market prices of grain and  edible oils. During slack seasons, major festivals, and at times  when market prices fluctuate greatly, the funds will also be  used to organize supplies and to make up for price differences  and other costs of curbing market prices.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Visa Linkage With Discover: Credit card processor Visa USA has agreed to an  electronic linkup with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Discover card that could lead  to greater acceptance of Discover by merchants, a Sears spokesman said. The  arrangement will enable merchants to run Discover cards through their Visa  processing machines, sparing them the hassle of installing separate Discover  authorization and computer terminals, a Sears division spokesman said. Sears  said the electronic link will be established later this year.  </P></p>

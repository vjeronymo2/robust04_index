			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mountleigh defers pref dividend MOUNTLEIGH, the property and retail company, yesterday underlined its parlous financial state by deferring the Pounds 4.3m dividend on its Pounds 83m of convertible preference shares. With debts of more than Pounds 500m the company is trying to reach an agreement with its banks and bond holders over a financial restructuring. Matters are likely to come to a head before May 27, when it is due to redeem Pounds 40m of Swiss bonds. A further Pounds 35m of bonds are due to be redeemed in June. Its ability to meet those obligations have been damaged by failure to clinch the sale of its Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands to Hammerson, the UK property company, and the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser. The deal, which would have brought in Pounds 125m, fell through at the end of last month. That failure was partly due to the likelihood that the shopping centre was built on contaminated land. The risks of investing in blighted areas have become more prominent because the government is considering bringing in a register of contaminated land. Mountleigh's negotiations with its creditors are headed by a banker, Mr Steven Gerard, who became chief executive early last month. Mr Gerard, a former senior executive at Citbank, one of Mountleigh's largest lenders, said he aimed to implement a 'strategically focused operating and financial plan which will be satisfactory to all creditors'. The announcement that the preference dividends would be deferred was expected by the City and Mountleigh's shares closed at 6 3/4 p, up 1/2p.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: A cox's lot is not a happy one - Michael Whale on his self-imposed fast for Henley / Rowing I suppose if I were to consult a doctor he would advise that at 5ft 7 1/2 in tall, and weighing a mere 8st 8lb (55 kilos), there was something severely wrong with my metabolism. Not so. I am a coxswain taking part in this week's Henley Royal Regatta, and severe loss of weight is the self-imposed penalty required to cox a crew of super-fit and dedicated Imperial College students in the Thames Cup. We trade under the name of Queen's Tower, a strange architectural quirk at the centre of the college which is behind the Albert Hall in Kensington, London. As the eight-man crew endeavours to increase its weight and strength through daily training, the cox is often the butt of their ire. As you obey the coach's secret pre-race instructions and, in horse-racing terms, apply the whip in the last furlong, there are moments when you can read the hatred in their eyes. One of the ways they get their own back is to judge how much weight you can lose before a big event such as Henley. It was not my coxing prowess but my weight loss that won most praise before this week's competition. Having observed diet books climbing the weekly best-seller lists, I am busy on The Henley Diet by The Coxswain. Unfortunately, its sales appeal would be limited because it is as slim as its author. I can, however, tell you that the main requirement is a three or six-mile run before breakfast, quite often combined with steering my crew for an hour from Putney to Mortlake at 7am. The advantage of this start to the day is that it removes any appetite for breakfast, apart from a cup or two of strong coffee. After a hot bath, with a liberal amount of cooking salt in the water to remove the aches of running, comes the daily visit to the scales. Coxes, rather like inspectors of weights and measures, frequently find fault with the accuracy of scales. Inevitably we feel they put weight on, rather than record the wasting truth. Living, as I do, on a regime of Ogen melon for lunch, and either chicken, fish or hard-boiled egg and salad for dinner, my mood can become fractious if I am not occupied every minute of the day. Thankfully, I have discovered that a cox's diet permits a glass or two of red wine in the evening. So, just as I have developed a craving for reading recipe books, I am becoming an expert on the lower end of the red wine market. This week we are staying in a large house in Henley. At breakfast the crew counts every crumb I eat. To add insult to injury I have been put in charge of organising and must help prepare the massive evening meal for the crew. Near the boat tents, I came across Jurgen Grobler, Great Britain's rowing manager. We had met previously. I reintroduced myself, and said: 'I'm only 55 kilos, you know. How about being picked for England?' I don't think he understood my humour.</p>

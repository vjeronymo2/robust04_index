			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / MI6 praises Iraq exports case defendant MR PAUL HENDERSON, the managing director of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry-based machine-tool makers, passed information about eastern European affairs to MI6 for more than 10 years before he began spying on Iraq, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Henderson was also praised by his MI6 controller for his bravery in gathering intelligence on Saddam Hussein's regime. Mr Henderson is one of three former Matrix Churchill directors who deny breaching export controls by pretending that machine tools exported to Iraq in 1987 and 1988 were for civil, not military, purposes. His MI6 field controller, giving evidence anonymously from behind a screen, confirmed that Mr Henderson had worked for MI6 from the early 1970s until the 1983, giving information on commercial contracts behind the Iron Curtain. He had also been 'reactivated' for such work between 1985 and 1986. The officer also said Mr Henderson had frequently visited Iraq and gathered intelligence, knowing Saddam's reputation for ruthlessness and that foreign agents were particular targets. Mr Henderson had done so when his business was under pressures. 'There are very few people who would take such risks and take them in their stride,' the MI6 officer told Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Henderson. During their meetings, the officer said that Mr Henderson had supplied information concerning a number of long-range missile projects planned by the Iraqis. He gave his MI6 controller blueprints relating to a projectile capable of being fired 1,200 kilometres and said Matrix Churchill had been approached by the Iraqis to make machine tools for the project, known as ABA. A technical report from one of the meetings went to a 'very high' ministerial level, the officer said. Questioned by Mr Allan Moses QC, prosecuting, the officer said Mr Henderson had not told him Matrix Churchill would be carrying out the work on the ABA project, or that it had a contract to supply the Chilean arms dealers Industrias Cardoen with bomb fuses destined for Iraq. In September 1989, Mr Henderson was interviewed by MI6 technical experts at a 'safe house' a short walk away from the Foreign Office in London. Afterwards, he expressed concern that the delay in processing his company's export licences could cost hundreds of jobs at the company. His MI6 contact told him he would be better off complaining to the Foreign Office and introduced him to a suitable contact. The trial continues today.</p>

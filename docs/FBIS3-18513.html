			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mulligan, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister today urged the resumption of  peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians after last week's  massacre of 50 at a mosque in Hebron.    At Commons question time, Mr Major expressed his regrets  about violence in what he called "that powder keg of the Middle  East."    He was responding to Labour's George Galloway, MP for  Glasgow  Hillhead, who said the Palestinian chief negotiator, Nabil  Sha'th, was present in the Commons gallery to hear the exchanges.    Mr Galloway asked the Prime Minister: "Do you have a message  for Nabil Sha'th in the light of the fact that since last  Friday's massacre in Hebron, the Israeli Army have shot down  more people than were shot down by the murderer in the massacre  itself?"    He urged: "Will you suppoort a protection force, made up  either of the United Nations or at least the co-sponsors of the  peace process, to protect the Palestinians under illegal Israeli  occupation?"    Mr Major declared: "Violence from any source in that powder  keg of the Middle East is to be regretted whether it comes from  the dreadful massacre at Hebron or any other source."    He said he believed UN observers in Israel were doing "an  extremely good job," and he had discussed the situation with the  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali a few days ago in the  United States.    The Prime Minister stressed: "What would be most helpful is,  as soon as it seems to be politically practicable, for the sides  to sit down again and continue with the negotiations that have  made more progress in the last 18 months than for many years  past. What everyone wishes to see is a comprehensive peace  settlement there that will enable the people who live there to  live a decent, civilised and safe life."    Mr Galloway, whose visit to Iraq was widely condemned in  January, was strongly rebuked by Foreign Office Minister of  State Douglas Hogg when he raised the issue at Commons question  time yesterday.    Mr Galloway criticised the Israeli armed forces which he  said  had shot down many people since the massacre.    To Tory cheers, Mr Hogg retorted: "In view of your quite  odious support for Saddam Husayn, I would have thought that you  would have thought it wise to abstain from participating in  questions on the Middle East."</p>

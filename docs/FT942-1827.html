			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Reorganising the organiser producer - Caroline Southey looks at the changes that have put Filofax back on its growth path Filofax has enjoyed a remarkable reversal in fortunes from an all-time low in 1990 when it appeared to be a casualty of the decline in brand mania. Yet Mr Robin Field, who has turned the company around since joining it at its nadir, believed all along that the difficulties were with Filofax the company, not with its ring binder personal organisers or the market. From record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.72m for the year to December 1988 on turnover of Pounds 14.7m, Filofax went rapidly downhill as it crumbled under the pressure of extraordinary growth which saw turnover double year on year from 1980. It slumped to pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.55m in 1990 and its share price crashed to 13p. Mr Field, now 42, was brought in as a management consultant, but stayed to become chief executive in 1990. He saw that the company had stagnated. Its products were over-priced and poorly distributed with a limited presence in foreign markets. Among his first steps, he shed jobs, cut prices and reduced the marketing budget. He then changed management and began concentrating on the two planks of his longer-term strategy - expanding sales abroad and reducing reliance on the traditional Filofax product. Both have been achieved through an aggressive acquisition strategy, buying both distributors and makers of new related products. None of the changes he introduced brought instant relief. Profits were depressed in the first two years after his arrival and the credibility problem remained. 'It has taken four years for the stock market to accept that changes have been made and that they will prove effective,' said Mr Field. But he remained confident in his analysis. Worldwide he estimates there is a potential annual market for 10m new organisers. In 1987 Filofax sold 300,000 personal organisers a year. In the year to end-March 1994 it sold 800,000. The acquisition trail was first struck in 1992 when Filofax bought Lefax, a luxury organiser company in the US. This was followed by the acquisition of a French distributor in October 1992. During the past 12 months it has scooped up three companies in continental Europe and one in the UK. Through its British acquisition, Drakes, which controls 90 per cent of the UK market in carbonless duplicate message books, Filofax has added a range of new products to its portfolio. Under Mr Field's leadership the company has worked hard at debunking the myth that the Filofax was the plaything of the rich, upwardly mobile young adults prevalent in the 1980s. Although the Filofax can still cost between 15 and 20 per cent more than unbranded competitors - the most popular model retails for Pounds 34 today, compared with Pounds 60 for an average Filofax in 1988-89. The product has also been modified and improved in the past four years and a cheaper range, starting at Pounds 9.95, has proved popular with students. Acquisitions have generated substantial increases in sales, particularly abroad, and have allowed Filofax to build its own distribution network. In 1987, at the height of its fortunes, foreign sales accounted for 38 per cent of total turnover. In the year to March 1994 they accounted for 65 per cent. Although the company holds between 55 and 60 per cent of the UK market, worldwide it has managed to capture just 15 per cent of the market, leaving plenty of room for growth, it believes. The expansion has also meant that non-organiser products are expected to contribute more than 10 per cent of total sales in the coming financial year. In 1987 their contribution was negligible. Mr Field remains enthusiastic about the appeal of the original organisers. He points out that more than 65 per cent of sales are to women, mostly housewives. Army officers and clergymen are also strong Filofax fans, a pattern established shortly after the first Filofax was sold by mail order in 1921 and when a Church of England store provided the first retail outlet. The common theme among Filofax users is that they organise their lives without secretarial help. Mr Field is sanguine about competition from electronic personal information managers and personal digital assistants. 'We watch their development very closely, but we are not in the same market.' He says those products are business tools, aimed at business people. 'We are aimed at the domestic market.' With a secure order base and new markets to explore, Mr Field believes the company can sustain its profit growth. This week it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.26m on turnover of Pounds 17.1m. Yesterday its share price was trading at 206p, off this year's all time high of 228p but up 10 fold in four years. Filofax, he says, 'remains alert to further acquisitions'. With net cash of Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 3.35m) to the March year-end it is a strategy it can well afford to pursue.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / BR move clears way for leasing market THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to allay fears over the future of British Rail's West Coast main line services after Network SouthEast won a year-long battle for new trains to be financed under an innovative Pounds 150m leasing deal. The deal announced yesterday ends months of speculation over how BR would use a special leasing concession announced in last year's Autumn Statement, and will benefit up to 125,000 London commuters. It opens the way to the creation of a leasing market for rolling stock and also safeguards for a year the jobs of more than 1,000 workers at ABB Transportation's York works, where the new trains will be built. InterCity's West Coast main line had been vying with Network SouthEast for new trains, but BR has decided to use the concession to lease 41 new four-coach Networker Express trains for Great Northern and Kent Coast services. Existing Great Northern trains will be switched to the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line. The announcement was criticised by opposition parties. While welcoming the investment in Network SouthEast, Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said the future of the West Coast main line was now in question. But Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said BR's decision did not reflect any doubts over the importance of the line. He said he was prepared to consider subsidising services on the line - even after it is franchised, in 1995 or 1996, as part of rail privatisation. A 'shadow team' would be running the services in a year's time, which would show how much money they are losing. Mr Freeman also stressed that 'we must have a replacement' for the West Coast line's rolling stock. He said the Department of Transport and the Treasury wanted to discuss with GEC Alsthom, the engineering group, its 'interesting new ideas' on leasing. The Anglo-French group's bid to build 11 InterCity 225 trains was judged too expensive. Yesterday's announcement is an important step in the rail privatisation process because it paves the way towards the much-derided concept of an 'operating lease' market for rolling stock. Under this the private sector - in this case ABB - is responsible for financing, building and maintaining the trains, and also accepts the risks involved in the 'residual value' of the equipment after the lease ends. Mr Freeman said the deal had 'proved the sceptics wrong.' The creation of a fully fledged operating lease market financed by the private sector would allow the government to concentrate scarce public funds on rail infrastructure. Transport is among the areas expected to be discussed at today's meeting of EDX, the cabinet's public expenditure committee, amid reports that the Treasury plans to cut departmental capital spending budgets. Ministers are considering scrapping plans to make contributions to large transport projects such as the Pounds 2bn Crossrail scheme for London in favour of proposals to provide subsidies once such schemes are up and running. The roads budget, which has grown strongly in the past two years, is also under scrutiny.</p>

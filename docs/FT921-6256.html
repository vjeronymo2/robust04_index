			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Brambles Industries tumbles 13% BRAMBLES Industries, the Australian transport group, yesterday blamed lower interest rates and economic uncertainty in Europe for a 13.2 per cent drop in net profits to ADollars 88.7m (USDollars 66.4m) for the six months to December. Sales were up from ADollars 1.189bn to ADollars 1.197bn. Mr Gary Pemberton, chief executive, said the group expected a similar result in the second half, implying full-year earnings of about ADollars 177m, compared with ADollars 192m in the previous year. The board declared a fully-franked dividend of 30 cents, up 5 cents on the previous interim dividend, and announced it would reintroduce a discounted dividend reinvestment plan for shareholders. Despite the move, Brambles shares slipped 40 cents to ADollars 16.80 on the Australian Stock Exchange. Mr Pemberton said the group suffered a fall of ADollars 15m before tax on interest income from its cash holdings of about ADollars 500m. The trend is expected to continue in the second half as a result of lower interest rates. Brambles is also expected to reduce its cash deposits to finance the USDollars 257m acquisition of Environmental Systems (Ensco), a US waste management company. The acquisition is due to be completed in mid-March unless it is halted by a legal challenge from some shareholders. Mr Pemberton said the acquisition of Ensco would complete Brambles' planned expansion of its operations to North America. He said there were 'good grounds for confidence' in the long-term future of Brambles' other US business, a pallet pool being established in a joint venture with GKN of the UK. Mr Pemberton said Brambles had suffered a 'softening' of performance in its European operations. Trading had suffered from uncertainty in France and the UK, but newly-acquired fork lift and heavy lift businesses were contributing to profitability. Results from its Australian businesses were marginally down on the comparable period of the previous year, but were 'pleasing in the face of domestic recession', Mr Pemberton said.</p>

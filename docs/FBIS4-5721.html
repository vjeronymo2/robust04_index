			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Malaysia  have agreed to look into establishing a construction  consultative body for government officials to strengthen  bilateral cooperation in the construction field, officials here  said Tuesday.    South Korean Construction Minister Kim U-sok, who is  visiting  Malaysia, held talks with Malaysian Public Works Minister Leo  Moggi and asked him to take action that would allow South Korean  builders to participate in various development projects.    Malaysia is pushing ahead with its "Vision 2020 Program" to  raise per capita gross national product (GNP) to 10,000 U.S.  dollars by 2020 and has embarked on various development projects.    Minister Kim proposed that Korean and Malaysian construction  firms advance jointly into third countries including China and  Vietnam.    Kim promised the Malaysian minister that South Korea will  draft a plan for its construction businesses to transfer  technology and provide technical education to Malaysian workers.    Meanwhile, South Korean builders have received 4.1 billion  dollars in orders from Malaysia and are carrying out 1.75  billion dollars worth of construction in 23 cases.</p>

While talking with people's deputies from Shaoyang  yesterday,  Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: As a deputy of Shaoyang, I come  here today mainly to listen to your proposals and views on the  government work report. I hope you will speak without any  inhibitions. Chen Qiusheng, provincial people's deputy and  manager of the Qingshao cigarette factory; Liu Zhigang, Wugang  County magistrate; Li Zigang, Xinshao County magistrate; and  others spoke one after another. In his speech, Deputy Liu  Zhigang fully affirmed the work achievements of the provincial  government last year, and favored the arrangements for the work  this year. He also suggested that large projects be provided  for Shaoyang.    Governor Chen Bangzhu stressed: Modern enterprises must take  the road of high technology. They must not always think of  large projects. They must proceed from invigorating themselves.    In the afternoon, Governor Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor  Zhou Shichang led responsible persons of the provincial  planning, economic, and construction commissions to take part in  the discussion of the Hengyang city delegation. (He Xinjun),  people's deputy and acting major of Hengyang, made a special  speech in light of the city's practical reality. He said:  Whether Hunan is attractive is determined by its  macroenvironment [words indistinct]. It is necessary to further  form a rational pattern for opening to the outside world, and  the provincial, city, and county authorities must make concerted  efforts to set their sights on the outside world so as to place  their emphasis on an export- oriented economy. Deputy Zhou  Tongxin talked about the Hengyang railway station reconstruction  project, and the (Meiliang) airport construction project.  Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the provincial departments  concerned to put forward their plans, then and there.    After that, Chen Bangzhu came to the panel discussion of the  Huaihua prefectural delegation. (Hu Zhongyuan), administrative  commissioner of the prefecture; (Xiang Maolin), chairman of the  Xupu County People's Congress Standing Committee; and others  expressed their views on the development of counties and  districts, the migration from reservoir areas, transportation  projects, [words indistinct], the integration of policies, and  so on.

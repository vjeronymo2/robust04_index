			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Prodev: "Two Days After Congress"] </F>   [Text] Rather than three days, the Bulgarian Socialist  Party [BSP] Congress lasted four days and one night. This was  not because so many of the delegates wanted to speak, but  because of purely organizational reasons. It turned out that we  still do not know the real price of time. Time costs money,  which does not grow on trees.    The congress was awaited with interest by our entire public  and was accompanied by many forecasts. Unfortunately, the  forecasts were made by amateurs, and not a single one turned out  to be true. As so many times in the past, it again became clear  that our political prophets are not interested in the truth  about the BSP, but in their own notions about it. This causes  them to deceive themselves, which is not only confusing, but  almost evokes ridicule. If one reads their forecasts one sees  that their preliminary expectations have nothing in common with  the facts. Again most of the journalists, political scientists,  and observers showed that bias and personal feelings are only an  elementary propaganda game with the real situation. None of  them succeeded in forecasting what would happen at the congress,  and thus distinguish himself.    The 41st BSP Congress provided a number of "surprises,"  which  if sensed before the congress, could have been a case of serious  political intelligence. I will not dwell on all the surprises,  but will point out only two that deserve special attention.    The first was the fact that the expected personal and  ideological duels did not take place, although they were implied  in some of the statements. In this context the expected split  or great differences in assessments proved to be a bluff. The  congress' energy was not wasted on imposing someone's will or  settling accounts. The delegates not only showed prudence, but  they also did not allow anyone to impose his will for his own  ends. This was not the result of weariness, feebleness, or  fear, but of a most serious attitude toward the problems. It  became quite clear that the factors that divide the party are  much weaker at present than the factors that unite it. Even the  strongest words from the rostrum and the most nervous scuffle  near the microphones did not confuse the congress' general  atmosphere. On the contrary, the atmosphere was businesslike and  influenced by the results, not by selfish and vain struggles.  Even those persons from whom great thunder was expected did not  violate the rules of good taste. This is more than indicative  for a political congress taking place in the present social  situation, torn apart by explosions. It became more than  obvious that the Socialists can think bitter thoughts, but do  not seek success through scandals. There were indeed attempts  to create scandals, but the initiators did not find any support.  The congress quickly quashed such attempts, sometimes with  derision, and showed that it thinks on a grand scale and rejects  petty ambitions. This is what the political prophets were not  able to forecast. They expected a storm perhaps even  catastrophic clashes, but instead of this they saw a complex but  fruitful dialogue. The BSP again proved that unlike its  political opponents, it is a party with sound nerves and a clear  voice.    The second serious surprise of the 41st BSP Congress  involved  the election of its top leadership. For a long time the press  and the radio toyed with various names, pointed out ideological  currents, sought heroes and victims, and tried to forecast a  conflict of personal and group interests. Today the election is  already a fact and all this does not sound serious. Almost all  the great figures in the BSP, with a few exceptions, found their  place on the BSP Supreme Council. Only a few of them, who  either evoke concern with their behavior, or express radical and  unacceptable positions, were not elected. I personally regret  the fact that some of them were not elected, but this does not  change anything. The election sense of the delegates proved to  be quite precise. The delegates refused to give their  confidence mostly to people who did not convince the congress  that they were selfless in their ambitions, and that they  profess sober views.    Of course, this does not mean that controversial persons,  people associated with the old notions of party behavior, and  people who still have a leadership mania did not enter the BSP  Supreme Council. Despite this, however, the result is positive.  The delegates voted according to their conscience and generally  elected a leadership that corresponds to the current BSP  interests. It is a leadership of balance, professional thought,  and a useful combination of the center and the ideological  currents. This is a hope that could produce positive results.  Those who were not elected are certainly disappointed, but if  they are politicians, they must draw the necessary conclusions.  At the present political moment the party does not want and  cannot be subjected to a test by controversial persons and  extremist views. It faces serious social battles and needs a  prudently composed leadership that will guarantee a complete  balance. I would like to believe that, despite the forecasts,  precisely this is what the new Supreme Council will do.    As usual, various gossip accompanied the congress, or was  spread afterward. Now that the forecasts have been proved wrong  it is the time of the lies. One of them is more than bankrupt.  I mean the BTA report, quoted by certain media, according to  which I was jeered by the delegates because of a report in DUMA  that ostensibly attempted to suggest Zhan Videnov's election  prior to the actual vote. This is a pitiful forgery. The truth  is that the congress jeered not DUMA's chief editor, but a small  group of delegates from Sofia who made use of the report in  order to compromise the newspaper and the party leader before  the election. By the way, this unworthy act had a decisive role  in the fact that Aleksandur Marinov was not elected a member of  the Supreme Council. There were other similar lies, but let us  not pay any attention to them. Whoever wants to know about them  should read DEMOKRATSIYA. This newspaper presented what  happened at the congress in such a twisted manner that one can  only laugh.    The 41st BSP Congress will go down in party history as a  useful congress. It adopted a new charter and election  platform, and cleared the way for for the new party program  finally to be adopted. What was very important -- the congress  confirmed the decision to hold early parliamentary elections.  Now life should prove the correctness of the party's collective  mind. This can happen only if the congress' ideas successful  merge with the requirements of our time, and if each of us,  Socialists and supporters alike, accept them as our own ideas.  Let no one become the victim of excessive suspicion or  inappropriate confidence. Both suspicion and confidence are  more than harmful, especially at a time such as the present,  when the BSP's opponents are becoming ever more confused and  malicious. We are yet to face the struggle for the new  parliament, which means a struggle for power that will require  all our strength. In this sphere things are extremely clear and  cannot be subjected to any games. It depends on us, rather than  anyone else, whether the people will believe us and will give us  their confidence. Therefore, the congress' decisions must  become the destiny of all those who want to help Bulgaria. It  was no accident that most the statement read at the congress  referred to the future. The real chance of our nation lies  somewhere in the future. Let us devote everything we have as  Socialists and patriots to this chance. Only thus will we be  able to prove that we are ready for the great public role that  awaits us.</p>

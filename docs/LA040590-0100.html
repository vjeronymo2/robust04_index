			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE PLAYER'S 4 HOME RUNS TIE SOUTHERN SECTION RECORD  </P> <P> Mike Lieberthal of Westlake High tied a Southern Section record by hitting four  home runs in a 15-5 victory over Simi Valley in Marmonte League game at  Westlake on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lieberthal's school-record 10 RBIs matched the third highest output in the  Southern Section.  </P> <P> He is also the third Southern Section player to hit four home runs in a game  but the second to do it this season. The other is Troy Dunlap of Culver City.  </P> <P> In the first inning, Lieberthal put Kenny Hood's fastball over the left-field  fence, more than 330 feet way, for a three-run home run that gave Westlake  (13-0, 6-0 in league play) a 3-1 lead. Hood (4-1), a senior left-hander who  went into the game with a 1.55 earned-run average, threw just four pitches and  failed to retire a batter.  </P> <P> In the second, Lieberthal hit a solo shot. Then, he singled in the fourth  inning before hitting a grand slam in the fifth. He finished with a two-run  home run in the sixth inning.  </P> <P> "The ball looked like a melon," said Lieberthal, who raised his batting average  to .556. "I wanted to hit it even if it was out of the strike zone." JEFF RILEY  </P></p>

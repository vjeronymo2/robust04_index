			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> FIRE PREVENTION DAY RECALLS CHICAGO FIRE  </P> <P> The Ventura City Fire Department will hold its annual fire prevention day, in  remembrance of the disastrous 1871 Chicago fire, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today  at the Buenaventura Mall parking lot.  </P> <P> While the public will have the opportunity to see various pieces of fire  equipment, a more important element is the development of familiarity with the  Fire Department.  </P> <P> "One thing we always hear is how afraid people are to call 911," said Barry  Simmons, the department's public education officer.  </P> <P> "Fire prevention day helps to shorten the distance between the Fire Department  and the public. It makes people feel free to call us up and say, 'I need help.  My kids are playing with fire.' "  </P> <P> In addition to the equipment display, Simmons will instruct youngsters on how  to "stop, drop and roll" if their clothing catches on fire. They will also be  taught to crawl toward an exit in a smoke-filled room.  </P> <P> Simmons will also give instruction on smoke detectors. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

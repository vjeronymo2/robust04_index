			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco's choice cuts Given that the market had already discounted Tesco's asset values, the food retailer's move to depreciate its land and buildings comes as a belated recognition of reality. Tesco should have made the changes long ago. Still, choosing the precise depreciation rate to apply to a superstore site is a tricky problem, given that none have been open long enough to judge their useful life. Tesco has been reassuringly conservative in implying that the average price paid for its land is twice the alternative use value. This realism is welcome. But that scarcely makes the shares more attractive, despite the promises of scaled back capital expenditure and higher income growth. Having extracted Pounds 572m from shareholders three years ago, Tesco will now try to slip the cash back through higher dividends. Given the shares have underperformed the market by 38 per cent since the fund-raising, that seems a sensible thing to do. Tesco can afford to lift dividends faster than earnings. But earnings are likely to go nowhere. So unless pressures in the grocery market ease or inflation returns with a vengeance, Tesco's shares will remain becalmed. J. Sainsbury's response will be interesting. It may be tempted to exploit its market leadership and accelerate its store opening programme. Sites will be cheaper and the attrition rate will ease. But Sainsbury faces the same competitive challenges as the rest of the industry. It, too, will come under pressure to modify fair-weather accounting policies, and start to depreciate its land and buildings.</p>

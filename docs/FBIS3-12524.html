			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur has said that  no one in the defense establishment had anticipated that a man  would get up and do what the murderer Goldstein did. We were  taken by surprise, the deputy minister admitted. Our  correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that, speaking before the  Knesset plenum, Deputy Minister Gur said that very harsh steps  will be taken against the supporters of Kakh. At the same time,  however, the administration will attempt to avoid discrediting  all of the Jewish settlers in the territories.    Our correspondent reports that the Knesset debate was very  stormy. Knesset Members [MK's] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and  Rehav'am Ze'evi called each other terrorist and murderer, and  other MK's rushed to separate the two rivals.    Deputy Minister Gur pleaded with the Arab MK's to go back  on,  and refrain from making statements linking the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] with Barukh Goldstein's shooting. Such claims  are blood libel, Gur said.</p>

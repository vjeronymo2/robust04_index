			<p>Activity   <F P=102>   944E0657A Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 1 Apr 94 p 6 </F> <F P=103> 944E0657A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow IZVESTIYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Igorevich Rachuk, president of the </F> Chara-Holding Corporation, conducted by unnamed interviewer;  place and date not given]    [Text] It would seem that there is no longer any  financial niche for the appearance of a new bank. But even so  almost every day we hear of the birth of new financial centers.  But some die almost before their advertisements appear, while  others survive and put pressure on competitors. Chara is  evidence of that. People prefer to endure the wait in order to  put their money in this particular bank. And this is the third  year like that. What is going on? Is it merely high interest  rates on deposits?    The president of the Chara-Holding Corporation,  Vladimir Rachuk, answers these and other questions.    [Interviewer] So are you people here at Chara altruists? You  are not interested in profits, you give depositors more than  other banks. What is your interest in doing that?    [Rachuk] High interest rates on personal deposits is Chara's  fundamental position. Despite the fact that interest payments  eat up a large part of profits. But generally we are against  excessive profits. And not only because they are disadvantageous  because of high taxes. To periphrase Suvorov, let me say: profit  is nothing, but circulation is fine.    From the start the idea of the bank was built on that:  reaching the maximum turnover with minimum profitability, only  that which is vitally necessary to the bank. On the one hand,  this allows us to develop quickly, and on the other, to attract  depositors with truly advantageous conditions for placing their  savings.    But there is really no other way today; what sense is there  in cutting off the branch you are sitting on. Besides, a large  part of the capital used to pay interest is immediately returned  to us in the form of new deposits. So it is simply beneficial  for the bank to pamper the client and allow him to get rich.    However, promising high interest rates by no means solves  everything. Intelligent depositors try to reach the golden  medium, excellent profits and the absolute reliability of  capital placement. Orienting ourselves precisely to this  category, from the very start we took it as our rule to "Do it  well or don't do it at all."    [Interviewer] But in order to create a system which will  work  well from the start, serious preliminary preparations are  needed. Organizational, financial, cadre, and psychological  preparations.    [Rachuk] Yes, although we started later than others, we were  able to rely on the experience of the first wave of banks,  became familiar with practices in organizing banking abroad, and  did serious marketing work.    This allowed us to define our "niche" more precisely.  Inasmuch as there was still a very strong prejudice against  banks created by private persons, the goal was set of creating a  bank which enjoyed special trust, even if at first it was only  among a small group of persons, you know, a "bank for our own  people," in which credit policy could possibly be conducted  without special risk.    Those who knew us were the first to come to us. And since  before then we had already actively and quite successfully done  business in the spheres of hotel services and real estate and a  number of other spheres, many people knew about us. Add personal  acquaintances and the acquaintances of our acquaintances.    We were initially located in a small apartment and the  director's office was in a tiny kitchen. The entire bank, so to  speak, operated as an insurance company before receiving a  license. But that did not frighten people away; on the contrary  it somehow even made us closer to our clients. We dealt with  them not across an official counter, but rather seated at a desk.    Many film and theater figures, journalists, and famous  doctors were the first to come to us. The point is that my  father, the professor of film studies, Igor Rachuk, gave half  his life to cinematography, and I hope that it was precisely the  kind memory of him that brought us hundreds of people whose  names would do honor to any bank where they were customers.    Today the bank has grown and become transformed in many  respects. But we will always be grateful to our "veterans," who  essentially created the bank along with us. And I hope later  clients do not condemn us for showing special attention to the  bank's pioneers.    [Interviewer] You talk as if Chara already had decades of  tranquil activity with no conflict behind it. But you are only 2  years old and most likely everything was not smooth.    [Rachuk] Do you remember the Pavlov banknote exchange? That  was when we first passed the test for our depositors and within  24 hours before the deadline were already beginning to issue  them money in the form of the new notes.    The second test befell us along with the entire country in  the days of the October events. Political instability is deadly  for banking and institutions like it. It creates artificially  excited demands for cash deposits and provokes unreturned  credits. This time everything was moving in exactly that  direction. The simplest and most painless thing would have been  to take advantage of the formal cause and suspend operations,  since as we were located in the very heart of Moscow, on Tver,  we naturally fell under the rules of the state of emergency.    But we did not resort to that. A plan for emergency  conditions conceived in advance was promptly put into effect.  All financial operations were suspended, with the exception of  service to private persons. So that, God forbid, work did not  stop for a minute because of a shortage of cash, which would  have immediately created panic. In advance we had prepared a  reserve of liquid securities to be put into circulation.    The psychological preparation of personnel helped a great  deal. Employees were calm and confident and worked quickly and  carefully, like stewardesses in a plane which has gone into a  tailspin. And this is hard to believe, but the situation changed  diametrically; people who just a few hours earlier were only  thinking of how to pull out their money, instead deposited their  last money, convinced that it would be safer here than at home.    I was especially pleased that this happened in my absence. I  was on vacation and I could influence events only by telephone.    [Interviewer] Let us assume that at that time you managed to  master the situation and get rid of tension by showing a high  class of professionalism. Such banking techniques are familiar  from the well-known novel by Arthur Haley, "The Moneychangers."  But what if your plan had not worked and a large majority of  your depositors had all the same demanded their money? Would  that have been a disaster for you?    [Rachuk] On the day that Roosevelt died, in New York the  huge  simultaneous load on the city's phone system broke it down: too  many people wanted to share the sad news with one another. Don't  believe a banker who maintains that he has never had a nightmare  about this situation. Every person must work and watch for that.  Especially in our time and in our country.    Nonetheless, I do not doubt that any bank which plays an  honest game will fulfill its obligations. It is a different  matter altogether that many, especially beginning bankers, do so  at the price of their own ruin.    Each bank decides how to insure itself against this  occurrence in its own way. We would like to believe we have  insured ourselves with special flexibility. The Chara-Holding  Corporation envisions corporate responsibility for the  promissory notes of each of the companies which are members of  it. First of all this applies to the Chara Bank, which is the  core of the holding company. Our potential allows us to use the  reserve system as a basis for financial resources, in amounts  which more than cover all obligations to depositors.    There are purely tactical techniques. For example, the  problem of a harmonious combination of long-term, medium-term,  and short-term credits must constantly be a focus of attention.  The point is that from the standpoint of elementary logic, in  order to ensure that loan capital is returned, it must always be  "at hand," hence, long-term investments must be avoided. That is  on the one hand. On the other, to tie the bank to short-term  credits means to deliberately renounce the bank's development  and realization of large-scale constructive programs which the  state and society have the right to count on. The art of  banking, it seems to me, certainly consists of the ability to  find and maintain this fragile point of balance.    I assure you with all responsibility that the Chara Bank is  ready at any time to meet all of its responsibilities. Although  it will naturally have to sacrifice something.    [Interviewer] Do you mean to say that you have more tangible  securities than money?    [Rachuk] Exactly. Above all real estate. In the center of  Moscow alone we own five large installations. Selling them in an  emergency means losing a great deal, of course. To be frank, it  would be devilishly painful to realize that what we have begun  will be completed by others. I hope it will not reach that point.    I want to believe that we have earned our depositors' trust.  And if more difficult moments come, they will help us survive  and through ill-considered actions will not begin destroying the  mechanism that works in depositors' own interests.    [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich, all this is remarkable.  But  money must be put to work. Only then can it reproduce itself.  There are legends surrounding Chara. People even say that the  bank subsidizes the narcotics trade. Otherwise, where would such  high interest rates on deposits come from?    [Rachuk] Well, that is of course complete nonsense. We  respect ourselves and our clients too much to get involved in  questionable operations. Our money is put to work in real  estate, since, as I already said, even before the bank's  creation we had accumulated experience in realtor activity. The  quick rate of turnover of capital invested in this business is  attractive. And its efficiency. The growth rate and the money,  and in dollars too, for major real estate are such that our  monthly obligations on loan resources invested in it are covered  with interest.    The second general direction is securities. Everyone who is  close to financial spheres recognizes the need to develop a  secondary securities market. Unfortunately, this is somewhat  blocked by legislation restricting the circulation of securities  made out to the bearer. Despite this, we decided to be actively  involved in this activity. Properly, well-thought-out work with  securities during periods of sudden changes in the exchange rate  of the dollar allows one to obtain profits of up to 1,500-2,000  (!) percent annually. This is no longer the fruit of theoretical  research but practice. The fairly complicated financial  mechanisms which we created and in which the obligations of the  Ministry of Finance, bank stock, promissory notes, "AVVA" stock,  and other securities are linked in a single chain make it  possible to obtain such high profits.    Also helpful is the fact that the Chara-Holding Corporation,  the most important but only 1 of the 10 components of the Chara  Bank, is a multispecialization firm and the primary enterprise  organizes work to distribute financial capital with the greatest  efficiency during any particular period of time. In other words,  this helps us be in constant readiness to enter any civilized  market with adequate financial resources.    [Interviewer] Real estate, that is understandable. But  securities; today they are valuable and tomorrow not. All this  is somehow risky. We are accustomed to expecting stability,  reliability, and permanence from a bank.    [Rachuk] I understand your remark. So recently we have  vigorously "invested" in enterprises such as GAZ [Gas] and the  St. Petersburg optical-mechanical association LOMO. And while we  began with buy-and-sell operations, now we are attempting to get  hold of a sufficient block of stock to raise work efficiency at  these large enterprises of Russia.    I am tired of hearing about the losses produced at  high-tech,  high-precision production facilities. I do not doubt that a boss  who is vitally interested in the result will be able to organize  things. There were and are wonderful specialists and engineers  in Russia. Especially in St. Petersburg with its great  traditions. But people must be paid decently. And to do this a  system of material incentive must be created, a system like  those which operate in developed countries. Like Japan. Yes, as  has been repeated to us before, this is a sweatshop system. But  personally I am confident and ready to state to the entire world  that the greatest human invention is not the wheel, but the idea  of exploitation. A person must exploit himself and make others  work efficiently. That is precisely what moves civilization.  Without exploitation even wheels would not have appeared.    Of course, investment capital will be needed. For example,  70  percent of the machine tools at LOMO must be replaced. Major  customers will help accomplish this. They have already been  found in the United States. I think that people interested in  the large-scale program for night vision devices will also be  found.    [Interviewer] What do you think of the Central Bank's recent  decree on increasing bank charter capital to 2 billion rubles?    [Rachuk] We are already becoming accustomed to surprises  which the state throws at us all of a sudden, in this case the  state represented by the Central Bank. And we are learning to  protect ourselves and our depositors from all types of surprises.    Speaking specifically of this Central Bank decision, it  seems  justified for Moscow. The rank of the capital banks commits them  to a particular status. There is potential for this: According  to certain information, up to 80 percent of the financial  operations are carried out in our city.    As for the periphery and cities which do not lie at the  crossroads of financial arteries, such a requirement is nonsense.    [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich! It seems that you and I  have discussed everything except one problem: Is a depositor  something abstract to you or really a living person?    [Rachuk] To me a depositor is an absolutely real individual:  a person who has entrusted his money to us. Perhaps his last  money, his only hope. I have also learned what drinking tea  without sugar means. For a bank, when the number of depositors  runs into the tens of thousands, unfortunately, more and more  they become "all the same." Barriers of  organizational-structural links have grown up between the  "original clients" and our "ordinary clients." We have become  separated. And it is very difficult to survive such a thing  emotionally. This is by no means nostalgia for the office in the  kitchen where we could talk confidentially with our depositors;  for the bank as we envision it, the feedback mechanism is a  vitally important condition. We and our clients are a single  unit and we have a single breathing rhythm.    But can a banking institution conceived of as a "bank for  its  own people" remain like that at all in the new age and weight  category? It seems it can, if you seek the solution of this  problem on a different plane.    In our opinion, the Board of Trustees which we are creating  under the Board of Directors of the Chara-Holding Corporation  will help the bank keep its finger on the pulse of the entire  mass of depositors. Depositors' interests will be represented  there by people whose competent opinion, I am sure, will help  better organize work with clients and raise the quality of  service by bringing it closer to the requirements of European  standards.    Determining the priority directions of charitable and  sponsorship activity will be an important task of the Board of  Trustees. Our business is to earn money, but how to "put it to  work" for the good of our great but tormented country is a  problem that must be resolved all together with God's help!    [Interviewer] In conclusion, what do you have to say about  the raid by the tax police on the Chara Bank, which was made  public in the mass information media in recent days?    [Rachuk] As for the raid on the bank's premises under the  guise of searching for documents of an altogether different  organization, we will of course take all legal steps to protect  our honor and dignity. Whatever political or economic goals were  being pursued by this raid on precisely the bank, I emphasize,  rather than on the Chara enterprise, which is being formally  audited and is located on the adjacent street, and which we knew  of in advance, incidentally, our depositors will in no way  suffer. I am speaking of this with complete confidence, since  all the Chara Bank's activity is based on precise compliance  with the laws.</p>

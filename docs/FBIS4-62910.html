			<p>BFN     [Text] Premier Valdis Birkavs today returned from a  three-day official visit to Finland. During the visit, Birkavs  met the Finnish premier, president, and parliament speaker. In  their bilateral talks they touched on the questions of Finland's  participation in the fund for Skrunda and the repatriation of  retired Russian military personnel, Latvia's entry into the  European Union, and issues of the two countries' economic  cooperation. Valdis Birkavs also got acquainted with the work of  the Finnish border guards.    [Begin Birkavs recording] We did not sign any agreements.  Our relations have entered a period of active cooperation, and  I would like to emphasize the words said by several Finnish  statesmen: There is satisfaction with the current development of  bilateral relations, with Latvia's progress toward the European  Union, and with Latvia's action in concluding a treaty that has  strengthened Latvia's position as an independent country in  Europe. I think that after this visit, cooperation will be  considerably activated in several directions. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UN troops chief welcomes Clinton pledge GENERAL Jean Cot, commander of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday welcomed a pledge by President Bill Clinton to send an unspecified number of US peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, saying it would be a welcome boost to the peace process. However, Mr Clinton's pledge yesterday threatened to add to tensions in western policy on Bosnia, after he insisted the troops would only operate under Nato, not UN, control, and stressed that any deployment would need full authorisation by Congress. He said: 'It (the deployment) has to be enforced or, if you will, guaranteed, by a peacekeeping force from Nato, not the United Nations, but Nato.' Diplomats yesterday warned that the US insistence on Nato control was likely to be a significant stumbling block, given the insistence of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, that peacekeepers in Bosnia must be under UN control. A UN diplomat yesterday said: 'This is a very fraught issue. Discussions have been continuing for a long time, but it remains a big sticking point.' Mr Boutros Ghali yesterday met Russian, British and French officials, apparently to discuss the issue. British and French diplomats yesterday reiterated that peacekeeping troops would probably need to be under both Nato and UN, in spite of a widespread recognition that Nato is best equipped to run a peacekeeping operation. Mr Clinton's promise of troops for Bosnia came after he met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. In spite of Mr Izetbegovic's demand that the US launch air strikes against the Serb and Croat forces to break the siege of Sarajevo and add weight to his attempt to wrest more territory in the Geneva peace negotiations, Mr Clinton refused to set any deadline for air strikes. Under US pressure, Mr Izetbegovic said Bosnia's Moslem-led government was ready to resume peace talks with Serbs and Croats. But at a news conference he continued to insist that these adversaries must yield more territory for an agreement. Meanwhile Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, has cancelled plans to visit Sarajevo next week because of the delay in the Bosnian peace talks, the Pentagon said yesterday. He will meet US and European defence officials and experts in Brussels on Saturday.</p>

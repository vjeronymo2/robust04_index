			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Airports face capacity crisis Heathrow and Gatwick will have to turn passengers away from the beginning of the next century unless an additional runway is built to serve London's two busiest airports, according to a study commissioned by the British Air Transport Association, the UK airline trade organisation. The report, which has not yet been published, warns that the proposed construction of a new Pounds 900m terminal at Heathrow and expansion at Luton and Stansted will not be sufficient to accommodate passenger demand in the London area after the turn of the century. The debate over the need for additional runway capacity in the south-east is dividing the UK aviation industry. BAA, the airports operator, and British Airways argue that there is no urgent need for a new runway, while other airlines are pressing for additional runway capacity in the Heathrow-Gatwick area. Both BAA and BA are anxious to avoid any controversy over a new runway undermining the proposed development of Terminal Five at Heathrow, which will be at the centre of a long and fiercely contested public inquiry starting in May. BAA has argued that Heathrow requires additional terminal capacity but will not need additional runway capacity until about 2015. A fifth terminal at Heathrow would enable BA to concentrate operations at its main London hub. The report expresses concern that the campaign for the terminal risks delaying any government decision on a new runway. It says arguments that the government need take no decision on a new runway until well into the next century are 'dangerously misconceived'. The government is due to make a statement this year on the findings of a committee it set up to study runway capacity in the south-east. 'Our worst fear is that the government will take no decision and will be persuaded that the system can cope without any change for the time being,' said Mr David Hopkins, the trade organisation's chairman and former head of Britannia Airways. If the government were to sidestep the runway issue, it would delay any expansion programme by up to 20 years, he added. This would give an advantage to rival European airports. The study says Department of Transport figures show that capacity at Heathrow was between 96.8 per cent and 98.5 per cent this summer and Gatwick was between 95.2 per cent and 95.9 per cent. Capacity is available at Stansted and Luton, but the study emphasises that airlines are mainly interested in serving Heathrow and Gatwick.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: STARS HAVE THAT BOXED-IN SENSATION  </P> <P> Better find some space on your record shelves. Lots of space.  </P> <P> Elton John, Barbra Streisand, the Who, Steve Winwood, Jeff Beck and Bob Marley  are among the pop stars whose careers will soon be saluted in multi-disc boxed  sets.  </P> <P> In addition, multi-record career retrospectives are in the works for the Allman  Brothers, the Bee Gees, Van Morrison, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, the Byrds, the  Moody Blues, Rush, Kiss, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Howlin' Wolf.  </P> <P> The boxed-set boom owes a lot to the success in recent years of boxes by Bob  Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Eric Clapton, all of which have gone gold (sales  of more than 250,000).  </P> <P> One of the main reasons for the surge is the arrival of the compact disc. Now  fans with CD players have added incentive to acquire definitive collections by  their favorite artists in the new format.  </P> <P> Gregg Geller, who compiled Elvis Presley's six-record "Elvis -- A Golden  Celebration" set in 1984, pointed to another factor: the maturation of rock 'n'  roll.  </P> <P> "There is sufficient history to our current pop music at this point that there  are a good many artists that lend themselves to this treatment," said Geller,  who is assembling a five-CD/cassette retrospective of CBS Records' greatest  country hits and a box saluting guitarist Jeff Beck.  </P> <P> "Jazz artists have always done it," said Andy McKaie, an MCA Records executive  who compiled widely admired boxes by Chuck Berry and Willie Dixon. "Now that  rock and pop have been entrenched as long as they have been, why shouldn't they  enjoy the same type of respectful overview?"  </P> <P> McKaie, who is planning a seven-record/five-CD Elton John box and a  six-record/three-CD Muddy Waters retrospective, said that boxes have an  inherent fan appeal.  </P> <P> "Many people don't want to buy everything by an artist, but they want more than  a greatest-hits album," he said. "They use the box as the centerpiece of their  collection."  </P> <P> Bill Levenson, PolyGram Records' director of catalogue development, said he  isn't concerned that a glut of boxed sets might exhaust the market.  </P> <P> "I think you can do the giants of the business and it doesn't matter if you  have 10 or 50 of them out," he said. "Each has its own audience. I just hope  that they continue to be done for the right reasons and not just to capitalize  on what seems to be a trend."  </P> <P> Levenson, who won a Grammy for compiling Clapton's "Crossroads" box and has  assembled a similar box for the Allman Brothers, added: "I'm sure boxes are  going to come out that will be shoddily packaged, but they'll all find their  own level. The good ones will surface and the bad ones will just be sold  casually and then go away."  </P> <P> The Allman box, "Dreams," will be issued in June, but most of the others will  be released to coincide with the lucrative Christmas sales season. The Bee  Gees, Marley and Muddy Waters boxes and the CBS country collection are set for  this Christmas, but a final decision hasn't been made on several of the  superstar boxes -- including Streisand and Elton John. Some of those probably  won't come out until Christmas 1990, when compilations by Winwood, Beck and the  Who are also slated.  </P> <P> NEWS NOTES: The Madonna/Pepsi-Cola union isn't pop's only corporate sponsorship  deal to hit the rocks. Belinda Carlisle has filed a cross complaint in Superior  Court against L.A. Gear, a top fashion athletic footware and apparel company,  charging it with -- among other things -- "deceptively altering a photograph of  Carlisle." The filing claims that the Mar Vista-based company airbrushed a  picture of an L.A. Gear watch onto her wrist for a print ad. The complaint asks  for damages of $6.7 million. A spokeswoman for L.A. Gear declined comment,  saying that executives there hadn't seen the complaint. . . . The Grateful Dead  and Tracy Chapman are part of an benefit concert for AIDS research, set for May  27 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. Also on the bill: Robin Williams, Los  Lobos, Huey Lewis &amp; the News and the retooled Jefferson Airplane. . . .  Stevie Nicks' fourth album, "The Other Side of the Mirror," is due May 23.  Nicks duets with Bruce Hornsby on one cut, "Two Kinds of Love." Rupert Hine  (Tina Turner, Howard Jones) produced the album, which also features guest work  by Kenny G, and Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers. Nicks is slated to tour  this summer. . . . Paula Abdul, the second choreographer to land a No. 1 pop  hit (following Toni Basil), is set to choreograph the film version of "Evita,"  which stars Meryl Streep. (Robert Stigwood is producing and Oliver Stone is  directing.). . . . E.U. is contributing music to Spike Lee's next film, "Do the  Right Thing," due this summer. The group was featured in Lee's comedy "School  Daze," singing their Grammy-nominated hit "Da Butt." Lee also directed their  subsequent "Buck Wild" video.  </P> <P> PLAY BALL: Two great American pastimes -- baseball and rock 'n' roll -- will  come together May 20 at the annual T.J. Martell Rock 'n' Charity softball games  at USC's Dedeaux Field. The highlight of the four games will be one that pits  the Rockers (captained by Vince Neil of Motley Crue) against the Rollers  (captained by comedian Sam Kinison). The teams will be drawn from members of  Whitesnake, Van Halen, Dire Straits, REO Speedwagon, Jethro Tull and the L.A.  Kings hockey team. Other games will feature deejays from local radio stations  KLSX, KLOS, KNAC and KEDG and the cast of "Married . . . With Children."  Tickets are $7 for the four games and are available at most outlets. The New  York-based Martell Foundation is a music industry charity that benefits cancer,  leukemia and AIDS research.  </P> <P> AND FINALLY: Many weekly TV series are spicing their sound tracks with pop  hits, but few are as adventurous in their selections as Fox Broadcasting's "21  Jump Street." Tonight's episode of the teen hit -- which airs locally at 7 p.m.  on KTTV -- features three songs by local faves X: "Hungry Wolf," "Blue Spark"  and "Come Back to Me." And it's not a one-shot stunt. The May 14 installment  will feature three songs by rapper Tone Loc. Other episodes this season have  featured songs by the Stones, Concrete Blonde, Robert Cray, R.E.M. and Steve  Winwood. . . . Aretha Franklin and Elton John are slated to film a video this  week for their fast-rising Top 40 duet, "Through the Storm." But the big  question is whether the Queen of Soul and the Godfather of Soul, James Brown,  will be able to film a video of their duet, "Gimme Your Love." Working out the  logistics won't be easy because Brown is still in prison in South Carolina and  the Detroit-based Franklin refuses to fly or take the train. The only solution  may be a weekend pass for Brown. Let's hope Southern wardens have soul.  </P></p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Hungary spices up investor appeal - A look at a mould-breaking government bond FOREIGN investors in the Hungarian stock market, until now limited to slow-performing equities, have won direct access to the far more vibrant market in government bonds. The breakthrough comes with Hungary's invitation to foreigners, along with domestic investors, to subscribe to a mould-breaking five-year state bond. The 'paprika bond,' nicknamed after the peppers which spice Hungarian food, is the first long-term government security in post-communist central and eastern Europe to offer a truly fixed coupon. Kulturvest, a subsidiary of Banque Indosuez Hungary is marketing a Ft7bn (Dollars 84m) issue. The bond, priced at 99.5 per cent, bears a coupon of 16 per cent with both interest and redemption convertible into dollars at the prevailing exchange rate. A separate B tranche is to be marketed internationally. The government claims that the issue yield of 16.2 per cent should compensate outside investors for currency risks, which this year has amounted to little over 5 per cent. The move to widen investor appeal opens up an important new route into Hungarian government paper for foreign investors, who could to date only participate through intermediaries. The paprika bond provides an alternative to the investment funds focusing on government securities set up by CA Securities, the Hungarian investment banking arm of Austria's Creditanstalt, and four other institutions. The funds have limited use since they are permitted to sell up to 20 per cent only to foreigners, although some have effectively worked around the rule. The latest issue is potentially much more attractive to investors than the three-year bond which launched the government bond market last October but was closed to foreign subscribers. However, brokers tend to agree that no rush of money is likely to result from the five-year bond issue, symbolically important as it is. First of all, the Finance Ministry is beginning with a small transaction to 'test the market.' Moreover, Mr Peter Zelnik, manager of Europartners, the Finance Ministry's adviser on the transaction, admits that western interest for the five-year bond is relatively low. 'Investors are simply not aware the opportunities and the risks attached to the Hungarian forint,' he says. Western brokers argue rather that the yield of just over 16 per cent is simply too low for a path-finding issue, some saying that it would need to be closer to 20 per cent to be attractive internationally. The five-year bond's significance is more that it sets a standard for follow-up issues. 'We are speaking about a new market, not just a new issue: now the forint market is opening to foreign investors,' says Mr Zelnik. Treasury bills and the three-year state bond have recently accounted for more than 90 per cent of turnover on the Budapest stock exchange and have dwarfed equities' trading. The government needs to broaden further the debt market to to finance a growing budget deficit. The Finance Ministry calculates on a shortfall in central government finances next year of Ft185bn and a total public-sector deficit equivalent to about 6 per cent of GDP. Reforms of public finances limit the amount that the state can borrow at preferential interest rates from the National Bank of Hungary, the central bank, and pressure is increasing for further securitisation of the existing state debt of Ft1800bn. The government is moreover eager to diversify state borrowing which currently leans dangerously on commercial bank purchases of Treasuries and central bank borrowing on international bond markets. The authorities feel the timing is right for the move because Hungary's economy seems to have stabilised. Inflation, interest and currency depreciation rates have fallen sharply  - and have brought investors' economic expectations closer into line with the government's optimism. However, not everyone is convinced that a wider bond market is an unadulterated benefit for the stock market as a whole. 'It works for the debt market but against the equity market,' says Mr Zsigmond Jarai, the Budapest representative of James Capel, the UK brokerage. 'It depends on what you call a stock market. The real sign of building capitalism is equity rather than debt,' he added. However, other brokers hope that deep markets in government debt will establish a true yield curve and bond benchmarks by which other issues can be priced. 'It is helpful for the stock market as a whole,' says Mr Andras Simor, managing director of CA Securities.</p>

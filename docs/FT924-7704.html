			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: The gilt rubs off Since Black Wednesday the Footsie has risen by just 14 per cent - arguably something of a disappointment given that base rates have more than halved, sterling is 10-15 per cent lower against most European currencies, and Mr Lamont has spelt out the details of his new growth strategy. The reality is, however, that most of the excitement in the London share market may be over. The chancellor's own forecast of a 1 per cent rise in real GDP next year, for example, is not only at the optimistic end of the range. It looks anaemic beside the 1.5-2 per cent which the US will probably achieve in 1992, but which was insufficient to re-elect Mr Bush. Nor should lower short-term interest rates in the UK be exaggerated as a motor for equities. What matters more are gilt yields, which are vulnerable to increased funding pressures next spring and any signs of a resurgence in inflation. On the assumption that overseas investors will be less interested in a UK outside the ERM, that burden will fall on domestic institutions. Pension funds will no doubt extract their price. Judging by yesterday's reaction, the market appears to have more than discounted any boost from the Autumn Statement. The building sector's 20-25 per cent advance over the last month, in particular, may have been overdone. Joint ventures with the public sector may be exciting over time; the proceeds of council house sales may not materialise without any asset price inflation to tempt in buyers.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA gold producer suggests ways to stimulate price A DEMAND-LED solution to the debilitating profit squeeze on South Africa's gold industry was proposed yesterday by the country's main gold producer. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division at Anglo American, said that a doubling of gold consumption for jewellery over the next four years was 'the only way out' of a stagnant gold price. He calculated that if jewellery consumption doubled from current levels of about 1,800 tonnes a year to 3,600 tonnes, with 400 tonnes added for industrial purposes, and assuming world production of about 2,000 tonnes per annum, there was a prospect of demand being double supply. World demand for jewellery grew by about 300 tonnes in both 1988 and 1989. Mr Sunter said the industry was by looking at itself only as a producer. He said it should pay closer attention to the customer. 'We are going to have to promote ourselves out of trouble,' he said. He suggested that the levies gold producers pay to the World Gold Council, the international agency which promotes the consumption of gold, should be increased, perhaps being linked to the gold price. A tightening of the world gold market would encourage central banks to hold on to their gold, said Mr Sunter. Mr Sunter highlighted action on the supply side to improve the industry's outlook: Curbing cost escalation - Anglo American wants to keep its costs per kg of gold produced flat for two years. Better use of technology, such as higher speed transport underground, cutting ore rather than blasting it and improving metallurgical recoveries. Improving remuneration systems with reward more closely based on contribution. Better management systems, with key decisions taken at the mine, not at head office. The trend towards area contribution accounting, treating each shaft as a profit centre.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: The Who's Tommy Broadway careened into the video age last week with the opening of The Who's Tommy, a spectacular new musical theatre version of the classic 1969 rock opera that is as addictively watchable - and as troublingly meaningless - as MTV music television. Former Who member Pete Townshend, who wrote the music and lyrics, and director Des McInuff, have bolstered the narrative for this version which is playing at the St James Theatre, but the story's basic outline remains the same as the original. A young British boy sees his father shoot his mother's lover and turns catatonic when his parents force him to suppress the experience. The 'deaf, dumb and blind kid' is subjected to myriad unsuccessful cures, sexually abused by his uncle and harassed by his streetkid cousin. As a teenager, Tommy becomes a 'pinball wizard' and is declared a genius. He snaps out of his daze when his mother smashes the mirror into which he constantly stares. This miraculous recovery makes him a media superstar, but he eventually rejects the adulation as meaningless. The musical represents Tommy's estrangement from his environment by having Michael Cerveris, the rich-voiced and otherworldly-looking actor who plays the full-grown Tommy, appear on stage to voice the inner experience of himself at ages four and ten, played by two younger actors, before he takes over the action midway through the first act. It is characteristic of McInuff's high octane direction that Tommy can fly. He bounds ten feet in the air to land on top of the mirrored wardrobe in which his younger self stares, and somersaults from the top of the proscenium to the middle of the stage (all supported by discreetly efficient wires). Tommy's excellent staging is at its best in the overture, an expositional masterwork which, through Wayne Cilento's exuberant choreography, state of the art technology and stagecraft, tells a story that it would take pages of dialogue to communicate. It is filled with visual shorthand as when uniformed actors enact an air lift by jumping through an unseen hole in the stage floor as hundreds of tiny paratrooper images appear on a screen covering the front of the stage. John Arnone's spare set consists of a series of girders which frame the proscenium, and a few set pieces representing internal location. Crucial to the production's visual effect is a multi-panelled wall of video screens filling the back wall of the stage. The screens flash images which provide settings and comment on the action, representing Tommy's experience. Diehard Who fans will probably find it jarring to hear the beloved rock'n'roll hymns of their adolescence played by a full orchestra and sung by 27 trained voices, but the score remains as vital as ever. Tommy bombards the audience with so much aural and visual stimulation that there is little time to wonder what it all means. It is a story that probably made much more sense in the marijuana cloud of the late 1960s. Broadly, it is concerned with the difficulty of leading an emotionally complete life in an uncompassionate, abusive society in which reality and relativity are distorted by the media. These are themes that have increased in relevance in the several decades since Tommy was written, but the production seems less interested in investigating these troubling ideas than in glossing over them. Anything menacing about the story is played down; pains are taken in casting and direction to make the characters whose actions might seem reprehensible appear sympathetic. Uncle Ernie (Paul Kandell) is an alcoholic who cannot control his impulses; Tommy's parents (Jonathan Dokuchitz and Marcia Mitzman) are a good-looking middle-class couple; the murder and subsequent denial which set the story in motion are made out to be an understandable crime of passion, soon forgotten. Clearly the forces behind this production were more excited by Tommy's music and its visual possibilities than its message. They chose to dress up the story in the trappings of a Broadway musical - and what trappings they are]  -but, although it feels great at the time, eventually, there is nothing there.</p>

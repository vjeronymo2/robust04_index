			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Belgian recovery offset by dollar and rate rises - Emma Tucker views opposing forces in Brussels The good news for investors in Belgian equities is that recovery of the country's compact but heavily industrialised economy has outstripped virtually all expectations. At the beginning of the year, growth of 1 per cent was the most that many analysts hoped for. Eleven months on, new forecasts are hovering between 1.5 and 2 per cent for 1994. The economy's strength has buoyed the so-called cyclical components of the Belgian stock market, measured by the Bel-20 index of leading shares. These well established Belgian blue-chips - Solvay, Petrofina and UCB, for example  -have had, as one analyst described it, a 'spectacular' recovery in earnings. But two opposing forces have all but neutralised these positive steps: a sustained rise in long-term interest rates since the beginning of the year; and the weak US dollar. 'The big cyclical companies were supposed to be helped by the recovery, but instead they have come down thanks to the dollar and interest rates,' says Mr Pierre Stiennon, Belgian equities analyst at Goldman Sachs in London. As long-term interest rates in Germany have moved upwards, so Belgium's have followed suit, to settle roughly at 8.5 per cent. There are still question marks over the government's ability to reduce the size of the budget deficit; with the market still demanding a risk premium for investing in Belgium, the long-term rate is about 90 basis points higher than in Germany. Short-term rates are also more likely to rise than fall. 'Even if the next step by the Bundesbank is down, I think that by this time next year, short-term rates will be higher,' says Mr Guy Lerminiaux, an analyst at Petercam in Brussels. 'Inflation pressures may not be particularly visible, but they are certainly around.' The weakness of the dollar has affected the competitiveness of companies not just in Belgium but across all of Europe. Furthermore, many of Belgium's biggest companies are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the dollar, with interests in the US and denominating much of their business in the currency. A good example is Union Miniere, the Brussels-based mining and minerals company. It sells a large part of its products to the European car industry but, as a largely dollar denominated company, has suffered from the US currency's decline. The result is that compared with a year ago, the bourse has remained virtually flat, the Bel-20 hovering at around 1,350 points, down just 1.5 per cent. Since the beginning of the year, when optimism about the recovery pushed prices higher, it has sunk by about 10 per cent. It is thus roughly in line with other European bourses. Domestically, economic conditions are stable. In October, inflation dropped to 2.12 per cent on an annualised basis and, as the Belgian daily newspaper Liberacion optimistically described the situation: 'Even if a small lift is expected before the end of the year, the inflationary menace is not particularly present.' Meanwhile, the Belgian savings ratio remains high, at over 20 per cent, with consumers displaying characteristic caution and preferring to wait before parting with savings. This is bad news for the distribution companies, such as Delhaize le Lion, the supermarket group, which have as yet shown few signs of recovery. A more buoyant domestic scene would also help the banks which continue to make most of their profits in Belgium. How, then, are analysts who track Belgian stocks weighing up the future? 'I think the interest rate outlook is more or less neutral,' says Mr Stiennon of Goldman Sachs. 'We believe that long-term interest rates will stay roughly where they are.' A boost may be on hand, however, from the dollar. 'We believe that the dollar has hit bottom,' adds Mr Stennion. 'From now on, the dollar should be helpful for cyclical stocks.' He may be a little optimistic. Although he is not alone, some other analysts believe the US currency still has lower to go. From roughly Y97.30 and DM1.51 this week, pessimists believe the dollar could drop to Y90-Y95 and DM1.45 before beginning its ascent. Mr Lerminiaux believes that the next move for the stock market will be a hesitant step up. 'But I am not sure whether it will be the cyclicals, the interest rate sensitive companies, or the distribution sector. I take the slightly contrary view that some of the banks and retailers will do well,' he says. One positive piece of news is the decision by the authorities, announced earlier this month, to deregulate fees on bourse orders, a move which is widely expected to lead to lower fees for large private client orders. The change was designed to bring the Belgian market into line with other stock exchanges but would have almost no impact for institutional orders where the fees are already freely negotiated in many operations. Banque Bruxelles Lambert was one of the first companies to react. It lowered its fees on all private client orders of more than BFr7m to 0.3 per cent. Under the previous system, investors paid fixed commission fees of between 0.8 per cent and 1 per cent for orders of less than BFr5m as well as a fixed 200 francs per transaction.</p>

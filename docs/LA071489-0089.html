			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-TROJAN PEETE IS 'SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED' IN DETROIT  </P> <P> Rodney Peete, opting for professional football over baseball, signed a  multi-year contract Thursday with the Detroit Lions.  </P> <P> Terms of the agreement with the former USC quarterback, Detroit's sixth-round  draft choice, were not disclosed, but it was reported to be a two-year  contract.  </P> <P> Peete will join the Lions' voluntary passing camp Saturday at Oakland  University in suburban Rochester, Mich. Regular training camp begins July 20.  </P> <P> "I'm signed, sealed and delivered," Peete said during an interview at the  Pontiac Silverdome, where he signed with the Lions Thursday afternoon, shortly  after arriving in Michigan.  </P> <P> "It was a tough decision," he said. "I've loved baseball a long time and played  it a long time. But football is where my heart is."  </P> <P> Peete was runner-up to Oklahoma State running back Barry Sanders, the Lions'  top draft choice and No. 3 overall pick in the NFL draft, in last season's  Heisman Trophy voting. Peete also was an All-American and the Pacific 10  Conference's offensive player of the year in 1988.  </P> <P> Peete was the Oakland Athletics' 13th-round selection in the baseball amateur  draft. He said earlier that he was considering reporting to Oakland's Class A  farm club in Medford, Ore., if he couldn't reach a contract agreement with the  Lions.  </P> <P> Peete set a deadline of Wednesday for deciding between football and baseball.  The Lions waited until Wednesday before offering him the contract he signed the  following day.  </P> <P> "In June, baseball was pursuing me, and football wasn't," Peete said. "As for  right now, I'm a Detroit Lion . . . and I'm not thinking about baseball at  all."  </P> <P> Peete completed 61.5% of his passes in 1988 for 2,654 yards and 18 touchdowns  with the Trojans, who lost to Michigan, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl last Jan. 2.  USC also lost to Michigan State in the Rose Bowl a year earlier.  </P> <P> He finished college with 630 completions in 1,081 attempts for 8,225 yards, all  school records.  </P> <P> Peete said he was looking forward to Detroit's option-laden run-and-shoot  offense, designed in part to add spark to what was the National Football  League's worst offense in 1988. Detroit was 4-12 last season.  </P> <P> "I don't think I'll have any trouble fitting in," Peete said. "I'm very excited  about it. As a quarterback, you love to throw the football and under this  (offense), you obviously do."  </P> <P> Also Thursday, the Lions signed Jerry Woods and Chris Parker, their respective  seventh- and eighth-round draft choices.  </P> <P> Woods, a defensive back and kick-returner from Northern Michigan, was a  two-time Little All-American. Parker, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound defensive lineman  from West Virginia, was a second-team All-American in 1988.  </P> <P> Earlier, the Lions signed their 12th-round pick, James Cribbs, a 6-3, 269-pound  defensive end from Memphis State.  </P></p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Digging for dirt THE HISTORY OF BLACK MINEWORKERS IN SOUTH AFRICA: 1871-1948 by V L Allen The Moor Press, Keighley, W Yorks Pounds 18, 491 pages STUDDED WITH DIAMONDS AND PAVED WITH GOLD by Laurie Flynn Bloomsbury Pounds 20, 358 pages ONE OF the most remarkable and fascinating aspects of the history of Southern Africa is the story of the labour recruitment system which was, and is, fundamental to the development and exploitation of the region's mineral riches. For many years the detail of this system remained - deliberately - obscure. South Africa's black miners, drawn from all over the region, far beyond the frontiers of the Union and then the Republic, were the unacknowledged dynamic of the white economy. Historians have been chipping away at the rockface of mining house secrecy since the pioneering work of Professor Francis Wilson, and here are two new, worthwhile though not unbiased, examples. Professor Allen's first volume on South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers is a perfectly good example of partisan history, not without value at the margin. He is an expert on British mining trade unionism and has in retirement switched his attention - exhaustive, sometimes rambling - to South Africa where this first volume, finishing in 1948 (when things got really interesting), has at its core the history of the development of the WNLA and NRC recruitment networks with which the Chamber of Mines controlled the flow of black labour to the mines on the Reef. It is not exactly light reading, but beneath the old-fashioned Marxist approach there is much to engage the attention of anyone interested in South African affairs. If Professor Allen cannot expect to be an honoured guest at the executive dining rooms in Main Street, Johannesburg, still less can the banned Mr Flynn, whose Studded in Diamonds, Paved with Gold sets out to discuss why 80,000 miners have died in South Africa's mines in the course of this century - 95 per cent of them black. It is an unapologetically partisan indictment of South Africa's mining houses, apparently based on the author's researches as a television reporter. His personal involvement in the topic is not denied. His thesis is that 'since their origins under British colonial power, the mining houses have had scant regard for human rights, and since the arrival in power of the Nationalists in 1948, the companies have collaborated closely with the apartheid State, voluntarily choosing to become entwined in its policies and brutalities and augmenting these with many cruelties of their own . . .' This is a jumbled, confused, badly-written book, but it makes a point. If I were a PR man for Anglo, or JCI, or Gencor, or Rand Mines, or Gold Fields, or Anglovaal, I would like to be able to answer him. I might find it difficult.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK housebuilding lifts Raine 24% to Pounds 3.4m Pre-tax profits of Raine, the housebuilder and contractor, increased by 24 per cent from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 3.44m over the six months to December 31. The company was helped by a strong performance from UK private sector housebuilding, which increased operating profits by 80 per cent. The interest charge was also sharply reduced, from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 891,000. The figures, however, were dented by a Pounds 1.4m turnround in the Californian housing operation, which moved from a Pounds 819,000 profit to a Pounds 605,000 loss. As a result, Raine's operating profits were only marginally higher at Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 4.55m). Earnings per share rose from 0.83p to 1.06p but, as expected, the group halved its interim dividend to 1p. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 207m (Pounds 205.1m). Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the company had lost sales following the Los Angeles earthquake, which had not damaged any of its housing developments, but business was picking up again. Private sector house sales in the UK rose by 23 per cent to 803. The group had increased margins by reducing sales incentives and the cost of part exchange deals had halved. Social housing profits fell in spite of a 21 per cent increase in sales, from 482 to 584 homes. Volumes should increase further in the second half with Raine benefiting from its recent contract with a consortium of Kent housing associations to build more than 1,500 homes over three years. Contracting and commercial property profits, affected by low margins and lower interest on cash payments, dipped at the pre-tax level from Pounds 817,000 to Pounds 715,000. The shares fell 4p to 99p. COMMENT Raine's Californian problems, its exposure to recession-hit UK contracting and uncertainty over the dividend has distracted attention from a creditable performance by the UK housebuilding operations. Currently, operating margins on private house sales are about 12 per cent and still about 6 per cent for social housing. Increased sales should mean that social housing profits for the year will be at least maintained. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m in 1993-94 would put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 20 - falling to 14 times earnings on Pounds 20m in 1994-95. Over the past 12 months the shares have underperformed the sector by 50 per cent. For a pure UK housebuilder Raine might look cheap. The question is how quickly the Californian housebuilding and UK contracting businesses may recover.</p>

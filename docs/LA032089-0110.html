			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ON STRIKE WITH MINIMAL EFFECT;  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL ATTENDANTS STRIKE; EFFECT MINIMAL  </P> <P> Continental Airlines reported no immediate effects on flights today as  attendants began picketing at airports across the country.  </P> <P> As the Continental strike deadline came this morning, some flight attendants  set up picket lines at the carrier's main Houston hub, but flights appeared to  be departing and arriving normally.  </P> <P> There are about 6,800 Continental flight attendants; the company and union give  differing figures on how many are union members in the largely non-union  carrier.  </P> <P> "I can only confirm that the strike has been called," Myra Clayton, spokeswoman  for the Union of Flight Attendants, said today in Houston. She said the  decision was made among union leaders Sunday night, but it is not directly  related to the strike that has all but shut down Eastern Airlines since March  4.  </P> <P> "It's like an annual event," Continental spokesman Dave Messing said. An  Easter, 1988, call for a sickout failed to materialize, and "there's no reason  to believe this attempt will be any more successful," he said.  </P> <P> About 10 members of the Union of Flight Attendants, dressed in maroon uniforms  with Continental emblems, walked a picket line at Houston Intercontinental  Airport, carrying yellow signs proclaiming "On Strike."  </P> <P> "We were prepared to strike in December and we were promised at the time that  if we waited the company would be willing to sit down and negotiate a contract  with us in January, but that still has not happened," Sheila Hammond, one of  the pickets, said.  </P> <P> There were also pickets reported at Los Angeles International Airport, Newark  (N.J.) International Airport and Denver's Stapleton International Airport.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how many flight attendants walked off their jobs  and how many were picketing on their days off.  </P> <P> There were no immediate reports of problems at airports affected by the  picketing, or at other airports.  </P> <P> Continental said in a statement that the flights were running normally, "which  shows that our flight attendants are proud of their service and will continue  to support the company's goal of providing for the customer."  </P></p>

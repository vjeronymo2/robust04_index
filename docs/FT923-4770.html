			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Beneficial Bank to buy Sterling Bank for Pounds 24.6m Beneficial Bank, the retail financial services group, is to buy Sterling Bank for Pounds 24.6m cash from Sterling Trust, the USM-quoted financial services company. The price is equivalent to Sterling Bank's net asset value at the completion date and is subject to the approval of Sterling Trust's shareholders. The deal has already been approved by Robert Fraser Group, the privately-owned merchant bank which owns 51.5 per cent of Sterling Trust. Mr David Hart, chairman of Sterling Trust, said the sale was being undertaken because the company's shares had been trading at about 57p when net asset value per share was above 120p. The shares put on 23p to close at 80p yesterday. Because the sale will leave Sterling Trust with no operating subsidiaries, its shares are to be suspended when the sale is completed and the group's quotation may be cancelled if it does not acquire new businesses within six months. Mr Hart said no acquisitions were being considered but a range of options were being examined, including a repayment of capital or a reverse takeover. Sterling Trust also yesterday reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 1.56m to Pounds 1.22m in the six months to end-June. Turnover fell from Pounds 9.26m to Pounds 8.92m. Earnings came out at 4p (5p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- Regular air service will  open between Seoul and Khabarovsk, Russia, in June and Asiana  Airlines will fly the route once a week, Transportation Ministry  officials said Monday.    In addition, Korean Air [KAL] and Asiana will increase  flights between Seoul and Singapore to 14 times and five times a  week, respectively, from mid-April.    KAL will expand service between Seoul and Manila to four  times a week in mid-April and Asiana will begin flying the route  three times weekly in mid-May.    Korean Air's service on the Seoul-Moscow-Amsterdam route  will  be divided into Seoul-Moscow and Seoul-Amsterdam routes in May.    The Transportation Ministry asked the two national carriers  to cooperate in selling tickets and carrying passengers on the  Seoul-Manila route to avoid excess competition, but the two  airlines refused and will fly the route separately.    Korean Air and Asiana will begin working-level contacts on  allowing passengers to use both airlines' tickets on domestic  routes and cooperating in carrying international travelers.</p>

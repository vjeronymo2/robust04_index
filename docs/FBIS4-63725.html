			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Sergey Karmalito </F> and Lev Ryabchikov]    [Text] Simferopol, 24 May -- It was decided today to set up  a Ukrainian-Crimean parliamentary working party to consider  contentious issues surrounding the restoration of the  Constitution of the Republic of Crimea, as worded on 6 May 1992.  The decision was taken at a meeting in Kiev between delegations  from the two parliaments.    Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme  Council  reported that representatives from the Ukrainian parliament were  expected to arrive in Simferopol on Friday [27 May]. It was  recognized that it would be more sensible to hold the dialogue  in Crimea, since such contradictory information is being  received about the situation here. We think that the mutual  understanding found in Kiev will be strengthened, he said.    According to Mezhak, the Crimean delegation considered it  particularly important to set out its point of view as clearly  and as specifically as possible: There is no question of  redrawing Ukraine's borders. Political integration within the  framework of the CIS sets a good example, the deputy chairman of  the Crimean Supreme Council stressed, Crimea cannot survive  without Ukraine but relations must be built on equal terms.</p>

International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  said at a press conference that his ministry's role is to  prepare the environment for the private auto industry to  cooperate with their U.S. counterparts in expanding exports to  Japan.    "It is not bureaucrats that are impeding the negotiations,"  Kumagai said.    "The government of (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa  intends  to enhance transparency of Japanese markets, while the private  sector is hoping for a balanced expansion," of the auto trade,  he said.    "Understanding on these points has deepened," the minister  said.</p>

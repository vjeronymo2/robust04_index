			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Council workers accept 1.5% rise LEADERS of 900,000 council manual workers last night agreed a 1.5 per cent pay deal in line with the government's ceiling this year on wage rises for the public sector. Union negotiators claimed a breakthrough with an agreement to pay give part-time workers bank holiday pay from next July. Most white-collar town hall workers - who have still to agree this year's claim - are expected not to vote for industrial action against the pay ceiling. The ballot of 500,000 local staff belonging to Unison, the public services union, will close today. The results will be be made public on Monday. Meanwhile Fire Brigade Union leaders will meet local authority employers today in what they describe as a 'last chance' to secure a wage rise in November based on the 15-year-old pay formula. Earnings drift in the public services contributed to a rise of 7.5 per cent in the public-sector pay bill to Pounds 92bn in 1992, according to the Public Finance Foundation.</p>

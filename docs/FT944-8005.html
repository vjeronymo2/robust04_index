			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Share dealing risks in Russia eliminated by new systems Sir, Your article, 'Fears over share security deter investors in Russia' (November 16), merely encourages investors' belief that all share transactions in Russia carry a high risk of fraud. In practice, experienced, reputable brokerages have developed procedures that all but eliminate the settlement and custodial risks referred to. The Sirius computerised settlements system, currently being adopted by a number of the latest Russian enterprises, including Surgutneftegaz and Yuganskneftegaz, provides buyers and sellers with a secure and auditable mechanism. Electronic trading systems are being introduced by KPMG while DCC is developing a secure custodial system. Russian securities law may be in its infancy, but it still provides strong and clear redress for investors who find themselves in conflict with factory managers and their registrars. The main deterrent to increased investment in Russia may well be the disproportionate publicity afforded to incidents such as Transworld's.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vadim Khusaynov: "Following Its Own Rules"] </F>   [Text] Yekaterinburg -- The first session of the  Sverdlovsk Oblast Duma has been held in Yekaterinburg.  According to the standing orders, deputies began work by  electing a chairman. Eduard Rossel received 18 of the 27 votes.    I would recall that about a year ago Rossel was removed from  the post of governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast by Russian  presidential edict for attempting to proclaim the Ural Republic.  After his removal, his popularity rating rose even higher. The  oblast inhabitants elected Rossel deputy to the Russian  Federation Council and then deputy to the Oblast Duma. In  addition, the heads of administrations of the territories  adjoining Sverdlovsk Oblast picked Rossel as president of the  Urals Economic Cooperation Association, and the nonpolitical  movement "Transformation of the Urals" elected him chairman.    In this way the Urals demonstrated its disagreement with  Moscow's edicts and supported the out-of-favor governor.  Meanwhile, Eduard Rossel continued to develop the idea of  regional self-government along the lines of the U.S. states or  the German laender in the belief that it is necessary to abandon  the national division of Russia and switch to a territorial  division. He put that idea to the deputies in the Oblast Duma.  Incidentally, Vladimir Volkov, the second contender for the  post of chairman of the Sverdlovsk Duma, also stated in the  pre-election debates that the constitution of the Ural Republic  should form the basis of Sverdlovsk Oblast's charter.    Now that Eduard Rossel has become chairman of the Duma and  the latter is actively supporting the idea of regionalism, we  can expect quite an interesting development of events. The Duma  is beginning to work on the oblast charter, copying it from the  Constitution of the Ural Republic. But whereas the Constitution  had to be ratified by a vote of the Russian parliament, the  charter is adopted by the Oblast Duma itself. One of the main  provisions of the charter is the election of the oblast governor  by universal suffrage.    Eduard Rossel makes no secret of his intention of running  for  this post if elections are held. Bearing in mind Rossel's  prestige and his reputation in the oblast, it may be said that  he has a very good chance of being returned as governor, unless,  of course, the president of Russia bans the elections of  governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, as happened last fall.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Moscow agrees big cash boost for state enterprises THE Russian government has agreed to provide state enterprises with Rbs500bn in fresh working capital after Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the newly reappointed central bank chairman, tried to set the figure at Rbs1,000bn. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday that the figure had been reduced to Rbs500bn after stormy debates within the government and with Mr Gerashchenko, whom he accused of seeking unilaterally to alter government policy on the debt crisis which has beset state-owned enterprises. The new money, which is in addition to another unscheduled Rbs200bn handed out to enterprises this spring, is supposed to be tied to strict conditions so that it helps enterprises which are unable to operate because of inflation-induced cash-flow problems. Enterprises are not, for instance, to use the government help to increase wages or prices. Net debtors in the payments crisis are still supposed to be made accountable for their debts, and Mr Nechayev denied that he had given up a plan to effect a few bankruptcies of irresponsible state enterprises to discourage others. Asked in what circumstances the government might resign rather than continue to compromise with its domestic critics over financial stabilisation, Mr Nechayev said that stepping down would become an option 'if we were no longer able to block financially irresponsible policies'. But as the government yesterday welcomed the receipt of a first International Monetary Fund credit tranche of Dollars 1bn and hoped it would obtain an extra Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in the autumn, it is looking increasingly unlikely to meet targets agreed with the Fund to restore the country to some sort of financial health. To gain access to the first Dollars 1bn, which is to replenish depleted foreign exchange reserves, Moscow undertook to keep the budget deficit to below 5 per cent of gross domestic product and to lower inflation to a monthly level of 10 per cent. The near-impossibility of this task is underlined by estimates by western experts that the budget deficit was already heading for 15 per cent of GDP, before the approval of Rbs500bn  - which is itself bigger than the budget deficit already forecast by the government.</p>

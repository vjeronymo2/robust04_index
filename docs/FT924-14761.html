			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Independent Bank cannot be regulator as well as guardian Sir, An autonomous Bank of England should be one of the necessary preconditions for sterling's re-entry into the ERM, as your leader ('Down and down again', October 6) rightly states. But, before that, don't we have to review the Bank's regulatory role? The doubt cast over it by the US Congress's report on BCCI and the backwash from the Blue Arrow affair which sent waves lapping to its very doors are strong arguments for separating the Bank's role as guardian of the currency from that of regulator. The UK needs a strong banking regulator without umbilical links to the banking industry. Bryan Cassidy, Bureau 827, Van Maerlant, European Parliament, 97-113 Rue Belliard, 1040 Brussels</p>

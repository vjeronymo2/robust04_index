			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> HOME SALES RISE ON LOWER INTEREST  </P> <P> Sales of new homes edged up 2.7% in May as mortgage interest rates continued to  decline, but they remained well behind the pace set in the previous two years,  the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes rose to a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613,000 units in May following a 9.1%  increase in April. The April figure was revised downward from the 10.9%  increase reported earlier.  </P> <P> The April increase had been attributed by some economists to an aberration in  sales in February and March, when sales dropped 11.3% and 11.9%, respectively.  Sales had risen 4.6% in January.  </P> <P> The pace of sales in May still was well behind the 676,000 new homes sold in  1988 and the 671,000 units sold in 1987.  </P></p>

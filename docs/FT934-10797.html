			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (7): Sleepy giants face market - The likely impact of banking reforms Moroccan banking is based, like much else in the country, on the French system. Until the Moroccanisation Law of 1973, which restricted foreign ownership, French banks dominated the sector. Today, the French legacy is one of structure so that the bulk of the sector's assets are in the hands of only a small number of banks. Though there are 14 commercial banks, only three - the state-owned Banque Centrale Populaire, Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur and the Banque Commercial du Maroc, the largest bank in the private sector - hold 60 per cent of the banking system's assets. This makes it hard for newcomers or the smaller banks to compete and is reflected in the weak penetration of the market by the seven smallest banks which hold less than 10 per cent of banking aggregates. The system is highly regulated by the Bank al-Maghrib, the central bank, which still fixes the maximum lending rate. As a result of these controls, the banks have stuck to a traditional role of lending money and taking deposits. About half the deposits held in the commercial banking sector are in non-interest bearing accounts, so an easy way to make money has been to increase the branch network. Just under 30 per cent of deposits are held by Moroccans working abroad and Banque Populaire holds about 70 per cent of expatriate accounts. Although the domestic banks have competed fiercely for market share, they are sometimes unkindly known as the sleepy giants. They are now being steered into a more competitive environment with the introduction of banking reforms and the passage of a banking law last year. The aim is to liberalise the banking system, which is regarded as a necessity if privatisation and competition are to take hold, which will inevitably result in a reduction of control exercised by the central bank. Nearly two-thirds of the candidates for privatisation are from the banking and financial sector with the commercial banks representing 40 per cent. The single largest company due for privatisation is BCP, the country's largest bank. The monetary authorities began liberalising in 1991 by lifting credit ceilings imposed by the central bank. Interest rates were also liberalised to the extent that banding was introduced and banks were free to set their interest rates within those bands. However, the result was that the money supply increased by 20 per cent in 1991 with banks, anxious to increase their credit market share, increasing the growth of their loans by 35 per cent compared to the previous year. By the end of 1992, the commercial banks accounted for 60 per cent of credit compared to 53 per cent in 1990. The strong explosion of credit prompted the central bank to intervene and it did so principally by raising the banks' reserve requirement to 25 per cent on demand deposits and by increasing the overnight borrowing rate. The measures have had the desired effect and the rate of growth of the money supply fell back to 9 per cent in 1992 while credits rose by 11.5 per cent. The central bank eased the reserve requirement a year ago to 10 per cent (although banks had to place the 15 per cent balance in treasury bonds instead) and in June, the Ministry of Finance lowered the maximum lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 14 per cent, to help stimulate the economy. The banking law, which has not yet been codified, is intended to improve the supervision of banks by creating new regulatory bodies and a guarantee protection fund for depositors. The banking reforms are aimed at strengthening domestic banks and bringing them up to international standards. New capital adequacy ratios were introduced at the beginning of the year; banks must maintain 8 per cent of their capital against risk-adjusted assets. Banks must also make provisions against a non-performing loan after four months by making a 100 per cent provision against the loan unless there is a guarantee. The measure is being introduced gradually. The banks also operate under one of the toughest legal lending limits in the world. The limit is 7 per cent of net capital funds to a single borrower compared to the usual limit of 25 per cent in other countries. While the limit used to apply to each subsidiary of a company, it is now restricted to the company as a whole. The reforms are not popular with most of the banks, which claim they were imposed too suddenly. 'The provision against non-performing loans is terrible for us,' said one banker at one of the largest banks 'because we have to increase our capital.' However, the banks are now obliged to do their homework before they lend money by selecting businesses which are well-managed and by looking for profitable loans or those giving the best guarantees. While the reforms may seem a constraint to the bankers, some Moroccan companies have traditionally found it cheaper to finance themselves through debt, leading to an undesirable capital structure. The new reforms should make it cheaper for them to turn to equities for finance. Despite the proliferation of measures, there is some anxiety that change is not taking place as quickly as it should. In his open letter on July 14 to Mr Muhammad Karim Lamrani, the prime minister, King Hassan urged a reformulation of financing policy to make access to international capital markets easier for local companies. He also called for the development of domestic capital markets through stock market reform and an increase in the range of financial instruments available. Companies need the infrastructure of suitable instruments, such as capital markets to gain access to foreign investment. The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate devoted to private sector investment in the developing world, is planning to establish with the CPR group, the French investment bank, a Moroccan discount house with six Moroccan banks before the end of the year. It will give advice on the central problem of how to create greater liquidity on the debt securities market. Morocco returned to the international capital markets in July through a Dollars 30m Euroloan arranged by Citibank International for Omnium Nord Africain, the country's largest private company. One international banker says that while there is a lot of interest in the stock exchange from international institutions, progress has been slow which are highlighted by the lack of a developed capital market. 'There is not enough synchronisation,' he said. 'While banks and corporations are allowed access to international capital markets and can borrow money overseas, there is, as yet, no mechanism by which foreign exchange exposure risk can be hedged.' Morocco also lacks a money market and a secondary market for fixed income instruments. The Casablanca Finance Group, established with backing from Paribas and others, says that there is a lot to do before it can establish itself as the country's first investment bank. It needs to convince investors to turn to the capital markets instead of banks, and also a developed brokerage system and buoyant stock exchange. It plans to launch the country's first open-ended mutual fund by the end of the year.</p>

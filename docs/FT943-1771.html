			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tibbett &amp; Britten advances 11% - Growth provided by car distribution but difficulties in clothing Tibbett &amp; Britten, the distribution group, reported an 11 per cent increase in first-half profits, but failed to keep pace with expectations that the UK economic recovery would translate into increased revenues from its core business. The shares fell 42p to 768p, after Tibbett revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 11.4m) for the six months to July 2, on turnover up 15 per cent to Pounds 203m (Pounds 177m). Mr John Harvey, chairman, said that 'the present trading environment is tough, with margins generally under pressure.' Most brokers marked down 1994 profit forecasts by some Pounds 1.5m to a new consensus of Pounds 27m. However, the group's UK business has secured substantial new contracts, from companies including Mars and Jacobs Bakery, which bodes well for next year. Profits growth for the period came primarily from Silcock Express, the car distributor purchased in late 1992 and strengthened by the purchase of Toleman in March. Divisional profits increased by Pounds 1.5m to 5.5m. Tibbett &amp; Britten Ltd, the core UK business, fared less well, with profits edging up to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 7m). The subsidiary suffered from difficulties in its clothing network. The group has been making a substantial push overseas, and the UK accounted for 71 per cent of revenues, compared with 97 per cent in 1991. Tibbett &amp; Britten International increased turnover by 62 per cent. Progress in its three main markets of Canada, South Africa and Portugal helped lift operating profit from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 600,000. Profit margins overseas remained razor thin, but Mr Harvey said this reflected the level of investment in new facilities. He said the international division should be able to achieve the 6.6 per cent profit margins of the UK, compared with 2 per cent now, but the improvement would be slowed by continuing investment. Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 13.4m to Pounds 39m, bringing net borrowings to Pounds 33m. Mr Harvey suggested that the year end figure could rise to Pounds 55m. The increase in the interim dividend to 5p (4.5p) is in proportion with earnings per share, up from 17.5p to 19.4p. COMMENT The danger with a premium stock market rating, is that investors expect earnings growth to match. Tibbett's shares remain at a 29 per cent premium to the stock market, and parts of its UK business are looking decidedly mature. Profits should hit Pounds 27m this year, representing a p/e of 18.3. International expansion offers good longer-term prospects, and the management performance justifies a high stock market rating. However, it does not justify the current level, and the shares are likely to lag in the short-term.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A body that washed ashore near a southern Mexican village six weeks ago has  been tentatively identified as that of an American employee of the U.S. Agency  for International Development who had been on a hiking trip, officials in  Washington said. Dental records appeared to confirm that the victim was Frank  Fairchild, 43, who went to Guatemala on a hiking trip alone in May and crossed  into Mexico on June 1. The remains have been sent to Mexico City for further  examination. Fairchild's body washed ashore at Puerto Arista and was buried by  local authorities. Mexico informed the State Department, which requested that  the body be disinterred after it was learned that Fairchild, who was born in  Los Angeles, was missing.  </P></p>

"I am proud to be able to present to you the Czech Republic  as a stable democratic State with a rapidly advancing market  economy," Dr. Havel said at a banquet hosted in his honour, by  his counterpart, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma.    Among a variety of issues, Kashmir figured prominently  during  talks which the visiting dignitary held with the Minister of  State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia.    The first head of the Czech Republic to visit India, after  Czechoslovakia was partitioned last year, Dr. Havel, during his  six-day stay, will be conferred with the Indira Gandhi Prize for  Peace, Disarmament and Development for 1993.    Ideal solution for Kashmir issue: In the backdrop  of India's refusal to the Pakistani bid for external  intervention on Kashmir, Dr. Havel said it was "unnecessary for  one side to internationalise the issue." Aware of what he  described as a "complicated issue" (Czechoslovakia was a member  of the UN Commission on India and Pakistan soon after its  appointment), Dr. Havel said Kashmir's solution lay in a  "peaceful bilateral dialogue."    Citing a precedent which saw India and Pakistan signing an  agreement, he advocated that an "ideal solution lay in a  peaceful negotiation as was done before at Shimla."    Hoping to see the Czech Republic supporting India's campaign  to make the U.N. more representative, Mr. Bhatia discussed  'restructuring' the U.N. system with Dr. Havel. Expansion of the  15-nation Security Council is high on India's agenda.    With Dr. Havel offering India better economic opportunities  following market reforms by Prague, economic relations between  the republics could well be on the upswing. Sharing Dr. Havel's  optimism during talks this morning, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma  hoped "the two countries will work together for mutual benefit  in the fields of economic cooperation, commerce and trade."    In the wake of this political nod, a meeting between  industrialists with the Czech Minister of Finance, Mr. Ivan  Kocarnic, yielded the possibility of India investing in the  Czech republic in sectors including steel, heavy engineering,  computer software, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, consumer goods,  ceramics and textiles. Referring to the potential economic  advantages, Mr. Kocarnic told Indian businessmen that nearly 60  per cent of the Czech industry was now in private hands.    Apprising entrepreneurs that the former east bloc power  house  was not `Euro-centric', he said that nearly 60 per cent of  exports to Western Europe finally ended in Asian markets. Before  its partition, Czechoslovakia was also a supplier of key defence  equipment for the Indian arsenal. Heavy vehicles and small arms  were among a variety of equipment churned out by Czechoslovakian  factories which ended up in Indian defence stores.</p>

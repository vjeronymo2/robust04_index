			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Recovery alone is not enough The golden rule for economic forecasters is: forecast what has already happened and stay at the cautious end. The British Treasury's summer economic forecast obeys both these rules; like other forecasts it tells us more about the present and the recent past than about the future. Growth has turned out slightly faster and inflation lower than in the official forecast late last autumn when the unified Budget was introduced. These developments have occurred not just in one country but in most principal western economies. As a result the Treasury has cautiously raised its 1994 forecast from a growth rate of 2 1/2 per cent to 2 3/4 per cent, these numbers both being 1/4 per cent lower if North Sea oil output is excluded. Next year the growth rate is expected to remain at 2 3/4 per cent with or without the North Sea element. The forecast for the inflation rate has been adjusted rather more. It is expected to remain at 2 1/2 per cent (excluding mortgage interest payments) in the final quarter of 1994 and rise only to 2 3/4 per cent next year - well within the government's 1-4 per cent target range. The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement projection has accordingly been trimmed back by Pounds 2bn a year, nearly all due to higher revenue estimates. The Treasury insists that inflation tends to fall when the output gap - the difference between actual and potential levels of gross domestic product - is sufficiently high. Officials are confident that there is still a sizeable margin of excess capacity and that there will therefore be considerable further downward pressure on inflation in the medium term. The outbreak of price competition among British newspapers may tell us more about the changed economic climate than the spurt in commodity prices or the fall in bonds. Indeed it is important for the government not to be panicked by the bond markets into premature restrictive measures. No one country can resist these pressures on its own. But they are something that the finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries should tackle together, preferably at meetings where central bank governors are also present rather than at the 'summit' to be staged next week as a media event by heads of government in Naples. In the UK growth has, quite naturally, been consumer-led. Nevertheless the forecast current balance of payment deficit is expected to fall slightly, as a proportion of GDP, to reach 1 1/4 per cent by 1995. This is the one place where the Treasury is prepared to be more optimistic than its Panel of Independent Forecasters. Indeed import growth is expected to be 'slower than usual in relation to the expected growth of demand'. Cost competitiveness is put at about 15 per cent better than in the second quarter of 1992, before sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. It is also better than in nearly all of the past 15 years. The need is thus not to achieve 'competitiveness' but to keep it and exploit it. Pay and jobs As usual, the most interesting aspect of the Treasury forecast lies not in the predictions but in the observations made en route. For instance officials admit that employment has yet to show a strong recovery. 'The implication is that falling participation in the labour market has made some contribution to the decline in unemployment.' Increased participation in further and higher education is one reason for diminished participation rates, but is far from the only one. Indeed the biggest problem of modern western economies is not the growth rate but the inter-related ones of low pay and unemployment. For the market-clearing pay rates for the less well-off have been squeezed everywhere, showing itself directly in the US and in the form of high and rising unemployment on the continent of Europe. In Britain, the pay squeeze is becoming evident well ahead of the job improvement aspects. Some new evidence of the extent of the squeeze in low pay has been published by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in a new paper, What Has Happened To Wages? The summarised conclusion is stark and is illustrated in the accompanying chart. British workers half-way up the income distribution (normally called by statisticians the 'median' or '50th percentile') received a total real pay increase of 35 per cent between 1978 to 1992. Those 90 per cent of the way up the income distribution (the '90th percentile') received a pay increase of 50 per cent. On the other hand workers 10 per cent up from the bottom (the '10th percentile') have not even recovered from the real pay cut they took under the Labour government's pay ceilings of 1975-76. (The figures relate to full-time male workers to avoid the complication caused by increased female participation rates.) The relative position of workers at the bottom was at its worst since records began in 1886. The IFS exaggerates the contrast between Britain and continental Europe. For the position of the low paid is being squeezed in most countries; and Britain is simply ahead of the others in its move to more flexible labour markets. The IFS explains the disparities partly in terms of high returns to skill and education. But this begs the question of whether these are genuine returns or whether employers are using the educational system as a quality filter to help choose recruits. In any case income disparities have increased even within similar educational groups. So other qualities, such as work attitudes, personal traits and even luck have also become more important. The British government has been approaching the problem from the angle of structural unemployment. At the moment attention is concentrated on the Job Seekers' allowance, which is to replace both Unemployment Benefit and Income Support. Valuable time has been frittered away on a turf battle between the Department of Employment and the Department of Social Security about who is to administer the new benefit; predictably they are both to have a hand. A more substantial discussion has been going on about the definition of 'availability for work'. The guiding principle is likely to be a review of the recipient's attempts to find work - a development of Lord Young's Restart scheme. A less 'Gradgrind' aspect is to carry further the reintegration of the employment services and benefit offices. It is suggested that the same official who places somebody in a job should also explain to him how to apply for the top-up benefit for low earners known in the UK as Family Credit. Another constructive idea is Prof Dennis Snower's, for the transferability of benefit for a limited period to employers willing to make a net addition to their labour force. A couple of pilot projects have been launched, but the DoE is regarded in the rest of Whitehall as dragging its feet in this regard. All such schemes must have some effect in reducing wages - the whole idea is to encourage employers to price more people into work without the workers concerned being forced into poverty. There is no escaping the changes in the labour market, which confront some workers with the choice of no pay or low pay. But if they are to choose the latter without being forced onto unacceptably low standards of living, the solution would have to be a significant extension of the UK Family Credit system. This has been advocated by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, who is no dewy-eyed sentimentalist. At present Family Credit does not apply to single people or families without children. An extension to these groups is now estimated to cost up to Pounds 1bn a year. Although this is real money, it would be a low price to pay for combining the advantages of a US-style labour market with a European approach to poverty. Of course, reform should go further and ease some of the other conditions for drawing this benefit. But it is quite remarkable that no social security secretary within the past few years has as much as asked the Treasury for this particular extension.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / LDP godfather faces more tax evasion charges JAPANESE prosecutors have filed further tax evasion charges against Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and are continuing investigations into allegedly illegal political donations by leading construction companies. Having already been charged with evading Y119m (Dollars 983,400) in tax for 1987, Mr Kanemaru was charged at the weekend with having evaded Y920m in taxes for 1988 and 1989. His former secretary, Mr Masahisa Haibara, was charged with evading taxes totalling Y280m from 1988 to 1991. Mr Kanemaru has been in custody since March 6, in contrast to his previously lenient treatment from prosecutors. It remains unclear how tough the prosecutors will be in pursuing Japanese construction companies, but 18 leading contractors have been raided in the search for information about political donations. Mr Kanemaru is also not the only Japanese politician allegedly to have received generous funding from the construction industry, raising the prospect that other leading LDP officials will be spotlighted. However, the prosecutors, who have leaked many of their findings to Japanese newspapers, may see the publicity as warning enough to the industry and to politicians. Prosecutors are said to be investigating whether charges of bribery can be sustained against a list of politicians who allegedly received funds from contractors. Construction industry representatives deny they have been a party to bribery, but have conceded that the system of political donations should be made more transparent. The Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, is also under public pressure to ensure there is no bid-rigging for public works projects. Tokyo's District Court is due to rule today on a petition for Mr Kanemaru's release from custody. If found guilty in a case which may take many years to settle, he will liable to pay Y2.14bn in penalties and back taxes.</p>

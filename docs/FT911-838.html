			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: PepsiCo commercial leaves a bitter taste COCA-COLA and PepsiCo are suddenly at each other's throats in Japan, lodging competing claims with the Fair Trade Commission over a Pepsi commercial that Coke wants canned. Advertisements ridiculing a competitor are unusual in this consensus-conscious country, but, for the past month, PepsiCo has served a mildly amusing, gently mocking commercial to Japanese viewers. The US-made commercial shows the high-octane rap singer M. C. Hammer having his customary Pepsi switched for a Coke during a performance. He then breaks into an off-key rendition of the ballad Feelings, which prompts an audience member to offer him a Pepsi, inspiring a return to the rap beat. PepsiCo Japan has filed a claim with the FTC alleging Coca-Cola (Japan) has put unfair pressure on Japanese television stations not to broadcast the commercial, which has disappeared from the television screen in recent days. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola had lodged a complaint with the FTC against Pepsi, alleging that, under the Japanese advertising code, the commercial unfairly disparages Coke. Four years ago, the FTC ruled comparative commercials would be allowed only if the method was impartial and the content verifiable. A Coca-Cola official said unfair pressure had not been applied to Japanese broadcasters, though 'we informed key television stations that we did not authorise the use of our trademark and that the information implied was untrue and therefore unsupportable and disparaging'. Pepsi said yesterday the commercial was the first of its kind in Japan, and a survey of young people showed it was the second most popular nationally last month. The company said Pepsi sales for the month were up 50 per cent from a year earlier, though Coke is still reckoned to have a 90 per cent share of the cola market. 'We would like to continue airing this popular commercial. However, when we placed orders for May television spots to five key stations, they all replied that they cannot accept,' PepsiCo said. The success of the commercial has surprised the Japanese advertising industry, which will be tempted to indulge in the gentle art of the put-down if the FTC rules in favour of Pepsi. Commission officials yesterday said they could not comment on cases under review. Coca-Cola said that the company had no objection to PepsiCo screening the commercial in the US because the country was accustomed to comparative advertising. He said that Japan was 'a completely different situation' and that 'we have always tried to respect Japanese customs in presenting our product'.</p>

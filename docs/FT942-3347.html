			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Danger of marginalising UK aerospace industry Sir, The Hercules replacement decision ('Herculean task for UK defenders', June 13) raises two important questions about British government policy. First, acquiring the C-130J would mean short-term budgetary pressures prevailing upon the long-term interests of the British aerospace industry. Given the close relation between the FLA (Future Large Aircraft) and Airbus programmes, British Aerospace's position in the latter would inevitably be compromised if the RAF did not procure the FLA. There would be knock-on consequences for Britain's aerospace equipment and aero-engine industry, which would lose FLA and Airbus work, gaining comparatively little in return for the C-130J procurement. Second, the decision to procure the American C-130J for the RAF would stand in stark contrast with the call for 'enhanced, co-operation in the fields of armaments' among western European nations, contained in the Maastricht treaty. The FLA is the only significant European defence equipment programme for a long time on which all European governments' views coincide. It would be a shame if the government's budgetary preoccupations marginalised the British aerospace and defence industries from developments at the heart of Europe.

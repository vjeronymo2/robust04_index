			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: WIN ONE FOR THE OLD BROKER  </P> <P> The best players in Los Angeles' securities industry aren't jumping through  hoops. They're aiming at them. On March 19, West Coast offices of several  investment firms will compete in a tournament to raise funds for the National  Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.  </P> <P> The Wall Street West Basketball Challenge -- to be held at the Great Western  Forum -- is modeled after a benefit in New York. Companies scheduled to field  teams include Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards; Dean Witter Reynolds; Kidder  Peabody; Morgan Stanley, and Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P> Some of the companies are taking the competition seriously. At Bateman Eichler,  a 6-foot-8 employee in Anchorage who played college ball plans to try out. But  he will be up against about 25 other hopefuls competing for three roster  positions.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a pretty competitive environment here," says Sulfiati  Magnuson of Bateman Eichler. "These guys like to win."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marshalls Minds the Store  </P> <P> Marshalls, the nation's largest off-price clothing chain, has taken a small  step toward solving a big problem: finding a talented pool of retailers to run  its fast-growing network of stores.  </P> <P> On a visit late last month to Los Angeles, Francis H. Arnone, Marshalls'  president and chief executive, formally agreed to sponsor a retailing  internship at Cal State Los Angeles. Students selected for the program would be  paid while getting on-the-job training and, in some cases, would qualify for a  scholarship.  </P> <P> "We want manpower to come and run these stores," Arnone said, adding that the  program is "a way to reach out to minorities." Arnone, a former chairman of the  Broadway department store chain, now lives in the Boston area, where Marshalls  is based. But clearly he's still partial to California, where Marshalls has 46  stores and more than 4,000 employees. Plans call for opening 17 more stores in  the state by the end of next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MBA for Couch Potatoes  </P> <P> Would you hire an MBA who learned his stuff from the comfort of his couch?  </P> <P> A Colorado university and a major cable television firm have joined forces to  offer a select group of Californians -- among 4 million residents of 29 other  states -- the chance to earn a Master of Business Administration degree without  leaving their living rooms. Beginning this fall, Colorado State University's  20-year-old MBA program will be available through Mind Extension University, a  cable-TV service of Jones International.  </P> <P> In the Southland, cable systems serving Oxnard and the Palmdale-Lancaster area  will carry the program.  </P> <P> Cable students will receive credit from Colorado State; actual MBA classes at  the school will be videotaped to give students the benefit of classroom  questions and answers. Assignments will be handled by mail, and students can  call a toll-free number to talk to professors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Search of a Good Meal  </P> <P> When Californians let their fingers do the walking, it's often because their  stomachs are growling.  </P> <P> California residents look up restaurants more than any other category in their  Yellow Pages directories, according to a survey of 7,000 households around the  state. The survey was conducted by the San Francisco-based National Yellow  Pages Monitor.  </P> <P> A total of 7.6% of all consumer use of Yellow Pages directories was to look up  restaurants, the report said. That was followed by airlines, with 3.5%, and  physicians and surgeons, with 2.8%.  </P> <P> Also listed in the top 10: auto repair, beauty salons and pizza parlors.  </P></p>

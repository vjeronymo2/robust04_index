			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon, Dr. Nabil Sha'th said he has sent  the Shamgar Commission report to 'Arafat and members of the PLO  Executive Committee in Tunis. The PLO leadership's reaction to  the report will be issued after the report is studied.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that several members of  the Palestinian Authority have already rejected the conclusions  of the Shamgar Commission. Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the Cave of  the Patriarchs massacre was not perpetuated by one individual  but rather stemmed from the settlement policy. He maintains,  therefore, that the Israeli Government should bear the  responsibility. 'Urayqat warned that the presence of the  settlers in the territories is a time bomb which can go off any  minute.</p>

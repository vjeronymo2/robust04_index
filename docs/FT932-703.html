			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Shock in Salisbury - Theatre THE FASCINATION with contemporary American theatre continues to spread. One would not normally expect the British premiere of a play about veterans from Vietnam to take place in Wiltshire, but here it is. At the Salisbury Playhouse, Sam Shepard's States of Shock is given one of the best sets I have ever seen in a studio theatre. As the title suggests, everything about the play is in varying degrees electric. The set includes thin neon lighting, but also some lovely street lighting of the kind that is just coming back into vogue. It looks old, but relies on modern technology. The stage is littered with hundreds, possibly thousands of small photographs, some of them torn up and on the floor, others stuck on the walls. Before the piece opens an elderly white couple whom I first took to be dummies are sitting at a table. They turn out to be real, with memories of an American war long before Vietnam. That was the war between the states, as southerners still call it. Shepard is very precise about his titles. The play itself has a concealed shock. On the face of it, an American colonel is looking after a mutilated returnee from Vietnam who is supposed to have tried to save the colonel's son from being killed in an incident of 'friendly fire'. The colonel appears to be trying to reconstruct what happened. It is a test of your pyschological instinct how quickly you guess that the mutilated victim is in fact the colonel's son. David Burke's colonel cannot bring himself to accept that his boy did not either die or return as a hero. There is another twist. The mutilated victim does not realise either until late on that the colonel is his father. None of that is wholly explicit. Nor is that all. Gradually the elderly couple come into the play, first mildly complaining that their clam chowder in the American diner has not been served while the men from Vietnam can get a banana split in five minutes, then enjoying a return to an American past where rebellious youth is beaten into shape. American sentimentality comes in as well. The flag never leaves the stage and the play ends with everyone quietly singing 'Good Night, Irene'. Intellectually it may not add up, but it is an immensely powerful spectacle. The production is part of the Royal National Theatre's Springboards Festival under which the RNT is seeking to extend its studio techniques throughout the country. The Salberg Studio at the Salisbury Playhouse is an able and willing pupil. Lucy Hall's set deserves the highest praise and Deborah Paige, the artistic director at Salisbury, here shows an immaculate command of detail. Nearly everyone to do with the performance, including very much David Burke, has had some experience of the RNT or the RSC. There is one reservation. I admire Sam Shepard's style, but there is just a possibility that he is becoming a bit of a cult outside his own country. I doubt if he has much to teach British playwrights. States of Shock is technically brilliant, but it lasts barely an hour. Salberg Studio, Salisbury Playhouse until July 3. (0722) 320 333</p>

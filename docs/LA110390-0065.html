			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKEND UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> HENLEY'S RETURN WOULD BE WELCOME  </P> <P> Cornerback Darryl Henley, who will be activated off injured reserve today,  could be stepping back into the Rams' secondary in the nick of time.  </P> <P> Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray has been nursing a sore knee this week, and  Coach John Robinson was evasive Friday about whether Gray will play Sunday  against the Houston Oilers at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "We're just kind of waiting as long as we can," Robinson said of Gray's  situation. "Jerry will be OK, I think. It's just we've got quite a few ifs  there, and we're going to try to play a lot of people. Is that vague enough?"  </P> <P> Gray, who is not listed on the Rams' injury report, missed the first three  games of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, and  lately has been complaining of soreness in the knee. He had it re-examined this  week, but no further serious damage was found.  </P> <P> If Gray is sidelined, Robinson said Mickey Sutton probably will play in his  place, though Henley, who was projected to be a starter before his hip-muscle  tear in the exhibition season, is also a possibility.  </P> <P> Running back Marcus Dupree, eligible to come off of injured reserve, will not  be activated for Sunday's game, Robinson said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliamentary delegations from Ukraine and Crimea  have ended talks in Simferopol on the settlement of the Crimean  problem. In a final document, the participants noted that  proposals for coordinating the two sides' legislations should be  prepared by 15 June. At the same time, the delegations agreed  that the Ukrainian constitution has supremacy over other laws on  the territory of Crimea.    It was decided to set up a joint working group which will  deal with the delineation of authorities between Ukrainian and  Crimean state structures. At the same time amendments will be  made to Ukrainian laws.    The delegation from the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet asked  President Leonid Kravchuk not to take any measures against the  Crimean authorities. The Ukrainian delegation also addressed a  similar request to President Yuriy Meshkov.    INTERFAX reports that Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the  Ukrainian parliament, plans to arrive in Simferopol on  Wednesday.</p>

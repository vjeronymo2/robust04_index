			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. </F> Secretary of State Warren Christopher with foreign and domestic  correspondents in Jerusalem on 29 April "after the second  meeting between the two" -- live; broadcast in progress]    [Excerpts] [Rabin, in English] ...the negotiations for  peace between us and the Palestinians, between us and that three  neighboring Arab countries. We appreciate the efforts that you  have put since you became a secretary of state in bringing about  solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. You spent some days now  in Cairo with President Mubarak, Chairman 'Arafat, our Foreign  Minister Peres, and helped to bring about the beginning of the  end of the negotiations about Gaza-Jericho First. I know that a  date was set for the signing of the agreement, but there are  still some issues to be negotiated, formulated, and be put in  the draft -- not the draft, in the context of the agreement on  which we will sign.    I know that now you will go to other Arab countries,  especially to Syria, in an effort to revive the peace  negotiations between Israel and Syria. Israel is interested in  achieving peace treaties with the three neighboring Arab  countries, beyond the peace with Egypt. And we appreciate your  efforts in bringing the Syrian and the Israeli positions closer,  and I wish you all the success on your road to Damascus.  [passage omitted]    [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent in  English  regarding reports on a deal to offer Syria control over Golan  Druze villages]    [Rabin, in English] I do not believe that it will be  advisable to me, before the secretary will go to Damascus, to  discuss any details of what we brought before the secretary as  our basic approach for the peace with Syria. [passage omitted]    [Qol Yisra'el political correspondent Shlomo Raz] I  understand that the meeting with Secretary Christopher focused  on the Syrian issue. Were the Americans given any additional  information that will facilitate expediting the negotiations  with Syria? Has Israel presented more detailed plans or the  scope of the withdrawal it is willing to carry out on the Golan  Heights?    [Rabin] Today, our main goal is to complete the work in  Cairo in order to attain an agreed formulation of the  Gaza-Jericho First accord. Such an agreement has not yet been  fully drafted. Several problems which require examination and  agreement still exist. The delegation headed by the deputy  chief of staff will leave for Cairo on the morning of 1 May in  the hope of wrapping everything up by the evening of 2 May.  Several issues were left for a meeting I will hold with 'Arafat  on 3 May. Those issues must be concluded in order to attain a  complete and total agreement. A date was set, but there still  are issues that need to be completed, agreed upon, and added to  the formulation of the agreement.    In fact, today we dealt with issues that concern the  negotiations with the other Arab partners -- that is, the three  neighboring Arab countries. Naturally, we dealt primarily with  Syria. We also heard the secretary's briefing on the outcome of  his meeting with King Husayn in London in the context of the  resumption of the negotiations with Jordan. We presented the  secretary with our stands in principle regarding our willingness  and conditions for the attainment of peace with Syria. Do not  expect me to give details, but the main principles of our stands  are known, and I will not repeat them on this occasion. I  believe that, in the absence of direct contacts, negotiations  should be held through the secretary of state. He will relay  our stands, and I will not do this through the media. [passage  omitted]    [Indistinct question by unidentified correspondent]    [Rabin] I presented a comprehensive concept which contains  the nature of peace, the principle of withdrawal with which you  are familiar from my previous declarations, the stages,  reference to the implementation of each step, as well as several  demands from the United States. I will provide no further  details. [passage omitted]</p>

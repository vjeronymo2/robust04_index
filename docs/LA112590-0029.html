			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: WRAPPING A RAPPER  </P> <P> THE SHOW: "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"(NBC, Mondays, 8 p.m.)  </P> <P> THE SETUP: Will Smith plays "the Fresh Prince" (also his real-life rap  moniker), a kid from a tough Philly neighborhood whose parents send him to live  with his well-to-do uncle Philip Banks (James Avery) and his family in Bel-Air.  The frequent clashes between the young rapper and the upper-crust set provide  sparks.  </P> <P> And also some smooth dance steps.  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Smith (pictured) frequently wears bright, extra-large shirts,  extra-large baggy pants in neon colors. His look is fresh, young and  unrestricted, especially compared to Carlton, his totally preppy cousin.  </P> <P> "We're taking our cue from Will Smith/Fresh Prince. He is the character, so his  wardrobe for the show is pretty much what he'd wear himself," said the show's  costume designer, Judy Richman.  </P> <P> THE LABELS: The Westside Pavilion's young contemporary shops provide Richman  with a lot of that fresh stuff. At DJ's, she gets men's sportswear, silk  jackets with matching pants in a variety of colors and dressy unstructured  blazers. At GHQ, Richman finds bright shirts and jeans. The shoes that allow  the Prince to hip-hop are Nike Air Jordans (the kind you fill with air) and  Reeboks.  </P> <P> The yuppie relatives dress to blend into the Bel-Air landscape. Clothes come  from Neiman Marcus, Maxfield boutique on Melrose, Modasport and Carroll &amp;  Co. in Beverly Hills. SUE MARTIN  </P></p>

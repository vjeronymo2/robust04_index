			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Bush backs force to ensure 'new world order' US PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday proclaimed his belief in 'the selective use of military force for selective purposes' in order to ensure that a new world democratic order was sustained. But he insisted that it would be a 'waste of resources' for the US to assume the role of global policeman. Other nations must contribute militarily and economically whenever 'their interests are at stake'. In a farewell address to the cadets of the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, Mr Bush sought to lay out his thoughts on the use of force which, he said, could serve as 'a complement to diplomacy or as a temporary alternative to it'. He cited the Gulf war and the current operation in Somalia as two examples of this use. Humanitarian concerns, as in Somalia, meant 'we should not stand by when the modest use of force can make an immediate difference'. But he argued that any decision not to use force could also be valid. In former Yugoslavia, for example, 'up to now it has not been clear that the use of limited amounts of force would have had the desired effects given the complexities of that situation'. He warned, however, that circumstances in the Balkans could change. Mr Bush cautioned against drawing up too rigid a set of rules whereby international military intervention might be determined. Instead he preferred 'principles' and 'guidelines', though he offered no details as to what these might contain. He added that ideally nations should use force 'in concert' but international agreement on such deployments, while desirable, should not be an absolute 'prerequisite'. There would be occasions, he said, when the US might want to act unilaterally, as it had in Panama when it determined its own vital interests were at stake. But, he went on: 'The fact that America can act does not mean that it must.' He was mostly at pains to emphasise the new challenges of the post-cold war era which, he said, was 'unfortunately' still fraught with 'the spectre of war'. In this climate: 'I cannot say that the demands on the US will diminish.' For all the hope attendant on the end of the cold war, 'the new world order simply won't emerge on its own'. The US could not remain 'passive and aloof' from events far from its shore, he said. The speech was consciously designed to address the criticism that foreign policy had been given no coherent framework since Mr Bush first coined the term 'new world order' more than two years ago.</p>

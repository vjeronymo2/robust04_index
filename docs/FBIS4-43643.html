			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "The Miscalculation of </F> the Bonn-Paris Tandem"]    [Text] Brussels, 16 June -- The struggle for the  succession of the president of the European Commission, Jacques  Delors, is moving towards its climax. At their summit in Corfu  next week, the 12 heads of state and government of the European  Union [EU] will have to choose between the government heads of  Belgium and the Netherlands, Jean-Luc Dehaene and Ruud Lubbers.  Yet, the likeliness that, instead, there will be embarrassing  disagreement, is increasing day by day. French President  Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl will not catch the genie  they let escape from the bottle. They achieved a 7:5 majority  in favor of the Belgian at an early stage and were optimistic of  winning the support of the entire community apart from Britain's  John Major and Lubbers himself in time before the vote. They  calculated that, at the summit, Major would most likely give in  and Lubbers would be "defeated."    However, things have not quite turned out that way. The  official from the Netherlands, who, contrary to Dehaene, threw  himself into the race, is with certain success making propaganda  with some smaller EU partners but also Italy's new head of  government, Silvio Berlusconi, against the "Franco-German axis,"  which was trying to put Dehaene, who allegedly complies with all  their wishes, in front of them. If this were true, Corfu would  become the summit of irony, because Mitterrand and Kohl have  justified their choice not least by arguing that Dehaene had the  outstanding skills of accommodating differing interests, while  Lubbers was tending towards polarizing the club. During a time  when the Romance south of the community is watching the increase  in power of the "Germanic" north with suspicion, Dehaene's  talents would be vital. Yet, now it looks as if the community  is to be polarized not so much by the man from the Netherlands  but rather by his opponents. The dividing line would then run  between big and small instead of north and south. The "axis"  would itself have disqualified as incompatible with the  community.    One can certainly believe that the chancellor is pinning  Euro-idealist expectations on the new chief in Brussels. The  French, however, are guided by national interests. People in  Brussels have, for example, made the following calculation:  France's state enterprises, from Air France to the Credit  Lyonnais and the electronics group Bull, will have to rely on  subsidies that are incompatible with the EU's competition rules  for a long time to come. The conflict with Brussels is fully  underway and is deteriorating in an unprecedented way. The  French opponent of the French is the most able Belgian  Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert. He would have to go  if Dehaene came in, because Belgium is entitled to only one  place in the Commission. That way, the path would be cleared  for Edith Cresson, Mitterrand's former prime minister, to head  the body that is so important for France's future. The  chancellor will certainly be aware of his friend's ulterior  motives.</p>

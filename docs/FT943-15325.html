			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: The spoils of archaeology - The ancient delights of modern Syria In the 1930s Agatha Christie voluntarily played second fiddle to her archaeologist husband, Max Mallowan, when she accompanied him to Syria in his quest for artefacts of the past. At the end of each dig, when the local workmen had been paid off, Agatha and Max agonised over the division of the spoils. One half they could bring back to Britain; the other was claimed by the French authorities on behalf of Syria's museums. The form was long established: Agatha and Max divided the shards, ornaments, pieces of jewellery and small statues into two piles, knowing there would be no quibbling about the content of each. The French official, advised by his wife, would scrutinise the piles, point to one and have it removed intact. The dilemma for Agatha and Max was in the dividing. Whichever pile was chosen would inevitably be the wrong one. It would contain something they desperately desired. Today's visitors to the museum at Aleppo, in northern Syria, can assess for themselves the French official's judgment. Here are Mallowan's discoveries - unpainted pots and decorated jars from the 3rd millennium BC, a golden altar frieze, jewellery of precious stones, gold and silver. Such is the power and presence of the past in today's Syria that the comfortable coach for internal travel, and the top-class hotels with the very best of 20th century facilities, become incidental to the monuments of a civilisation stretching back to the 10th millennium BC, believed to be the date of the earliest alphabet, recorded on tablets discovered at Ebla, south of Aleppo. In the Roman city of Bosra, 3,000 men, women and children continue to live with their animals among the basalt ruins. Elsewhere, the city would be fenced off and tourists charged a fortune to wander its streets. But in Bosra chickens and turkeys scuttle through the agora and goats survey visitors from the ramparts of the Arab castle. Children, hoping for the gift of a pen or a boiled sweet, emerge from the canvas coverings which act as front doors to their homes among the ruins. On the street stretching the width of the town, from the Nabataean Gate to the Gate of the Wind, women and children queue outside the bakery for the flat Arab bread they carry home piled high on their heads. Following TE Lawrence's route from Aqaba to Damascus, the signposts point left to Beirut and right to Baghdad. The abandoned, half-built houses lining the desert road belong to the Bedouin semi-nomads, who construct frames of stone and wood and fling canvas over to make the roof and walls. The families had moved on, taking their canvas with them to the next semi-structure on their route. Eventually they would return. Further on, the true Bedouin in their canvas tents signalled that in exchange for cigarettes we could take their photographs. At Palmyra, a man sat cross-legged on a hillside looking down on the ruins of the 2nd century city still known by locals as Tadmor (city of dates). Around him his sheep gazed, too, at us and at the temple columns, the monumental arch, the remains of the bath house and the rows of seating leading down to the orchestra of a theatre whose white stone turned pink in the setting sun. An oasis in the Syrian Desert, mentioned in tablets as early as the 19th century BC, Palmyra is there for us still, to clamber over, photograph and savour. Its guardians regard it without awe. Our coach - the only one on the vast site - raised dust and stones as it left the track and headed through the ruins to the entrance of the hypogeum; in the museum the curator invited us to touch the exhibits, to prove that the statue was of a blind man whose eyes definitely lacked pupils. Part of the Roman road which once stretched from Antioch to Aleppo remains, and the desire to step on it is irresistible. From nowhere appear small children, clutching gifts of wild flowers: purple and red poppies which flourish in the cracks between the blocks of stone. The blocks had been cut about a metre square by the Romans or their slaves and placed side by side on top of the desert scrub. Amazingly, the road is not straight. Olives grow in abundance, along with almonds and pistachios. But it is the olive and its oil which are special to the Syrians who, for 5,000 years, have understood its worth as a foodstuff and its usefulness - when boiled - for keeping enemies at bay. The guide at the Crac des Chevaliers pointed with delight to the many nooks and crannies from where boiling olive oil was dropped on intruders by the Crusader knights, intent on controlling trade from the ports to the Syrian interior. The Crac, dramatic in its domination of the only gap in a 250km mountain range stretching from Antakya in Turkey to Beirut, housed a garrison of 4,000 when the Crusaders built it in 1150. It is extremely well preserved and, apart from later additions in Frankish and Arabic styles, would probably be recognised today by one of the 4,000. Saint Simeon's monument to excessive piety, the pillar on which he lived, ate (once a week only, and then sparingly) and slept for 40 years, is crumbled and shortened by time, set among the ruins of the serene and beautiful Monastery of St Sergius and Bachus - a place in which to linger and not to ponder on how a man copes with the practicalities of living 13m above the earth, perched in the open on a pillar at best 1m square. In the old city at Damascus a young man approached and invited us to tea in a cafe where, he promised, a story-teller was due to read tales from One Thousand and One Nights. Inside, a large man wearing a gold turban and braided jacket sat on a high chair reading from an ancient parchment. The audience - all men, apart from me - listened intently, smoking their hookahs and drinking tea from small glasses. With no knowledge of Arabic, we were caught by the atmosphere as the story-teller's face, arms and voice dramatised events. The souks at Aleppo and Damascus cater for modern-day shoppers. Merchants of silk, silver, gold and semi-precious stones tempt you to their stands with offers of tea and a sit-down. Mostly, they want to practise their English and discuss the fortunes of Manchester United. Bartering is expected and one-third off the asking price is the usual compromise. Confronted with the present, it was hard to ignore the missiles on the border roads as we drove parallel with the Israeli border from Jordan into Syria, and we noticed that our guide preferred questions about the ancient world rather than the modern. Flying in at night on a Royal Jordanian aircraft, it was impossible to distinguish the lights of Aqaba from those of Eilat. The irony was not lost on us. Throughout the flight the route had been displayed in the cabin, using a map on which Israel did not exist.</p>

It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the  Council of Europe [CE] in safeguarding human rights and  promoting co-operation among relevant organizations such as the  United Nations and the CSCE. Because the purpose of our meeting  today is to exchange views on the conclusions reached by the  United Nations 48th General Assembly Third Committee, and  because I represent the only Council of Europe member state to  have gone before that committee recently, specifically with  regard to human rights, I feel compelled to draw your attention  to a few relevant points.    We consider the results of the 48th General Assembly to be  of  utmost importance both with regard to the human rights issue and  for the further development of mechanisms intended to ensure  compliance in this area. First, let me stress the importance of  the newly-established office of the High Commissioner on Human  Rights, who will enjoy the status of a UN Undersecretary  General, a post whose creation was adopted by consensus of the  184 UN member states. However useful this post will be, recent  developments regarding the use of human rights mechanisms have  demonstrated to us that there can never be enough mechanisms to  provide each country with the findings it may need to explain  its policies to the satisfaction of others.    I would add one caveat here, and that is that we do, indeed,  face challenges in integrating our alien population into  Estonian society. For instance, we have a scarcity of language  teachers and instructional materials. However, I would stress  that these difficulties of integration are organizational  matters that bear no relation to human rights.    To confuse these practical matters with the very serious  matter of human rights would be irresponsible.    My second point, regarding organizational politics, is no  less significant. I have in mind a serious case of abuse of the  existing UN human rights mechanisms which, unfortunately for all  of us here, appears to have set a precedent. As we are all  aware, despite a lack of findings by the Special Mission of the  UN to Estonia and regardless of the positive report of the  Secretary General in this matter, the UNGA [United Nations  General Assembly] recently adopted a resolution on the situation  of human rights in my country. I was pleased to read the  Secretariat Memorandum, prepared by the Directorate of Human  Rights and submitted to the distinguished participants of this  meeting, which deals with the UNGA resolution. To refresh your  memory, the Secretariat Memorandum stated that, and I quote,  "the brevity and wording of the text may indicate that this  question will no longer appear on the Assembly's agenda," end of  quote.    I would be delighted to share the Secretariat's optimism in  this matter. However, because the Memorandum only suggests that  the resolution's wording "may indicate" a certain result, I am  reluctant to do so.    Our delegation to the 48th UNGA did its best to negotiate  an acceptable wording, and we found it curious that we received  no support in our efforts. This leads me to the conclusion that  the Council of Europe member states represented here today  harbor doubts as to whether the reports of the UN and the  Council of Europe missions to investigate the human rights  situation in Estonia are, in fact, credible and objective  documents.    As you know, in the end we accepted the UNGA resolution  proposed by the delegation from the Russian Federation and we  conceded to the language because we understand that, for  domestic political reasons, Russia requires any such UN document  to establish the basis for possible future accusations. At the  same time, we know better than most that Russia's internal  political situation will not, in the foreseeable future, become  so stable that these unfounded accusations will stop. This is  especially clear after President Boris Yeltsin's New Year's  greeting to the Russian people, in which Mr. Yeltsin described  the defense of the rights of Russians living outside the  Russian Federation as being among his state's highest foreign  policy priorities.    In addition, Yeltsin's remarks last week at the US-Russian  summit, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's comments last  Monday, strongly suggest that the tone of these accusations in  the area of human rights is likely to become more, not less,  strident, and that their frequency will increase. I am  confident that you share our view that these accusations are  purely political in nature. In light of these developments, I  would ask you to consider whether we can allow for the  usurpation of this vital tool, that is, human rights  mechanisms, to indulge an individual state's political interests?    I would now turn to another problem, namely, the scarcity of  financial and human resources in the human rights field.  Estonia believes that the international community is in danger  of squandering those possibilities open to us. For instance, a  fact-finding mission of the UN that visited Estonia a year ago  reported no evidence of discrimination on ethnic or religious  grounds in Estonia. Unfortunately, however, the Resolution of  the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly on the human rights  situation in Latvia and Estonia did not address that report.  Are we so wealthy that we can justify dispatching costly  missions whose labours are not used? I think not.    My final point touches upon the reputation of the Council of  Europe as a whole, about which my country is concerned. It  seems to Estonia that the quiet acceptance by Council of Europe  member states of these well-orchestrated and unfounded  accusations against a fellow Council member-state by a  non-Council member calls into question the credibility of the  Council of Europe as a whole. I ask you, does this quiet  acceptance not undermine the very authority of the Council of  Europe to speak with one voice in matters of human rights?    I would remind you that in ten days' time, the UN Commission  on Human Rights will meet in Geneva to discuss human rights  issues. Because Estonia is not a member of that Commission, we  are put in the difficult position of not being able to defend  ourselves against the next round of accusations which are sure  to be raised at the forum.    Dear colleagues, if you share Estonia's concern about the  reputation of the Council of Europe, I appeal to those of you  represented on the UN Commission on Human Rights to stand up  against any resolutions based on unfounded accusations that may  be tabled against Estonia at the Geneva meeting.    I would conclude by saying that Estonia fondly cherishes the  hope that the human rights area will not suffer from an illness  that all too frequently afflicted the social sciences during the  Soviet period, namely, that if the facts do not verify the  theory, then it is too bad for the facts.    I thank you for your attention.</p>

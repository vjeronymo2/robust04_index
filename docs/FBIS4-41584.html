			<p>BFN     [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received Vladimir Kazimirov,  President Yeltsin's competent envoy on the Daghlyk Karabakh  problem, today. Aliyev and Kazimirov agreed that the cease-fire  is not being heeded in the western areas and that the existing  situation requires that the principles must be consolidated so  that a peaceful solution can be found to end the war.    Vladimir Kazimirov briefed Geydar Aliyev on CSCE Minsk Group  Chairman Jan Eliasson's visit to Moscow and his talks with  Vladimir [name indistinct], chairman of the Russian Federation  [word indistinct] and chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly, and Deputy Foreign Minister Adamyshin. He said that  the main issue that was discussed was the question of finding a  peaceful solution to resolve the dispute between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. He noted that the outcome of the talks indicated  that Russia and the CSCE maintained a similar approach. In view  of that, the sides must benefit from the political experience  and positions of Russia and the CSCE.    President Aliyev said that he highly assesses the talks Jan  Eliasson has held with the political circles in Russia. He  described the general agreement reached between the  representatives of the CSCE and Russia as a concrete step in the  effort to find a peaceful solution to the war.    Later, the sides discussed the possibility of benefiting  from  the experience of the Middle East countries and Turkey, which  are neighbors with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Geydar Aliyev noted  that the participation of the representatives of Iran and Turkey  in the effort to find a political solution to the problem is  essential. He also said that holding political consultations  with them is equally important.    State Adviser Vefa Gulizade and Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov attended the meeting.</p>

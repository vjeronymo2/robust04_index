			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEK TO IDENTIFY BODY FOUND IN IRVINE APARTMENT  </P> <P> Police continued to search for clues Saturday after the discovery of a badly  decomposed body in an Irvine apartment rented by a woman who has been missing  for two weeks.  </P> <P> Irvine police found the body Friday while investigating the disappearance of  Eileen Margaret Casey, 55, who had not appeared at work since Aug. 20.  </P> <P> An autopsy was conducted Saturday, but the body was so badly decomposed that  the identity can only be determined after a review of dental records, Police  Sgt. Jim Potts said. Moreover, authorities have yet to pinpoint the cause of  death, he said.  </P> <P> The body was found in the bedroom of Casey's unit at the Heritage Point  Apartments near the Santa Ana Freeway and Jeffrey Road after the woman's  co-workers told police she had failed to report for days at either of two jobs  she held, Potts said.  </P> <P> Police checked the apartment about a week after the woman was reported missing,  but did not discover a body during that search.  </P> <P> Casey apparently had shared the apartment with one or more teen-agers, and at  least one person was believed to have been living at the apartment during the  past week, police said.  </P> <P> But authorities would not release further details, saying the case was still  under investigation.  </P></p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government moves to boost freight switch from road SUCCESSIVE transport ministers have repeatedly said that they would like to see more freight switching from road to rail, but the words have rung particularly hollow in the last few weeks as hundreds of thousands of tonnes have gone in precisely the other direction. There have been fears that privatisation would not only continue, but accelerate this process. Yesterday, however, the government acted to sweeten the privatisation pill with a package of measures aimed at making the railways more attractive for freight. One of the main reasons for the recent switch away from rail has been the imposition of big increases in railfreight charges as part of an attempt by British Rail to get its freight operations into profit in readiness for privatisation. Under the new proposals, would-be private-sector freight train operators will start by negotiating a fee for the use of the tracks with Railtrack, the state-owned body that will own them. This will be a commercial negotiation based on what the train operator can afford. Railtrack's bottom price will be the marginal extra costs it incurs as a result of allowing a particular freight train to run on its tracks. Clearly it could not drop below that price without incurring a loss. But if the freight-train operator cannot afford even that price, and would otherwise send its freight by road, the government will be prepared to intervene by paying grants to the freight-train operator of up to 100 per cent of the track charges - in other words, giving it a completely free ride on the tracks. In addition, the government is planning to extend the existing freight facilities grants scheme, which allows the private sector to claim modest capital grants against the cost of building freight facilities such as private sidings. In future it will also be allowable against the cost of rolling stock. The government is also to open consultations on increasing the maximum allowable weight of lorries used in combined transport operations - that is, those using lorry trailers that load on to rail wagons for the long-distance part of their journeys. The limit would go up from 38 tonnes to 44 tonnes.</p>

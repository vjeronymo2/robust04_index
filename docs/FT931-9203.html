			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Job losses hit French middle classes THE professional classes have become the latest casualties of France's rising unemployment rate with nearly 133,000 salaried employees losing their jobs in 1992, according to the latest figures from Insee, the state statistics institute. The overall number of people without jobs in France rose by 5 per cent to 2.98m last year. The worst affected areas of the economy, according to Insee, were construction and manufacturing. Until recently, professional people were relatively immune from joblessness. The number of salaried employees in France rose by 1.1 per cent in 1990 and fell by just 0.7 per cent in 1991. But the ranks of salaried employees fell by 0.9 per cent to 14.74m in 1992, with the rate of job losses accelerating as the year progressed. Unemployment is one of the main political problems facing France's ruling Socialist party in the run-up to next month's legislative elections. Fears of joblessness among salaried employees could cause additional problems for the Socialists, who have traditionally enjoyed support from professional workers such as teachers, social service workers and the media. The government has recently tried to stem the tide of manufacturing job losses with its controversial attempts to stop Hoover, the US vacuum cleaner company, from closing its Dijon factory and Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, from relocating a laboratory at Boussens in south-west France. Meanwhile Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister, yesterday met representatives of French industry and unions in Paris in order to discuss his proposals for pension reform. Mr Rene Teulade, minister for social affairs, will this week present plans to the cabinet for a FFr100m (Pounds 12.3m) guarantee fund to plug the rising pension budget deficit. The fund, financed by the proceeds of the privatisation programme, represents a compromise on Mr Beregovoy's earlier hopes of introducing private pensions to supplement the existing state schemes. The centre-right coalition, firm favourites to win the March poll, has included plans for private pensions in their election manifesto.</p>

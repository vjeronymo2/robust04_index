			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese truck makers sign supply agreement Three Japanese truck makers have agreed to supply each other with trucks, a significant step in the restructuring of Japan's automobile industry. Nissan, Nissan Diesel and Isuzu will provide each other with products on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis beginning next summer, the companies said. Under the agreement, Nissan will supply Isuzu with 6,000 vans and 3,000 one-tonne trucks annually, which Isuzu will market under its own brands. Isuzu, in its first deal to supply a competitor with trucks on an OEM basis, will supply Nissan and Nissan Diesel with 14,000 units of its two-to three-tonne truck, which the Nissan companies will sell under different brands. The deal aims to reduce development costs in order to meet rising competition in the Japanese truck market, Isuzu said. The truck makers are particularly concerned that tougher vehicle exhaust rules will add substantially to development costs. Sharing development costs has become an important theme for many Japanese carmakers. Competition in the domestic truck market is expected to remain intense as demand is not likely to rise significantly in the near future. All three companies have come under severe pressure in Japan's slumping automobile market. In the year to March 31, Isuzu saw total vehicle sales fall nearly 20 per cent, Nissan Diesel 13 per cent and Nissan 10 per cent.</p>

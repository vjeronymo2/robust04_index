			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE PLANNERS  </P> <P> Builder bashing is booming in the Los Angeles Times, thanks to your recent  series of duplicative stories about the Laguna Niguel open-space controversy,  as well as other recent articles and editorials concerning local public  officials doing horrible things such as golfing with builders.  </P> <P> Specifically, we are writing in response to your editorial titled "County  Planning -- Pattern of Blunders (Aug. 5)," in which you manage to attack the  county's planning staff, the Planning Commission, City Council members,  developers and the Orange County development planning process itself.  </P> <P> The approval process for building homes in Orange County is cumbersome and  subject to excruciating and exacting scrutiny. It is a process which entails  many public hearings and compromises. It is totally open to the public and to  every private interest group that may want to comment on a proposed development  project.  </P> <P> This process is the crucible for discussions and deciding the proper balance  between environmental and economic issues; for parks and open-space issues; for  transportation and low-density issues; for kangaroo rats and humans. In this  process, projects are often rejected, and densities frequently reduced. All of  these decisions directly impact the availability of all varieties of housing  for residents of our county and region.  </P> <P> The process includes a tremendous amount of interaction between people --  whether they are government officials, neighbors, consultants or builders.  </P> <P> We think it works for Orange County. Look around you. Orange County is  world-renowned as a place to live and work and play. It didn't happen that way  by accident. It happened because of the process, because of thousands of  dedicated men and women working within that process to produce homes, jobs, and  recreation.  </P> <P> Is the process perfect? Of course not. Some people are bunglers and some people  are dishonest. But by and large, the process, and the people involved, have  done a pretty good job in helping Orange County respond to the human and social  needs of its residents.  </P> <P> CHRISTINE D. REED  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Building Industry Assn.  </P> <P> of Southern California Inc.  </P> <P> Orange County Region  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S SON AND BAILOUTS OF FAILED SAVINGS AND LOANS  </P> <P> So now we're supposed to weep and moan with George and Barbara Bush as they  agonize over the fate of their son Neil and his troubles with the Silverado  Banking, Savings &amp; Loan ("Bush Discloses Anguish Over Son's Troubles,"  front page, July 12). What about weeping for the taxpayers who have to shell  out $150 billion (or is up to $300 billion now? Or $600 billion? Or a  trillion?) to bail out the savings and loan industry?  </P> <P> What about those depositors who lost thousands and thousand of extra dollars  when the Silverado investigation was postponed so it would fall after the 1988  presidential election?  </P> <P> Now we all know, of course, that George Bush was out of the loop on that  decision, just as all know he was out of the loop on Iran-Contra, right? Want  to know what's happening? Just read George's lips. And keep weeping for poor  Neil.  </P> <P> ROB SULLIVAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Litton subsidiary buys back own shares Litton Industries' oil services subsidiary is to pay Dollars 558m to buy back a block of its own shares as part of a series of measures to shape it as a free-standing company. Litton said its Western Atlas subsidiary will pay Dollars 358m in cash and Dollars 200m in seven-year notes to buy the 29.5 per cent of the subsidiary's shares held by Dresser, another oil services company. Western Atlas, which derives 60 per cent of its annual Dollars 2bn sales from oil services and the rest from industrial automation, is expected to be spun off before the end of the year. Litton shareholders will receive one share in the new company for each Litton share they own. Litton also said it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 172m in the current quarter to reflect the accelerated depreciation of some of Western Atlas' assets. The subsidiary specialises in the use of information technology in exploration and drilling operations and demand for the newest technology had been stronger than expected, forcing the accelerated write-downs of older equipment. Mr Alton Brann, president and chief executive, said the purchase from Dresser would allow both Litton and Dresser to concentrate their investments on their core businesses. Mr John Murphy, chairman and chief executive of Dresser, said the deal would give his company 'greater liquidity and flexibility'. Dresser, which said it would record a Dollars 150m after-tax profit on the sale, is in the process of completing an all-share takeover of another oil services company, Baroid, in a deal currently valued at Dollars 750m.</p>

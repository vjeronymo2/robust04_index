			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Savings found on EC car sales SUBSTANTIAL savings can be achieved by private motorists importing a new car from some continental European markets rather than purchasing in the UK according to Which?, the Consumers Association magazine. After research among car dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands the magazine claims that savings of up to Pounds 2,131 could be made on the UK price of a Ford Fiesta 1.3iLX. Price quotes made by two Audi dealers offered a saving of Pounds 2,176 over the UK price of an Audi 80. However, the magazine claims that some carmakers are continuing to flout European law by preventing British motorists from taking advantage of lower prices in certain other EC countries. Carmakers are legally required to supply right-hand drive cars to dealers in different EC countries for export to the UK, but Which? claims that dealers often quote unrealistic prices or unreasonably long delivery times. Researchers from Which? contacted 40 dealers in Belgium and Holland (10 each from Ford, Fiat, Audi and Rover) in June. Of the dealers, according to the magazine: 29 could not give a price for the car requested. 14 said it was impossible to buy a right-hand drive model. One said it was not allowed to sell for export to the UK. One wanted to charge Pounds 1,000 more than the local left-hand drive price for a right-hand drive version. Ford said yesterday it had issued a guide to every salesman in the EC covering the procedure for the supply of cars to non-resident EC customers. It was now reconfirming this advice.</p>

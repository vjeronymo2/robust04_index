			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Granada Group The Granada recovery bandwagon rumbles on. A 28 per cent improvement in underlying pre-tax interim profits on sales up less than 1 per cent continues to reflect the bracing effects of Granada's re-invigorated management. Granada's rental activities, which represent about half group profits, may be slowly shrinking but they remain highly cash generative - especially since depreciation has overtaken capital expenditure. Catering, television, and even computer services continue on their upward trend. But there are blemishes. Locking into interest rates of 12 per cent a few years back is a minor embarrassment. Losing the chance to buy WH Smith's stake in Yorkshire Television may prove a more serious setback, especially if the government really does relax the ITV franchise rules. Granada's shares have bounced strongly as Mr Gerry Robinson has strengthened his grip on the business. Continued outperformance will increasingly depend on successful expansion of turnover. The acquisition of Sutcliffe should guarantee satisfactory progress for at least a year or two. Thereafter, the prospects grow more opaque. Still, Granada is proving it has the happy habit of generating cash and the management skill to apply it productively. That is a rare enough combination and should secure Granada's premium rating over the longer run, especially if BSkyB or the National Lottery turn up trumps.</p>

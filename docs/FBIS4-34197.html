			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 15 Jun (NA) -- Argentine  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella censured Fidel Castro in  Cartagena today over the latter's speech during the inauguration  of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and  governments. He said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape  because its policies are very bad."    Di Tella confirmed the possibility of a personal meeting  between President Carlos Menem and Castro. He added, however,  that "conditions are not right" following the harsh speech by  Castro yesterday.    Di Tella said: "Yesterday, in the boat (that transported the  presidents to a luncheon) they were together and they chatted.  The same thing may happen again." Di Tella quickly added,  however, that a formal meeting is unlikely because conditions  are not right. "Castro's position does not encourage anyone to  speak seriously," the minister said    Di Tella talked with Argentine journalists covering the  summit at this city's convention center at noon today. He  recognized that the Argentine Government felt "very bad" about  Castro's speech at the end of the ceremony yesterday.    Foreign Minister Di Tella, who does not hide his deep  differences with Castro, said: "To say Cuba is being persecuted  and that their entire situation is the consequence of U.S.  persecution is like living on the moon."    Di Tella said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape because  its policies are very bad." The minister added: "The U.S.  embargo, which the Cubans call a blockade, prevents them from  purchasing from the United States, but not from Canada, Mexico,  or Europe."    Regarding the situation on the island Di Tella said: "Their  economy is a mess because of their policy that the state  directs, contracts, and rations everything."    Di Tella stressed: "Cuba needs a qualitative change toward  democracy and a change toward a market economy -- which started  to appear but too timidly -- because the situation is on fire."    He said: "There is no point in talking about Cuba's entry  into the Inter-American system until these changes take place.  We expect Cuba to join the system later. I hope Castro will  introduce those changes; if not, I think the situation will end  dramatically."    The foreign minister said: "We do not want Cuba to be  reincorporated into the OAS before it accepts democracy,"  because the organization "is a democratic club."    Di Tella thus answered criticism by Castro against his  counterparts on 7 June for not pronouncing "a single word  against the United States' criminal blockade" and for not  reiterating the demand to democratize the island. [sentence as  received]    "We respect your opinion and you should respect our  opinion,"  said Castro during an impromptu speech last night when answering  the insistent call of various presidents, among them the  Argentine president, to introduce democracy in Cuba.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Engines used in recreational vehicles which are defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows: (1) The engine has no installed speed governor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the engine's rated speed is greater than or equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 RPM; (3) the engine is not used for the propulsion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a marine vessel; and (4) the engine does not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this regulation. Recreational vehicles include: All- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terrain vehicles, off-road motorcycles, snowmobiles, and go- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> karts. These engines are being excluded for several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons: First, the duty cycle is completely different from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most small SI engine applications. These engines experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highly transient operation and likely will require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completely different test procedures for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control testing. Second, they are designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emphasize power output; thus, they are typically designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run at much higher RPMs than other small SI engines. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invites comments on other criteria which may be utilized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defining the class of nonroad engines which propel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recreational vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Exclusions and Exemptions to Today's Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 203(b)(1) of the CAA, the Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing additional categories of exemptions from new small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine regulation similar to the exclusions and exemptions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist for on-highway engines and that have been proposed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad large CI engine rule. These include exemptions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, or for reasons of national security. Exemptions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be obtained either categorically, that is without application to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator, or by submitting a written application to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. Export exemptions and manufacturer-owned engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions would be granted without application. Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions, display exemptions, and national security exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be obtained by application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exclusions from this regulation include nonroad engines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are used solely for competition or for combat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exemptions and exclusions are justified in these cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the sources are limited in number or scope, so minimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental harm results; the particular use of the source is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to further air quality research; and/or the exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is vital to the security of the nation. (See 39 FR 10601, March  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21, 1974.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Effective Date for Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing that certification of new small SI engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begin in 1996. Manufacturers of engines produced on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 1, 1996, would be required to obtain from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator a certificate of conformity covering the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family. The certificate would be obtained prior to selling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States the new engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the small SI engines affected by this proposal include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a broad range of engine types, EPA believes that the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date for the proposed standards is reasonable and technologically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible and that engine manufacturers will be able to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations within the short lead time provided under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. This issue is discussed, in detail, in ``V.I. Effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date.'' Further, an August 1, 1996 effective date is consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Congressional mandate found in section 213(c) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act which requires that, ``Standards *&blank;*&blank;* shall take effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the earliest possible date considering lead time necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit the development and application of the requisite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology *&blank;*&blank;*'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Emission Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 213(a)(3) of the CAA states that nonroad emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* shall achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievable through the application of technology which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator determines will be available for the engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or vehicles to which such standards apply, giving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology within the period of time available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and to noise, energy, and safety factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the application of such technology. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining what degree of reduction will be available, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator shall first consider standards equivalent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringency to standards for comparable motor vehicles or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines (if any) regulated under section 7521 of this title,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking into account the technological feasibility, costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety, noise, and energy factors associated with achieving,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate, standards of such stringency and lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The emission standards being proposed for this Phase 1 small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine regulation are listed in Table 1 in the Overview Section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed emission standards result in significant emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the near term while work is going on to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent Phase 2 standards and while manufacturers work to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design engines and equipment capable of meeting lower standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a later date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes these proposed emission standards represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the greatest emission reductions achievable given the short lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time prior to this rule's effective date and the technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available during this period. Requiring more stringent Phase 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards than those proposed today would necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay implementation of new small SI engine standards by at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two years. This additional lead time would be needed to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers time to redesign engines and equipment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate requirements of more sophisticated technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air quality benefits which will accrue under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards are large and meet the statutory criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad standards required by the CAA. These benefits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in Section VI of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

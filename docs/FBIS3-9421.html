			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 23 Mar (TANJUG)--Following Serb-Croat talks in  Zagreb, Slobodan Jarcevic, minister of foreign affairs of the  republic of Serb Krajina, described in a statement to TANJUG the  fact that both sides had given guarantees that they would not  try to resolve their problems on the battlefield as the most  important outcome of the talks.    Both Krajina and Croatia lodged guarantees to this effect  with the mediators: Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy  Churkin; U.S. Ambassador in Zagreb Peter Galbraith; and Kai Aide  and Geert Ahrens, cochairmen of the Conference on Former  Yugoslavia.    Jarcevic said that there was a possibility that next  Tuesday,  29 March, an agreement would be signed, but only on an end to  clashes and hostilities. He described this as the main goal of  the negotiations. All other issues of common interest will be  put on the agenda later.    He said that no pressure was put on either of the sides  during the negotiations and that the mediators were there to  help, but with a clear message that the world had had enough of  war and bloodshed.    The mediators stressed that it was up to the opposing sides  to decide on how to regulate their future relations, but this is  an issue for political negotiations and was not mentioned in  Zagreb, Jarcevic said.</p>

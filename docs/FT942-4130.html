			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / BT union seeks flat-rate rise The National Communications Union, the main union at British Telecommunications, has submitted a pay claim for a flat-rate increase of Pounds 15 a week. BT has already made an opening offer to the union based on a percentage rise. At its annual conference in Blackpool the union continued its opposition to BT's Customer Service Improvement Programme, which is designed to introduce more flexible working hours. The union insists that weekend working must continue to attract overtime rates. The union also overwhelmingly approved a merger with the postal workers' union, the Union of Communication Workers.</p>

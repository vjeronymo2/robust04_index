			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Tereshchenko report: "Will Fascism and Erotica </F> Get By?"]    [Excerpt] The Russian Federation Committee for the Press  (Roskompechat) has set about working to expose newspapers of  fascist orientation published in this country, Roskompechat  Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov reported to INTERFAX. In his  words "it is essential to close off the routes by which these  publications appear and, apart from this, establish who is  financing and distributing them."    S. Gryzunov noted that Roskompechat is enlisting  representatives of the Moscow Antifascist Committee,  journalists, as well as foreign diplomats from countries where  the problem of neofascism has been encountered, in its work to  expose papers of fascist orientation.    "It is essential for us to work out our approach to state  policy on this kind of publication," he said. He also noted  that after those papers of fascist orientation existing in  Russia have been exposed, a ban will be imposed on the  publication of at least some of them.    The mayor of Moscow has banned the sale of erotic literature  on the capital's streets, having given orders to immediately  regulate the distribution of such products. Yu. Luzhkov has  given prefects one month to identify the commercial outlets on  each's territory which might be used to sell these particular  goods. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Pole position for growth - Why Antarctic explorers make tracks for Tetbury When things are at a low ebb in the workshop, the thoughts of Richard Olivier and Roger Daynes turn to the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge, where one of their Nansen sleds lives, much admired, in retirement. It is the veteran of a 3,700-mile international trans-Antarctic dog sled expedition in 1989-90 - the longest dog sled journey ever made. Snowsled, the company Olivier and Daynes own jointly, supplied the sled, one of three used by the six-man team. The other two were American Greenland-type sleds. When, in mid-transit, the American sleds broke up on the crevasse-riven terrain, Snowsled was asked to replace it with another of its Nansen models. 'Our sleds gave no problem and we were naturally very pleased,' said Daynes, a former British Antarctic Survey base commander. Daynes, 52, and Olivier, 44, have been making sleds and other expedition equipment since 1987. The irony is that if they had continued only making sleds they would probably not be in business now. Olivier, a joiner and outdoor pursuits enthusiast, and Daynes met in 1986. Initially, Daynes continued running his carpentry business in North Wales, commuting for part of the week to help Olivier in his Gloucestershire workshop. An order worth Pounds 9,000 from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1987 for two complete Nansen sleds, 130 bridges and many components, convinced the two that their future lay in making sleds together. Later the same year, Daynes moved house and joined Olivier in his workshop - a converted 18th-century barn on Prince Charles's estate at Highgrove House near Tetbury. 'BAS was bowled over by the workmanship in our Nansen sledges,' said Olivier. 'They particularly liked the strength, the traditional lashings, and the way we had adapted a 3,000-year-old design that displays great flexibility and strength when pulled at up to 20mph by snowmobile.' 'Neither of us was really a businessman,' Olivier said. 'We could not see that, although we continued to get orders for very high specification sleds, we were not going to make money unless we diversified.' By 1989, turnover had reached Pounds 50,000, but after the two had drawn Pounds 10,000 each in wages they found there was no profit at the end of the year. 'We had an annual order from BAS and also from its American equivalent - about Pounds 30,000 in total,' Daynes said. 'We also had a useful order from the sponsors of the 1989 International Trans-Antarctic Expedition for 40 mini-Nansen sledges at Pounds 400 a time, for sale in stores in the US. But still we were struggling to keep going. 'We started to complement the sleds by making glass fibre pulks (lightweight, kit-carrying sleds), but in 1989-90 the business was still making no profit and we both drew no wages.' In 1991, the pair formed a limited company. They borrowed Pounds 20,000 from Lloyds Bank under a small business loan guarantee scheme and a further Pounds 20,000 from friends, all of whom have a share option in the company. They also run a Pounds 15,000 Lloyds overdraft. The money helped them to build up stock and to begin trading seriously in the Ventile high-performance clothing they had been experimenting with for the past two years. Ventile is a highly resilient cotton fabric. During the second world war, it was found to increase greatly the life expectancy of pilots who had been shot down over the sea. Early in 1993, Snowsled took on two women full-time to make Ventile clothes. Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Mike Stroud wore Snowsled Ventile clothing crossing the Antarctic on foot that year. The clothing has the potential for volume production and it was while investigating this that the two felt out of their depth. Early in 1994 they commissioned a marketing survey for Pounds 1,000. 'Although much of it told us things we already knew, it made it clear where our efforts were best placed,' said Olivier. Unfortunately, the report urged them to give up manufacturing the dog touring and racing sleds they had enjoyed making since 1988. 'We think they are lovely creations. But we sell them in very small numbers, so now our policy is to make them only to order,' Olivier said. The other main recommendation of the survey was to place far greater emphasis on marketing - in which they knew they had few skills. 'Early this year we employed a man with a great deal of marketing experience to work for us for three days a month at a fee of Pounds 1,000,' Olivier said. 'After two months he came up with nothing, so we lent on him. He was hurt to the quick and left. We felt very relieved.' Despite a year in which cutbacks in their national Antarctic surveys have meant smaller sled orders from the British and American governments, Snowsled has sold equipment to Japan and Brazil. However it has been a good year for the Ventile clothing, which is likely to account for between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of this year's expected turnover of Pounds 150,000. The two are also optimistic about the future of two survival and protection systems - a vacuum mattress stretcher for spinal injuries and a lightweight rescue stretcher - in which they have invested much time. The vacuum mattress is used by 15 of the 40 UK mountain rescue teams. 'We see huge potential, but we are spread so thinly between manufacturing, sales and a great deal of R and D that we have no time for marketing these two products,' Olivier said. 'We are open to offers from anybody who could take on the marketing of all our products, and at the same time buy into the business. But it would have to be the right person.'

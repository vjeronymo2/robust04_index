			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudi oil minister fails to turn up at Opec summit MR HISHAM NAZER, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, yesterday failed to turn up at the ministerial summit of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna in a move which surprised and disconcerted other delegations, but which the Saudis said signalled no change in the Kingdom's oil policy. A Saudi delegate said that Mr Nazer was simply 'a little bit exhausted' after an intensive series of overseas meetings. Although some oil analysts suggested that Mr Nazer's absence, his first from an Opec meeting since he replaced Sheikh Yamani as the kingdom's oil minister in 1987, could be interpreted as a 'slight' towards delegations favouring a higher-price Opec policy, diplomats in Riyadh who met Mr Nazer yesterday said they believed he may genuinely have been over-tired. The diplomats said that there was no indication that Mr Nazer's post as oil minister was threatened, or that his absence indicated a shift in oil policy from Riyadh. They said he had appeared intent on making the trip to Vienna when they met him, but that 'he had no appetite for the journey'. Mr Nazer, they said, had spent 25 hours without sleep during talks late last week in Kuwait between EC ministers and those of the Gulf Co-operation Council on which the EC's proposed carbon tax was high on the agenda. Saudi Arabia is leading an Opec lobby against the imposition of such a tax. Mr Nazer's place at the summit was taken by Mr Fayez Badr, a minister of state with responsibility for the Saudi Ports Authority and a man with no clear oil expertise. Saudi Arabia has widely flagged before the Opec summit, which begins in earnest today, that it would be seeking a 1m barrels a day rise in the cartel's production ceiling for the third quarter from the 22.98m b/d agreed for the second in February. Iran, among several other delegations, opposes such a move and would prefer to see Opec restrain output to force prices towards the cartel's formal reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, told reporters curtly yesterday: 'I want a cut in the ceiling.' Oil analysts suggested that Mr Agazadeh may have simply been stating an opening bargaining position for the talks and that a cut in the February ceiling was unlikely. But many equally suggested that Mr Nazer's absence might indicate that Saudi Arabia would be likely to press less forcefully its argument for a rise in the ceiling for the third quarter and that, despite its opening position, the Kingdom may settle for a roll-over of the present ceiling. Saudi Arabia estimates the call on Opec crude to reach 24.2m b/d for the third quarter, but actual production for the second has neared 23.5m b/d rather than the nominal February figure, due largely to Kuwait's accelerated output and a Saudi refusal to cut production below 8m b/d - as was notionally allocated.</p>

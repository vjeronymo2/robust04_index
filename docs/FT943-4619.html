			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Canny Menem wins second shot: But new constitution could backfire against the president Argentina's new constitution is almost tailor-made to suit the interests of two men - President Carlos Menem and his old rival, Mr Raul Alfonsn, the opposition Radical party leader and former president. They negotiated in secret a package of constitutional amendments in which Mr Alfonsn supported Mr Menem's central objective - lifting a constitutional ban on successive presidential terms - in exchange for greater powers for the opposition, the legislature and the judiciary. Mr Menem is now free to stand for re-election to a second, four-year, term in May 1995. However, the reforms which came into force last month, are not popular. Mr Rosendo Fraga, a pollster and political commentator, says few people believe the reforms are essential. 'The only reason for reform is Menem's re-election. The other clauses are only there to justify this.' Mr Menem's positive image has now dropped below 40 per cent from over 50 per cent last December. This has benefited the Frente Grande, an alliance of left-wing parties, ecologists and disaffected Peronists and Radicals whose support has grown strongly through opposition to the reforms and Mr Menem's re-election. Its growth threatens the balance of interests the Radicals and Mr Menem's Peronist party wrote so carefully into the new constitution. Take the new election rules. In future, the president will be elected directly - replacing the old US-style electoral college. Elections will be held in two rounds, unless the winner takes at least 45 per cent of the vote first time around. Alternatively, the leading candidate would win with only 40 per cent of the votes if the runner-up is more than 10 percentage points behind. This was designed to help the Peronist party, which normally polls over 40 per cent of the vote. But unless his image improves, Mr Menem could have to go through a bruising second-round vote, and his likeliest contender would not be a Radical, but Mr Carlos 'Chacho' Alvarez, the Frente's telegenic leader, who boasts a rating of 24 per cent. The new constitution adopts a semi-parliamentary form of government which Mr Alfonsn hopes will give Congress greater leverage over the government. Under the new rules, the president will appoint a cabinet chief, similar to a prime minister, to run the government's day to day business. Congress will be able to sack the cabinet chief with a simple majority in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The difficulty with this innovation is that Mr Menem has already said he will not cede fundamental presidential powers. The cabinet chief could therefore become either an irrelevance or a source of friction between the president and Congress. Mr Alfonsn also demanded that the 48-member Senate be increased by half, with the new members coming from the opposition parties in each of Argentina's 23 provinces and the federal district of Buenos Aires. In addition, Congress gains new powers to reject presidential decrees, control the federal audit office and participate in running the judiciary. A new system allowing congressional committees to legislate virtually independent of the floor of the Senate or Chamber of Deputies is intended to increase the snail's pace of lawmaking. However, the ruling Peronists dominate both chambers of Congress, so it is debatable how effective these added powers will be. Furthermore, the influential congressional committees could fall further under the sway of special interest groups. The constitution includes new direct democracy clauses. Anyone who gathers the signatures of at least 3 per cent of the electorate can directly submit a bill to Congress. Congress can also call referenda, which if approved, cannot be vetoed by the president. The president can also call a referendum, although its result is not binding. The courts also win greater independence. Mr Menem's domination of the judiciary - by packing the Supreme Court, or picking party hacks as judges - is deeply unpopular. A new independent council of magistrates comprising politicians, lawyers, academics and eminent persons will take over administrative control of the courts from the Supreme Court and select judges. The council's detailed workings will be decided by a congressional law, which the Peronists will be sure to construct as liberally as possible. There is always the danger this body will be hijacked by the parties, undermining its effectiveness. The governors of Argentina's 23 provinces have also won important new rights, especially over sharing federal taxes. At the moment, a complicated formula regulates sharing of federal tax revenues with the provinces. The governors will probably get more money and win greater independence from Buenos Aires, strengthening them in their battle with Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, who demands they reform their oversized and corrupt public sectors. Argentinians have followed the reform process with little interest. Many people think that instead of rewriting the constitution - this is the third reform since 1949 - the politicians should first learn to observe the original 1853 constitution.</p>

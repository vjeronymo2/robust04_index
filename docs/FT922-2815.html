			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Adaptability of Nafta disputes procedure in doubt: Mexico's legal system could hinder the introduction of a settlement process THE US and Canada have resolved some of their thorniest trade rows with maximum speed and minimum political fall-out through the disputes settlement process of their free trade agreement (FTA). The fact that many of the decisions have favoured Canada has been been one of the Mulroney government's few weapons against his many FTA critics. So successful is the settlement process that Mexico has made the inclusion of a similar mechanism one of its key objectives in the creation of a North American free trade area (Nafta). There is concern, however, that the rules may not work as well if and when they are grafted on to a legal system as different as Mexico's. These fears range from Mexico's rudimentary standards of judicial investigation to the ability of its Civil Law code to enforce a binding decision handed down by an international tribunal. Administrative law governing the work of government agencies is far less developed in Mexico than in the US or Canada. On a more practical level, there are doubts whether Mexico can muster a sufficiently experienced pool of trade experts to serve on the binational panels which are the cornerstone of the FTA system. The US has a list of 50 people from which the panellists are drawn. Even the Canadians have a pool only half as big. A senior Canadian negotiator says both Washington and Ottawa still need to be satisfied that the Mexican system can adapt. A US official is more sanguine, however. 'All it needs is the will to make it work,' he says. The FTA provides for two types of review procedure, known as Chapter 18 and Chapter 19 panels. In each case the panels consist of five members. Two are chosen by each country, and the fifth by mutual agreement (sometimes simply by drawing a name from a hat). The panellists themselves choose a chairman. 'Arguing before a panel, rather than a single judge, is more challenging and more rewarding,' says Mr William Ince of the Washington legal firm Cameron &amp; Hornbostel, who has appeared before about a dozen FTA panels. Chapter 18 panels are used to adjudicate long-running, general disputes, usually with strong political overtones. Short, fixed periods are set for various stages of the process, with automatic triggers to discourage delaying tactics by either government. Chapter 19 panels have a narrower focus. They act in place of domestic courts to review specific anti-dumping and countervailing duty complaints. Again, time limits are set out for each stage of the process, with a maximum of 315 days between the date of a request for a review and a panel's decision. The FTA also provides for an 'extraordinary challenge committee' comprising three judges, as a last resort and a safeguard against impropriety or gross error. All but three of the two dozen or so disputes referred to binational panels since the FTA came into force in 1989 have been adjudicated under Chapter 19. An extraordinary challenge committee has reviewed - and thrown out - only one case, involving a US complaint against a panel finding on pork imports from Canada. The most recent Chapter 18 decision, handed down in the second week of June, touched on the highly contentious subject of rules of origin for cars assembled by Japanese-owned plants in Canada. A North American content of 50 per cent is required for these vehicles to qualify for duty-free access to the US, but Ottawa and Washington have disagreed on which costs can be included in the calculation. The panel unanimously supported Canada's argument that the Cami factory in south-west Ontario, jointly owned by General Motors and Suzuki, can include non-mortgage interest payments in calculating North American content. Chapter 19 panels have dealt with products ranging from raspberries and beer, to steel rails and induction motors. Some have dealt with the same issue more than once. For instance, a Canadian supplier of parts for road-paving equipment challenged the Department of Commerce's implementation of a 1991 panel ruling which called on the department to re-examine its calculation of a dumping margin. Another panel recently demanded that the department reconsider some of the evidence within the next two months. The two governments are on the verge of implementing revised rules of procedure for Chapter 19 panels. One planned change which is likely to please the Mexicans, should they join, is a requirement for a 'briefing' stage in the process, where parties must provide panellists with full details of case law in their countries pertaining to the issue being reviewed. Much of the panels' work is already done through telephone conference calls. Views differ on the wider contribution which the FTA mechanism may be making to international trade. Prof Andreas Lowenfeld, of New York University's School of Law, says that 'the notion that there is an FTA jurisprudence developing is not quite right'. But he adds that administrative agencies, such as the US International Trade Commission, 'are seeing that they have to be more precise and less sloppy'. Prof Lowenfeld says that the FTA panels generally examine arguments more carefully than domestic US trade tribunals. Mr Ince, on the other hand, observes that the binational reviews have 'regrettably' brought little improvement in the standard of investigations by the US Commerce Department and the ITC. 'We have invoked the panel process in more than one case where adherence to agency regulations or standard practice would have avoided the necessity for an appeal,' he says. Further articles in a series on Nafta will appear in the coming weeks.</p>

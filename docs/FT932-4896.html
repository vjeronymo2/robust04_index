			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Telecommunications Of the two 'deals of the century' BT did with MCI last week, only one makes a great deal of sense. The joint venture in international private networks and value-added services is a reasonable, if limited, initiative to capture the business of large multinationals. Even here, however, the rush towards setting up alliances seems well in advance of a real market opportunity, and is reminiscent of the banks' charge into the securities business. BT's purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI is the really worrying part of the transaction. It is a little odd that the deal comes after the bullish swirl surrounding MCI has pushed the share price from around Dollars 35 to over Dollars 50 this year. BT's defence is that it needs the stake to cement its relationship with MCI, but Dollars 4.3bn seems a high price for security. Attention has also focused on AT&amp;T's possible response. Short of the unlikely and petulant course of pulling out of the deal to buy McCaw, AT&amp;T is somewhat hamstrung. There has been speculation that AT&amp;T might buy Vodafone or Mercury from Cable &amp; Wireless. With Bell Canada a partner in Mercury, a deal there looks improbable. Buying Vodafone would be expensive, even for AT&amp;T, and its gearing would be stretched even further. Indeed, as US telecoms companies have average gearing of 85 per cent, it is notable that BT will still only have gearing of 30 per cent after the MCI deal is completed. That leaves open the prospect of continuing good dividend growth or further acquisitions of minority stakes in other telecoms companies at premium prices. Since BT has not yet shaken off the latter habit, it may expect scepticism until it makes one of these deals really work.</p>

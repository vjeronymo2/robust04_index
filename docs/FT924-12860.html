			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Five years on, the crash still echoes / A look at the long-term effects of the October 1987 fall in share prices across the world On October 19, 1987, share prices crashed around the world, leading to fears of a second great depression. Governments eased monetary policy to prevent turmoil in the financial markets pushing the real economy into slump - a policy that contributed, in the UK at least, to rapidly-accelerating inflation and then, in reaction, to the monetary squeeze that produced the present recession. As stock markets fell, they were responding in part to the rise in long-term interest rates earlier in the year. That rise, with the equity market's uncertainty, ended the 1980s' upward spiral of asset prices, and caused problems for creatively-financed, acquisitive companies. Some did not survive the next few years. In the UK, for example, British &amp; Commonwealth, Polly Peck, Coloroll and Maxwell Communication fell victim as the new climate revealed weaknesses the 1980s' asset-inflation had concealed. The charts show that in real terms the four leading stock markets are no higher than - and in Japan and the UK, well below - their pre-1987 levels. The table lists the best and worst performing large shares during the crash period, and what has happened since. The 'crash change' column shows the percentage change in a company's shares from the day before the crash to the market's trough; the second column shows the change in the shares from before the crash to now. Comparing the two columns shows the market's nose for winners and losers: shares which suffered most during the crash have by and large done poorly since, with a few striking exceptions, such as JP Morgan, Disney, RTZ, and MAN. Those which fell by least during the crash period have usually continued to outperform the market.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                    US: BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           Crash          Pre-crash                          change %        to date %  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Union Carbide             -13.8             +8.1 Texaco                    -14.5            +63.8 Merck                     -15.9           +107.6 Philip Morris             -16.7           +201.6 Chevron                   -17.3            +47.4  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Worst performers  ------------------------------------------------------------------- JP Morgan                 -37.1            +40.2 Westinghouse              -36.1            -57.9 Walt Disney               -33.8           +105.0 Goodyear                  -33.6             -1.9 Allied Signal             -33.4            +27.7  -------------------------------------------------------------------                     UK: BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           Crash          Pre-crash                          change %        to date %  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Assd.

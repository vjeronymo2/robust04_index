			<p>BFN     [Text] Let us point out that the new, unofficial minister  of foreign affairs, attorney... [pauses] Mr. Charles David, who  was appointed this week by the military regime in  Port-au-Prince, has refused to resign from his post as  journalist of the daily LA PRESSE in Montreal, according to the  newspaper's management.    The appointment of Mr. David, 53, to a government not  recognized by Ottawa, has led the Canadian Government to freeze  his Canadian assets. LA PRESSE, which has employed him for 22  years as journalist in charge of international issues, cannot  dismiss him for the moment. Under the provisions of the  newspaper's collective convention, he obtained a six-month leave  without pay so he could devote himself to his political  activities. The LA PRESSE management advises that if David  returns to the newspaper before the expiration of the six-month  period, he can no longer work in international service. After  this period, he will lose his job.    In an editorial published on 18 May, LA PRESSE condemned the  unofficial government in power in Port-au-Prince, which it  labels illegitimate, unelected, and antidemocratic; and  disapproves of Charles David's decision to be a part of it.</p>

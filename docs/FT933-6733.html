			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Blunkett attacks Brown over economic policy LABOUR'S hopes of forging a united front on economic policy were shattered yesterday by an attack on Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, by Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary. Mr Blunkett, the leading shadow cabinet supporter of 'radical' socialist policies, accused Mr Brown of allowing Labour's economic policy to be shaped by a decade of Conservative government. The attack was prompted by the launch last week by Mr Brown of Labour's revised economic policy. In it Mr Brown abandoned the party's 'tax and spend' manifesto commitments from the 1992 general election and promised to cut taxes if possible. Speaking in Sheffield, Mr Blunkett said Labour's job was 'to argue for a new agenda rather than to accept the existing orthodoxies'. He argued that spending on public services should be an essential plank of Labour's plans for economic regeneration and job creation. 'We must shape thinking, and not merely be shaped by the dogma of the last decade,' he said. 'This entails sensitive policies to increase equality of treatment and reward, and not merely of opportunity for the individual.' Mr Blunkett's comments reflect a continuing division in the shadow cabinet between 'modernisers' such as Mr Brown, who hope to make the party more acceptable to southern voters, and the more traditional 'radical' wing. Mr Blunkett described his speech as a contribution to the internal party debate about the 'nature and type of Labour party which is to emerge in the next two years'. His decision to speak out will be seen as part of a campaign by Mr Bryan Gould - Labour's leading 'radical' - to wrest control of the party from the modernisers. Mr Gould has threatened to stand against Mrs Margaret Beckett for the deputy leadership next year unless Mr Smith changes course. Mr Blunkett acted as campaign manager for Mr Gould when he stood for the leadership after the party's general election defeat last year. Mr Gould was heavily defeated, but has continued to criticise party strategy, particularly on Europe and the economy.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (8): Jump start to future hopes - Developments in high technology Egypt is aiming to jump-start its sluggish economy by attracting investment from international high-technology firms in its Pyramids Technology Valley (PTV), instigated in 1989 by the Cabinet Information and Decision Support Centre (IDSC). PTV has gained increased relevance in the past year following the sharp decline in the country's previously flourishing tourism industry, the fall in oil revenues, and general stagnation in most export sectors. Mr Hisham El Sherif, PTV initiator and IDSC chairman, insists that there is now both the money and political will to implement this highly ambitious scheme. 'High technology will be the oil of the future,' he says. The aim is to develop a world class, export-based industry. Two science parks - 'technopolis' - are planned in the 6th October industrial satellite city. The Suez Canal governorate of Ismailia is offering a range of financial incentives including free zone privileges for both the local as well as the export market. The hope is that Egypt would then be in a position to capture a share of the growing Dollars 800bn international information technology (IT) market already successfully entered by other developing countries such as India and Singapore. A report commissioned by the IDSC from Dataquest, the international consultants, suggests that although Egypt's IT industry is small - annual production is about Dollars 172m - the opportunities are enormous, but only if global manufacturing companies will act as engines of growth. The report concludes that local high tech production could be worth Dollars 2.5bn a year within five to seven years. Dollars 1.5bn would come from export revenues, creating 60,000 job opportunities and increasing GNP by between 3 per cent and 5 per cent a year. Most of this would be software. While such figures should be taken with a degree of caution, there is broad agreement within the industry that software is Egypt's obvious niche in the global market. In the increasingly price-conscious environment, Egypt has in abundance what big software companies really need: a large pool of cheap trained labour. In return, international software houses offer Egypt the benefits of technology transfer. 'Software development is mainly man hours,' notes Mr Hesham Gabr, general manager of Bull, the French IT group, which is planning to build a software factory in a PTV technopolis. Bull, which is one of only four big IT companies with a subsidiary based in Cairo (the others are IBM, ICL and AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, formerly NCL), estimates that Egyptian software engineers are about 30 per cent cheaper than those at its base in Paris. IBM places Egyptian labour costs at about half those in Europe and the US. But this can be a mixed blessing. Local computer firms complain about a steady leakage of trained personnel to higher paid jobs in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. However, Mr Ali El Hefnaoui, PTV's general manager, cautions that Egypt's competitive advantage in labour costs is likely to continue for only another 10 years as wages continue to rise towards international levels. 'Engineers with good basic computer science skills are easily available, but there is still a need to build skills for large complex project management and system design,' says Mr Amin Khaireldin, manager of IBM's Cairo-based software Arabisation centre. PTV seeks to address this through two recently established institutes which take about 1,300 honour graduates a year and train them up to international standards. Labour issues aside, Egyptian officials say that Egypt's lead role in the region allows easy access to the markets of the Middle East, particularly the high-growth markets of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Egypt is also a stepping stone to Africa and backyard development for Europe - and if regional peace becomes a reality, for Israel. The answer is 'marketing, marketing, and more marketing,' according to IDSC chairman El Sherif, to capitalise on the country's competitive advantages. PTV has started to sponsor Egyptian pavilions at important trade fairs, and a software association is in the process of being formed under the aegis of PTV. But still too much is being left to the individual level - too small to attract the big participants. 'Egypt has not positioned itself in the global market as yet,' comments Mr Adel Danish, managing director of the local Standardata, which also has offices in the US and France. 'The messages have been too diffuse and too few.' Mr Danish, who is also chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt's IT committee, advocates an aggressive government strategy linking big public sector contracts to work executed in Egypt, to start the ball rolling. There are, however, reservations among local firms as to whether those at the highest level are willing to act, in effect, as salesmen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mr. Lamassoure Will Judge the </F> Italian Government on Its Actions"]    [Text] Questioned on the Luxembourg Radio and Television-LE  MONDE "Grand Jury" program on Sunday, 15 May, on the appointment  of five neofascist ministers to Silvio Berlusconi's government,  European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said he had welcomed  the fact that "our Italian friends and others were not as  sectarian when France had Communist ministers in 1981." "It is  in government," he said, "that we will now judge the whole team.  From this viewpoint, the statements by Mr. Berlusconi himself  strike us as satisfactory. We need a strong Italy." The  presence of economist Antonio Martino in the post of foreign  minister strikes him as boding well for Italy's internal  economic reforms without threatening the European Union [EU]  move toward the single currency.    "We cannot accept new members with the existing European  institutions; we need a simpler system which is more efficient  and more democratic," Mr. Lamassoure explained. While rejecting  the prospect of an "a la carte Europe," which would enable each  to take what interests him and leave the rest, the minister  advocated a Europe of "variable geometry," provided that the  ultimate objective is that all member states are involved in the  same way in the EU.    "France and Germany are still the driving force of Europe  for  geographical and historical reasons," he added. "If France and  Germany were unfortunately to disagree on important subjects,  there would be two Europes."    Mr. Lamassoure, who visited Ukraine a short time ago, also  explained that France is due to sumbit to the Twelve in Brussels  on Monday a plan for the closure of the Chernobyl power plant  "as soon as possible," and aid for the construction of three  power stations. Finally, with regard to a successor to Delors,  the minister said that the Twelve should not hesitate to choose  a "weighty" person. He ruled out the candidacy of British  Conservative Sir Leon Brittan, despite his "personal qualities."</p>

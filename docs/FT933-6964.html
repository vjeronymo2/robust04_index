			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Bundesbank discount rate cut expected THE chief economists at Germany's 12 biggest banks all expect the Bundesbank to cut its leading lending rate this week, even though conditions have failed to improve since the central bank's last meeting at the end of July. Nine of the dozen questioned in a poll, which closed last Friday, said they expected a reduction of half a percentage point in the key discount rate, currently at 6.75 per cent. However, inflation is still stuck above 4 per cent, according to the latest indications, while money supply growth seems likely to remain well above the central bank's target range for some months yet. The cost-of-living index in Baden-Wurttemberg edged up 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-August, state officials reported yesterday. This brought the year-on-year increase in the most prosperous state to 4.3 per cent, compared with 4.2 per cent in July. New money supply figures are not expected this week, but the effects of heavy buying of weak currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism  - before the widening of fluctuation bands three weeks ago - are expected to drive the annualised growth rate in the M3 measure above July's 7.5 per cent. The bank's target range for this year allows for growth between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president-elect, dropped mild hints last weekend when he said small rate cuts were possible provided the trend in the money stock permitted them and inflation declined slightly in the near future. Observers suggested the bank could justify a drop in the discount rate tomorrow if it filtered out the distorting effects of money market interventions on M3. The policy council has also recently shown itself to be more interested in short-term inflation trends than in the conventional figures. According to informal analyses, the annualised rate for the past three months could be as low as 3 per cent in August compared with 3.4 per cent in July. However, non-German economists suggested a rate cut this week was unlikely because fundamental conditions had not changed in the past month, and that international pressure had eased greatly since the widening of ERM fluctuation bands. The Bundesbank's announcement yesterday of a fixed-rate offering of securities repurchase agreements at an unchanged 6.80 per cent gave no clues to its intentions for Thursday, analysts said.</p>

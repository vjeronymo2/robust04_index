			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijan's ambassador to </F> Moscow, by Boris Mikhaylov in the "Transcaucasus" column: "`We  Have the Right To Count on the Support of the CIS and the World  Community.' Ramiz Rizayev, Ambassador Plenipotentiary of the  Azerbaijan Republic to the Russian Federation, Denies Reports  About Afghan Mojahedin Involvement in Hostilities"]    [Text] [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, at a recent meeting of  the CIS heads of state in Ashgabat President Geydar Aliyev of  Azerbaijan demanded that a mechanism be worked out within the  framework of the Collective Security Treaty that would enable  the CIS countries to ensure Azerbaijan's territorial integrity.  Could you speak about the Azerbaijani initiative in greater  detail?    [Rizayev] The fact is that the provisions of the Collective  Security Treaty are so defined today that it is oriented toward  a rebuff against an "outside enemy" if such, God forbid, ever  appears. Although, to be frank, neither Iran nor Turkey are  threatening Azerbaijan; on the contrary, we enjoy good-neighbor  relations with these countries. This treaty in its present  shape does not provide for the possibility of collective defense  in a situation when one country -- a party to this treaty, in  particular Armenia -- commits aggression against another CIS  member, Azerbaijan. Armenia, trampling upon international law  and UN Security Council resolutions, continues to occupy  approximately one-quarter of Azerbaijani territory. All the  peace efforts undertaken earlier by the CSCE and the Russian  Federation to deal with this issue have not brought any tangible  results, primarily because Armenia continues to speak from a  position of force. The unprecedented case -- the shooting by  Armenian snipers at Russian Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov's  mission on 20 November -- has testified once again to Yerevan's  unwillingness to come across with any concessions. After that  attack, as is known, Russian Ambassador Kazimirov had to cut  short his peacemaking efforts. It is also indicative that  Armenia has demonstratively refused to apologize for this  incident to the Russian side. In this situation we have the  right to expect that parties to the Collective Security Treaty  will give a legal assessment to Armenia's expansionist policy,  because otherwise the very idea of a collective security system  within the CIS framework can be discredited.    [Mikhaylov] Russian diplomat Vladimir Kazimirov in the  course of a recent visit to Tehran stated that Russia is ready  to continue its intermediary efforts to achieve a settlement in  the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. How does Baku appraise  Russia's peacemaking efforts?    [Rizayev] We can only support the aspiration by the Russian  side to ensure peace and stability in this region. Russia in  this mediation process can and should do a lot: Russia's  geopolitical and economic interests call for stability along its  southern borders, and moreover there are approximately half a  million Russians living in Azerbaijan who consider our republic  their motherland and share all the hardships on a par with  everybody else. The peacemaking process should be based on the  principle of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. At the same  time one should bear in mind that the so-called "self defense  forces of Nagorno- Karabakh" are a myth. In fact the formations  acting in the zone of combat operations are a component part of  Armenia's national guard. Therefore all attempts by the Armenian  side to accord Nagorno-Karabakh the status of an independent  party in the talks hold no water. How has the tiny Armenian  community of Karabakh come by such a mighty power -- tanks,  missiles, aircraft, and fuel to fill the deadly military  machines? Therefore Yerevan's assertion that the conflict is  occurring between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh is nothing but  an attempt to absolve itself from responsibility for the ongoing  war in the region.    [Mikhaylov] Some time ago first Armenian sources and then  some Russian papers began to report that Afghan mojahedin are  fighting on the Azeri side. Could you confirm this information?    [Rizayev] I can only express a feeling of utmost amazement.  The Russian mass media are once again demonstrating unanimous  silence over the tragedy unfolding in Azerbaijan before the  entire world. More than a million civilians have been left  without shelter; death is taking its toll; a real genocide is  occurring, but we are not hearing any condemnation of this fact  by the Russian public. At the same time certain papers are  willingly airing the subject of Afghan mercenaries. Framed  "documents" are being used and these fabrications are being  backed up with fantastic figures. The impetus to this campaign  was provided by statements of Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan. This is an attempt to divert world public  attention from the numerous facts of the involvement of foreign  mercenaries as part of Armenia's occupation forces. There is  evidence to suggest that Armenians who have been trained in  Kurdish guerrilla camps in the Middle East are then transferred  to Karabakh, and Syrian and Lebanese hirelings are also arriving  here.    [Mikhaylov] Mr. Ambassador, I would like to ask a final  question, which is related to the internal political situation  in Azerbaijan. Could it be said that the present leadership has  succeeded in achieving national accord in the country? Some  time ago Ayaz Mutalibov, former president of the republic,  expressed his readiness in the press to collaborate with the  current authorities....    [Rizayev] The Azerbaijan leadership is ready for a  constructive dialogue with all healthy political forces of the  country wishing to undertake efforts to lead the country out of  the crisis. As for Mutalibov, I can say the following. It is  bad when a man does not want to understand that his time has  passed. It is okay if lying behind Mutalibov's statements are  only his personal ambitions, but there is a danger that the  ex-president is being turned into a kind of banner by well-known  forces aiming to destabilize the situation in Azerbaijan, which  is difficult as it is.</p>

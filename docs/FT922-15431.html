			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Ambulance staff offered 4.75% ABOUT 20,000 ambulance workers have been offered a 4.75 per cent rise or Pounds 400 a year, whichever is the greater. The offer, which has gone out to consultation with union members, is in line with other NHS workers. Ambulance workers had claimed 9.5 per cent. Earlier this week NHS managers made an across-the-board offer of a 4.76 per cent increase for most of the 115,000 hospital ancillary workers, rising to 6.86 per cent for the 13,000 worst-off workers. The offer, which is being considered by union leaders, would add 4.93 per cent to the pay bill for ancillary workers.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Showdown vote for Australian opposition chief Months of speculation over the leadership of Australia's federal opposition will come to a head in Canberra today, where Mr John Hewson, the incumbent, has said he will throw the matter open to a vote. Just over a year ago under Mr Hewson, the Liberal party lost a supposedly 'unlosable' election to Mr Paul Keating's Labor party. He regained some ground last summer, when the Labor government's budget was stalled in parliament for several months, but since then has seen his ranking in the opinion polls fall sharply. By contrast, the Keating government has pushed through a number of policy initiatives including an aboriginal land title bill and a white paper on employment and industry, and its standing with the electorate has risen. Its latest budget proposals, announced earlier this month, contained a minimum of new measures and thus run little risk of a repetition of last summer's upheavals. Pressure on Mr Hewson has increased over the past 10 days as a field of alternative leadership candidates has narrowed. Mr Alexander Downer, the opposition's spokesman on economic and treasury matters, and Mr Peter Costello, a young lawyer MP, are heading the challenge. Announcing his decision to hold a vote, Mr Hewson said he believed speculation had gained such a momentum that it needed to be resolved as soon as possible. He believed his chances of retaining his position were good: 'I think I will win quite well'.</p>

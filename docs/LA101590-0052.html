			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL RACE FREE OF MUDSLINGING  </P> <P> Compared to some election races in Orange County, Fullerton's City Council race  may seem a bit boring. After all, the race is void of any mudslinging and  outrageous campaign charges and countercharges.  </P> <P> With only three candidates -- two of them incumbents -- vying for two seats in  the Nov. 6 election, the race has been decidedly low-key.  </P> <P> "I think Fullerton City Council races have traditionally been free of  mudslinging," said Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, who is seeking reelection. "Sure,  we all have our philosophical differences, but we talk about them at City  Council meetings, and the public knows where we stand. You won't find any  skulduggery or backdoor dealing in a Fullerton City Council race."  </P> <P> The other two candidates, incumbent Councilwoman Molly McClanahan and  challenger Ray Merryman, agree.  </P> <P> "I think Fullerton has had a long tradition of cordiality," said McClanahan,  who is running for her third term on the City Council. "The council likes to  deal with issues, not personalities."  </P> <P> The only spark of discontent comes from Merryman -- a longtime Fullerton  resident who unsuccessfully ran for City Council in 1988 -- but even his  disagreements with Catlin and McClanahan remain civil.  </P> <P> "I like to stick to the issues," Merryman said. "I personally believe 12 years  on the council is nothing more than a politburo. But I like to stick to the  facts."  </P> <P> Merryman said the council tends to vote the same on every issue that comes  before it, a signal, he said, that change is necessary.  </P> <P> But other than fundamental differences with the council, Merryman has refrained  from verbally attacking Catlin's or McClanahan's character.  </P> <P> Though Catlin and McClanahan disagree on some issues, the two candidates agree  on what they called Fullerton's major issues -- the economy and environment.  </P> <P> "It's no secret that the overall economy is slowing down and leveling out,"  Catlin said, "and this will have an effect on our city and what kind of service  we can provide.  </P> <P> "The city's revenue stream is strained. And people in Fullerton are used to  getting good service from the city. We, as a council, must be ready to work  with the problem."  </P> <P> As far as the environment is concerned, both Catlin and McClanahan agree that  water and air quality and the safe disposal of waste is crucial for the city.  In addition, both said Fullerton needs to start working with other Orange  County cities in solving these problems.FULLERTON CITY COUNCIL These are the  candidates running for two seats on the Fullerton City Council in the Nov. 6  election.A.

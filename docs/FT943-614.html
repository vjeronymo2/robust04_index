			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps lift Huntleigh 74% to Pounds 5m Huntleigh Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer, reported a 74 per cent increase in first half profits following a maiden six-month contribution from Nesbit Evans. Gains by the hospital bed manufacturer, acquired for Pounds 11.8m in November last year, helped lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 5.27m in the six months to June 30. Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the subsidiary - renamed Huntleigh Nesbit Evans Healthcare - contributed about Pounds 1m to operating profits of Pounds 5.21m (Pounds 2.86m). The improvement was achieved on sharply increased turnover of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 16.3m), with the proportion of UK sales rising from 23 per cent to 50 per cent of the total following the Nesbit Evans deal. Mr Schild, however, hinted that the full-year results might not show the same growth. 'With the acquisition of Nesbit Evans, the consolidated profits are likely to be weighted towards the first half owing to the seasonality of the UK market,' he warned. He also sounded a note of caution about overseas operations, particularly in the US where there had been regulatory delays in winning FDA clearance for some products. Huntleigh's new French subsidiary made a loss following its launch late last year, but Mr Schild said it was performing above initial expectations. Earnings per share rose from 7.45p to 12.18p, and the board is lifting the interim dividend to 2.75p (2p). The shares closed up 5p at 433p.</p>

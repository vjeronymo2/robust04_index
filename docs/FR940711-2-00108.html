That information, along with supporting documentation, is reviewed to determine if waiver can be approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reviewing Waiver Request <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments, the waiver request is reviewed in the field office; in Disability Insurance overpayments, it is reviewed in the processing center.

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Task force plan for exporters THE CHAMBERS of commerce yesterday announced plans to establish an export task force to give exporters a greater influence over government policy. As a first step the task force, which will begin work within the next six weeks, will review the effectiveness of government and private-sector support. It will then examine the feasibility of creating a national export council as a permanent representative of large and small exporters and export trade organisations. The initiative was announced at the Association of British Chambers of Commerce annual conference in Leeds. The chambers announced plans to take a closer interest in export assistance for smaller businesses. They will establish a working party to influence the way the government's new business advice centres  - 'one-stop shops'  - help exporters and to co-ordinate the assistance provided by training and enterprise councils, chambers and local authorities. The chambers also unveiled plans to improve the quality of training for export staff. The Institute of Export helps people working for its professional qualifications but there was less training for people changing careers and for exporters at junior executive level, Mr Parsons said. The association has commissioned the London and Mid-Yorkshire chambers to develop a national training course leading to the new national vocational qualification in export trade. The government is keen to speed up the process of creating 'one-stop shops' for local business advice, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said last night. Only six centres qualified in the first round of applications last month, while nine more won conditional approval. The government wants to accelerate the three-year programme envisaged for establishing a national network, Mr Heseltine told the association's conference dinner.</p>

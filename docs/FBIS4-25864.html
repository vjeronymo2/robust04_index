			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roundup by a XINHUA reporter: "Li Denghui's (Li Teng-hui) </F> Remarks Intended To Split the Motherland Have Aroused Grave  Concern From the People on Both Sides of the Strait"]    [Text] Beijing, 14 June (XINHUA) -- Of late, Taiwan's  preeminent power-holder Li Denghui went to some Central American  countries and South Africa to blow his own trumpet there, trying  to buy over some people to support Taiwan's "return to the  United Nations." He unscrupulously spread statements within and  outside the island intended to split the motherland, attacking  and vilifying the Communist Party of China [CPC]. What Li  Denghui has done has aroused grave concern from the people on  both sides of the strait.    From 4 to 16 May, Li Denghui was active in Nicaragua, Costa  Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland. During this period, he said  on many occasions that Taiwan "must engage in diplomacy as a  sovereign country and that Taiwan `will not retreat from its  stand of joining the United Nations'." He slandered China's  leaders as having a "rigid concept" (originally from the  Japanese, meaning "as hard as cement") and even shouted an  abuse, calling mainland leaders "bandits." Before his visit to  these countries, during his "frank dialogue" with a Japanese  writer on the island of Taiwan, he said he would like to talk  about "the sadness of the Taiwanese people," saying that Taiwan,  recovered by China from the hand of the Japanese aggressors, had  been ruled by "a foreign political power," that the call of the  Chinese communists for cross-strait reunification was "a strange  rigmarole," and that "the term China is ambiguous." He also  styled himself as Moses who led the Jews out of Egypt to build a  new country. He also said he had been a Japanese until he  reached age 22. On 20 May, when he attended the extraordinary  meeting of "the National Assembly" in Taiwan, Li Denghui once  again declared: "One China is our future objective, but it does  not exist at present." Once again he was selling his so-called  theory of "two China's," one of which is the "Republic of China  on Taiwan."    Public opinion inside and outside of Taiwan showed that  these  splittist remarks by Li Denghui "have truly revealed his true  features." In recent years some principal power holders in  Taiwan have switched from pushing "elastic diplomacy" and  "essential diplomacy" to "pragmatic diplomacy" and "vacation  diplomacy," and switched from a policy of "two Chinas as a  phase," raised at the Seattle Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum last winter, to the recently raised policy of "accepting  dual recognition by South Africa of both sides of the strait."  This amply shows they are moving toward the path taken by the  advocates of "Taiwan independence." A columnist on the island  commented by saying: "In the past, the DPP [Democratic  Progressive Party] has been publicizing the "Taiwan  independence" ideal, but this is no longer the DPP's patent.  What the KMT is doing "pragmatically" now is promoting "Taiwan  independence." A Hong Kong newspaper, in a signed article,  points out: Recently Li Denghui "made one rigmarole after  another; he is distorting history." He said "nonsensically that  there is the `Republic of China on Taiwan.' Actually, it is  `independent Taiwan' and is also `Taiwan independence.'" In an  editorial, Taiwan's LIAN HE BAO [LIEN HO PAO] said: If Li  Denghui's doctrine of "foreign political power" exists, then it  is necessary to "smear or revise history." Remarks about "the  sadness of the Taiwan people" and "foreign political power" are  originally the principal views of the advocates of "Taiwan  independence." By taking the lead in "staging this kind of  show," Li Denghui is trying "to stir up sentiments" and "incite  enmity." By styling himself as Moses in the Bible, he "is not  honest with himself." At a discussion meeting, a person from  the press circle called these remarks of Li Denghui "helpful to  the `Taiwan independence' movement" and "harmful to the Chinese  people."</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Companies in south now entitled to aid COMPANIES in parts of London and on the east and south coasts of England are to be entitled for the first time to financial assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry. To qualify for the help they must invest to create new jobs or safeguard existing ones. The move follows a redrawing of the Assisted Areas map, which outlines areas where regional aid subsidies may be paid. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, yesterday announced the areas covered by the first new map since 1984. The old map concentrated assistance on industrial areas north of a line drawn from The Wash to the River Severn. The new map brings in districts of high unemployment in London such as Park Royal and the Lea Valley and selected coastal areas running from Skegness, through Great Yarmouth, the Isle of Thanet and Hastings to Torbay. Areas hurt by coal mine closures, such as Chesterfield and Mansfield, or by defence cuts, such as Barrow-in-Furness, have also been included. To keep the proportion of the population covered by the map down to 34-35 per cent, parts of south and north Wales have been removed. So too have parts of Manchester, Bradford and Midland towns such as Corby, Kidderminster and Telford. Regional aid payments are made under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1982. Areas entitled to aid are split into development or intermediate areas, denoting the extent of subsidy which can be paid. Regional selective assistance, which cost the government Pounds 193m in 1991-92, is used as a carrot to attract inward investment. The shape of the new map reflects the changing pattern of unemployment in Britain. Areas of southern England, hurt by recession and the shakeout in the service sector, have recorded unemployment figures higher than those areas in the Midlands and north associated with industrial decline. The government's choice of areas was predictably controversial. 'Extensions to the map should not have been paid for by cuts elsewhere,' said Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary. Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington, which lost assisted status, accused the government of gerrymandering the map 'to prop up crumbling Tory support across the country'. In Wales, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, tried to steer criticism away by saying that the majority of the working population continues to have Assisted Area status but Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, said 'the Welsh economy is too fragile to lose government aid of whatever type'.

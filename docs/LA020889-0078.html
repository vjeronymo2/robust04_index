			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> About 5,000 Polish coal miners pressed ahead with a strike, apparently defying  appeals by two emissaries sent by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. The miners  said they stopped work shortly after midnight at the Belchatow mine, 90 miles  southwest of Warsaw, after talks with management broke down. The strikers have  demanded more pay but said they did not want to disrupt round-table talks in  which the government is seeking a deal with the banned Solidarity union to help  solve Poland's economic crisis.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> EDDIE MURPHY WINS BY DEFAULT  </P> <P> Eddie Murphy, his production company, and Paramount Pictures won a victory  Tuesday when a Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit over the movie "Coming  to America."  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed in August, 1989, by Oman Oba Adele Mouftaou Lassine  Osseni-Bellow, also known as Prince Johnny Osseni-Bellow.  </P> <P> The plaintiff claimed in his suit that Murphy, Eddie Murphy Productions Inc.,  and Paramount Pictures Corp. used his story idea to produce a film about an  African prince coming to America.  </P> <P> Judge Philip Saeta dismissed the state court case when Osseni-Bellow failed to  appear in court for a scheduled hearing.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was similar to another action in federal court, also involving  Osseni-Bellow and a Canadian writer, Shelby Gregory. That lawsuit, a copyright  action over "Coming to America," involved the same allegations as the state  suit and already has been dismissed.  </P> <P> Neither lawsuit was related to the celebrated action over "Coming to America"  by columnist Art Buchwald.  </P></p>

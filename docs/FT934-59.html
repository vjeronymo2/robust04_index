			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Israel offers to share control of borders with Palestinians Israel has offered to share control with Palestinians of the border crossing points with neighbouring states. Officials see it as a final attempt to break the deadlock in negotiations on Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday that the proposal, which Israeli officials claim was broadly agreed by the two delegations in Cairo this week, has not been accepted. The PLO is insisting that it alone should control the crossings. Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a senior PLO official who attended the Cairo talks, said the PLO had not agreed to the draft text and accused Israel of exaggerating the extent of agreement. 'There is no joint agreement. It is a paper which includes the Israeli views,' he said. 'We hope that these kinds of exaggerations, which we consider as an attempt to bluff, will not undermine the present form of negotiations.' Another PLO negotiator, Mr Nabil Shaath, said last night that Israeli and Palestinian teams would spend the next two weeks in the Egyptian resort of Taba attempting to reach agreement. Mr Shaath said he had sent the Israelis a paper describing possible compromises. According to the draft document, released in Jerusalem, Israel would maintain control over external security, except at crossing points between Jordan and Jericho, and Egypt and Gaza. At those points both sides would have a veto over travellers seeking to enter Gaza and Jericho. Each side would have separate windows within one terminal building. Checks would be carried out electronically and leading Palestinians would be exempt from the procedures. The proposal marks a climbdown from earlier Israeli demands to maintain sole control over the entry points. Israel has also doubled its original offer of the land area around Jericho to be administered by the Palestinians to about 56 sq km. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and Mr Yossi Sarid, the environment minister, continued to insist yesterday that the proposal was broadly agreed by the PLO team and merely needed final approval from Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. Mr Sarid said it seemed that Mr Arafat had refused to back the judgment of his negotiating team. 'As one who was there, I can say in the clearest and most authoritative way that the understandings which are being discussed were acceptable to the heads of the PLO, but are unacceptable to the PLO leader.' Foreign diplomats said Israel, by releasing the text of the draft proposal, was trying to force the PLO to accept the deal as a 'final offer'. Mr Peres also warned that the April 13 deadline for Israel to complete its military withdrawal would not be guaranteed if talks continued to drag on. Editorial Comment, Page 11</p>

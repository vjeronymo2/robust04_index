			<p>BFN     [Text] The Greek Government has expressed the conviction  that following the latest developments, the Cyprus issue has  reached the point where the UN secretary general should assess  the situation, determine who is responsible for it, and present  a report to the Security Council. Greek Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said alternative solutions to the  Cyprus issue should also be examined, adding that it is not  possible to continue the current time consuming process. This,  he said, is necessary because of the continuing Turkish  intransigence and the lack of political will, which were  confirmed at the latest meeting between Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, and  [Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf] Denktas.</p>

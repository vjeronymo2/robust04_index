			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CON ARTIST CONVICTED OF TRYING TO BLACKMAIL ANCHORWOMAN  </P> <P> A man described as a con artist was convicted of trying to blackmail a local  anchorwoman by asking for $30,000 to help block the publication of X-rated  photos of her, which in fact did not exist.  </P> <P> The Superior Court jury deliberated for about four hours before finding Gilbert  Cabot, 44, guilty Thursday of attempted extortion and conspiracy in connection  with the plot against KTLA anchorwoman Jann Carl.  </P> <P> "I feel relieved," Carl said. "What he tried to do to me was wrong, and at  least for a while, or as long as his sentence turns out to be, he won't be able  to find any more victims."  </P> <P> Cabot faces up to a five-year prison term at his sentencing Sept. 11. Cabot,  whom prosecutors said is a veteran con artist, had been calling Carl since 1985  to try to get her to let him act as her manager, Carl said. She repeatedly  refused.  </P> <P> He then phoned her to say a woman had planned to sell nude photos of the  anchorwoman taken from a sexually explicit videotape to a national magazine,  but that he could block the sale by paying the woman $30,000, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Carl, knowing the tape did not exist, worked with authorities on a sting  operation that resulted in Cabot's arrest.  </P></p>

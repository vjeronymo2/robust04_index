			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Opposition figure Rafael  Gutirrez Santos protested today the fact that Cuban authorities  refuse to give him permission to leave Cuba to attend an  international trade union meeting in Brussels, Belgium.  Gutirrez Santos, who is 58 years old, is on probation after  spending eight months in prison for charges of spreading "enemy  propaganda." His sentence is still pending.    The activist showed foreign journalists the invitation sent  to him by the International Conference of Free Trade Union  Organizations (CIOSL), which is headquartered in Brussels, to  participate in a forum on human and labor rights to be held next  week.    The Belgian Government informed CIOSL that it would grant a  visa to Gutirrez Santos but Cuban authorities have refused to  renew his passport and to grant him a corresponding departure  permit, Gutirrez Santos said.    Gutirrez Santos was an electromechanical operator in the  port  of Havana and a leader of a regional merchant marine union,  which is affiliated with the Cuban Workers Federation until 1992  when he was expelled from the union for his opposition  activities. He was also fired from his job at that time.</p>

To make things worse,  demonstrators threw rocks at a police patrol vehicle after  unsuccessfully trying to set fire to it.    During the morning there were protests in several parts of  the city which later turned into riots. The police repelled the  demonstrators with tear gas, while students wearing face masks  threw rocks and other hard objects.    Near the junior high school in the northern section of the  city, several groups attacked police patrol vehicle 181. After  unsuccessfully trying to set fire to it, they stoned the  vehicle. Several demonstrators were hurt.    Alejandro Zambrano, a student who was charged with burning a  bus, was released. This was in response to the demands made by  another student. Nevertheless, police still had to use tear gas  to disperse the demonstrators.    Merida is without transportation for the sixth consecutive  day. Transportation union leaders say they are unable to work  due to the lack of security, as they find the government  unwilling to come to their aid.  <H5>  National Transportation Strike </H5>   The National Transportation Federation called a 48-hour  strike for Thursday and Friday, because the Ministry of  Transportation and Communication has not responded to their  demands. The demands include changing the preferential student  fare to half price. The strike is nationwide. In the predawn  hours the strike will be regional, which means there will be no  transportation service in Merida or in the interior of the state.    Police sources reported that masked demonstrators looted a  trailer truck loaded with cosmetics on Monday.</p>

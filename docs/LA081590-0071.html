			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH ASSAILS DEMOCRATS OVER STALLED BUDGET  </P> <P> President Bush blamed the federal budget impasse on Democrats in Congress  Tuesday, lashing out at lawmakers for trying to gain political advantage from  the issue rather than negotiating in good faith to reduce the deficit.  </P> <P> "I feel I kept my share of the bargain," Bush told a nationally televised news  conference. "Now it is up to the Democrats who control Congress."  </P> <P> But congressional Democrats quickly responded with a well-orchestrated attack  of their own on White House budget policies.  </P> <P> "I am saddened to see the President resort to partisan complaining on the  budget," House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said in a statement.  "For months the budget summit has been meeting in good faith to address a  deficit that is the direct result of 10 years of Reagan-Bush economic and  fiscal policies."  </P> <P> Bush warned lawmakers that they would "bear heavy responsibility" if a failure  to reach a budget agreement next month forces him to impose potentially  crippling automatic spending cuts on Oct. 1, affecting an array of defense and  domestic programs.  </P> <P> "As painful as such deep cuts would be, I must uphold the law," Bush said. "I'm  determined to manage them as best I can, knowing that I've done all in my power  to avoid them."  </P> <P> Bush faces serious problems, however, in trying to carry out such a threat.  Many lawmakers are convinced that the White House has little choice but to find  a way to avoid the roughly $100 billion in spending cuts called for under the  Gramm-Rudman budget law because the Pentagon could not live with the  consequences during the current crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Gramm-Rudman law would be revised if a deficit accord is reached, easing  the targets and extending the timetable for achieving a balanced budget.  </P> <P> The crisis in the Persian Gulf has complicated the budget problem even further  by boosting military outlays and by increasing the risk of recession because of  higher oil prices.  </P> <P> Bush vowed to veto any spending legislation that would make the deficit deeper  and renewed his pledge to support a capital gains tax reduction as a means to  spur economic growth. The White House believes that lowering the tax on gains  from the sale of investment assets, such as stocks and bonds, would boost  business investment and help revive the economy.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is fearful that a large deficit will keep interest  rates high and plunge the economy into a recession, perhaps endangering Bush's  reelection prospects in 1992.  </P> <P> "Our current budget, or lack thereof, constitutes a real threat to the economic  well-being of this country," the President said in an unusually long opening  statement at the news conference.  </P> <P> Despite the risks to the economy, Bush said he wants budget negotiators to  stick to their ambitious original goal of slashing next year's federal deficit  by $50 billion.  </P> <P> By contrast, several lawmakers, worried that recent oil price hikes might cause  a recession, have suggested scaling back the size of next year's  deficit-reduction budget package to lessen any immediate negative impact on the  already sluggish U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Bush took advantage of his afternoon news conference, carried live on all  television networks, to turn up the heat on Congress at a time when his  personal popularity is riding high over the White House's handling of the  situation in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The President met with reporters shortly after returning to Washington from his  Maine vacation home for two days of talks and briefings. Before his news  conference, Bush gathered with advisers to discuss the budget, but Budget  Director Richard G. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady were out of  town and did not attend the meeting.  </P> <P> Bush argued that the budget negotiations have dragged on for more than three  months without any substantive accomplishment so far, largely because  congressional Democrats have been trying to gain extra leverage over the White  House.  </P> <P> "There were some saying: 'Hey, we think we got the President over a barrel  here. We've made him back away and give and give and give and get nothing,' "  Bush said.  </P> <P> The talks, which were stalemated when Congress left for its summer recess  earlier this month, are scheduled to resume after Labor Day.  </P> <P> Frequently displaying strong emotion over the budget issue, Bush accused  Democrats of "laughing all the way to what they think is the electoral bank."  </P> <P> Democratic lawmakers, however, insisted that they are not to blame for the  impasse over how to reduce a deficit expected to exceed $220 billion next year  unless the White House and Congress can agree on spending cuts and tax  increases to narrow the budget gap.  </P> <P> "The President's statement on the budget was not accurate and not helpful,"  Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said. "If there has been an  'abdication of responsibilities' on the budget, it has been on the part of the  President."  </P> <P> Bush defended his Administration's conduct of the budget negotiations with  Congress, contending that he had gone the extra mile in trying to jump-start  the deadlocked budget talks in late June by backing down on his "no new tax"  campaign pledge.  </P> <P> But, although Republicans have suffered politically from Bush's decision to  change course and present a new proposal that includes higher taxes, Bush said  Democrats have failed to respond with a budget plan of their own.  </P> <P> "After three full months, the Democrats have yet to offer one single proposal  at the budget summit," he said.  </P> <P> Shortly before Congress left town, Republican lawmakers disclosed a White House  plan to sharply raise taxes on alcoholic beverages and to limit deductions for  state and local taxes. But the proposal was never formally presented to  Democrats, who decided not to present a counterproposal of their own.  </P> <P> Budget negotiators are expected to try to go into hiding when they resume  bargaining next month. Rep. Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) said he was told that talks  will resume on or about Sept. 5 at Andrews Air Force Base, home to the White  House's Air Force One about 15 miles east of Washington. He said he plans to  sleep at Andrews.  </P></p>

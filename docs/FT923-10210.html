			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / BA cabin staff set strike for Tuesday BRITISH Airways cabin crews have set next Tuesday as the date for the first of a series of one-day strikes. The TGWU general union, which represents 2,600 of the airline's 2,900 cabin crew, said yesterday: 'We will definitely close down domestic, European and Concorde services unless BA agrees to further talks over the new pay and conditions.' BA has conceded that, if the strike attracts strong support after midnight on Monday, short-haul services will be disrupted. It is thought unlikely that Concorde will be affected. The union said it was expecting all members to support the strike call, but officials admitted privately that it was impossible to predict how many members actually would do so. BA said it was planning a normal schedule on Tuesday. The company said the ballot for the action had produced only a 121 majority in favour of action, in a turnout of about 70 per cent. An earlier ballot, which produced a bigger majority, was ruled unlawful. BA said it hoped short-haul crews would report for work on Tuesday and that 'we will operate all our domestic and European services without inconvenience to passengers.'</p>

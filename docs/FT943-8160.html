			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures weaker - Market Report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE prices ended weaker in very light volume yesterday after traders liquidated long positions in the absence of any fresh factors. 'We lack any impetus on the upside and, as with other markets, when there is a lack of news it tends to recede,' one trader explained. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER led a general afternoon rally, but once morning losses had been erased most contracts ran into resistance. Markets were still rather thin and, in most cases, fairly light volumes of business were moving prices, traders said. That may have given markets a stronger appearance than was actually the case. 'Copper looked strong in the late morning and early afternoon but it all fizzled out when we hit Dollars 2,420 a tonne,' one said. 'The same happened to aluminium at Dollars 1,480 and nickel at Dollars 5,700.' PRECIOUS METALS turned easier in the afternoon when follow-through to Tuesday's rally failed to materialise.

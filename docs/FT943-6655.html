			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: C &amp;G sets up help-line - At a glance The Cheltenham and Gloucester building society has bowed to pressure and set up a telephone help-line, which comes into operation from Tuesday, to help its customers understand the terms of the Lloyds Bank takeover offer for the society. Many account holders are unsure whether they qualify for cash payments under the offer because of a ruling that customers must have been members of the society for two years to be eligible. The desk can be contacted on 0345-889900, from 9am to 5pm, Mondays to Fridays, and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays.</p>

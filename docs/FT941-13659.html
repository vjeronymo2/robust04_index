			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Benefit changes could swell jobless total More than a quarter of a million people could be added to Britain's official unemployment register as a result of government plans to tighten the rules for claimants of invalidity benefit. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs yesterday that introducing a new system for disbursing invalidity benefit could mean that between 1995 and 1997 a total of 280,000 current recipients would be forced actively to seek work. Ministers have stressed these are 'worst case' figures, and the number of people who end up claiming unemployment benefit will depend on the strength of the economy and the number of jobs available. However, one Conservative backbencher warned last night that the new system of incapacity benefit could have a 'definite upward impact' on unemployment in what could be the two years before a general election. The MP said: 'There is a presentational problem here, and it is one which has inhibited the government from introducing this measure in the past. The government will have to make a big effort on presentation and in finding training schemes for those affected.' Mr Lilley announced the potential impact of the measure at the start of a second reading debate on the incapacity for work bill. The legislation will bring in an objective medical test for all recipients of incapacity benefit from April 1995. Mr Lilley said the current system of invalidity benefit was open to abuse, with the number of claimants trebling over the past 15 years. 'Is there really an epidemic of incapacity?' he asked. 'Of course not.' He assured MPs that about 800,000 current recipients of benefit with acute medical problems would not be liable to a benefit review at all. But in response to persistent questioning Mr Lilley said that about 95,000 people could find themselves actively seeking work in the first year of the new benefit, and 190,000 in the second. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the all-party social security committee, said yesterday that the measures would effectively unwind the government's Restart scheme, which in the late 1980s reduced the jobless numbers by allowing more people to claim invalidity benefit. 'This legislation will backfire on the government because the jobless figures will go up at the wrong time,' he said. However, Tory backbenchers were adamant that the measure, which will save about Pounds 2bn in its first two years, needed to be introduced. Mr Matthew Banks, Tory MP for Southport, said: 'Too many people are claiming the benefit who are simply not entitled to it.'</p>

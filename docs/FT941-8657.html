			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Prices warm up despite cold reality of high stocks: Kenneth Gooding assesses new trends in the metals markets Strange things are happening in the metals markets. Take this example. Although western world aluminium stocks are at a record 5m tonnes - enough to keep the world's consumers happy for nearly four months - buyers wanting metal for June and July from London Metal Exchange warehouses recently had to pay a premium to be sure of delivery. Copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc stocks are also overflowing from LME warehouses, and there seems little chance of a return to more reasonable levels until the end of this year. Yet LME prices, a reference point for nearly all metals contracts worldwide, burst upwards in January. Even zinc, the worst-performing base metal, ended the month 17 per cent above its lowest point in the present economic cycle, while nickel and lead were 49 and 42 per cent above their lows. The metal markets' aberrant behaviour can be traced to the arrival of new players - financial institutions and investment funds forced by low interest rates to widen their search for profitable ways to deploy their cash. The influx has provided welcome liquidity, but it might also have a negative impact, according to Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining company. By pushing LME prices up more rapidly than is justified by the fundamentals, it might delay actions - such as closure of out-dated capacity - necessary to bring the market back into balance. Also, Mr Crowson points out, because it does not take much money to move these markets, the funds' heavy reliance on chart-based technical trading makes prices more volatile. Mr David King, LME chief executive, suggests that fund activity on the exchange so far is well under 10 per cent of the Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.39bn) daily turnover. But it would not be healthy if the weight of fund money pushed prices 'up or down substantially as they moved in or out of the market'. The potential for volatility has been well illustrated this month. After the Federal Reserve Board eased US interest rates upwards, the funds immediately reduced their exposure to metals and LME prices fell. But in the past few days most metals prices have recovered and seem determined to defy gravity. Those who believe in fundamental-historical analysis insist that stock levels give the best indication of the health of metals markets. And metals stocks are sky high. LME warehouses around the world contain about 4.6m tonnes of metal valued at more than Dollars 6bn, representing 55-60 per cent of the western world's surplus metals stocks. This is a big change from the previous trough in 1982, when only 14 per cent of stocks were held on the LME. This change helps explain why today's stock figures are sending out confusing signals. Traders suggest a great deal of LME stock has been 'neutralised' by long-term financing deals. According to a December survey by Mr Alan Heap, of County Natwest Securities Australia, about 45 per cent of total LME stocks was held by financial institutions, either as collateral against loans to producers and consumers or as a speculative investment. This follows a shift in the LME's membership over the past 10 years: far more banks and financial institutions now operate on the exchange. 'You only have to name a few names to get the feel of this financial muscle - Barclays, Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan,' says Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch. Some of these banks have a new activity - holding metals to earn the contango (or the premium over the cash price) which reflects the cash price, storage and insurance fees and interest costs during a contract period. Banks have been using their financial power to improve their earnings from the contango. They get better terms from warehouses, for example, by guaranteeing to leave metal in storage for one or two years. Mr Arnold suggests institutions have been earning a 6.45 per cent annual return, attractive business at a time of low interest and low inflation. The aluminium market has been a prime target for this 'financialisation' of stock. Traders also warn that some organisations are not content just to earn the contango, they want to make capital gains as well. This could drive up prices rapidly as demand improves, in spite of stocks remaining high. However, Mr Arnold points out: 'This strategy would backfire because excessively high prices would encourage producers to reactivate capacity much more quickly and they would deliver the extra production directly into LME warehouses.' Mr Crowson suggests that disappointment looms for those expecting a rapid and solid upswing in metals prices as the world's economic health improves. Managed commodity funds alone have Dollars 26bn to find a home for and if a bullish or bearish trend emerges, the funds will tend to reinforce it. 'It will be a rollercoaster,' he says.</p>

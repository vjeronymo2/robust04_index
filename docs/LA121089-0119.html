			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: NO GREAT STRIDES ON 'JOURNEYMAN';  </P> <P> ERIC CLAPTON "JOURNEYMAN." WARNER BROS. ** 1/2  </P> <P> "Agoraphobic" might be a more appropriate title, so safe and close to home does  Clapton play it here. "Journeyman" is a far cry superior to his previous  platter, "August," to be certain; a change in producers from Phil Collins to  Russ Titelman has helped. But seeing how good guitar-playing can redeem bad  tunesmanship only so much -- and how Clapton's inexpressive voice redeems it  not at all -- he's once again at the mercy of the material he's picked, which  doesn't find him journeying beyond his recent  '80s-yups-with-CD-players-oriented boundaries near enough.  </P> <P> The better choices include one of Ray Charles' patented happy-sounding,  horn-filled blues, "Hard Times"; a version of "Hound Dog" that comes close to  what Ry Cooder or David Lindley might do with the oldie; another '50s relic,  "Before You Accuse Me," one of several cuts to feature slide-vs.-slowhand  dueling with Robert Cray, and, best of all, R&amp;B faves Cecil and Linda  Womack's "Lead Me On," with its writers joining in on vocals. This track is a  moving ballad of jealousy that includes telling emotional details, something  missing in all the other songs.  </P> <P> On the minus side are the uniformly mediocre tracks by Clapton's favorite  commercial writer of the moment, Jerry Williams, which take up five of the  album's 12 slots along with the accompanying mod programming nonsense. George  Harrison's contribution sounds like an outtake from one of his lesser  middle-period albums. It's all competent background music at worst; it's your  12 bucks, digital heads.  </P> <P>  Albums are rated on a scale of one (poor) to five (a classic) stars.CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

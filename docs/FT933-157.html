			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The low cover on yesterday's gilts auction doubtless sent a shiver through those who fear that the Pounds 3bn-a-month funding programme must cause indigestion eventually. There are some who argue that as the market adjusts to the auction process increased sophistication will allow cover to fall. Longer-term experience in the US suggests that cover remains a function of underlying demand. By that measure, the UK looks a little vulnerable. The recent weakness of sterling against continental currencies, and the consequential deterrent to overseas buyers who have seen the value of previous auction purchases fall, shows how critically dependent gilt auctions are on foreign support. Since the tax increases announced in the last Budget have yet to kick in, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre in raising extra funds in November must be limited by the risks of fiscal shock. There may only be limited room for the interest rate cuts which the market so confidently expects. This summer's rerating of gilts may be sustainable, but it is hard to see where the next leg up is to come from.</p>

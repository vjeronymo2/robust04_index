			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nedlloyd reports flat profits NEDLLOYD, the Dutch transport group, reported flat net profits for the 1992 first half. However, the group said the long-term trend was 'positive' because the figures did not rely as heavily on book profits from divestments as they did the year before. Net profit totalled Fl 1m (Dollars 605,000) against Fl 2m in the same period of 1991. Operating profits were also barely changed at Fl 62m compared with Fl 60m. 'Disappointing economic growth and intensified competition had a negative influence on the operating results,' the company said. However, it noted that post-tax results from ordinary activities, which excluded gains on divestments, showed a profit of Fl 3m in the first half, compared with a Fl 35m loss the year before. In the first half of last year, Nedlloyd's results included a book profit of Fl 40m on the sale of its stake in Transavia, the Dutch charter airline, to KLM. Nedlloyd also managed to turn in a slim net profit in the first half of 1992 because of a decline in interest charges and a rise in profits on the sale of fixed assets. The company, which is struggling to reduce costs at a time of a general slowdown in world trade and increased pressure on shipping tariffs, said it expected to end the year with a 'modest positive result'. Until now, Nedlloyd, which has not paid a dividend for two years, has said only that operating profits would show an improvement. Turnover fell to Fl 3.22bn from Fl 3.31bn. However, if companies divested in 1991 are eliminated, turnover rose by nearly 7 per cent. Within Nedlloyd's land-based operations, the road cargo division posted a 'clearly negative' operating result, but the Unitrans division reached the turnround point after previous losses. Operating results in ocean shipping were hampered by the bad market for tankers and difficult conditions in the short sea liner trade, it said without giving figures. Nedlloyd's shares, which had weakened this week ahead of the figures, partly on fears that the company might show a first-half loss, rose by Fl 0.30 to close at Fl 38.00.</p>

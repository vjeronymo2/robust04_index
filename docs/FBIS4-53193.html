			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign minister says that, so long as there  are weapons and fighting in Cambodia, it will be impossible to  achieve peace there. Commenting about King Sihanouk's request  for arms assistance from western countries and Australia to  fight the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri says Thailand will have nothing to do with that; it  involves only the countries giving and receiving. However, he  said, there will be no solution to the fighting if one resorts  to the military option.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Has there been  any request for sympathy from Australia?    [Prasong] Well, it is impossible for us to say: You should  not give them the weapons. That would be an interference on our  part. But we can tell them that we will have nothing to do with  that; it's your business whether or not you are going to give  them the weapons. Anyway, we believe that a settlement of the  Cambodian problem should be achieved through political not  military means. [end recording]</p>

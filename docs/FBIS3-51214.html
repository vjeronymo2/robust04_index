Utec Rector Mauricio Loucel said that among the  approximately  2,061 citizens polled from the nation's diverse sectors, a total  of 1,800 people--mostly of the younger generation--expressed  their interest in the coming elections. A total of 40.2 percent  expressed their preference for Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA  [Nationalist Republican Alliance] party president and  presidential candidate. Nevertheless, 56.6 percent of those  polled said that the current government has not met its promises.    Likewise, 22.2 percent of those polled expressed their  preference for Ruben Zamora, FMLN-CD [Democratic  Convergence]-MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] presidential  candidate, followed by Fidel Chavez Mena, PDC [Christian  Democratic Party] presidential candidate, who obtained 14.1  percent. Chavez Mena slid, however, by 3.4 percent since the  previous poll was conducted, Loucel said.    The Utec rector added that candidates Jorge Martinez from  the  MU [expansion unknown] and Edgardo Rodriguez, from the MSN  [expansion unknown] continue to obtain 10 percent in their  favor. This represents a gap too large to overcome in the coming  days.    According to the results, the political parties most likely  to have representatives in the Legislative Assembly are: ARENA,  in first place, with 35 percent in its favor, followed by  FMLN-CD-MNR, with 23.4 percent, and in third place, the PDC  [Christian Democratic Party], with 15.2 percent.    With regard to the voting card, of the 1,800 interested in  the coming elections, 88.55 percent have the voting card, while  11.45 percent do not.</p>

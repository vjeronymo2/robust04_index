			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Falling margins at Dinkie Heel Difficult trading conditions in the UK and exchange rate pressure resulted in falling operating margins at Dinkie Heel in the six months to June 30. Reflecting increased exports, this Bristol-based supplier of components to the footwear manufacture and repair industries reported turnover of Pounds 3.38m against last time's Pounds 2.93m which excluded a Pounds 701,000 contribution from loss-making Enterprise, which was sold in October. Operating profit was static at Pounds 154,000 but a reduced interest charge of Pounds 44,000 (Pounds 64,000) lifted the pre-tax line to Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 90,000). The interim dividend is maintained at 0.35p, payable from earnings of 0.67p (0.55p) per share.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops after early rise on March economic data Wall Street CONCERTED computerised selling during the afternoon sparked a 50-point turnround in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday from a moderate rise made earlier in the session on the back of positive US economic statistics, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow blue chip indicator was down 35.40 on balance at 2,876.98, having initially been over 15 points ahead. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending 5.36 off at 373.66. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, which had been lower all day, registered a drop of 6.90 at 487.74. Turnover on the New York SE was thin at just 150m shares. Declining issues outpaced advances by more than two-to-one. Share prices had been higher in early trading after the Commerce Department released figures showing that new home sales rose by 1 per cent in March and by a revised 18.6 per cent in February. Statistics outlining a 0.2 per cent rise in personal income and a 0.6 per cent increase in personal consumption in March were also released. The figures were better than expected and suggested that economic activity was picking up, albeit slowly. While this encouraged the stock market to improve at first, the buying was never convincing and afternoon programme selling quickly sent prices into retreat. The market's losses in the past week, and the ease with which the Dow has fallen through several technical support levels, has convinced many professional investors that shares are embarking on a medium-term decline. Only a cut in interest rates could bring the market out of its present slide, said analysts. Pepsico slipped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 on volume of 4.8m shares after reporting a modest rise in first-quarter profits to 26 cents a share from 23 cents. A&amp;P, the supermarket group, dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 45 3/4 in the wake of Friday night's warning that its first-quarter profits might be as much as 30 per cent below the Dollars 1.33 a share earned at the same stage in 1990. Boeing eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 3/4 on turnover of 2.2m shares after revealing a modest rise in first-quarter income to 90 cents a share from the year earlier level of 87 cents. News of a Dollars 346m charge against earnings and a resultant Dollars 237m first-quarter loss left USX, the steel and energy group, Dollars 1/2 lower at Dollars 31 7/8 . Vista Chemical climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 52 1/8 in response to the decision by RWE-DEA, the German utility group, to extend the deadline on its Dollars 55 a share offer for Vista from May 13 to May 21. Playboy Enterprises advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 on reporting an increase in fiscal third-quarter operating profits to 3 cents a share from the 2 cents registered a year ago. Other stocks to rise on news of improved profits included Universal Corporation, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 1/4 , and Unum, Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 62 1/2 . Canada TORONTO share prices drifted lower from the opening and accelerated their fall late in the session on fears that the Ontario budget, the first by the province's socialist-oriented New Democratic Party, would include a sharp deficit and new taxes. Trading was moderate. The composite index lost 25 points to close at 3,472.2, while declining issues were ahead of rises by 351 to 176 after a volume of 21m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-groups finished lower, led by transportation, off 2.18 per cent, while gold issues declined 1.60 per cent and mining 1.45 per cent.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Blair House impasse 'puts Gatt at risk' REFUSAL by the US to open talks with the European Community on 'clarifying' the Blair House farm trade agreement will make it hard to conclude the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations by their December 15 deadline, Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, warned yesterday. 'The deadline might be realistic if the Americans are prepared to shift a bit,' Mr Steichen said. Briefing EC farm ministers on his talks last week with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, Mr Steichen said he was disappointed by Washington's intransigence over the EC's 'legitimate, reasonable and responsible' demands. According to the commissioner, Mr Kantor refused to discuss the additional farm trade concessions sought by France and incorporated into the EC's negotiating brief after a special meeting of foreign, trade and agriculture ministers on September 20. Mr Kantor also refused to open technical discussions with the EC at senior level, dismissing the 'clarifications' sought by Europe as an internal Community problem. At yesterday's Council of Ministers, however, the Commission and most member states argued that the US stance might be tactical. 'It was always unlikely that the Americans would say now what more they were prepared to discuss in agriculture,' one senior Brussels official said. Mr Steichen's comments set the tone for a low-key debate on the Gatt farm chapter, but also prompted France, Spain, Belgium, Ireland and others to question the December 15 deadline, when the US administration's 'fast track' negotiating authority runs out. Mr Jean Puech, France's agriculture minister, insisted the EC should not be mesmerised by the date. He also introduced a new element into the farm trade imbroglio by insisting the Commission nail down precise interpretations of the extent to which sanitary, plant health and veterinary regulations can interrupt normal trade in agricultural produce.

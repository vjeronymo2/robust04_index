			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Defense Programming Law Under </F> Development'']    [Text] Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand chaired a Defense  Council meeting on the 1995-2000 military programming law, which  will then be adopted by the Council of Ministers before its  submission to the spring session of Parliament. In line with  the White Paper on Defense, the law will give precedence to  equipment currently being manufactured as opposed to research  and development programs (development of prototypes). According  to a senior defense official, ``delaying large armament programs  some more was quite a tempting option,'' but ``we preferred to  give priority to the deployment of modern equipment in the Armed  Forces.'' Accordingly, no further delays are expected for  programs relating to the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier,  Rafale fighter aircraft, ``Triomphant''-type missile-launching  nuclear submarines (SNLE), and Helios observation satellites.  Orders for Leclerc tanks should keep coming in. Nevertheless,  brand new programs will be postponed, including those concerning  the NH-90 transport helicopter and the M5 ballistic nuclear  missile, for which a consensus had to be found between the prime  minister and the president of the Republic. The deployment of  M5 missiles in SNLE submarines, a pet project of the president,  will probably be postponed from 2005 to 2010. In exchange, the  prime minister has reportedly agreed to commission studies on a  land-based version of the M4/M45 missiles, which would replace  the S3 ground- to-ground missiles installed in the Albion  platform in 2005.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Theodore Sindikubwabo learned about the fall of  Gitarama at the 30th OAU meeting in Tunis. A correspondent  asked him for his reaction. Old Man Sindikubwabo, who has  started to forget how to count, said it does not mean anything  as the government still controls 10 prefectures. His counting  due to advanced age is wrong as Rwanda does not have 15  prefectures. Rwanda did not grow bigger after his two-month stay  in power. Rwanda has 10 prefectures and the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] controls many of them. Among these are Byumba,  Kibungo, Kigali, Gitarama and a big portion of Ruhengeri.  Sindikubwabo no longer controls 10 prefectures, but five which  he does not control completely. He controls Gisenyi, Kibuye,  Cyangugu, and Gikongoro. He does not really control Butare as we  occupy many of the prefecture's communes.    By saying that he is just camping in Gitarama and that he  will continue his journey to other prefectures, Sindikubwabo  should remember that the liberation campaign is continuing and  that the RPF is keeping up its campaign to rescue innocent  people still being killed.    In an interview with Radio France International,  Sindikubwabo  said the loss of Gitarama is an important setback, politically  and militarily. No one knows when he became a soldier.  However, this explains why his troops continue to be defeated  as though they were not present.    In short, Sindikubwabo, with a sad voice, at least accepted  that if Gitarama has been captured then things are serious.  Speaking in French, he said it is serious. He said this is  because troops in all areas -- the south, Kigali, the north --  are no longer in contact. [passage omitted].</p>

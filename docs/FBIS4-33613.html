			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Mario Rivera and Marta Moreno from </F> the NTV newscast]    [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited Central Army  units. Raul Castro was accompanied by Commander of the  Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del  Toro, and other high-ranking FAR officers and representatives of  the peoples and political organizations.    In the morning, Raul and his delegation met Division Gen.  Joaquin Quintas Sola at Central Army headquarters. The FAR  minister and his delegation first laid a wreath in honor of the  militia leaders who died in combat during the Bay of Pigs attack:    [Begin Quintas recording] We are honored today with a visit  to this Central Army territory, including parts of Matanzas and  Villa Clara Provinces. [end recording]    Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba  in Matanzas, gave a briefing on the province's economic,  political, and social situation. Garcia stressed key  accomplishments and highlighted difficulties encountered in some  economic activities and the efforts that are being made to move  forward.    Colonel Alberto Cabrera Valdez, second chief of staff of the  province, gave a briefing on combat preparation and readiness,  conservation of equipment and weapons, evaluating the defensive  readiness and awareness of the population, and the development  of the self-sufficiency program. Cabrera emphasized the work  being carried out in Varadero, Limonar, and Cienaga  Municipalities to attain the second-level defensive readiness  condition.    The evening was dedicated to visiting people's tunnels,  caves  readied for defense, and larger fortified constructions, from  which an active defense is guaranteed. The visitors were also  able to ascertain how activities are carried out in one of these  command stations. Living and working conditions are assured in  these facilities, no matter how difficult they may be. The  delegation also visited a high security area in which an  artillery unit is located. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del  Toro stressed the need to preserve and improve this type of  facility.    Another visit of interest was made to the (?espirulina)  plant, a microseaweed that allows the production of high-protein  food supplements that, in tablet form, can be used by soldiers  under any circumstances. This microseaweed has proved that it  works to combat illnesses, such as optic neuritis.    Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque asked about  the plant's investments, the cost, number of workers, and the  conditions under which this production takes place.    Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young  Communists, stated that over 50 percent of the plant workers are  young and have intermediate-level schooling.    There is no doubt after visiting these Central Army units  that this area's protection is assured and that the FAR members  and the population work intensively to assure that this is so.    [Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish at 1100 GMT on 8  June reports during its regularly scheduled "First Thing"  program that Raul Castro's delegation visited the "No. 2 Citrus  Farm," in Jaguey Grande, and met Agriculture Minister Alfredo  Jordan, Matanzas Province leaders, citrus farm representatives,  and chiefs of the Youth Labor Army's (EJT) 102d Division. The  report adds that the officials "agreed to convert the citrus  farm, considered among the world's largest, into the EJT  integral farm mode, whose efficiency has been proved in the area  and other parts of the country."]</p>

This conviction was shared by Major and Russian President  Boris Yeltsin.    Major arrived in the Russian capital on Monday [14 February]  night on his first-ever visit to the country. His talks with  Yeltsin on Tuesday resulted in the signing of a package of  documents and agreements on international issues.    Among the accords, the most important is an "unprecedented"  statement on reciprocal non-targeting of strategic nuclear  missiles no later than May 30, 1994. The statement envisages  everyday control over Russian and British nuclear forces.    The two leaders also reached an essential agreement on joint  military exercises starting from 1995 to increase their armed  forces' capability "for interaction in peacekeeping operations."    Details of further military cooperation between the two  sides  were discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd behind closed doors.    Moreover, Hurd and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev  signed an accord on cooperation in education, science and  culture. They also signed a convention against double taxation  to cement the basis of Russian-British economic relations.    According to official sources here, Britain was the third  largest trade partner with Russia in 1993, when a trade volume  of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars was registered.    Major also met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin to discuss further developing trade and economic  relations.    Summing up the results of their talks in the Kremlin, both  Major and Yeltsin told reporters that they held identical views  on certain international issues, the Bosnian crisis in  particular.    Major said he found "no major contradictions" with the  Russian leader on the Bosnian problem and both leaders were  committed to a peaceful settlement of the conflict.    Major said he and Yeltsin also agreed on the necessity to  place under U.N. control the heavy weapons of the warring  parties around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    But major pointed to Russia's "certain misunderstanding of  the essence of the NATO decision" to unleash air strikes against  the Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to  withdraw their heavy weapons from around the city by midnight  GMT on Sunday.    Yeltsin told reporters, "Our stands are identical on the  main  point -- it is necessary to hand over to the U.N. forces the  heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo. This measure will allow us  to stop the shelling of that city."    However, the Russian president stressed, "Some people are  trying to solve the problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall  not allow this to happen."    Diplomats here said other topics discussed by Major and  Yeltsin were Russia's "interaction" with the Group of Seven  industrialized countries and the European Union and Moscow's  relations with the Baltic nations.    Major will leave Moscow for Nizhniy Novgorod, a major  Russian  city on the Volga, on Wednesday and from there he will depart  for London later in the day.</p>

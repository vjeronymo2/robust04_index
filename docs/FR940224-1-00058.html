After receiving a complete application, the FMD will issue a permit to an applicant eligible for a permit under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Fees. A fee is charged for each application for a Hawaii longline limited entry permit (including initial permits, permit transfers and permit renewals). The amount of the fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude issuance of a limited entry permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Expiration. Permits issued under this section remain valid for the period specified on the permit unless transferred, revoked, suspended, or modified under 15 CFR part 904.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Renewal.

An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Transfer. (1) A permit is valid only for the vessel for which it is registered. A permit not registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The owner of a Hawaii longline limited entry permit may apply to transfer the permit:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To a different person for registration for use with the same or another vessel; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For registration for use with another U.S. vessel under the same ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An application for a permit transfer must be submitted to the Pacific Area Office in the same manner as described in paragraph (c) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) A permit will not be registered for use with a vessel that has a length overall that is greater than the length overall of the vessel that had the greatest length overall and that landed Pacific pelagic management unit species under a limited entry permit during the moratorium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Only a person who is eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) may be issued or may hold (by ownership or otherwise) a limited entry permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

In order to be considered by the Regional Director, the appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the reasons therefor, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action(s) by the FMD.

The Regional Director will notify the appellant of the decision and the reasons therefor, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Director determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Director may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose.

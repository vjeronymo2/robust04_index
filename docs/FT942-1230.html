			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Yeltsin signs plan to bring Russia back into Europe: FT writers report from the start of the EU leaders' two-day summit in Corfu President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday signed a landmark 'partnership' agreement with the European Union which strengthens political and economic ties, and holds out the prospect of a free trade area at the turn of the century. Mr Yeltsin, visibly pleased, told EU leaders at the Corfu summit the agreement was of historic importance: 'There is a clear definition of the various stages of bringing Russia back into economic Europe as an equal partner.' The partnership and co-operation agreement - similar in scope to the pact signed this month between the EU and Ukraine - is a central plank in western strategy aimed at stabilising post-communist Russia. It also aims to ease Russian nationalist fears of encirclement as more countries which were formerly Soviet satellites or neutrals, from the Baltic to the Adriatic, are drawn into the democratic, market-oriented orbit of the European Union. In a telling sequence, minutes after Mr Yeltsin was whisked away in his armoured black Zil, the leaders of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway stepped into his place in St George's Chapel to sign accession treaties to the European Union. Poland and Hungary have already applied to join the EU, with the Czechs in the wings. Yet EU diplomats believe their policy of embracing Russia is paying off. This week, Russia became the 21st country to enter the Nato alliance's Partnership for Peace, dropping its earlier demands for a special status and joining its former communist satellites in central and eastern Europe. Next month, the Group of Seven industrialised nations will welcome Russia as a member of the G8 at their summit in Naples. The new political grouping is calculated to appeal to Russia's demands to be treated as a great power. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the partnership agreement was more than a symbolic act. It amounted to a quantum leap in relations with Russia which would encourage foreign investment in Russia and liberalise trade. Last year, Russian exports to the Union were valued at Dollars 17.4bn (Pounds 11.4bn), around 50 per cent of its total exports. Main items included minerals (44 per cent) and wood products (14 per cent). EU exports to Russia were Dollars 13.5bn, with one third being electrical machines and parts; processed foodstuffs made up 16 per cent. The agreement contains several important 'safeguard' mechanisms aimed at regulating two-way trade before 1998, when the EU and Russia will decide whether to embark on the far more ambitious goal of a free trade area. Its main features include: EU support for Russian accession to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs and the successor World Trade Organisation. Meantime, both sides agree to consult before increasing tariffs on each other. Removal of all EU quotas on Russian exports, with the exception of certain textile and steel products. But Moscow may introduce limited restrictions in sectors facing heavy jobs losses, or those which could lose market share to more competitive western companies. Safeguard clauses may be introduced on either side to curb sudden surges of imports, similar to those in Gatt. These require parties to show there has been substantial injury to domestic producers. Enriched and natural uranium. Thanks to pressure from France, which has the largest share of the EU market, the pact includes safeguard clauses similar to an earlier 1989 pact with Russia. The aim is to conclude a separate agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997. Investment and business. The pact removes obstacles to the free flow of capital, including direct investment as well as repatriation of profits. Once established in Russia, EU companies cannot be subjected to restrictive legislation for three years following the passage of any new law. Mobility of labour and management should increase, too. The most vexed topic in the negotiations concerned the Russian banking sector. After much huffing and puffing, Moscow has agreed to scrap by 1996 a decree maintaining curbs on foreign banks. Meantime, this law will not apply retrospectively to the five banks already given licences in Russia - Credit Lyonnais and Generale de Banque of France; Dresdner Bank of Germany; and the Dutch INGBank and ABN Amro. Mr Yeltsin called for trust between the EU and Russia and welcomed ever closer political and economic integration inside the Union. Russia intended to press for 'more and more integration' in the Commonwealth of Independent States, he said.</p>

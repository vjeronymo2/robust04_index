			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (7): Threat to life blood - Small is no longer beautiful in business ITALY'S small businesses, whose flexibility has pulled the country out of recession several times since the second world war, are facing a serious threat as high interest rates and rising labour costs reduce their ability to remain competitive at home and abroad. Small- to medium-sized companies are the life-blood of Italy's economy. They account for an estimated 70 per cent of industry's total sales and about 40 per cent of exports. Confindustria, Italy's employers' federation, estimates that companies with fewer than 20 employees make up 95 per cent of all Italian companies and employ 36 per cent of the industrial workforce. Companies with fewer than 100 employees are estimated to account for 99 per cent of all companies and employ 59 per cent of the industrial workforce. The combined strength of these small companies - most of them the fruits of first-generation entrepreneurs - is all the more admirable in view of the lack of interest that successive post-war Italian governments have shown in them. Indeed, the nation's industrial policy has focused on big companies, both in the state and private sectors. But Italy's entrepreneurs have become increasingly frustrated that almost no government help has been forthcoming in their hour of need. They want the government to acknowledge and base its economic policies on the fact that Italy's economic future lies in industry, especially in small businesses, and not, for example, in tourism or agriculture. A survey of 355 companies with an average of 36 employees commissioned by Confapi, the Italian confederation of small and medium-sized industry, showed that in the half of 1992 many small companies were experiencing financial difficulties because of the rise in interest rates. The difficult financial situation was compounded by continued weakness in the domestic economy in the six-month period; both exports and domestic orders showed a decline. Labour costs rose by an average 3.74 per cent in the first half, the survey noted, but Confapi officials said prospects in this area had improved since abolition, at the end of July, of Italy's scala mobile wage indexation system. Indeed, Italy's increasingly rigid labour laws and the rise in employers' contributions to the state over the past decade are mainly to blame for the loss of flexibility and competitiveness of small businesses. For a company with annual sales of up to L5bn (Pounds 2.3m), the labour costs per employee rose by 79 per cent to L29.7m (Pounds 13,884) between 1982 and 1988, while a company with sales of between L25bn to L100bn saw labour costs per employee jumped by about 90 per cent in the same period, to between L35.7m (Pounds 16,690) and L37.9m (Pounds 17,718). But what is perhaps more worrying for small businesses is that the advance in technology can no longer help them to remain competitive. In the early 1980s, technology concentrated on individual machines which resulted in some degree of convergence in productivity between big and small companies. But technology has now progressed to such an extent that entire manufacturing systems to replace dozens of workers are being produced. In the 1980s, small businesses tended to invest in machinery which increased their productive capacity rather than levels of efficiency. The disadvantage of this decision can now be felt as productivity levels slow down. Another problem facing small companies today is that an increased number of them have become dependent on larger companies for most of their orders. The percentage of sub-contractors among companies with between 10 and 100 employees had risen from 45.5 per cent in 1978 to 57.7 per cent in 1984 and is estimated to have risen further since then. One solution to this predicament would be for small companies in the same industry to merge (already happening in the textiles and furniture industries), or to be taken over by a larger company. Merging would narrow the large gap in Italian industry between the tens of thousands of small businesses and the handful of very large companies - and facilitate long-term borrowing from banks to buy necessary new technology. Financing has always been problematic for small businesses in Italy because, unlike their counterparts in Anglo-Saxon economies, they have been unable to tap the stock market or other financial markets. Neither can they get banks to inject capital, which happens often in Germany, because in Italy banks are not allowed to take stakes in companies. Furthermore, they have to compete with the state for private savings. So small businesses rely heavily on short-term financing, either in the form of trade credits or bank loans, though some small business owners have clubbed together in so-called mutual guarantee schemes, to get more attractive loans from the banks. Confapi is concerned about the high proportion of short-term financing among its members - estimated at 70 per cent - and has asked the government for funds of L7,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to help small businesses convert them into longer-term loans. Some economists believe that the 'small is beautiful' concept may have run its course in Italy, and that the small companies which survive the current difficulties will be those which have made the necessary technological leap, or those least dependent on big companies. They fear that others, especially those in troubled industries, will either have to merge, sell out, or close down. But it would be foolish to underestimate the resilience of Italy's entrepreneurial class, which has triumphed over economic adversity in the past. Italy's 'piccoli forti' could well live to fight another day.</p>

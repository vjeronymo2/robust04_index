			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu will meet the chief of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) in Tokyo next week to discuss the North Korean  nuclear situation, a Ministry official said Friday.    Han pushed up his departure to Europe to meet IAEA  Director-General Hans Blix on April 12 in Tokyo, where he plans  to attend a seminar on the nuclear industry.    In accordance with the U.N. Security Council's presidential  statement last week calling for additional inspections in North  Korea, the IAEA is expected to send a message to Pyongyang soon  proposing talks on arranging the checks.    Han and Blix will discuss the practical "deadline" for  conducting the additional inspections and providing the right  conditions so that North Korea accepts full nuclear checks, the  official said.</p>

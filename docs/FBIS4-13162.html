			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The United States has warned Jordan that unless  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] stops operating from its  soil, Jordan will join the list of terror-supporting countries.    So far Amman has not formally reacted to the warning issued  yesterday by Prime Minister Rabin, but Jerusalem is convinced  that Husayn will take steps against Hamas. Our political  correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen has more:    [Begin recording] [Rosen] [passage omitted] The news  conference held by Rabin and Peres close to midnight last night  was deliberately dramatic. Jerusalem believes that such a  public onslaught will deal King Husayn a hard blow and force him  to take action. The decision to act publicly, which Rabin made  yesterday afternoon, was preceded by a series of secret  messages. Elyaqim Rubinstein spoke with Jordanian Ambassador in  Washington Fayiz al-Tarawinah. Senior U.S. elements also spoke  with Amman. Jordan has not yet reacted officially. Unofficial  elements said today: There is not much we can do.    Rabin says Jordan is running the risk of being placed on the  U.S. list of terror-supporting countries; the Jordanians must  choose between good relations with Washington and good relations  with Hamas.    [Rabin] Not only does the Israeli Government take a grave  view of this, but it will be unable to continue as if nothing  has happened if this situation continues.    [Rosen] A military operation? asked journalists. No  comment, replied Rabin. It is safe to assume that he was not  referring to that. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1730 GMT on 15 April carries an announcer-read report adding  that "Israel refuses to accept the Jordanian reaction conveyed  by a senior official, rejecting the prime minister's warning  with regard to Hamas. Israeli political elements said that  Jordan will be given some more time so that it can be determined  whether the Jordanians are genuinely curbing the freedom of  movement of the Hamas office in Amman."]</p>

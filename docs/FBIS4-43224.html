			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 15 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday [15 June] that two of its  inspectors continued working at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear  facility despite Pyongyng's withdrawal from the Agency.    "The inspectors have not yet been asked to leave Yongbyon,"  said IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer.    He added that the inspectors were continuing their work, but  gave no further details.    Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state who is  handling the North Korean standoff, warned in a CNN television  interview that the very serious situation would deteriorate  further if North Korea were to expel the two inspectors.    The IAEA says the inspectors are in North Korea in the  framework of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which North  Korea has not pulled out from.    But North Korea's defence minister said in remarks reported  Wednesday that the country will not allow any further  inspections of its nuclear facilities, which foreign governments  suspect of developing nuclear weapons.    Marshal O Jin-U, speaking at a banquet late Tuesday for a  visiting Vietnamese delegation, said his government had taken  "self-defensive measures of withdrawing from the (IAEA) and of  no longer allowing any kind of inspection."    On Monday, North Korea announced its immediate withdrawal  from the IAEA after the UN nuclear watchdog body suspended  technical aid to Pyongyang because of its refusal of full  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    The marshal said the IAEA had recently acted "arrogantly and  insolently" when it demanded nuclear inspections "with the  threat of sanctions."    He added that North Korea would uphold "our-style socialism"  and reunify the divided Korea with the guidance of Kim Jong-Il,  who took over the supreme command of the People's Army from his  aging father, President Kim Il-Sung, in December 1991.</p>

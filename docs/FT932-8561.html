			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei easier as Hong Kong puts on 1.7 per cent SHARE PRICES fluctuated to end on a mixed note after investors bought equities on dips, but late futures selling left the Nikkei average easier on balance in light trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The 225-issue average was finally 91.36 off at 20,565.51, after setting a day's high of 20,689.49 and low of 20,520.03. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished at 1,611.25, up 5.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.54 to 1,243.57. Volume languished at 330m shares, compared to Friday's 567m, and declines narrowly outscored rises by 515 to 485, with 182 issues unchanged. Brokers said buy orders from government-managed public funds supported equity prices during the session, but that no specific sector or issue gave a boost to the Nikkei average. Investors expressed the hope that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which led the market during its major advance in March, will settle above the Y1m mark; a break through this level would have a positive effect on the market and, in all likelihood, encourage a wave of fresh buying, brokers added. NTT closed Y12,000 higher at Y997,000. Meanwhile, most market participants are expected to stay on the sidelines in the short term, in order to examine the agglomeration of company earnings reports due to be released this week. Foreign exchange considerations, too, are expected to keep institutional investors cautious. Investors, in particular, are expected to study Friday's April money supply data for any signs of economic recovery. The banking sector drew active buying. Mitsubishi moved forward Y40 to Y2,510, Daiwa Y30 to Y1,070 and Sumitomo Y20 to Y2,010. Motor issues gained a little ground: Toyota appreciated Y10 to Y1,700 and Honda firmed Y10 to Y1,420. Telecommunications equipment manufacturers eased. NEC finished Y10 softer at Y1,030 and Fujitsu Y13 lower at Y792. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 38.27 higher at 22,828.74 in volume of 16.0m shares. Roundup STRONG performances featured among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG finished sharply higher on growing optimism about the resumption of meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. The Hang Seng index climbed 118.83, or 1.7 per cent, to a record close of 7,124.12. Turnover amounted to HKDollars 5.4bn. Blue chips reaped the biggest gains, with HSBC Holdings adding HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 72, followed by Cheung Kong, which gained 60 cents at HKDollars 27.60. Jardine Matheson was another strong performer, rising HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56. AUSTRALIA slipped towards the close as gold shares retreated following lower world commodity prices. The All Ordinaries index lost 11.6 to 1,686.9, while the golds index declined 28.7 to 1,723.3. Turnover came to ADollars 305.8m. In the resources sector, BHP receded 6 cents to ADollars 13.90 and CRA shed 20 cents to ADollars 13. Western Mining eased 5 cents to ADollars 5.28. Among specialist gold stocks, Placer Pacific dipped 2 cents to ADollars 2.55 and Plutonic 20 cents to ADollars 4.70. ANZ declined 6 cents to ADollars 3.54 after reporting slightly disappointing interim results last Friday. KUALA LUMPUR extended its gains of last week by a marginal 0.36 in the composite index to 720.36. There was selected foreign buying of blue chip stocks, but turnover contracted to MDollars 1.70bn from MDollars 1.93bn. MANILA gathered upward pace, the index rising 11.31 to 1,616.04 in turnover of 555m pesos. An improvement in San Miguel 'B' shares, up 2 pesos at 127 pesos, helped to support the market. TAIWAN was disappointed that the central bank did not cut interest rates over the weekend as had been anticipated. The weighted index lost 105.42, or 2.3 per cent, at 4,460.11 in TDollars 23.9bn turnover. Among the weakest spots, Acer fell TDollars 1.10 to TDollars 24.70 and China Steel TDollars 1.10 to TDollars 21.10. SEOUL was stronger on bargain hunting following recent weakness. The index put on 11.79 at 717.17 in turnover of Won513bn. Financial issues performed well, with Commercial Bank of Korea up Won370 to Won10,000. SINGAPORE lost ground on profit-taking after its record-breaking run last week. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 17.12 to 1,846.27. Sembawang Shipyard, which was among the leaders in the past week, closed 40 cents down at SDollars 12.60 in volume of 1.8m shares. BOMBAY opened higher but closed the session sharply lower after investors took profits following recent gains. The BSE index settled 56.53 off at 2,300.99. NEW ZEALAND showed a good performance from Telecom ahead of today's annual results, the shares gaining 4 cents at NZDollars 2.79. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 7.44 to 1,588.34 in turnover of NZDollars 27m.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei kicks off 1992 with a jump of 3.6 per cent THE HIGHER yen, lower bond yields and last week's record-breaking advance on Wall Street encouraged buyers on the first trading day of this year, and the Nikkei average soared 3.6 per cent in the half-day session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei finished 817.41 stronger at 23,801.18 after opening at the day's low of 23,030.66 and attaining a day's high of 23,801.78 just before the close. A total of 180m shares changed hands. Advances overwhelmed declines by 879 to 103 and 81 issues remained unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 48.75 to 1,763.43 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 6.00 to 1,347.22. Traders said investors had started to react to positive fundamentals. The Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate by a half-point to 4.5 per cent on December 30, the last trading day of 1991. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel Pacific, said: 'The rally is a follow-through from last year as most investors were absent from the market and were unable to react.' He forecast that the Nikkei average was likely to reach 25,000 during the next month. Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, an analyst at Nikko Research Institute, said that although the index had room to advance, turnover would remain subdued due to the lack of trading by domestic investors. He added that most domestic institutions still held losses on investments and would not become active participants until such holdings were liquidated. Last year's total turnover on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 91.7bn shares, down 23 per cent on the year and the lowest since 1982. Total trading value dropped to Y107,108bn, one-third of that in 1989, the peak of the bull market, and down 38.7 per cent on the year. Investors sought interest rate-sensitive shares on hopes of a further decline in interest rates. The yield on the 129 benchmark bond closed at 5.34 per cent, after falling to 5.32 per cent during the session, the lowest yield on a benchmark bond since October 1989. Electric power companies gained, with Tokyo Electric Power moving ahead Y160 to Y3,700, while shipbuilders also advanced. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries climbed Y28 to Y594 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y33 to Y729. High-technology issues were stronger on bargain hunting in spite of the rise in the yen against the dollar. Sony surged Y300 to Y4,400 and TDK put on Y200 to Y4,200. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 718.18 to 24,887.27 on volume of 9.4m shares. Total turnover for last year on the OSE first section fell 47.7 per cent from 1990 to Y18,722bn. However, thanks to active futures trading, turnover for the Nikkei 225 futures soared 35.9 per cent to Y536,725bn last year. Roundup TOKYO'S optimistic start to the year encouraged the rest of the Pacific Rim yesterday. SINGAPORE surged on news that the US and Singapore had agreed in principle to transfer a US naval logistics unit from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Singapore. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 19.56 or 1.3 per cent to 1,500.45 in turnover of SDollars 135.8m, against a previous SDollars 62.1m. Shipyards were seen as direct beneficiaries of the US naval unit transfer. Keppel Corp, Singapore's biggest shipyard, topped the gainers list, rising 40 cents to SDollars 8.55, while foreign shares of the government-backed Singapore Shipbuilding appreciated 23 cents to SDollars 2.62. NEW ZEALAND started the new year on a strong note as equities caught up with the recent surge on international stock markets. The NZSE-40 index reached an intraday peak of 1,546.91 before easing back to close 31.08 or 2.1 per cent ahead at 1,535.86. Turnover grew to NZDollars 25.5m from the NZDollars 14.3m of last Tuesday. AUSTRALIA gained 1.6 per cent in the first half-hour of trading on continued hopes of an early interest rate cut, but then settled back to close just 0.9 per cent up on disappointing trade data for November. The All Ordinaries index ended 15.4 ahead at 1,675.1, after touching 1,685.9, in turnover of ADollars 192m, up from ADollars 115m. The market was also pulled back by BHP, which rose as high as ADollars 14.20 on news that it would begin oil exploration drilling offshore in southern Australia, but then receded to leave a net gain of 16 cents at ADollars 14.00. TAIWAN saw hectic dealing, mostly on international comparisons but also on speculation that its central bank will lower the rediscount rate by half a point to 5.75 per cent within the week. The weighted index, which posted a small gain of 12.30 on Saturday, rose 79.20 or 1.7 per cent to 4,692.17 in turnover of TDollars 33.9bn, up from TDollars 25.7bn. HONG KONG registered its first decline in two weeks as the Hang Seng index eased 0.16 to 4306.97 in turnover up from HKDollars 966m to HKDollars 1.22bn. Bargain hunting balanced profit-taking on the day, but uncertainty over Sino-US trade friction continued to dampen sentiment ahead of the bipartite trade negotiations in Washington on Friday. SEOUL took a break after its recent rise that was fuelled by active foreign buying. The composite index was down 0.21 to 650.10 in turnover of Won440.2bn on the first full trading session this year, compared with Won229bn in Saturday's half-day trading. KUALA LUMPUR finished higher after light trading on selective bargain hunting. The composite index ended 4.35 up at 557.34. Turnover rose to MDollars 108m from MDollars 76.9m. BANGKOK's bank shares took the SET index up 7.69 to 719.50 in turnover of Bt5.04bn, the largest in almost a month, although declines led advances by almost two-to-one across the board. The three most active stocks were banks: Bangkok Bank jumped Bt34 to Bt502 in turnover of Bt676m, Thai Farmers Bank Bt32 to Bt466 in Bt433m and Thai Military Bank Bt16 to Bt326 in Bt425m. JAKARTA decided that higher tax on corporate bank deposits was good for the equity market, where the index rose 2.37 to 249.76 in active trade. Volume was still fairly low at 3.95m shares, against Friday's 3.11m.</p>

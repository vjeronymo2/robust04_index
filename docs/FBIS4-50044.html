The Main Current Problems in Rural Economic  Development    1.01 Since the late 1980's, the deep-seated contradictions  and problems which had long existed in China's rural economic  development, gradually emerged. These contradictions and  problems are mainly reflected in the sluggish growth of  peasants' income in recent years. Since the beginning of 1992,  given a new period of speedy growth in the national economy and  an unprecedented thriving market economy, the sluggish growth of  peasants' income has not changed. On the contrary, this has  made the various new circumstances and new problems which are  unfavorable to agriculture and peasants salient and once again  is drawing people's great attention. These problems include:  The continuous deterioration of trading conditions for  agriculture, the issue of IOU's for the purchase of farm  products, the outflow of agricultural funds, the holding up of  farmlands by development zones, and the added burden on  peasants. In the meantime, given the further removal of price  controls on farm products and the conditions of a market  economy, the questions of whether or not there is a need to  protect agriculture and how to protect it have become new hot  topics in policy research. All these problems, which have  occurred as China changes to a market economic system, seem to  imply that the development of China's agriculture and rural  economy has entered a crucial period of change.    The Importance of Achieving Growth in Peasant  Incomes    1.02 Compared with that at the previous stage, the growth of  the rural economy during the 1989-1992 period had some totally  different characteristics, namely that the growth in peasant  incomes basically stagnated despite the fact that the supply of  farm products picked up. Between 1989 and 1991, excluding the  price factor, the per capita net income of peasants across the  country only grew by 0.7 percent. Together with the 5.9 percent  in rehabilitation growth in 1992, the average growth rate during  the four years was only 1.88 percent. During the same period,  calculated at constant prices, the total agricultural output  value had an annual average increase of 5.1 percent and grain  saw an increase of 2.9 percent; other major farm products,  except cotton whose production decreased in 1992 as a result of  insect disasters and which only had an average annual growth of  2.2 percent, such as oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops,  meats, fruits, vegetables, and aquatic products had increases  ranging from 6 to 10 percent. The increased output of farm  products unaccompanied by a growth in peasant incomes, by little  growth, or even by negative growth in certain years, has been  seldom seen since reform and since the PRC was founded.    1.03 Another phenomenon which attracts the same attention as  the excessively slow growth in peasant incomes is the  continuously widening income gaps between the cities and the  countryside and between different regions. For eight years  running since 1985, the income of urban residents grew much  quicker than that of peasants. Between 1989 and 1992, the annual  growth calculated by actual incomes showed that cities were 5  percentage points higher than the countryside. This has once  again widened the income gap between cities and the countryside  which had been narrowing for some time since reform. In 1978,  the ratio between peasants' per capita net income and urban  residents' per capita living expenditure income was 1:2.37. In  1984, it narrowed to 1:1.71, and in 1992, it widened again to  1:2.33. The gap has returned to the pre-reform level.    1.04 The income gap between peasants in different regions  has also increased very obviously. In 1992, the ratio between  peasants in the west, central, and eastern regions was  100:115:166 and the highest-income province (Shanghai) had  income 4.49 times higher than the lowest-income province  (Gansu). In 1983, the figures were 100:126:144 and 2.69 times  respectively. During the period of slow growth in peasant  incomes between 1989 and 1992, the annual growth in peasant  incomes in the eastern region was 2.29 percent and that in  central and the western regions 1.44 and 1.27 percent  respectively. This shows that the income gap between peasants  in different regions still tends to widen continuously and that  the growth in peasant incomes in many regions has stagnated or  even decreased in recent years.    1.05 The slow growth in peasant incomes not only directly  affects the upgrading of peasants' quality of life and  agricultural reinvestment but also has a negative influence on  the growth of the entire national economy. In the three years  between 1989 and 1991, the actual per capita living expenditure  of peasants across the country only increased by 0.07 yuan each  year. We can see from this that in many regions, peasants'  living standards virtually have not improved and the so-called  added burden on peasants is related to this. During the same  period, peasants' per capita expenditure on the purchase of  productive fixed assets (excluding the price factor) decreased  by 22.2, 35.4, and 18.2 percent from 1988. Peasants'  expenditure on purchasing chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and  sheets of plastic film in recent years have also decreased and  this will have an adverse and sluggish influence on agricultural  production.    1.06 It is also necessary to point out that peasant incomes  are becoming an increasingly important variable in the flowing  course of the national economy. As the degree of  commercialization and monetization of the rural economy is  continuing to rise, the proportion of money income in peasant  incomes has risen from 40 percent in the pre-reform period to  nearly 70 percent at the present time. This means that an  increase or decrease of one percentage point in peasant incomes  has a much greater influence on the demand expansion of the  national economy than in the past. Due to the sluggish growth  in peasant incomes, in 1992, the proportion of rural retail  sales volume in the total volume of retail sales decreased by  5.5 percentage points from 1984 and by 3.1 percentage points  from 1988. In the four years, peasants refrained from  purchasing 82 billion yuan's worth of commodities and this is  one of the main reasons why the home market has been sluggish  during the past few years.    1.07 For a long time, due to the absolute short supply  of farm products, the guiding principle in formulating rural  policy was always to give priority to ensuring the supply goal  of farm products. However, following the radical changes in the  supply-demand pattern of farm products in the mid-1980's, the  growth of agricultural production no longer simply corresponded  to the growth in peasant incomes and the importance in peasant  incomes as a motivation for growth had greatly increased.  Furthermore, at the microscopic level, since reform, peasants  can expand supply only on the premise of increasing income and,  if the peasant incomes are as bad as expected, the government  will find it very difficult to achieve the supply goal.  Therefore, like maintaining the growth of a balanced  supply-demand structure for farm products, maintaining the  sustained growth in peasant incomes should become the basic goal  for the formulation of China's agricultural and rural policies  in the 1990's.    The Main Factors Restricting Growth in Peasant  Incomes    1.08 It is generally held that two factors have resulted in  the sluggish growth in peasant incomes since 1989. First, the  trading conditions for agriculture have worsened. Compared with  1988, the price index of farm products rose by 10.87 percent in  1992 (prices on the grain market have fallen since 1989,  reaching their nadir in October 1992), whereas the price index  of agricultural capital goods rose by 33.59 percent. Second,  during the period of economic rationalization, the speedy growth  of township and town enterprises was curbed. Between 1989 and  1991, peasant incomes from nonagricultural sources fell by 25  percentage points from the previous years, the percentage  basically remaining at the 1988 level.    1.09 However, a deeper analysis shows that in addition to  the unfavorable factors, which are caused by the abovementioned  short-term policies, there are deep-seated reasons for the  sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years. In order to  demonstrate this, we can compare the changes in the main sources  of peasant income growth at different stages since 1978. The  speediest growth in peasant incomes was in the 1978-1984 period  when the actual average per capita income growth was 15.1  percent annually. The same period also saw farm products having  their speediest growth, an average annual growth of 6.5 percent.  At this stage, the growth in peasant incomes mainly benefited  from the supernormal growth in farm products in the early years  of reform and iis characteristics were that agricultural  production increased as did peasant incomes. At the second  stage, namely between 1985 and 1988, despite the fact that the  growth rate of agriculture lowered to 4.1 percent, peasants' per  capita actual income retained an annual growth rate of 5  percent. The main reason for this was that township and town  enterprises began to emerge during this period and income from  nonagricultural sectors supported the continuous growth in  peasant incomes. The characteristics of this stage can be  summed up as the slowing down of agricultural growth and the  continuous growth in peasant incomes. However, during the  1989-1992 period, the growth rate of agriculture rose to 5.1  percent but the actual per capita income of peasants only grew  by 2 percent, representing an increase in agricultural  production unaccompanied by an increase in peasant incomes.  This "increase in output unaccompanied by an increase in  income" in fact means that the major motivating factors which  had supported the sustained growth in peasant incomes in the  first two stages, namely the growth patterns in agriculture and  in township and town enterprises, have already undergone some  phased change. In fact, as the analysis given below shows, the  real challenges we are faced with are that the previous growth  pattern of the rural economy has difficulty in supporting the  sustained growth in peasant incomes and that, if radical  readjustment measures are lacking, then the sluggish growth in  peasant incomes in recent years will probably become a long-term  tendency. Below, we are going to analyze the major phased  changes facing rural economic development.    1.10 First, there have been profound changes in the supply  pattern of farm products and in the form of agricultural growth.  Prior to reform, China had been short of farm product supplies  for a long time. The speedy growth of agriculture motivated by  rural reform reversed this situation in just a few years. In  approximately the mid-1980's, China's farm-product supply  pattern began to radically change. This was first reflected in  the changes in the consumption level and consumption structure  of urban and rural residents. Following the improvement in the  supply of foodstuffs, in 1983, the per capita daily calorie  intake from food by peasants in China exceeded 2,400  kilocalories for the first time. In the mid-1980's, the daily  calorie intake from food by urban and rural residents had  already reached 2,900 kilocalories. After urban and rural  residents steadily passed the point of simply having enough food  and clothing, Engel's Coefficient began to steadily lower, the  per capita direct consumption of grain by urban and rural  residents began to fall in 1986 in absolute terms, and food  consumption began to change from an increase in quantity to the  upgrading of the quality structure. Second, following the  change of the consumption structure, agricultural growth began  to feel the restriction of demand and the income elasticity of  major farm products began to decrease.    According to  estimates by relevant experts, comparing the 1985-1992 period  and the 1979-1984 period, the income elasticity of grain fell  from 0.63 to -0.15, that of oil-bearing crops fell from 2.94 to  0.49, that of pork from 1.34 to 0.53, that of poultry from 3.06  to 0.75, that of sugar-bearing crops from 0.94 to 0.09, and only  the income elasticity of aquatic products rose from 0.52 to  0.86, that of eggs basically remained the same, and that of  cloth fell from 0.76 to zero. Since the mid-1980's, it has been  difficult to sell farm products. Although China's per capita  grain output in the 1990-1991 period was basically the same as  in the 1983-1984 period, prices on the grain market fell  considerably and grain did not sell easily, a clear sign that  agricultural growth was restricted by demand. The change from  the restriction of supply to the restriction of demand or,  rather, from mainly aggregate contradictions to structural  contradictions is a historical change in China's farm products  supply-demand structure. This change began in the mid-1980's  and will play a role for a long time in future agricultural  growth. Precisely because of the motivation of the change in  this pattern, China's agricultural growth pattern will change  from the previous pure quantity-type growth to a type of growth  stressing both quantity and quality.    1.11 The restriction of demand is not all bad. Rather, it  makes it possible to use market mechanisms to effectively  allocate resources. However, what we have to say here is that  the sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years, and the  prospects for peasant income growth in the future, are directly  bound up with the changes in this pattern. First, given the  short supply of farm products in the early years of reform, the  "sponge effect," namely where an increase in supply is  immediately swallowed by demand, no longer exists. This means  that the growth in peasant incomes no longer simply corresponds  to the growth in agricultural output. Second, given the  existence of the restrictions of demand, if the supply structure  of farm products does not adjust to the changes in their demand  structure, it also means that an increase in output is not  accompanied by an increase in income. In fact, the readjustment  of China's agricultural production structure already lags behind  the changes in the supply-demand pattern. This is reflected by  the very salient structural contradictions in the supply-demand  structure in recent years. Third, once China officially rejoins  GATT as a member, the pressure from external competition will  increase and this also means that it will be much more difficult  to support peasant incomes with agricultural growth. Lastly, if  the course of agricultural transformation is not accompanied by  technological progress, the effect of decreasing marginal  returns from agricultural investment will occur conspicuously  and peasants' efforts to increase income will be partially  invalidated by the accelerated increase in agricultural costs.    1.12 Therefore, we have come to the viewpoint that the  characteristics of great phased changes have already begun to  appear in China's agricultural development and this is a token  that agricultural development is stepping into a new period. We  can conclude from this that if we are unable to effectively  promote structural reform, it is already impossible for the  current structural framework of agriculture to sustain a  continuous fast growth rate in peasant incomes, although  peasants derive 60 to 70 percent of their income from  agriculture at the present time.    1.13 We are now going to analyze the profound changes facing  the development of township and town enterprises. As for the  question of increasing peasant incomes, people set more hope on  township and town enterprises. As the great invention by  Chinese peasants in the 1980's, township and town enterprises  really play a vital role in opening employment channels for  peasants and increasing their income. The development of  township and town enterprises in recent years has been not slow.  In 1992, their total output value reached 1,700 billion yuan,  of which 1,300 billion was in industrial output value and  represented more than one-third of China's total industrial  output value. However, since the late 1980's, the tendency has  obviously appeared in the development of township and town  enterprises that their capital is becoming increasingly  intensive and their ability to employ labor has weakened. The  output value of township and town enterprises in 1992 doubled  that of 1988, while the number of their employees only increased  by 10.9 percent, showing a decrease in employment elasticity  from 0.35 to 0.13. Since 1988, the fixed assets of collective  enterprises at the township and village levels have increased by  an annual average of 18.4 percent, while the number of employees  hired per 10,000 yuan of assets decreased from 3.1 in 1988 to  1.8 in 1991. Between 1984 and 1988, township and town  enterprises employed 12.6 million people from the agricultural  sector, while only an annual average of 2.6 million were  employed during the 1989-1992 period, representing a fraction of  that during the former period.    1.14 There will be an annual increase in surplus manpower by  over 10 million people in China's rural areas in the future.  The question of how to dissolve this huge unemployment pressure  and fully utilize and develop these rich labor resources is the  most challenging one for rural development in the 1990's. The  problem now is that the manpower not absorbed by agriculture  cannot be absorbed by township and town enterprises, which we  have always considered the best Chinese-style way to resolve  unemployment in rural areas! Does this indicate that there is a  need to reassess our previous understanding all over again?    1.15 In fact, some recent analyses have already pointed out  the inherent weaknesses in the structure and composition of  township and town enterprises. The following are the two major  weaknesses: First, township and town enterprises are extremely  scattered and are not in step with urbanization, so they are  unable to effectively nurture the development of tertiary  industry and this in turn leads to the unbalanced development of  secondary and tertiary industries among township and town  enterprises. This is an important point which restricts  township and town enterprises from expanding employment.  Second, the community-based nature of township and town  enterprises restricts the flow of production elements and,  coupled with other factors, leads to the distortion of the  prices of production elements, thus causing the township and  town enterprises in some developed regions to "replace labor  with capital" too soon.    1.16 We have come to the view that the contradictions  covered up in the early years of the development of China's  township and town enterprises are being gradually exposed. This  means that, like agriculture, township and town enterprises are  also faced with major phased changes in their further  development. From this, we have come to the conclusion that if  we fail to effectively readjust the strategy for township and  town enterprises, the present pattern can no longer effectively  resolve the unemployment problem in rural areas nor can it  continue to support the comparatively quick growth in peasant  incomes.    Price Protection and Structural Readjustment    1.17 According to estimates by the quarters concerned, in  order for peasants to lead a comparatively comfortable life by  the end of this century, their per capita net income should  reach 1,200 yuan (at 1990 prices) which requires that peasant  incomes increase at an annual rate of 6.3 percent from 1993  onward. Obviously, under the restrictive conditions mentioned  previously, it is very difficult to achieve this goal. In other  words, in order to promote the continuous growth in peasant  incomes for a period of time to come, it is necessary to make a  policy choice about opening up new sources of income. In  discussions in recent years, various different views have  gradually concentrated on a choice between two policies: The  first is that we should adopt a price protection policy for  major farm products and the second is that we should formulate  and adopt a new policy which promotes structural readjustment.    1.18 The price protection policy we are talking about here  is whereby, after controls on grain prices have been lifted, the  state should fix minimum protective prices for grain purchases  to stabilize grain production and simultaneously increase  peasant incomes. Most people agree with this policy proposal  but some disagree and have raised several questions worthy of  further discussion. The first is the question of whether or not  we are able to grant subsidies. They maintain that financial  subsidies are needed to form a price higher than the market  price; that if the protective price is inappropriate, its  protective role does not work; and that if the protective price  is too high, the financial burden will be very heavy. In  adopting price protection policies, North America, the EC,  Japan, and Taiwan each have only a small agricultural population  which is approximately 20 percent of the total population. That  is to say, the majority subsidizes the minority. China's  present agricultural population accounts for 70 percent or more  of the total and, in these circumstances, it is very difficult  to pursue a price protection policy. The second question is  that of efficiency. The price protection policy inevitably  causes price distortions and leads to the loss of efficiency in  resources allocation. In this respect, developed countries have  also drawn a lesson. While creating a huge burden, subsidies  also lead to a great surplus of farm products and an excess  waste of resources. Moreover, given the serious unemployment  situation in China's rural areas, the interests of the price  protection policy will be shared by the large rural population  and will in fact increase the cost of shifting rural manpower  from the agricultural sector and will, in turn, cost us the  opportunity for structural readjustment. In addition, there is  the problem that agricultural costs chase prices, namely the  "return of price parity." In short, before adopting the price  protection policy, we need to consider various factors and weigh  all advantages and disadvantages. Our basic view is that it is,  after all, necessary to pursue the protective price system at  the present stage. We should at least ensure that peasants do  not make a loss from growing grain crops. This is also out of  consideration for the country's grain security. However, we must  know that this policy is very limited in resolving the problem  of peasant incomes and that it is very unrealistic if we set all  our hopes of increasing peasant incomes on protective prices in  the future.    1.19 In our opinion, it is a more practical and positive  idea to seek and open up new sources for increasing peasant  incomes in the future through adopting a new policy or measure  which promotes structural readjustment and through promoting the  further reform of the rural industrial structure. The  structural readjustment we are talking about here not only  includes the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the  internal industrial structure of rural areas but also the  readjustment of economic structure between cities and the  countryside. It not only means readjusting the industrial  structure but, more fundamentally, changing the current  employment structure through the readjustment of the industrial  structure so that the free flow, rational combination, and  optimum allocation of all production elements and resources  within a greater scope can be achieved. In light of the  inherent demand of rural economic development and of past  experiences, the main points of the new policy which can promote  structural readjustment are: We must not limit it to rural  areas but should carry it out in both cities and the  countryside. We should combine the internal structural  readjustment of rural areas with the drive for urbanization and  pursue a new round of structural reforms with urbanization as  the central issue. We must intrtoduce more extensively market  mechanisms and let price mechanisms play a better role in  regulating the allocation of resources. We must pay more  attention to the promotion of advanced and practical farming  technology and support the efficiency of structural readjustment  with technology. We must insist on making innovations in the  organizational system to seek and establish the new  organizational form and order of the future mobile society. In  short, in our opinion, structural readjustment is a major force  promoting economic development and China's rural development  which takes structural reforms as the central issue has totally  different characteristics from the past and richer contents.    II. Create a Macropolicy Environment Which Suits  Structural Readjustment    2.01 The rural industrial structure in the 1980's was  basically readjusted in the rural areas themselves and under the  condition of not changing the original urban and rural economic  patterns. Whether the readjustment of the crop-farming and  agricultural structures in the early years, or the rise of  township and town enterprises which came afterward, the basic  focus of the policy is to resolve the problems in the rural  areas themselves. Such being the case, the readjustment of the  industrial structure in rural areas is still often restricted by  the macropolicy environment. As we said earlier, the question  remains: Is it okay to limit structural readjustment to rural  areas themselves? This involves one fundamental point, namely,  whether or not there is the need to readjust the traditional  economic development strategy and its policy environment and  whether or not we have come to the time for the readjustment and  how to readjust it. In fact, discussions and arguments by the  relevant quarters over this question have continued since rural  reform but it was not until recently that this question was put  on the agenda for policymaking.    The Necessity To Readjust the Traditional Development  Strategy    2.02 For a long time, the strategy for developing the  national economy has been that the development of heavy industry  takes precedence over others. This form of traditional  development strategy is of historical necessity. In the early  years of the PRC, and under the prevailing international  environment, the most important task was to build as quickly as  possible a complete industrial system with heavy industry as the  pillar. As the task was put forward, it was first necessary to  solve the problem of primitive accumulation for  industrialization. Obviously, under the prevailing historical  conditions, in order to complete the task of primitive  accumulation, it was impossible to rely on China's own weak  light industry, still less on international aid, but on  agriculture and rural areas. Therefore, in the process of  national industrialization which followed, we gradually formed a  whole set of macropolicy environment and economic management  systems suited to this strategy, which gave priority to the  development of heavy industry and special accumulative  mechanisms.    2.03 For various historical reasons, in order to extract  accumulations from agriculture and the rural areas and convert  them into capital for industrialization, our specific practice  was to adopt the system of state monopoly for the purchasing and  marketing of farm products. Under this system, we lowered the  cost of industrial raw materials and the wage costs through the  monopoly purchase of farm products at low prices and acquired an  excess profit through raising the prices of industrial  manufactured goods. This excess profit kept changing into funds  for industrialization through financial means. According to  expert analyses and calculations, from 1952 to 1978, owing to  the exchange of industrial and agricultural products at unequal  prices, the funds flowing from agriculture to industry amounted  to 391.7 billion yuan and the funds diverted from revenue income  sources to industry totaled 93.5 billion yuan giving an overall  value of 485.2 billion yuan. After deducting the financial  returns to agriculture, the net flow of funds from agriculture  came to 312 billion yuan, equivalent to 73.2 percent of the  original value of the nonagricultural fixed assets of  state-owned enterprises during the same period.    2.04 In order to guarantee the realization of this special  accumulative mechanism, a policy environment and structural  conditions which matched it were needed. This was mainly  reflected in the following three aspects. The first was the  artificially distorted prices of products and production  elements. Given an extreme shortage of capital, in order to  quickly develop capital- intensive industries, the state adopted  the policy of: Suppressing the prices of farm products and raw  materials, wages, and the prices of daily necessities and labor  services; maintaining low interest rates and exchange rates; and  raising the prices of industrial manufactured goods, thus  maximizing the industrial profit rate and accumulative  capability. Second, given the price distortions, it was  necessary to allocate resources through a highly centralized  planned system and administrative means and to strictly limit  the free exchange of products and the free flow of production  elements. In order to suppress the prices of farm products in  rural areas, market prices and the market were eliminated  altogether. In order to keep the opportunity cost of  agricultural labor low and to control the scope and  effectiveness of low-price welfare distribution in cities, China  adopted a strict identity and household management system and  firmly bound peasants to their land through a strict  city-countryside segregation system, excluding them from the  process of industrialization and urbanization. The third was to  establish a microfoundation which suited the planned management  structure. In rural areas, China instituted a people's  commune-based collective economic system, integrated government  administration with commune management, and deprived peasants of  their decisionmaking power to ensure that agricultural  production and management were placed under the government's  direct intervention. In the cities, China built an economy with  state ownership and state management as the mainstay, in which  the government exercised planned management of enterprises and  enterprises were merely production and labor units.    2.05 The traditional development strategy relied on the  accumulations of rural areas and on the government's very strong  capability to mobilize resources. This enabled China to  basically establish a comparatively complete industrial system  within a fairly short time. Its historical contributions and  positive significance deserve affirmation. However, after the  industrial system was basically established, following the  diversified and specialized development of materials production  departments and the increasingly complex national economic life,  the weaknesses in the original structure and policy environment  became increasingly obvious. In this process, although the goal  of the strategy whereby the development of heavy industry took  precedence over others was revised to some degree, its structure  and policy environment remained basically unchanged. The  microscopic low efficiency and the waste of macroscopic  resources allocation seriously hindered the normal development  of the national economy. In particular, under this traditional  strategy, agricultural productive forces remained stagnant as a  result of a long-term inability to make accumulations and a high  degree of tension developed between the population and the land  as large numbers of the rural population and work force were  unable to shift smoothly in keeping with the industrialization  process. All this shows that the traditional development  strategy and its policy and structure could no longer be  continued and had to be radically changed. It is not difficult  to understand why rural reform unexpectedly took the lead when  this kind of readjustment began.    2.06 The point is that, after 15 years of rural reform,  extremely profound changes have occurred in the rural economy  and its microscopic operational mechanisms, whereas the  macropolicy environment, though having been relaxed, has not  been radically changed. This is first reflected by the  relationship between industry and agriculture and the  distribution of national income. To date, the pattern of  supporting industry with agricultural accumulations has not been  radically reversed. In the process of industrialization,  countries around the world have to have agriculture nurture  industry. However, general experience shows that the nurturing  time cannot be too long, otherwise a huge cost has to be paid.  China's past experience has already explained this. Under the  new condition of extensively introducing market mechanisms, the  government should and must adopt a necessary support policy and  protective measures for agriculture, which is a special sector,  otherwise history will repeat itself.    2.07 More importantly, the current macropolicy environment  already seriously hinders the development of the rural economy  and its change into a market structure and has become a  difficult point in reform. As we have said previously, in order  to guarantee the further growth of agriculture, the rural  economy, and peasants' income, we must launch a new structural  readjustment and this demands market mechanisms play a fuller  role so that production elements can freely flow and recombine  within a greater scope. However, in the macropolicy environment,  the distorted prices of products and production elements, the  administrative intervention which is sometimes strict and  sometimes loose, and the various manmade limitations on the flow  of production elements hinder the normal growth of the products  market and the production elements market and are becoming major  limitations to the further development of the rural economy. In  rural areas, this is mainly reflected in the planned purchase  and marketing system which has not been thoroughly abolished and  the city-countryside segregation system. In addition, this  distorted macropolicy environment has led to the excessive  number of frictions and contradictions in the process of  changing the structure. This is because reform has created a  new market-oriented mainstay of operations [jing ying zhu ti  4842 3602 0031 7555]. On the other hand, because the  macropolicy environment which conforms to the form of the  previous development strategy has not been changed accordingly,  the two inevitably have acute frictions and contradictions,  leading to special difficulties during the period of changing  the structure. Therefore, it is high time the traditional  development strategy and its macropolicy environment are changed.    Smash the Key Links of the Old Economic Pattern    2.08 According to the experiences in countries and regions  whose economies have developed in a sustained and speedy way  since World War II, the development strategy which increases the  speed and stability of economic development and possesses  inherent structure-optimizing mechanisms is a one with a  comparative advantage. By a strategy with a comparative  advantage, we mean that we confirm an industrial structure in  keeping with a comparative advantage in resources and readjust  the industrial structure in keeping with the dynamic changes in  the comparative advantage in resources, to ensure that we can  fully use resources with a relative advantage to promote the  development of the national economy at every stage of economic  development.    2.09 The key to readjusting the relationships between  industry and agriculture, and between cities and the  countryside, does not lie in how we should "subsidize" or  "protect" agriculture or other industries through government but  in how we should develop the products market and production  elements market so that the relative prices of all production  elements and products can accurately reflect their relative  scarcity. This way, the development of all industries can be  rationally laid out in keeping with market price information,  their own economic advantages brought into play, and equal  competition achieved. Viewed from the angle of readjusting the  traditional development strategy, in deepening rural reform we  must mainly make breakthroughs in two things at the present  stage, namely: Thoroughly smashing the planned purchase and  marketing system and the city-countryside segregation system to  promote the growth of the products market and the production  elements market.    2.10 Thoroughly reforming the planned purchase and marketing  system. Since the central authorities announced the abolition  of the planned purchase and marketing system in 1985, the scope  of planned purchase and marketing of farm products has shrunk  greatly. However, the planned purchase and marketing of grain  and some industrial materials is still, to varying degrees,  being continued and this still has a very great influence on the  development of the rural economy. Owing to the stagnant growth  in grain output at one time, the purchase of grain has returned  from the contract purchase as confirmed in 1985 to state  purchase. Despite the fact that grain prices are close to the  market prices after their prices were raised on several  occasions, state purchase means that grain still cannot be  totally regulated by the market. State purchase has the sense  of obligation and taxation and is compulsory. In the process of  implementing state purchase, it is apportioned among all peasant  households. This, in fact, limits peasants from readjusting the  industrial structure and rationally allocating resources in  keeping with market price signals. Moreover, by retaining the  form of state purchase, we in fact retain the government's right  to use administrative means from time to time, and purchasing  organizations which are performing the purchase tasks can  continue to treat peasants haughtily. This leaves room for a  structural relapse. Although this situation has changed a little  in recent years since the removal of grain price controls was  announced, it is still there. Therefore, we should quicken the  reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system as we set up  the grain risk fund and the reserve system and we should lift  price controls over cotton and silkworm cocoons as soon as  possible.    2.11 Break the city-countryside segregation system. Central  Document No. 1 of 1984 allowed peasants intending to set up  industries, do business, and offer services to take care of  their grain supplies and to settle in small towns. In practice,  this encouraged the rural population to migrate to small towns  and promoted the development of these small towns. Later,  however, this trend did not continue following the widening gap  between the parity price and negotiated price of grain, the  various unmatched urban management and development policies, and  the changes in the macroeconomic environment. In recent years,  following the development of the small industrial districts for  township and town enterprises and of small towns run by peasants  themselves, and the upsurge of the "wave of migrant workers,"  the hot wave of peasants flocking into cities has reappeared,  having an impact on the old order in which cities and the  countryside are segregated and loosening the city-countryside  segregation system. The segregation between cities and the  countryside inevitably distorts the prices of production  elements making it impossible to fully develop the rich labor  resources. On the other hand, it makes it impossible to use  capital rationally and effectively. It not only limits the  development of rural areas but narrows the room for the  structural readjustment of cities themselves. Therefore, in  order to promote interaction between cities and the countryside  and readjust the industrial structure in a concentrated way, it  is necessary to reform the various economic and social policies  which segregate cities and the countryside, including those for  household management, employment, housing, education, social  security, and city development. The first step in breaking the  barriers between cities and the countryside is that the state  must no longer continue to foster and protect the sense of  superiority of city residents, must not protect the privileges  of cities at the expense of the interests of peasants and rural  areas, and gradually cancel "shifting agriculture into  nonagricultural sectors [nong zhuan fei 6593 6567 7236]."  Second, while allowing peasants to enter and settle in small  towns and in medium and small cities, we should also allow them  to come into big cities and megacities and improve and perfect  city management methods accordingly.    The Probability of Creating a New Macropolicy  Environment    2.12 Reforming the macropolicy environment which suits the  traditional development strategy means a readjustment of all  vested interests. If this is not done properly, it will lead to  social contradictions. However, with the past dozen years or  more of reform, China's comprehensive national strength has  continuously increased and the people's living standards have  greatly improved, people have a stronger psychological endurance  for the reform of their own interests, and everyone tends  increasingly to sympathize with market structure reform. All  this has created the basic preconditions for pursuing this  reform.    2.13 Owing to the changes brought about in the industrial  structure by the speedy economic growth in the 1980's,  especially the speedy development of light industry, China's  industrial accumulative capability has obviously strengthened.  With the readjustment of the prices of major farm products on  several occasions, the exchange of industrial and farm products  already tends to be at equal prices. Following the speedy  increase in the income of city staff and workers, the Engel's  Coefficient of food consumption began to decrease. In 1991,  grain expenditure only accounted for 6.5 percent of the living  expenses of urban residents. This meant that low-priced farm  products no longer played a decisive role in maintaining low  labor costs. The contribution of farm products supplies to  urban society has already had a change in nature, namely that it  has changed from offering accumulations for industry into  offering security for society. In view of this, there no longer  exist preconditions for continuing the policies of planned  purchase and marketing and of city-countryside segregation.    2.14 Since reform, there have been noticeable changes in the  accumulative form of national income and in the course of  capital flows. Following the growth of enterprises' incomes and  personal discretionary incomes, banking and credit have  accordingly replaced finance as the main channel of financing  and investment; securities, insurance, and real estate have  opened up new areas of investment; and banks' savings-absorbing  ability has greatly strengthened and a diversified investment  pattern has already been formed. On this basis, we not only  find it necessary to deepen monetary system reform but we also  have increasingly ripe conditions. As long as we straighten out  the monetary system and policy and maintain the stability of the  state's various basic reform policies, coupled with the people's  inherent tendency to save money, the accumulation rate and  utilization rate of national income will not decrease overall.  In the meantime, since we have straightened out the distorted  policy environment so that the comparative advantages of  different sectors and different regions can be fully released,  it will greatly increase the overall efficiency of the national  economy.    2.15 Quickening the development of the products and  production elements market is also badly needed for further  opening to the outside world, and participating in international  competition, and for the government to establish new regulating  and controlling mechanisms. China's rejoining GATT as a member  will mean that industrial and farm products will, without  exception, participate in international competition. If we do  not perfect the market regulating and controlling mechanisms as  soon as possible so that all sectors can enhance their own  competitiveness according to market rules, then we will lose the  relative economic advantage we have or even let our national  income drain away through irrational prices. Viewed from the  level of the state's macroscopic regulating and controlling  mechanisms, the original purchase and marketing system which  guarantees the supply of accumulations from agriculture to  industry has already become a big burden on the government's  expenditure. As a result of the fact that controls over the  purchasing prices of major farm products have been lifted while  the sales prices in cities lag behind, the amount the government  has to allocate from its budget to subsidize the price  difference between purchase and marketing comes to tens of  billions of yuan and the efficiency this produces is becoming  increasingly low and the state will find it increasingly  difficult to support it financially.    2.16 In the forthcoming structural readjustment, the most  active force is still the hundreds of millions of peasants. In  fact, in recent years, peasants have begun to take advantage of  the current reform environment to tackle the deep-level  composition of the irrational traditional development strategy.  What is most noteworthy is the trend wherein peasants are  breaking the barriers between cities and the countryside and  directly participating in urbanization. According to expert  surveys and estimates, the migrant population flowing from the  countryside into cities has rapidly increased since the  mid-1980's. In 1988, the total number of migrant population had  already reached 70 million with 59.34 percent flowing from rural  areas. In 1992, the migrant population coming from the  countryside into cities remained at 35.75 million per day, most  of whom were job seekers. The unstoppable migrant population  has created the "wave of peasant workers" which is worsening  annually and has become a hot point of concern to society and  the media. Peasants' entry into cities has not only quickened  the development of tertiary industry but also spurred the reform  of the city management structure. In megacities like Beijing  there are already residential areas for the migrant population  such as "Zhejiang Village." In the villages in these cities,  the autonomy of residents in the real sense has begun to emerge.  Special economic zones and development areas like Shenzhen,  Xiamen, Haikou, and Beihai have a comparatively high proportion  of migrant population. They have become migrant cities which  are different from other cities. Their development and  management have also become more suited to the population flows.  In places where township and town enterprises are comparatively  concentrated, a number of small cities and towns are quickly  emerging, even such new cities as Zhejiang's Longgang Township  which was all built by the pooling of funds among peasants  themselves.    2.17 Another notable phenomenon is that since price controls  on grain have been lifted, the nongovernmental circulation  channels formed under the previous "double-track pricing system"  for grain purchase and marketing have been rapidly expanding.  State-owned grain stations find it "difficult to purchase  grain." On the other hand, nongovernmental grain dealers are  unprecedentedly active. According to surveys, in typically big  agricultural provinces, the volume of interprovincial grain  exchange through nonstate channels already exceeds one-fourth of  the total. In the entire circulation of farm products including  grain, there is an active large sales force consisting of tens  of thousands of peasants. A number of wholesale markets run by  peasants themselves have been set up, forming a new and  noticeable pivot for farm products circulation channels. The  wholesale volume of vegetables in Beijing's Dazhongsi Wholesale  Market, for instance, already accounts for over one-third of the  city's total supplies.    2.18 Following the reform of the city industrial  enterprise system and the monetary system, the segregation in  reciprocal investment between cities and the countryside is  being broken through. At present, it happens that in various  localities peasants go into cities and contract on state-run or  collective enterprises and that township and town enterprises  and city enterprises carry out joint operations, cooperate, and  buy or even hold each other's shares. Moreover, some  enterprises in cities, especially some food processing  enterprises, are beginning to change from dependence on the  government to directly establishing affiliated or cooperative  relationships with peasant producers. They play a very positive  leading role in the production of some farm products.    2.19 To sum up what we have talked about above, we can  conclude that China's rural economy in the 1990's will enter a  stage of change in its development strategy. At this stage, the  structural readjustment for the establishment of new  relationships between cities and the countryside and for a  development strategy for the national economy will be the basic  characteristics of rural economic development. Changing the  traditional macropolicy environment and promoting the further  growth of the products market and the production elements market  in order to complete this strategic change, will be the  mainstream of rural reform in the 1990's.

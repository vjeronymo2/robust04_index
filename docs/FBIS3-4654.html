Such rigmarole of the traitor Kim Yong-sam is nothing but a  disgusting jargon of a political mountabank aimed at prettifying  his disgraceful records woven with arch crimes of flunkeyism and  treachery, fascism and repression, division and confrontation  and, at the same time, at dampening the unyielding fighting  spirit of the South Korean people who decisively rose in  struggle to topple the "civilian" regime, and at maintaining at  any cost the colonial puppet regime now driven to the crisis of  destruction.    The traitor openly revealed his wicked intention of division  and confrontation when he took issue with the fictitious  "nuclear problem" of the North, arguing in a far-fetched manner  that "the North's nuclear problem is a stumbling block in the  way of reunification".    This time he made a gesture as if he were intending to bring  about any change in the North-South relations, saying "the North  has no nukes" and he "would promote summit talks when the talks  could be considered helpful to checking the North's nuclear  development". This means, in the final analysis, that he  admitted of his own accord that his clique's criminal "policy  against the North" in the last one hear was wrong.    His attempt to find a solution to the North-South relations  by taking issue with the North's "nuclear problem" cannot be  construed otherwise than a mode of thinking of a stupid fellow  running about like a headless chicken, lost to reason.    The Korean nation will never pardon the foolish Kim Yong-sam  group, the source of national disaster which is nonspiring with  outside forces to harm and stifle the same fellow countrymen,  engaging itself in fascism, suppression, division and  confrontation.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Takeover flood as UK water spreads out: Groups are diversifying ahead of tighter regulation London's financial advisers should drink a toast to the UK water sector. Since privatisation in 1989, the water companies have blazed an acquisitions trail while other takeover activity has been muted by recession. So far this year, six of the 10 companies have made sizeable acquisitions. Yesterday, Welsh Water paid up to Pounds 56.1m for engineering consultant Acer Group, which is mainly involved in the transport and water sectors. Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the purchase allowed Welsh to move into overseas markets. But the rush to build up unregulated businesses has so far seen few successes, raising fears companies are paying too much for underperforming assets. Critics say some managements, freed from public sector control, have been too eager to acquire new businesses and lack experience in evaluating takeover targets. Meanwhile, companies have often found themselves bidding against each other and driving up prices. According to one merchant banker advising vendors, the water companies are a 'slightly soft sell' because of their strong balance sheets, inherited from privatisation, and a regulatory regime which guarantees price rises above inflation. 'They've got the cash and diversification makes good sense, although you sense some are simply keeping up with their peers,' he said. Companies are diversifying mainly because regulation is likely to become tougher after 1995, when Ofwat concludes its interim review of pricing. Companies which can generate non-regulated profits will be able to use them to maintain dividend growth in case profits from regulated activities are flat. For some smaller companies, perhaps only Wessex and Northumbrian, unregulated profits could contribute perhaps a third of total profits by the end of the decade. But for most of the companies, earnings from core water services will continue to overshadow unregulated businesses, which will contribute 10-20 per cent of profits at best. All the 10 water companies have now established non-core divisions through acquisition or joint venture, usually in process engineering or waste management. So far this year, they have spent more than Pounds 250m on purchases. In the largest, Wessex Waste Management (WWM), the joint venture between Wessex Water and Waste Management International of the US, bought NFC's waste arm for Pounds 113m. Other deals are expected. Tarmac's Econowaste is up for sale and some companies may be interested in Biwater, the privately-owned water engineering company. Further overseas expansion is also likely and Merck, the US pharmaceutical group, has put its Calgon Water Management subsidiary up for sale. But most of the acquisitions since privatisation are performing poorly. Biffa, the waste management company bought for Pounds 212m by Severn Trent in 1991, remains loss-making after interest costs. Thames Water, which has spent about Pounds 120m building up a process engineering division, generated a pre-tax profit margin of less than 3 per cent from the division last year, and is not expected to improve greatly before 1995. North West Water's process and environmental engineering businesses, built up at a cost of about Pounds 110m, is earning similar returns. The water companies claim, with justification, that it is too early to judge the success or otherwise of acquisitions. Most have been affected by recession and most, like Biffa, were bought as long-term businesses. Mr David Luffrum, group finance director at Thames, said water utilities can afford to think long term. 'It's less important for (the unregulated businesses) to be profitable at the moment than with a company struggling for liquidity,' he said. Nevertheless, water companies have been paying very handsome prices, especially if the assets acquired are not expected to perform in the short term. In January, South West Water paid English China Clays Pounds 27.5m for Haul-Waste, at an historic price/earnings ratio of 32 times. This month WWM bought NFC's waste division at more than 30 times historic earnings. Both companies believe they paid a fair price because of potential growth in the waste management industry, and forecast improvement in margins. WWM also hopes for about Pounds 3m of efficiency savings. But in several deals, the price paid seems to have been bid up by other water companies. Anglian Water, which paid Pounds 36m for Nordic Water earlier this month, is understood to have outbid North West Water. North West is also thought to have been interested in Simon Hartley, which Thames eventually bought for Pounds 20.2m in January. In the best example of competitive bidding, Severn Trent won Biffa from the jaws of at least two other companies, Yorkshire and Anglian. Companies can afford inflated prices partly because their balance sheets are so strong. At privatisation, the government wrote off all debts, and several companies retain net cash in spite of heavy capital spending. Most of the larger acquisitions have involved significant goodwill write-offs. For example, WWM's Pounds 106.5m purchase of Wimpey Waste Management in October 1991 led to goodwill write-offs of nearly Pounds 100m after fair value adjustments. '(Companies) are typically writing down fixed assets, which means less depreciation, thereby boosting the profits stream,' according to Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, analyst at NatWest Securities. Water companies claim their diversification into new and related areas has been logical. For example, companies already had experience of process engineering through their work with sewage treatment. Both Thames and North West Water have been able to use their expanded engineering and water management experience to bid for overseas contracts. The move into waste management is less clear cut. Companies do have experience of liquid waste disposal, and of working with environmental standards. Several companies, such as Yorkshire Water, have made small acquisitions to expand existing liquid waste disposal businesses. But large acquisitions of solid waste collection and disposal companies, such as Biffa and Haul-Waste, are open to criticism, especially as some companies have underestimated the effects of recession on waste management. Some observers argue that water companies are ill suited to manage assets such as dustcarts or landfill sites. Moving into waste management is therefore a risky diversification from the water business, rather than an extension of it. Mr Roderick Paul, chief executive of Severn Trent, agreed that moving into waste management was a diversification, but said all companies' acquisition strategies were reactions to the larger risk of tighter regulation. 'We asked, 'Is there something else which is at least a sensible thing for you to do, with at least some overlap?',' he said. Some analysts are not so sure. 'If the companies are right, they will make a lot of money. If they are wrong, it's going to be expensive,' said one.

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: Unlikely to avoid tax Sir, The refund of pension surplus to Courtaulds Textiles may be justifiable on a number of grounds, but avoiding the payment of unnecessary tax (Lex, December 22) is unlikely to be one of them. A refund is subject to a free-standing tax charge of 40 per cent. It is not absolutely clear what tax treatment applies to a pension fund which chooses not to pay a refund, but tax at 25 per cent is likely on the proportion of income and capital gains which relates to the surplus. Tax only continues while the fund shows a surplus. As Lex says, very few pension schemes can be certain to remain in surplus for long while the investment outlook is so uncertain. A fund which retains a surplus, therefore, has a good chance of paying less tax than one which refunds one. That said, it is true that the assumptions for determining whether a surplus exists are cautious and Lex may well be correct in saying that benefits are unlikely to have been put at risk.

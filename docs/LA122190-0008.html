			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S THROWING THE BOOK AT THE SOONERS AGAIN  </P> <P> "The Games Behind the Game," a book by Walter Byers, executive director of the  NCAA from 1951 to 1987, will be published in late summer or early fall of 1991.  </P> <P> According to the Associated Press, the book "will deal with his suggestions for  reform in collegiate athletics as well as look at the personalities, economic  power and politics that influence intercollegiate sports."  </P> <P> Is it ironic -- or fitting -- that "The Games Behind the Game" will be  published by the University of Oklahoma Press?  </P> <P> He broke the story: There was Woodward, there was Bernstein and now there's  Bailey.  </P> <P> Arnold Bailey of the Providence Journal-Bulletin, another in the growing legion  of collectibles columnists, wrote in his "Collector's Corner" of Dec. 8: "Way  back on Oct. 7, we provided a peek at what Topps is planning for 1991 -- a  special 40th anniversary production that mixes 792 new cards with bonus samples  of every card produced during the past four decades."  </P> <P> Trivia time: There have been no tie games in the NFL this season. When was the  last time the league went a full season without a tie?  </P> <P> Way back payback: After Miami's recent 23-20 overtime victory over  Philadelphia, the Dolphins' Jim Jensen said teammate Jeff Cross told him an  Eagle had said Coach Buddy Ryan offered $100 to the defensive player making the  best hit on Jensen.  </P> <P> Said Ron Howard, the Eagles' media relations director: "This has absolutely  nothing to do with Buddy Ryan. Our players felt Jim was a jerk. There was no  bounty on him, but our players thought, yeah, if we can get a good shot on him  within the legality of the rules and in the spirit of play, they would take  one."  </P> <P> Howard said the Eagle players were angry at Jensen for playing too rough in an  off-season "Best of the Beach" basketball game in Jamaica.  </P> <P> Add "bounty": Wednesday, the Eagles wore T-shirts that read, "Buddy's Bounty  Hunters."  </P> <P> Said guard Mike Schad: "We just found them in our lockers today. Buddy said an  anonymous guy brought them in in a box and gave them to the PR department."  </P> <P> Said Ryan: "Nobody gave me one."  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, who last year accused Ryan of putting a bounty on  Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman and kicker Luis Zendejas, commented on the  T-shirts: "Was that the bounty on us or was that the one on (Jensen) we heard  about this year?"  </P> <P> The Cowboys and Eagles play Sunday in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: 1985.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Princeton basketball Coach Pete Carril, explaining his team's  deliberate style: "We're not very fast. It's like Whitey Ford. The guy didn't  have a fastball, so he's gotta throw spitballs." TED BROCK  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME copper market recovers strongly - Market Report COPPER prices staged a strong recovery at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon in expectation of a sizeable LME stocks fall being announced today. NICKEL edged lower on a report from the Norilsk mine at Talnakh, Russia, that repair work was almost complete and the mine had been working at capacity for three days. Power problems at Norilsk have been buoying nickel prices for the past month. ALUMINIUM took heart from copper's strength but a repeat of recent fund liquidation capped the rise. COFFEE futures ended down after speculators and jobbers liquidated long positions built up ahead of Wednesday's Brazilian stock audit, which was in line with recent estimates.

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Dollar decline (continued) If the reputation of economic forecasters has sustained damage in recent years, the sub-branch of the trade that seeks to predict currency movements has seen its credibility pretty well shredded. The perpetrator in chief has been the dollar, the decline of which against both the yen and the D-Mark this year has confounded the great majority of pundits. The general assumption in January was that rising interest rates in the US, combined with slow recovery in Europe and Japan, would ensure a cyclical rebound in the dollar. Huge portfolio positions were built on this near-unanimous market view, often on borrowed money. The rest, so to speak, is hysteria, as both bond rates and currencies have danced to a different tune in an uncertain key. Why have currencies so dramatically defied predictions? Part of the problem has been that interest rates did not come down to the expected extent in Germany and Japan. The markets have also worried that the trade dispute between the US and Japan gave the Clinton administration an interest in a weak dollar in order to apply pressure to the Japanese. Yet the more powerful influence has been a shift in the structure of capital flows. With Japan projected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to run a current account surplus of nearly Dollars 130bn this year, while the US runs a deficit of just over Dollars 140bn, the natural direction for capital to go is from the world's biggest creditor to its biggest debtor country. But Japanese investors have been reluctant to play their part in this process. One reason is that they have incurred large accumulated losses on foreign investments, not least because of the yen's structural tendency towards appreciation. Another is that the relative bond returns in Japan are seductive. Japanese investors At current rates of inflation - nil for Japan, about 3 per cent for the US - the real yield on 10-year bonds in Japan last week was 4.7 per cent compared with 4.9 per cent in the US. That provides little protection for Japanese investors against further dollar weakness. The picture could be even more stark. Some analysts are predicting a deflationary fall of as much as 10 per cent in the Japanese price level over the rest of the decade, in which case real yields in Japan could be nearer 6 per cent. Even cash would afford a real yield of 2 per cent in such deflationary circumstances. The temptation for Japanese investors to forsake domestic bonds for overseas IOUs is thus minimal. And in equities, Wall Street remains very fully valued. US deficit On the US side, meantime, long-term portfolio capital is no more inclined to flow in the direction that the current account deficit requires than in Japan. US pension funds and mutual funds have been trying to reap the benefit of international diversification, which is supposed to bring higher returns for a given degree of risk. Against the background of a rising US current account deficit and a growing net outflow of direct investment, a Dollars 37bn swing last year from inflow to net portfolio outflow contributed significantly to dollar weakness. The timing and extent of such changes in stocks, as opposed to flows, is notoriously difficult to predict. But the course of long-term capital will in time change. What could bring that about? If US bond rates were to rise and Wall Street were to collapse, both US and Japanese investors might see dollar-denominated assets in a different light. And since markets have moved so much together this year, the US enthusiasm for foreign investment has not offered much diversification benefit. Enthusiasm may thus wane. It is noteworthy, too, that after the annualised Dollars 140bn inflow of foreign capital into the Tokyo equity market in the first quarter of 1994, the flow fell to Dollars 50bn a year in the second quarter. What is reasonably certain is that the US current account deficit, which is still the biggest number influencing the supply of dollars to the rest of the world, has peaked. Yet the behaviour of Japanese capital remains hard to predict. In due course cyclical economic factors will reassert their influence vis a vis long-term capital flows and the dollar will have its rebound. But the only safe short-term forecast is for further instability.</p>

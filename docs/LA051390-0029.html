			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD: VENICE ART COLONY OPENS ITS DOORS AGAIN TO THE HORDE OF 5,000  </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> More than 50 artists will participate this year in the annual Venice Art Walk,  which will be held next Sunday from noon-5 p.m. Organizers say they expect more  than 5,000 people to attend the event, at which each guest will be given a map  of Venice for a self-guided walking tour of studios of such noted artists as  Laddie John Dill, Fritz Scholder, John Okulick and Daniel J. Martinez. Tickets  for the event are $45 each and include admission to 24 special exhibitions  ranging from kinetic art, to a billboard installation, to photography shows.  </P> <P> Among other activities included during Art Walk will be a silent auction --  featuring more than 300 works by contemporary Southern California artists  including Carlos Almaraz, Billy Al Bengston, Jonathan Borofsky, Sam Francis,  and Lawrence Gipe; a food fair featuring samplings from 13 Westside restaurants  -- including Campanile's, Chaya Brasserie, 72 Market Street and DC3; and the  sale of the Art Walk '90 poster by Peter Alexander and the T-shirt by Jeffrey  Vallance.  </P> <P> But while the main activities will be held next Sunday, Art Walk -- which  engages the services of 500 volunteers and benefits the Venice Family Clinic --  actually begins on Saturday. The first activities will be docent tours -- led  by familiar art figures such as curator Josine Ianco-Starrels, gallery owner  Jan Turner and arts lawyer Sylvia Haimoff White -- to artists' spaces in Santa  Monica, West L.A. and downtown L.A. The tours will visit studios of artists  including Lari Pittman, Lita Albuquerque, George Herms and Robbie Conal. The  cost for each tour -- there are a total of six, three each on Saturday and next  Sunday -- is $90 and includes a catered lunch. Also on Saturday, the Art Walk  '90 dinner will be held at the Santa Monica Airport from 6:30-11 p.m.. Tickets  are $225 each.  </P> <P> Art Walk's starting location and registration center will be at Westminster  School, 1010 W. Washington Blvd., Venice. for information or reservations, call  (213) 392-WALK, Ext. 343.  </P> <P> Jenny Holzer isn't just for the museums any more. In fact, even couch potatoes  can now be privy to her art. Today through Saturday, TV spots by the artist  will be shown during regular commercial and program breaks on Los Angeles  stations KCOP Channel 13 and KTLA Channel 5.  </P> <P> The works were originally conceived and created by the New York-based Holzer  for cable video network MTV in 1989, as part of the network's "Art Breaks"  program. Consequently, newer versions have been produced for Italian TV in  conjunction with the upcoming Venice Biennale, at which Holzer will represent  the United States.  </P> <P> The 27 spots, running from 6 to 14 seconds in length, will be aired in the  early-morning, daytime and late-night slots, and are expected to be seen by  nearly a million viewers. Like the rest of her work, the TV spots present  deceptively simple sequences of text -- such as "Private property created  crime" -- that mix provocative social commentary with resonant poetic  reflection.  </P> <P> Television isn't the only direction the Long Beach Museum of Art is branching  out into. Beginning this Friday, the museum is holding a mystery/dinner theater  production that will be held every Friday when exhibitions are up in the  museum. The play, "Consequences," features a tangled maze of clues that takes  the audience through the Museum and its sculpture garden as they strive to  solve the crime. The event costs $49.50 per person, with dinner and hors  d'oeuvres included. Advance reservations are required. Information: (213)  439-2119.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERHEARD  </P> <P> "People still think the entertainment world is sexier than the arts. But if  they could just hear the stories circulating these days -- about things like  all the older women having affairs with younger men -- they might not still  think so." -- A certain well-connected L.A. arts figure during a recent private  reception.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> Noted artists Laddie John Dill, George Herms, Jill Giegerich and Peter  Alexander are among the nine-person faculty selected for Santa Monica College's  new College of Design, Art and Architecture, which is scheduled to open this  fall at the Santa Monica Airport. Other artist/faculty members include artist  William Tunberg, graphic designers Roland Young and Deborah Sussman, furniture  designer Robert Wilhite and architect Jeffrey Daniels.  </P> <P> College officials, who say the two-year program is the first of its kind in an  U.S. community college, are currently recruiting a first class of 60 students,  who will be admitted by portfolio. Tuition will be $50 a semester, and will  lead to an associate of arts degree.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEBUTS  </P> <P> The first solo gallery exhibition in California by artist Alfredo Jaar opens at  Meyers/Bloom Gallery on Saturday. The show will serve as a followup to those  who saw this winter's exhibition of Jaar's works at the La Jolla Museum of  Contemporary Art. The gallery show, which runs through June 16, features light  boxes and cibachromes depicting Asian boat people.  </P> <P> Twenty-two-year-old Texas-based artist Terrel Moore's first show outside of his  home state opens Thursday night at Cure Gallery. Moore, who paints large  Abstract Expressionist canvases and cites the works of Mark Rothko as his main  inspiration, works in oils, charcoal, acrylic and spray enamel. The show runs  through June 12.  </P> <P> The first comprehensive U.S. show of drawings by master Japanese printmaker  Utagawa Kuniyoshi opens at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design on Saturday.  The touring exhibition, "Drawings by Utagawa Kuniyoshi: Sketches for Japanese  Prints," includes 75 drawings as well as woodblock prints. It's on view through  June 16.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> A special benefit viewing of L.A. Municipal Art Gallery's "The Indomitable  Spirit," which features photographic works by noted artists including Robert  Mapplethorpe, Herb Ritts, John Baldessari and Annie Leibovitz, will be held  Thursday from 7-10 p.m. Tickets to the champagne reception are $75 per person,  with proceeds going to AIDS Project Los Angeles, AIDS Hospice Foundation and  City of Angels Hospice. Information: (213) 962-1600, Ext. 214.  </P> <P> In conjunction with the free public opening of "The Indomitable Spirit" and  another Muni exhibition, "Raging at the Visible: AIDS in the City of Angels," a  performance piece by Michael Kearns and Dale Raoul called "Forget Me Not: A  Collection of AIDS Letters," will be presented at the gallery next Sunday at  4:45 p.m. Information : (213) 485-4581.  </P> <P> "Thomas Hart Benton," a 1988 film narrated by Jason Robards documenting  Benton's life and work, will be screened Saturday at 3 p.m. at the L.A. County  Museum of Art. The screening is free.  </P></p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (7): Lines of communication move streets ahead - Transport / A new ring-road has cleared the congested streets of the city and made getting to surrounding areas an easier task OF ALL the improvements which Barcelona can boast, the one that most directly affects the transport in the city is the 40 km of new four-lane ring-road, which opened a month before the Games, is lined in parts with palm trees, and cost a total of Pta 136,071m. Barcelona's compact nature, which was one of its strong points when it came to bid for the Olympics, has also made it a difficult city to drive in. As a result of the new roads, traffic in the centre has lightened by 15 per cent and communication with the surrounding areas has improved dramatically. The inland section, the ronda de dalt, has been cut into the Tibidabo mountain which overlooks the city, while the ronda litoral runs along the coast, going underground as it passes the Olympic Village development and the port. But the first of the transport systems to receive attention was the metro. It reaches 2.5m of the 3.5m inhabitants of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, which includes the city itself and the surrounding municipal districts such as L'Hospitalet and Badalona. Air conditioning, badly needed in the summer, was installed in 90 per cent of the trains, and one of the four lines was extended to reach the Olympic Village and Port. Both Renfe, Spanish state-owned railway group, and the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat, the regional network, connect the nearby towns of the Baix Llobregat and Valles, many of which have developed rapidly in recent years as part of the commuter belt, and have put the coastal resort towns of Castelldefels and Sitges within half an hours' journey from the city. In an effort to encourage people to leave their cars outside the city, before the Games large car parks were built at many of the suburban stations. Public transport, either by bus or by metro, is heavily subsidised  -with the average cost of a journey less than Pta 60, about half of what it costs the city council. Joan Torres, the head of public transport at the city council, says the figure of 11,300 distinctive black and yellow taxis is around 3,000 more than the European average, given the size of the city. As transport falls under the jurisdiction of all three administrations - central, regional and local - a consortium has been created, inspired again by the co-operation of the Games, to plan for the future. The next step is a programme of underground car parks, and in a few years it is hoped that trams will be reintroduced. But in such a compact city, the simplest form of transport, and the one which 30 per cent the population use to go to work, remains walking.</p>

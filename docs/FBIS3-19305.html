			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Arthur Leathley: "CBI Chief Attacks Way Britain Is Run"] </F>   [Text] The leader of Britain's employers, the  Confederation of British Industry [CBI], last night demanded  wide-ranging changes in central and local government and in  Britain's European role.    Howard Davies director-general of the CBI set out a  catalogue  of reforms which called into question the fabric of  decision-making in Britain. Local government was at the head of  what he described as "a menu of modest proposals" which would  require an overhauling of the way that the public sector was run  at regional and local level.    Mr Davies, speaking to the European Policy Forum, an  independent think tank, demanded that central government should  allow local councils greater flexibility over their own  functions, particularly through greater control of their own  money.    Wider sources of revenue, such as channelling vehicle excise  duty to local councils, would help to make local authorities  self-financing, while national services, such as education,  should be taken out of local authority control.    Mr Davies said that, although he respected the strengths of  Parliament, there was widespread concern about whether it was  effective in preparing legislation.    His intervention comes at a sensitive time for the  Government  as it faces criticism for its handling of local government.    Voicing the concerns of the business community, Mr Davies  said there was a need for a regional dimension for handling  transport and planning needs.    Many local authorities were "small-minded, grotesquely  inefficient and generally awful," and were "in desperate need of  reform."    However, even after 144 pieces of legislation under the Tory  Government, Mr Davies insisted last night that "we are left with  much confusion and conflict."    He called for more extensive consultation with outside  bodies  before Bills were drafted, and said that interested parties  should be called to give evidence to MPs scrutinising new  legislation. There should also be periodic review of the  operation of legislation, which would allow input from outside  bodies.    His pressure for change will strike a chord with many MPs of  all parties who are concerned that the relationship between  local and central government has become increasingly strained.</p>

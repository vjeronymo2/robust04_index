			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / The Property Market: UK giant profits from its cautious ways Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, the UK's largest property company, sat in his splendid new offices overlooking Trafalgar Square in central London and gently scoffed at the critics who believe the company is too cautious. 'If we had geared up two years ago as the brokers said we should, we (he motioned to his fellow directors) would not be here.' The claim was something of an exaggeration at a time when his rivals have kept their jobs in spite of some hair-raising mistakes. But Mr Hunt can be forgiven for pressing the point. Land Securities has been a model of prudence - at a time when extravagant gestures were two-a-penny in the sector. The company's caution has been rewarded by the stock market, where its share price has significantly out-performed the rest of the sector. And the trend could well continue; a poll of investors by Gallup for Chartered Surveyor Weekly, a trade magazine, this week suggested that Land Securities would be the best performing property share of the year. Investors appreciate the liquidity of Land Securities' shares in addition to the company's stability and broad exposure to property. 'It's almost like an institution,' says Mr Marc Gilbard of County NatWest, the brokers. Few of Land Securities' stock market rivals offer such security of income. Three quarters of the company's rental income is underpinned by leases expiring beyond 2000, without break clauses and with upward only rent reviews. The company has not put a foot wrong in recent years and its stalwart, defensive qualities are exactly attuned to investors' needs at present. But for how much longer? Will its supporters abandon it in better times, as they have done in the rising markets of the past? Moreover, might the very qualities that have stood it in such good stead as an investment make it a target of criticism in the broader context of the economy as whole? The criticism of Land Securities is largely directed at its conservatism and bulk. Its tenants, struggling in the teeth of recession, could be forgiven for viewing the company as a rent-collecting machine, which reaps its profits from the structure of a UK property market which heavily favours landlords. Land Securities' rents - among the highest in the world - are protected by lengthy leases, upward only reviews and the right to claim rent from an original tenant if it assigned a lease to a company that subsequently defaulted. At a time when these contracts are driving businesses into receivership, large landlords such as Land Securities are sometimes seen as burdens on business rather than providers of an essential service. The company's apparently effortless ability to generate higher profits has long provoked envy as well as admiration. 'Landsits: How to stay in bed and make Pounds 10m' thundered a newspaper headline in 1980. The same reaction has often been provoked by Land Securities' ability to increase the value of its portfolio (with two notable exceptions: in the property crash of the early 1970s, the value of its portfolio crashed by 38 per cent; and the 32 per cent decline over the past two years). In the 1980s, a newspaper complained: 'There is something almost indecent about a company which sees its value increase by more than Pounds 1bn in a single year with barely a sign of sweat on its management's brow.' A common charge against Land Securities is that after it had built itself up through an audacious programme of borrowing and takeovers, it then simply sat on the best sites in London. This emphasis on acquiring the best positions in London was reflected in the enduring motto of the company's founder, Lord Samuel: 'Location, location, location.' The company's natural caution was reflected in its reluctance to pioneer new markets in the Docklands. This bewildered more adventurous developers, including Olympia &amp; York, which thought that London's established landlords were responsible for the capital's outdated and expensive office stock. Land Securities' policy of shunning new locations such as the Docklands could have been risky. During the heady days of the late 1980s, it seemed as though the primacy of location (ie, the City) would be replaced by the need for the most up-to-date product (as provided by the Docklands) as the most important priority for tenants. In the event, following the difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Land Securities' reserve in venturing into the Docklands seems vindicated. Criticism of the company's conservatism does not rankle with Land Securities. The company remains unabashed about its lack of enthusiasm for pioneering offices in east London. Mr Hunt believes that London will go on developing in a westerly direction. He describes the government's promotion of the Docklands and its lackadaisical attitude to transport planning as 'extraordinary'. The government's decision, late in the day, to give priority to east London's infrastructure over central London is 'monstrous', says Mr Hunt. 'The taxpayers working in the centre deserve to have central London tubes and railways built with their money before that thing in east London,' he says. Land Securities can also shrug off the idea that it has an outdated portfolio. During the 1980s, it spent hundreds of millions on revitalising its portfolio. The task of updating its Pounds 4.3bn of property is an endless one and the process will continue, although the slump in the market has forced Land Securities to mothball its planned redevelopment of buildings such as Stag Place in Victoria. Even its concentration on central London offices - which are still set to under-perform - is less overwhelming than previously. Retail and industrial property now account for more than half the portfolio's value, the result of a conscious shift in strategy as well as the slump in office values. Land Securities now likes to describe itself as the biggest retail investor on the market. Yet some property experts think it is just too large to be nimble. 'It is like a crude oil tanker,' says one. 'If it wants to change direction by five degrees, it takes 20 miles to do it.' This is a long-standing criticism. Back in 1979, Mr Joseph Sebag, then one of the UK's top property brokers, issued a call for the company to be broken up. 'We believe that the group is now just too large to manage dynamically and consider the management's philosophy is to put safety before entrepreneurial gain,' he said. The young Turks of the 1980s property expansion agreed and repeatedly ran their slide rules over Land Securities. They reckoned they could secure greater returns by borrowing and working the companies' assets harder, although in the end, the company was always too big to be threatened. The charge that Land Securities is an under-geared monolith that is insufficiently exploiting depressed market conditions may gather force when the market recovers. Rivals which are more highly geared will see the steepest increases in their assets, a key measure of a property company's success. But Land Securities remains unmoved. Although it has looked at the possibility of corporate acquisitions it considers that none have sufficient quality. It would prefer to cherry pick individual properties, while keeping a stern eye on its own gearing, now at 43 per cent. 'We are not going to buy because brokers say we should,' says Mr Hunt. 'In a valuation based business you have to be very careful with gearing.' The more the company borrows, the greater impact falling property prices will have on its net asset value. Not all analysts think that Land Securities's asset values will take another battering this year. Mr David Tunstall, a property analyst with Smith New Court, a securities company, says an improvement in retail values could push the company's net asset value up from 555p to 570p this year. Most analysts have pencilled in another fall, some to as little as 500p over the next two years. There is also reason to be cautious about future profits. The large rent increases which were in the pipeline two years ago have virtually disappeared in the worst-hit parts of the market. But Land Securities has no reason to be on the defensive. It has made none of the mistakes of its smaller rivals. And if inflation and the rewards of heavy borrowing are things of the past, its cautious style may stay in fashion.</p>

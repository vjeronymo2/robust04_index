Publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and delaying the effective date of this regulation would be contrary to the public interest since the event is expected to result in a high concentration of spectator and participant vessels, and the actual stipulations of the special local regulations were not finalized in time for publication more than 30 days prior to the start of the event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this regulation is published as a final rule without prior notice, an opportunity for public comment is nevertheless desirable to ensure the regulation is both reasonable and workable.

In addition, races in the Citizen Cup Defender Semi-Final and Final Series, the Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Semi-Final and Final Series, and the America's Cup Match Races will be held on several series of dates during the period mid-March through May 1995. Special Local Regulations establishing measures promoting the safety of these races are the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11&hyph;94&hyph;010); as these regulations contain different vessel operating restrictions, publishing a separate set of regulations for the latter period will help reduce confusion to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of San Diego Bay, Mission Bay and the IACC race venue during the Citizen Cup and Louis Vuitton Cup by controlling the traffic entering, exiting, and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the geographic area of applicability of these special local regulations, speed limits and operating requirements have been established for orderly passage to and from San Diego Bay and the race venue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Speed limits and operating requirements are also established for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On each specified race date, these regulations will be in effect in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay during two periods: between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon; and again in the afternoon for a two-hour period which will fall between 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Selection of the afternoon regulatory period will depend on the time of termination of race activities for that date. Notice of commencement and termination of the afternoon regulatory period will be made by Broadcast Notice to Mariners; a 15-minute advance notice of commencement of the afternoon regulatory period will also be broadcast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of the winner selection process and other circumstances may dictate that races will not actually be conducted on dates specified as race dates. In the event of cancellation or postponement of races scheduled for a particular date, the Patrol Commander's election not to implement these regulations on that date will be announced via Broadcast Notice to Mariners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and/or a five knot speed limit. These requirements will be activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. In addition, sailing vessels may be restricted to operating under auxiliary power or under tow, and motor-sailing with mainsail only. Activation of these additional regulations will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> UnionFed Unit Placed Under Restrictions: Federal thrift regulators ordered Los  Angeles-based Union Federal Savings Bank to stop paying stock dividends and  limited its loan-making ability until the institution comes up with an  acceptable plan to raise more capital, officials said. The Office of Thrift  Supervision imposed the restrictions on Union Federal, owned by Brea-based  UnionFed Financial Corp., just two weeks after the parent company was forced to  restate its yearly earnings to show an $18.1-million loss.  </P></p>

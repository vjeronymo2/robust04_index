			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Candelaria Rodriguez and Jose Antonio Roman] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 20 Jun -- The position  adopted by the Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, which  Subcommander Marcos has disclosed, does not affect the federal  government's intentions and plans to fulfill the pledges it has  made "because those pledges are totally justified and are  promises made to the communities," said Hector Hernandez Llamas,  a member of the government's executive Peace Commission in  Chiapas.    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has imparted  instructions  for full execution of the government's 2 March pledges, and  after the EZLN's refusal to comply eight days ago, the same  orders were imparted. The reached agreements, as well as  changes in the judicial system, Hernandez has said, are needed  by the communities that will benefit from them.    Regarding the funds earmarked for the war zone, 1 billion  pesos, the Peace Commission member has said a large percentage  of that money is for such services as health and highway  infrastructure in three areas: jungles, mountains, and border  regions. Another considerable portion will be used for  education, although productive projects will not be neglected.    The federal government must finalize its programs for  electricity, a rural telephone system, and potable water for the  townships by October. Efforts are also being made in the area  of education. A significant number of elementary school  children will be included in the school system in September,  particularly in communities that have irregular school systems.    It is expected that production projects will have been  agreed  upon and operational by June and July if the federal and state  governments finalize their plans and clearly prove their desire  to execute actions which, once and for all, will create a better  future and a more optimistic outlook on life for the Chiapas  communities. The government wants a return to peace that will  foster better living conditions for the communities in that  state.    Hernandez said it is necessary for both sides to yield. We  will be able to find ways of reaching agreements and working  together as long as they have the resolve to do so. Hernandez  concluded that as the elements emerge, "we will solidify in  time, form, and space the general agreements reached at the  beginning of March in San Cristobal de las Casas.

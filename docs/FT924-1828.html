			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Jobs: Putting your money where your faith is - Where expatriate workers' religious convictions can increase their employers' paybills 'IT all began with the New Testament . . . ' explained the patient voice from the German Embassy in London. 'You mean when the decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed?' the Jobs column inquired. 'Well, not precisely at that moment,' the un-named diplomat conceded. 'But as a consequence of it, yes.' Now, with today bringing this column's last appearance of the year, it is probably futile to assure readers that the above conversation really occurred, as distinct from being invented to give a Christmassy flavour. Even so, the fact is that what prompted the call to the German embassy was only accidentally connected with the season. It just so happened that Price Waterhouse was showing off its new system for calculating the costs of sending employees to work overseas. And one of the PW consultants came up with an example. 'Suppose you moved someone on a Pounds 60,000 salary in Britain to Germany for three years with a guarantee that they'd be no worse off through taxation and so on,' he said. 'What d'you think would be the total outlay?' Then quick as a flash the computer produced the answers. They were that, whereas before Black Wednesday the prospective bill would have been almost Pounds 391,000, it is now over Pounds 475,000. 'Mind you,' the consultant went on, 'the cost could be more if the people you send don't know about local conditions. For instance, if they belong to certain religious denominations and say so on their registration forms, they'll be liable to the extra taxes the German government collects for the churches.' However familiar that fact may be to readers, it was news to me. My first thought was that perhaps the said taxes varied, with different religions coming to market at different prices. After all, I'd seen something of the sort before: at the start of my national service 40 years back in the navy, when the various chaplains came round in turn describing their schedules for Sunday morning. The Roman Catholics and the Church of England each had pukka parades. While they were marching off to their respective services, agnostics and atheists were kept busy square-bashing. In the meantime the Methodists and Church of Scotland made their way informally to a short joint service with no sermon, followed by coffee made by the Wrens in attendance. (Whereupon, having not been brought up in any church, I became a Methodist - though I'm ashamed to say a since-lapsed one.) Could it be, I mused coming back from PW's demonstration, that the Germans operate some comparable arrangement through the tax system? Hence the chat with the diplomat. Alas he swiftly knocked down my idea about price-competition. The tax was at the same rate regardless of denomination, although in some of the country's states it was a percentage point less than in others. 'It is the successor to the church tithe of medieval times. But it is not on your total income, or at 10 per cent either. It is levied at 8 or 9 per cent of whatever sum you are assessed for by way of normal taxes. You do not pay unless you positively register yourself to do so.' In any case, he said, the option is open only to Roman Catholics, Jews and certain Protestants. 'A church needs many members to make the scheme pay - as the government acts as collector for the churches, you don't think it loses on the deal, do you? And no one pretends that whether you pay counts in heaven; it is solely about money here on earth.' Nevertheless, he added, things can go wrong. After unification, for example, the scheme was not well explained to the former East Germans. 'When they came to register, some who had clung to their faith wished to affirm it, and under the old regime it had anyway been unwise to leave blank spaces on official forms. So suddenly, of the little earnings they had, more was taken. But the government and churches apologised, and let them change things for the next half-year.' Which, this being Christmas, the Jobs column offers as an example to tax-collectors the wide world over. F INALLY this year to pagan matters - my traditional guide to the cost of acquiring and trying to escape a hangover in 18 international centres. The figures are generously supplied by the Runzheimer consultancy, based in Rochester, Wisconsin. The first three columns give the 'on-cost', the local prices of a litre apiece of a particular (though undisclosed) brand of whisky and of vodka, followed by the average of both. The next four cover the 'off-cost': 100 branded aspirin, three dozen Alka Seltzer (except in Tokyo where for some reason they don't seem to be sold) and half a pound of instant coffee - again averaged. The right-hand column lumps the on-cost and off-cost averages together, giving the aggregate price - in money, at least. And now, wishing you all the compliments of the season, I'll hope to meet you again in 1993.</p>

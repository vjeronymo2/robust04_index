			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Some 600 academicians  of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the newly-founded  Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), China's two top scientific  bodies, are meeting here to draw up a blueprint for China's  scientific and technological development as well as to probe a  road to national prosperity powered by science and technology.    During the grand gathering of the two academies, physicist  Prof. Zhou Guangzhao, president of the CAS, told XINHUA about  the strategic thinking of China's scientific and technological  development.    He said that the advancement of modern productivity comes  largely out of progress in science and technology. The key to  the solution of problems plaguing China, such as those related  to resources, the environment and development, lies in no more  than science and technology.    "Only by relying on modern science and technology, can we  create a productivity bringing good economic returns, high  efficiency and sustainable development," said Zhou, a renowned  theoretical physicist.    He said that China must base its scientific and  technological  developmental plan and strategy strictly on its real national  conditions, as economies at different development stages call  for different industrial and technological structures.    "Once any scientific and technological development scheme  deviates from its corresponding economic development stage, it  will have negative effects on economic growth as well as on the  progress of science and technology itself," the professor said.    China's strategy for scientific and technological  development  must therefore be forward-looking and far-sighted in nature, and  must serve the development of the upcoming economic stages,  rather than a stage now passing, Zhou said.    He listed four basic facts which had to be taken into  account  when China draws up its scientific and technological development  program:    -- Compared with developed countries, China is in an  inferior  position in terms of the overall economic strength and  scientific and technological development level;    -- China's vast population, a lack of resources in per  capita  terms, and environmental deterioration have combined to cast a  great burden on development, and will restrain development;    -- China's huge market and potential can push forward the  world economy;    -- China's high savings rate, low salary standard and the  fact that Chinese people are hard-working can create favorable  conditions for capital accumulation and industrial development.    The first two facts indicate that development is an arduous  task and a sustainable development is therefore ever more  necessary. The other two facts have made it possible for China  to utilize both domestic and foreign capital and technology,  accelerate scientific, technological and industrial progress and  achieve the relatively quick development, the academy president  said.    Overall, China should adopt a strategy marked by sustained  and coordinated development and get ready for a long-term  economic battle, Zhou said.    Meanwhile, China must be ready and able to fight  "quick-victory economic campaigns" in some specific domains, by  pooling capital and manpower and leaping over some links and  stages in the technical development process. This will help  China achieve quick development, he explained.    In some of the world's emerging high-tech spheres, which  have  potentially immense impact on future industrial development,  China should adopt a strategy with a mechanism that reacts  swiftly and such a strategy must be supported by a guarantee of  manpower, materials and funds, the professor stressed.    "In some selected spheres, China should strive to make  breakthroughs by introducing market economy mechanism," he  noted, adding that this was quite possible, especially in some  high-tech fields that need limited funds but much intelligence.    Talking about scientific and technological competition  worldwide, Zhou said that it is of little meaning to repeat past  discoveries.    The Chinese scientific and technological community should  tap  the superiority and potential of research institutes and  universities and colleges as well as encourage academic  pace-setters, particularly young scholars and technicians, to  set up comprehensive scientific research centers and compete in  the most advanced frontiers of the world's science and  technology kingdom.    However, he pointed out that China, as a big country with a  still low economic, scientific and technological development  level, would meet with ever intensifying international  competitions in all spheres in its whole process of opening  wider to the outside world.    "In these conditions, Chinese scientists, young scientists  in  particular, must get themselves well prepared and grasp all  opportunities so as to win a foothold in the international  scientific arena and eventually make contributions to our  times," the president urged.</p>

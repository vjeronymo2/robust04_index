			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / International Company News: Germans plan Europe rating agency A GERMAN initiative to develop a new European rating agency is soon to be promoted in other European countries. The aim is to create an entity which will cater for local investors' needs in the single market. Although several small rating agencies already exist in other European countries, the Germans are keen to develop a single Europe-wide institution, or at least to harmonise standards across a federation of agencies. A group of some 20 German companies and institutions, principally inspired by Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, are poised to set up a project company which will put the concept to a wider audience, including the French Italians and Britons. Those ratings ascribed to debt instruments alert investors to grades of risks and to changes in those risks. While the process has been less crucial to the European capital markets than those in America, the two big US agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, have established a significant presence in Europe. Moody's, for instance, claims to rate around 78 per cent of the outstandings in the Euro D-Mark bond market. Promoters of the new agency believe that, while the US agencies provide a highly efficient service for large corporations selling their debt to global investors, they do not have the capacity to analyse medium-sized companies in Europe targeting a more specialised investor interest. The Germans also argue that the American agencies are driven by US accounting principles and focus on short-term performance criteria that are less relevant for Europe. The group points out that the growth of capital market borrowing instruments reduces companies' dependence on bank-financed debt, which in turn increases the importance of ratings. The new agency should allow less well-known companies to reach new investors anywhere in Europe, through the common language of a simple debt classification. Commercial paper, medium-term notes, and multi-currency bonds would all be candidates for ratings, according to working party outlines. German interest in the project has been spurred by the recent development of a D-Mark commercial paper market, permitted since the beginning of the year. It already has outstandings of around DM1bn, issued by only a handful of borrowers.</p>

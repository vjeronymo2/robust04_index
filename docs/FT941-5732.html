			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner reverses into the red Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, the Norwegian shipowner, suffered a pre-tax loss of NKr47m (Dollars 6.35m) for 1993, compared with a profit of NKr166m in 1992. The loss was primarily due to weak markets in several shipping segments, foreign currency losses on debt and an increase in pension obligations. Nevertheless, the shipowner plans to lift its dividend to NKr1.50 from NKr1.30. Group turnover in 1993 rose to NKr3.58bn from NKr3.34bn while operating profit, before financial and other items, advanced to NKr285m from NKr221m. Financial items increased sharply to NKr194m from NKr55m. Wilhelmsen also provided NKr138m to cover pension obligations. Wilhelmsen said it had disposed of a 47.5 per cent shareholding in a drilling rig which will bring a gain of NKr175m to the 1994 accounts. Scancem, a 50-50 joint venture between Norway's Aker group and Sweden's Euroc, is to buy a 49 per cent stake in Cimangola, an Angolan cement plant. The deal, valued at NKr135m, of which Scancem will pay 50 per cent, also involves an unnamed international cement producer.</p>

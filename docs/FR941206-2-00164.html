			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (12) Test and Maintenance Equipment. (a) Eligible: Required test equipment, as indicated by good engineering practice for the maintenance of the project equipment. (b) Ineligible: Maintenance equipment such as hand and power tools, storage cabinets, and maintenance services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Air Conditioning and Ventilation. (a) Eligible: The costs to provide ventilation of eligible project equipment, such as ducting for transmitters, as required by good engineering practice. Transmitter air conditioning can be applied for and will be supported if the need is well-documented in the application. (b) Ineligible: Unless exceptionally well-documented, air conditioning for transmitters, control rooms, or equipment rooms, studios, mobile units, and other operational rooms and offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Remote Vans. (a) Eligible: Items to equip a remote van for audio/video production. (b) Ineligible: All vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Other Expenses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Construction Applications: NTIA generally will not fund salary expenses, including staff installation costs, pre-application legal and engineering fees. Certain ``pre-operational expenses'' are eligible for funding. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  15 CFR 2301.1.) Despite this provision, NTIA regards its primary mandate to be funding the acquisition of equipment and only secondarily funding salaries. (A discussion of this issue appears in the PTFP Final Rules, 56 FR 59172 (1991).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Planning Applications. (a) Eligible: Salaries are eligible expenses for all planning grant applications, but should be fully described and justified within the application. Planning grant applications may lease office equipment, furniture and space, and may purchase expendable supplies under the terms of Section 392(c) of the Act. (b) Ineligible: Planning grant applications cannot include the cost of constructing or operating a telecommunications facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Audit Costs. (a) Non-Profit Organizations: Non-profit organizations receiving payments of more than $25,000 in Federal funds during a one-year period are required to have an audit conducted in accordance with Federal guidelines. Audits for non-profit organizations are performed in one of two ways. An NTIA/PTFP-specific audit can be performed if the organization receives funds solely from NTIA. If the organization receives funds from more than one Federal source during the year that the audit is conducted, an organization-wide audit must be performed under OMB Circular A&hyph;133. (Note that Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding is not considered a Federal source.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal guidelines allow NTIA/PTFP to include an amount for audit costs as part of a grant award. NTIA/PTFP policy permits non-profit organizations to include up to $5,000 for audit costs in an application. Because audit costs may vary depending on the size and scope of an organization's operations, NTIA/PTFP recommends that applicants obtain estimates from auditors to determine the appropriate amount to include in their applications. Construction Grant Applicants should list the amount requested for audit costs in Part II, Section D_Other Project Costs, 1. Outside Services of the PTFP Application Form. Planning Grant Applicants should include the amount on line 7, Other, in Part III_Budget Information for Planning Grant Applicants of the PTFP Application Form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Government Agencies, Indian Tribes, and Educational Institutions: State and local governments, Indian tribes, and educational institutions are also subject to federal audit requirements if they receive over $25,000 in Federal funds during a one-year period. NTIA/PTFP can allow only an amount for audit costs equal to the NTIA/PTFP percentage of all Federal funds received by an entity. It is expected that the NTIA/PTFP percentage of the Federal funds received by state and local governments and educational institutions would be minimal in any one year, and NTIA/PTFP does not anticipate that these entities will include an amount for audit costs in their applications. These entities are not precluded from including such an amount in their applications, however, and the merit of such requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Purchase of American-Made Equipment and Products <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prospective PTFP applicants are hereby notified that they will be encouraged to purchase, to the greatest extent practicable, American-made equipment and products with funding provided under this program in accordance with Congressional intent as set forth in the resolution contained in Public Law 103&hyph;317, Sections 607 (a) and (b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Selection Process and Project Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PTFP grants are awarded on the basis of a competitive review process. Before being selected for a grant award, a given application for PTFP funding will undergo many stages of review, all of which apply the program's Funding Criteria listed in the Final Rules (15 CFR 2301.13 and 2301.14). The review includes the following: an evaluation by PTFP staff; a technical assessment by staff engineers; a review by outside readers, all of whom have demonstrated expertise in either public broadcasting or distance learning; and a rating by National Advisory Panels, composed of representatives of the major national public radio and television organizations. In addition, NTIA gives ``special consideration'' to the applications according to the level of involvement of women and minorities in the control and operation of the applicant's station or project or the degree to which the project's programming will be specifically directed towards meeting the needs and interests of minority groups or women. Documentation of substantial involvement by minorities or women may increase a given application's competitiveness. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

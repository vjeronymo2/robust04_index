			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 60-day period for public comments commenced on April 1, 1994 and expired on May 30, 1994. The United States received only one comment on the proposed Final Judgment, a letter from Michael London. As required by 15 U.S.C. 16(b), this comment is being filed with this response. (Exhibit A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In his comments, Mr. London expressed concern that the proposed Final Judgment's prohibition on advance price announcements would deprive consumers of valuable information for making travel plans. Mr. London also expressed concern that the United States may have filed its lawsuit without sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims against the airlines. The United States sent Mr. London a letter individually responding to his inquiries regarding the proposed Final Judgment. The United State's correspondence with Mr. London is also being filed with this response. (Exhibit B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has carefully considered Mr. London's comments. Nothing in these comments has altered the United States' conclusion that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment provides all of the relief requested in the Complaint against American, Alaska, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Trans World, the ATP, without the substantial expense of a trial. The relief provided by the proposed decree will leave these airlines and ATP without the ability to resume the actions that constituted the antitrust violations. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Respectfully submitted, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Mary Jean Moltenbrey, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Attorney, Antitrust Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exhibit A_Civil Action No. 92&hyph;2854 (SSH) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> April 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Attorney General, Anne K. Bingaman,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> United States Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dear Ms. Bingaman: I am writing to you concerning an article that appeared in our local newspaper about a settlement of price fixing allegations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are 2 points about this matter that concern me as both an air traveller and as a citizen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) I have found in the past, the prenotification of fare adjustments very useful in planning airline travel. My travel agent would scan the computer system for reduced fares to be effective at some future date. I could then plan travel for a date when that fare would be available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would enable me to save money instead of paying a higher current fare. Therefore, instead of injuring the public, this practice could result in savings over existing fares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The part that really concerns me and that seems unbelievable is the section of the article that states ``The government believes that history would make proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt difficult''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this paraphrase of your department's statement is correct, it seems a terrible thing that our government would take action under these circumstances. I always thought that there were Constitutional safeguards that protected individuals and companies against arbitrary prosecution. If the Justice Department had these doubts, how dare they waste our tax money and impinge the reputation of companies on such an unsubstantiated charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I am a stockholder of one of the airline companies named as a party to the settlement. I believe that unfair and arbitrary actions of the Justice Department have injured the reputation of the company and therefore my investment. If I believe that the actions of the Justice Department constitute False Prosecution or the attempt at False Prosecution, what remedies are available to me? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;Very Truly yours, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael London. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- Although the Egyutteles  [Coexistence] Movement does not trust the whole government  coalition, it still wants to go on supporting the government of  Jozef Moravcik, Miklos Duray, chairman of the Egyutteles  Movement of ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, says in an  interview published by the independent Czech daily MLADA FRONTA  DNES today.    "My mistrust is aimed mainly against the post-communist  Democratic Left Party (SDL), which from the outside looks like  being open to ethnic minority demands. But it is just the  opposite: It is the strong SDL group of deputies which has long  been blocking the solution of minority questions. I would like  to point out it is known that the SDL deputies are considering  post-election cooperation with (ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar,"  Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES. Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, now an opposition entity,  consistently tops opinion polls.    "Of course, we are aware that despite its mistakes, the  (present) government is a better alternative than Meciar," Duray  says. "However,... the Egyutteles would like the government to  arise from the new elections (slated for autumn) to lean more to  the right, as Hungarians were always able to reach consensus  with the Slovak right wing," he states.    He dismisses the idea that he and Meciar need each other to  legitimize their political stands. "I do not need Mr. Meciar for  my political existence.... Mr.Meciar has caused many problems  to Slovak residents, and as a politician I do not want any  problems," Duray emphasizes.    He says he does not consider himself a radical, but a  politician not inclining to compromises at the cost of  principles.    To the question of the interviewer whether or not the  Egyutteles contributed to the tension (between Slovaks and the  strong Hungarian minority) in south Slovakia, when three of its  nine deputies recently voted against the "place-name" bill  (which was to enable bilingual place names in the above  regions), Duray says the rejected bill's wording was far from  what the ethnic Hungarian parties agreed with the government  coalition. The bill could also have been passed if it were not  for the absence of thirteen coalition deputies at the relevant  parliamentary session, he adds.    "We have very precise information that the Council of Europe  (CE) was attentively monitoring developments in Slovakia and the  country's attitude to the ethnic minority question," Duray says.  He points out that the CE had not been correctly informed about  the "place name" bill. According to him, CE representatives had  believed that the Slovak Parliament would pass the law in a form  known from Norway or southern Tyrol. "They did not know at all  that we (ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia) had given up our claim  for bilingual names of towns and villages, and accepted --  within a compromise -- the introduction of bilingual road signs.  But this is a fundamental difference, and if they (the CE) had  known this, the opinion could not arise that Slovak Hungarians  demanded what could not be fulfilled. Therefore I cannot but  state that Slovak representatives in the CE had distorted the  reality at last," Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES.    Referring to the question of a Hungarian-Slovak agreement to  grant the unalterability of the common border, Duray says: "I do  not think at all that the question is of any great political or  international importance. The border, as all borders in Europe,  has been guaranteed since the end of World War Two. There is  only one exception, that of the former Yugoslavia, where we are  witness to a bloody war, which in no case threatens between  Slovakia and Hungary. After the split of the Czechoslovak  Federation (on January 1, 1993) both Slovakia and the Czech  Republic are in the position of successor states, which also  means their borders are guaranteed," Duray points out.    The Egyutteles Movement has 9 deputies in the 150-seat  Slovak  Parliament. Neither it nor the other ethnic Hungarian  parliamentary party, the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH, 5 deputies) are members of the government coalition, but  they are supporting the present government.</p>

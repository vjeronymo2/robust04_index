			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Improved service pledge for jobseekers Unemployed people, who are coming under increased government pressure to find jobs, can expect an improved service from their local Jobcentres under the terms of a Jobseeker's Charter published yesterday. The charter, the second for jobseekers, says that callers at the Employment Service should be seen on time and 'certainly must not wait longer than 10 minutes'. It comes when the service is getting even tougher on people who it believes are not actively seeking work. Unemployed people are being offered vacancies which are deemed 'hard to fill' as a way of testing whether they are genuine applicants for social security benefit. The service is responding to continuing governmental pressure to get people into jobs - with individual offices displaying their own and other offices' performances. This year the service as a whole has been given a target by the government of getting 1.7m people into work, compared with 1.47m in 1993-94. Other features of the charter, announced by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, include pledges: To make it a priority that job vacancies advertised are as up-to-date as possible. To answer telephone calls within 30 seconds. To respond to letters within five working days - in clear, plain language. To pay the right amount of benefit on time.</p>

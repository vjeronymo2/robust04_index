			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Poll reveals gulf between French leaders and voters FRANCE'S 51.05 per cent majority vote for European monetary and political union has given President Francois Mitterrand a reprieve, but signals a profound change for French politics. The first outlines of the new landscape started to emerge yesterday as the broadly pro-European political establishment, both left and right, began to take in the sombre message of the vote. It showed that the main parties' policies on the wide range of subjects in the Maastricht treaty are out of kilter with the views of nearly half the electorate. 'The problem of Maastricht has been sorted out, but the problem of France is another story. This country is manifestly troubled,' warned former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the centre-right UDF. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, added: 'We will have to take account of the French who voted No.' Alarmed party leaders were already starting to reposition themselves yesterday for legislative elections due next March. The governing committees of the Socialists, RPR Gaullists and Communists are all to meet in the next week. There were reports that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, was urging a snap parliamentary poll, before the RPR Gaullist party had time to reconcile the internal splits opened by the campaign. Mr Fabius disagreed, partly on the grounds that the Socialists need more time to seek an alliance with the ecology parties, both of which are mainly pro-Maastricht and which represent a combined 14 per cent of the electorate. Meanwhile Mr Jacques Chirac, the pro-Maastricht president of the mainly anti-treaty RPR Gaullist party, is set to demand a vote of confidence in his leadership at a meeting of the party's national council tomorrow. Supporters of Mr Philippe Seguin and Mr Charles Pasqua, the leading anti-treaty rebels in the RPR, yesterday called on Mr Chirac to negotiate a fresh European policy with them. For the time being, it looks as if a presidential election is not on the agenda. Mr Mitterrand has won the European gamble, and will probably want to take a hand in steering the remains of Maastricht or its successor through the EC. In theory, he can stay in the Elysee until April 1995, though few observers believe he will, in view of his illness and the thrashing the Socialists are expected to receive at the legislative election. According to exit polls on Sunday night, the Socialists and their allies would pull in a mere 22 per cent of the votes in a legislative election, while the RPR and UDF would get a solid relative majority of 45 per cent. The big challenge facing all the main parties as they prepare for the election campaign is how to tackle the deep regional, class and economic divisions opened up by the referendum debate. Sunday night's voting statistics reveal a sobering pattern, decribed by Mr Giscard d'Estaing as a map of the haves and have-nots. As an indication of just how easily the result could have swung the other way, 54 of France's 96 departements - 56 per cent of the total - produced a majority No vote. It was perilously close; only 50.82 per cent of the electorate in mainland France voted in favour of the treaty. The final votes from the overseas territories and domains, in the South Pacific and Caribbean, lifted the total to 51.05 per cent. Generally, the treaty got the thumbs-up from rich regions and cities such as Paris, Strasbourg, eastern France along the German border and Rhone-Alpes. The big surprise here is that Brittany, with its poor agricultural and fishing communities, was among those regions to follow its politicians' advice and come out with a solid Yes. Maastricht even won the day in La Trinite-sur-Mer, the birthplace of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing National Front and one of the treaty's most outspoken opponents. The Noes were to be found in economically depressed regions like Nord-Pas-de-Calais, hit by the decline of traditional industries; Picardy, north of Paris; and Corsica and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The poor port cities of Marseilles and Calais were also confirmed as hotbeds of Euro-scepticism. Generally, the pattern shows that economically vulnerable areas gave the thumbs down to their political leaders' Euro-enthusiasm. Exit polls reinforce that idea, showing majority opposition to the treaty among farmers and industrial workers, with support from executives and the professional classes. The exit polls also showed that the RPR is not the only party to split over Europe, though it is the one with the deepest divisions. Around 60 per cent of RPR voters ignored Mr Chirac's pro-Maastricht policy and voted against, while around 40 per cent of UDF supporters ignored Mr Giscard d'Estaing's line and voted against. Among Socialist voters, 20 per cent defected into the anti-Maastricht camp. In the days and weeks to come, the main parties' leaders have some hard thinking to do if they are to respond to their supporters' doubts in time for the legislative election.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FRANCE AND EUROPEAN UNION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1990         1990            Businesses                          Population  Unemployment  Agriculture  Industry                            ('000)         (%)        (% of 1988 total)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Alsace                  1,624.4        5.2         5.5          9.4 2  Aquitaine               2,795.8       10.1        10.4          8.5 3  Auvergne                1,321.2        9.3         9.8          9.7 4  Basse-Normande          1,391.3        9.0        12.0          8.4 5  Brittany                2,795.6        9.5        11.6          7.9 6  Burgundy                1,609.7        8.1        12.8          8.3 7  Centre                  2,371.0        7.9        14.2          8.6 8  Champagne-Ardenne       1,347.8        9.2        15.3          8.8 9  Corsica                   250.4        9.7         3.5          6.9 10 Franche-Comte           1,097.3        7.0         6.9         10.8 11 Haute-Normandie         1,737.2       10.7         6.9          8.4 12 Ile-de-France          10,660.6        7.3         0.6         10.9 13 Languedoc-Roussillon    2,115.0       13.1         7.4          7.3 14 Limousin                  722.9        7.8        16.3          9.3 15 Lorraine                2,305.7        8.5         5.5          9.4 16 Midi-Pyrenees           2,430.7        8.9         7.0          9.4 17 Nord-Pas-de-Calais      3,965.1       12.5         5.2          8.3 18 Pays de la Loire        3,059.1        9.6        12.4          8.5 19 Picardy                 1,810.7        9.7         8.5          8.7 20 Poitou-Charentes        1,595.1       10.1        13.2          8.3 21 Provence-Alpes-Cote        d'Azur              4,257.9       10.9         2.8          8.1 22 Rhone-alpes             5,350.7        7.3         5.1         10.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                     56,615.2        8.9         6.9          9.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Insee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Developing a new image for its core businesses - Hanson maintains the new key to its success is building up its main companies MR DAVID HARRIS, vice president of Cavenham Forest Industries, has survived more changes of ownership than he cares to remember. During the last seven years the US timber and wood products business has evolved from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation into an independent company owned by Sir James Goldsmith who then swapped it with Hanson for the conglomerate's 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining. Mr Harris, based in Portland, Oregon, said trying to extract cash for the previous owners became a trying routine of selling properties and closing manufacturing facilities. 'The big difference working for Hanson is that we now look for acquisition opportunities instead of divestiture opportunities.' This new emphasis on building core business seems at odds with Hanson's reputation for squeezing cash out of companies and spending the minimum necessary on developing them. In the past Hanson has explained the logic of its highly diverse portfolio of businesses in terms of their conformity to a set of characteristics. Its best-known criterion is that the business should have only a limited appetite for capital. Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's US arm, said Hanson had always been willing to invest in its businesses but 'nobody has focused on that side before'. Nevertheless, he accepted that Mr David Clarke, Hanson Industries' chief executive, had articulated the importance of managing core-businesses more clearly than anyone before him. Mr Clarke said he would continue to exploit the group's expertise in buying and selling assets. But the key to the group's success, he believes, was to manage businesses better than any other group. Forget the UK image of Hanson as a takeover glutton, chewing up and spitting out companies, he said. 'The bedrock of Hanson is to manage worldwide businesses into a class of their own.' In the US, Hanson has given core-business status to Cavenham, Peabody Coal, Beazer, the aggregates business, Grove Industries, the crane manufacturer, and SCM Chemicals. Such status is not a carte blanche for spending against all the Hanson traditions of tight financial control. But it does mean that the ground rules are not as simple as they were in the past, when Hanson was best known for buying and selling companies, not organic growth. Mr Harris of Cavenham said his instructions from the New Jersey head office of Hanson Industries was to grow both organically and by acquisition. 'Our requests for capital expenditure have not been turned down.' Grove, too, has been given approval for expansion. Mr John Panettiere, until recently Grove's chairman, had the idea of asking Fried. Krupp, the German steel and engineering group, whether it wanted to sell its loss-making business. In the end Hanson balked at the Pounds 250m price tag, but it came close to making its first substantial continental business. Mr Panettiere's successor, Mr Bob Stift, is continuing to look for another crane company. With Hanson holding a 53 per cent share of the US market and 70 per cent in the UK, Mr Stift says the quickest way to grow is by acquisition. He has even looked at the possibility of establishing a joint venture with a Japanese company. Another Hanson core business planning expansion is Peabody Coal. Mr Irl Engelhardt, president of Peabody, says: ''The idea that Hanson is only interested in cash generation is just not true'. Annual capital expenditure is expected to rise by 60 per cent this year, which is likely to put it significantly above Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m). Acquisitions continue apace. Martinka Coal, a subsidiary of Peabody has recently agreed to pay around Dollars 165m over 14 years, with an initial Dollars 62m payment, to acquire a coal mine and reserves from Southern Ohio Coal. Mr Engelhardt is eyeing mines across the world for further potential acquisition targets. SCM Chemicals is also making heavy capital expenditures as it switches from to sulphate technology to produce titanium dioxide to the more environmentally acceptable chloride technology. Since SCM Chemicals was acquired by Hanson in 1986 Mr Don Borst, president of the company, said the conglomerate had made capital expenditure of more than Dollars 450m of which 68 per cent of it over the last three years. 'Hanson scrutinises our requests for capital investment; but we have never yet had them turned down,' he said. That is because Mr Borst was able to persuade head office that there was an obvious 'pay back' over the next several years. When SCM Chemicals starts reporting increased profits the cash will begin to flow back to New Jersey. 'The important thing,' said Mr Borst, 'is that we received the capital expenditure when we needed it.' A number of consumer and recreational and leisure companies, such as Ertl toys and Tommy Armour golf equipment, are likely to be disposed of by way of flotation. 'In some cases we should not be spending time on smaller companies' said Mr Clarke. The picture in the UK-side of Hanson is less clear to observers. The only obvious stand alone core-business is Imperial Tobacco. The ARC aggregates business and London Brick form another core business under the label of building products. They are also looking at selling some of the smaller companies worth in total Pounds 200m. But that still leaves a large grey area of largish UK businesses, which are not being sold but which are neither core businesses. The market is still unsure whether Hanson Plc is transforming itself from a highly acquisitive conglomerate into a commited builder of core businesses on the lines of Hanson Industries. Until that problem is resolved the shares are likely to continue to trade at a 20 per cent discount to the average prospective price/earnings ratio in the UK.</p>

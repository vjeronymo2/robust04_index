			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Auditors' duties to regulators defined AUDITORS to investment businesses must examine any breaches of rules that might lead to de-authorisation of the businesses, new notes from the Auditing Practices Board said yesterday. The notes cover the reporting requirements of regulatory bodies for investment businesses, including the Securities and Investments Board. While auditors are not responsible for checking compliance with rules - such as the requirement to give 'best advice' to clients - they must take into consideration any claims or fines that might lead to withdrawal of authorisation to conduct business, they say. Auditors' main responsibility is to provide assurance to regulators on the financial information provided by businesses, the accounting records and control systems, and the stewardship of client assets. The notes lay out a standard form for reports to regulators that provides clear, unambiguous wording. The APB has deferred potentially controversial amendments to existing guidelines on 'ad hoc' or whistle-blowing reports to government regulatory bodies. Those allow auditors to report matters to the regulator without breaching client confidentiality. APB Practice Note 1. PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes. MK9 2JX. Pounds 6.50.</p>

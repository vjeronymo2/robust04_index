			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese bonds stay cool ahead of election As the countdown to Sunday's landmark election gets under way, the Japanese bond market is looking remarkably sanguine, with long-term yields in the lower half of this year's trading range. Last minute campaigning might be all about political reform, with most of the new reformist groups pledging themselves to programmes for economic recovery, but bond market participants have mostly focused on recent economic data. The data have pointed unequivocally to a delayed recovery, and bond yields have fallen steadily on renewed hopes of a cut in the official discount rate by the Bank of Japan. The yield on the No 145 benchmark 10-year bond yesterday closed at 4.255 per cent, down from a May peak closer to 4.8 per cent. Industrial production for May fell by 2.4 per cent compared with April. Meanwhile, the growth of housing starts decelerated to 0.3 per cent year-on-year, after averaging 5.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year. May's total employment fell by 0.2 per cent from the previous month, while consumer demand also slumped, with growth of chain store sales falling by 2.5 per cent year-on-year. Many private economists have revised their economic growth forecasts downward for the fiscal year. This has led to buying of long-term bonds. Institutional investors, which have been buyers of short-term bonds due to forecasts of a near-term economic recovery, are now investing in the No 145 bond. If - as widely predicted - the ruling Liberal Democratic Party does not regain its majority in Sunday's general election, a coalition government would result. The core party in any coalition would be likely to be conservative. However, whatever the combination, an immediate stimulus for Japan's economy through public spending looks unlikely. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond market analyst at Merrill Lynch, reckons that a coalition government would take its time in dealing with the sluggish economy. He predicts that the Bank of Japan will be forced to cut interest rates, pushing down the yield on the No 145 benchmark to 4 per cent during the third quarter. However, politicians in the new structure may try to arouse popular support through income tax cuts. Ms Tomoko Fujii, an economist at Salomon Brothers, says such fiscal favours will create higher fiscal deficits. Together with refinancing by corporations of equity-linked bonds issued in the 1980s, this could put pressure on bond yields in the medium term, she says. Ms Fujii expects the BoJ to remain reluctant to cut rates due to fears of reflation. This will make it difficult for the long bond yield to fall below 4.2 per cent, she says. In the long run, however, the impact of any political shake-up could be positive for the bond market. Electoral reform will correct the over-representation in the rural areas, shifting more power to the urban electorate. This could liberalise areas such as agriculture and distribution, leading to lower inflation.</p>

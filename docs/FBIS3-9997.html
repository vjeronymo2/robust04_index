			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edwige Balutansky] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 28 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The U.S.  Government, which is disgruntled with deposed Haitian President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, may let an oil tanker pass through the  blockade in the next few days, sources close to the coupist  military offices said today. "It would not be surprising. The  U.S. has clearly shown it does not intend to exert further  pressure on the military. It has never sought to corner them,"  the official told an international news agency.    The UN Security Council decided to apply an oil and arms  embargo against Haiti last October in order to force the  military officers who toppled Aristide with a coup d'etat in  1991 to return to the democratic system.    "Pressure exerted on the Dominican Republic reportedly  worsened the effects of the embargo; instead, they are seeking  that Aristide share power with the coupists and decree an  amnesty for the offenses perpetrated these last 28 months," the  source noted. The lack of controls on the Dominican border  allows entry into the country of sufficient oil so that traffic  is nearly normal.    After conducting a study of the northern part of the border  between both nations, the Justice and Peace Human Rights  Commission of the Catholic Church reported that more than 66,000  gallons of gasoline are brought daily into Haiti with the  complicity of Dominican soldiers. In Haiti, this "illegal"  traffic is totally controlled by the military, who obtain  revenues of 20,625 gourdes, some $7,392, for each truck  transporting hydrocarbons. The Justice and Peace Commission  regretted that these open violations are not sanctioned by the  United Nations.    Meanwhile, parliamentarians opposed to the return of  Aristide  to this Caribbean island denied Monday that they want to install  a new government. They termed this information on the issue as  "rumors." Senator Bernard Sansaricq, spokesman for this group,  declared last week that "all the institutions are ready to  support the Parliament's initiative to install a new junta, only  pending the persons who will form it. The Army cannot play that  card; it has not received the green light from the United  States," a source close to the military commented.    The group of anti-Aristide lawmakers, who staged "a coup  d'etat" against the Senate's Board of Directors, announced last  week the visit of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras to the  Parliament to take the opportunity to present the new  government. Despite having waited in vain for Cedras, who  according to sources close to the Parliament supported this  initiative in the beginning, Sansaricq would insist on Monday  that a new administration be named.    Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard today repatriated 141  Haitian  -- boat people [preceding two words in English] -- who tried to  reach Florida, United States, in boats. Officials of the local  Red Cross announced that 40 more Haitians will be repatriated  tomorrow.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: County Hall's final step into private sector County Hall, once home to the controversial Greater London Council, took its final step into the private sector yesterday, more than eight years after the government first tried to sell the site. Frogmore Estates is paying Pounds 17.5m for the three remaining buildings and land next to Waterloo Station, which it plans to turn into a mix of flats and offices. The deal completes the disposal of County Hall (above), following the sale of the main riverside building to Shirayama, a Japanese developer, in 1993. While details of this transaction were never disclosed, the government appears to have raised about Pounds 80m for the site as a whole, far less than originally hoped. County Hall Development Group - a consortium which included the London &amp; Metropolitan property group, merchant bank Lazards and the BBC Pension Fund  -agreed to pay about Pounds 170m in 1988. Planning delays and the downturn in the property market caused the plans to be abandoned and the company was put into receivership in 1990. The London School of Economics, the UK's leading social science university, bid Pounds 65m in 1992 and campaigned to get the government to accept its plans to relocate to the site. However, the government finally rejected the LSE's proposals in September 1992, after the financial viability of its bid was questioned. Shirayama is converting the riverside building into a 600-bedroom hotel and leisure complex. The hotel will be managed by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and is scheduled to open early in 1997. Frogmore plans to convert the two buildings adjoining the riverside building into about 300 apartments. Under previous plans these buildings would have been demolished. The company will seek the approval of Lambeth Council, since existing planning consents are for office and retail use. Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said the island building, built on a roundabout at the entrance to Waterloo Bridge, could be redeveloped as offices at a later date. Detailed plans had not been drawn up, he added. The original County Hall Development Group plans envisaged moving the roundabout in order to combine the island building with vacant land next to Waterloo Station. This would make room for a new office building of up to 500,000 sq ft.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                COUNTY HALL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 1986 - London Residuary Body appoints Richard Ellis to find buyer for County Hall site  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 1988 - County Hall Development Group bid of about Pounds 170m accepted by LRB  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 1989 - Lambeth Council turns down planning applications for hotel and office development  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept-Nov 1989 - Public inquiry  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1990 - Inquiry inspector rules against CHDG plans  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1990 - CHDG goes into receivership  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 1991 - Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, approves amended planning application  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 1992 - Pounds 20m bid by London School of Economics rejected by LRB in favour of Pounds 60m offer from Shirayama for main riverside building  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1992 - LSE makes Pounds 65m bid for whole site, rejected by LRB with government approval  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1993 - Shirayama completes purchase  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 1993 - Remaining buildings sold to Frogmore Estates for Pounds 17.5m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

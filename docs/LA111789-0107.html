			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL ROUND OF HEARINGS ON ETHICS REFORMS  BEGUN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council's ethics committee opened its final round of  hearings Thursday on a new package of ethics reforms that were triggered by the  controversy over Mayor Tom Bradley's financial affairs.  </P> <P> But it was clear that the committee has a long way to go in shaping, adopting  and implementing a new ethics code.  </P> <P> Committee members Michael Woo, Ruth Galanter and Gloria Molina were openly at  odds over proposals to ban outside employment and restrictions on city  officials returning to the private sector. Some proposals -- such as the  creation of a city ethics office -- would require a ballot measure to change  the city Charter. And other proposals, such as granting the city attorney  access to the grand jury to subpoena witnesses and take testimony under oath,  would require a new law by the state Legislature.  </P></p>

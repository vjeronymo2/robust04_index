			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Gloom on chemicals work prospects The chemicals industry in Cleveland has lost 5,300 jobs since 1981 and is expected to shed up to 2,000 more by the year 2006, says a report to be considered by county councillors tomorrow, Chris Tighe writes. This would cut employment in the county's chemicals sector to 11,200. Between 1981 and 1993, the chemicals industry's share of total employment in Cleveland dropped from 9 per cent to 7 per cent. Asset swaps, plant closures, demergers, selective acquisitions and more flexible working arrangements have all had an impact on Cleveland as chemical companies battle to keep a share of an increasingly competitive industry, often by focusing on core activities, says the report. The report, by the council's department of environment, development and transportation, says the county does have some 'core' industries which are performing well, but much of its employment is in the fluctuating bulk chemicals sector. It also points to lack of local control as a weakness in terms of job security.</p>

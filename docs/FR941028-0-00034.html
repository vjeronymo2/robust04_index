			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM does not believe that principles of due process mandate, as a necessary condition precedent to the denial of a permit to an owner or controller of a violator, that the agency provide a full, formal, de novo hearing on the merits of an ownership or control link, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited, and the status of the violation_followed by an exhaustive appeal on each of these matters to the court of last resort. Instead, the final rules adopted today provide due process commensurate with the limited interest of a permit applicant_the expectancy of permit issuance. OSM's position is consistent with the agency's earlier statements relating to the sufficiency of due process and the protection of property rights provided by the ownership and control rules and the AVS. See Preamble to Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Permit Approval; Ownership and Control; Final Rule, 53 FR 38868 at page 38885 (October 3, 1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in the cases of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pittston Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 92&hyph;1606 (4th Cir.) and No. 91&hyph;0006&hyph;A (W.D.

In the briefs submitted by the Department of the Interior in those cases, the Department analyzed relevant case law and carefully explained why the due process criticisms were not well taken. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking. To the extent relevant, OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, OSM disagrees with the commenters' view that due process requires that conditional permits be made available during the tendency of the appeal of an ownership or control link as a condition precedent to permit block. The final rules published today provide ample protection for an owner or controller by providing the opportunity for an owner or controller to challenge an ownership or control link. Further, the final rules provide for the Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to grant temporary relief from a permit block, where,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the challenger has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal. OHA is contemporaneously publishing final rules establishing procedures for the granting of temporary relief. Under OSM's final rules published today and the OHA rules, the likelihood of the erroneous deprivation of a permit due to an erroneous link is minimal. An appellant with a meritorious claim can get relief. Conditional permits for all appellants, without regard to the merits of their claims, are unnecessary and unwarranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the final rules published today provide a measure of protection commensurate with the very limited interest that a permit applicant has in his or her application for a permit. An applicant does not have a right to a permit to mine coal in the same way that he or she has title to real property or a leasehold interest in a mineral lease. A permit to mine coal is a privilege granted by the regulatory authority to those who have complied with the requirements of the Act and the applicable regulatory program, including the provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act and the provisions of 30 CFR part 773. Until an applicant has been found in compliance with the applicable provisions of the program; until the other provisions governing permit issuance have been satisfied; and until a permit has been issued, the applicant has, at most, an expectation which may or may not be reasonable, depending upon the circumstances, that he or she will qualify for permit issuance. Such an expectancy is highly speculative, continent, and limited. Investments based on an expectancy do not transform the expectancy into a presently vested property right. See generally  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Jacobsen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hannifin,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 627 F.2d 177, 179&hyph;80 (9th Cir. 1980). ``To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legislation claim of entitlement to it.'' See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board of Regents  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Roth,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast to this, the agency's interest in and responsibility for implementing Section 510(c) of the Act is substantial and must be balanced against the limited property interest of the permit applicant. OSM's ability to implement the provisions of Section 510(c) of the Act is critical to the agency's enforcement of the Act. Those provisions of the Act prevent violators from receiving new permits and, thus, from injuring the environment at new surface coal mining operations. Those provisions of the Act encourage abatement of violations and deter operators and their owners or controllers from committing violations. Potential applicants fear permit denial in the future. Therefore, such applicants are motivated to prevent or abate violations in the present. Thus, OSM has a substantial interest in the successful, credible implementation of Section 510(c) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

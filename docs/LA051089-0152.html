			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LANGSTON GOES 8 WITHOUT A HIT, THEN LOSES 3-2  </P> <P> The Blue Jays, held hitless for eight innings by Seattle's Mark Langston,  rallied for three runs in the ninth today and beat the Mariners 3-2, with  George Bell driving in the winning run with a bloop single off reliever Mike  Schooler.  </P> <P> Langston had shackled the Blue Jays through the first eight innings, allowing  only one baserunner, on shortstop Omar Vizquel's error in the seventh.  </P> <P> But in the ninth, Langston unraveled quickly.  </P> <P> Tom Lawless, pinch-hitting for Lloyd Moseby, led off the inning with a solid  single to center, ending Langston's chance to become the first Seattle pitcher  to hurl a no-hitter.  </P> <P> After Nelson Liriano sacrificed Lawless to second, Bob Brenly, batting for Rob  Ducey, doubled down the left field line, scoring Lawless and ending Langston's  shutout.  </P> <P> Junior Felix then tied the score 2-2 with an RBI single to center, driving in  pinch-runner Alexis Infante. Felix went to second on the throw to the plate,  and Langston was replaced by Schooler.  </P> <P> Schooler retired Kelly Gruber on a grounder to third and intentionally walked  Tony Fernandez to pitch to the slumping Bell.  </P></p>

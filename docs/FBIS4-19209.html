			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government on Thursday  [14 April] welcomed the reduction of the prime rate by the  Bundesbank. The decision of the Central Bank Council to reduce  the discount rate from 5.25 to 5 percent and the Lombard rate  from 6.75 to 6.5 percent supports the Federal Government in its  efforts for a further strengthening of the forces of growth, FRG  Finance Minister Theo Waigel stated.    Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt called on all people  involved in economic circles to further orient their decisions  toward the goal of stability. The inflation rate in both parts  of Germany, which has been constantly declining since the  beginning of 1993, as well as the Federal Government's  consistent adherence to its policy of consolidation and the  course of this years wage negotiations, so far have made the  current reduction of interest rates easier. The interest rate  reduction will support the forces of upswing in the economy.</p>

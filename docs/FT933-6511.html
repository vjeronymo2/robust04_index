			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / US airline chief calls for progress on route talks THE British and US governments were urged yesterday to advance their negotiations on the liberalisation of air routes to pave the way for broader multilateral talks in future involving other members of the European Community. Mr Stephen Wolf, the chairman of United Airlines, visiting London yesterday, indicated that the talks had been given fresh impetus by the publication last week of the report into the US aviation industry commissioned by President Bill Clinton. One of the report's recommendations was that foreign airlines should be able to raise their voting stakes in US companies to 49 per cent on condition that this was reciprocated to US companies. At present foreign airlines cannot exceed a voting stake of 25 per cent. Mr Wolf said that he welcomed the recommendations even though he thought that, in practise, they would be less beneficial to US operators because of EC restrictions on foreign-owned carriers running routes in the community. But the report had given scope for building blocks to a new US/UK agreement and broader negotiations in future. Mr Wolf said he could not understand why both governments had declared that they wanted greater liberalisation, yet so far had agreed nothing. 'It's like two drunks singing the same lyrics all the time, but they can't get on the same melody,' he said. The need for greater liberalisation has been given greater urgency by British Airways' stake-building in USAir. BA now has 24.5 per cent of the equity and 21.5 per cent of the voting rights in USAir.</p>

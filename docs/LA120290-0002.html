			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREATING FUN GAMES CAN BE SERIOUS WORK;  </P> <P> RETAIL: THOSE IN THE COMPETITIVE CONTEST OF SELLING ADULT PLAY THINGS ARE  RELYING ON BUDGET-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS SUCCESSFUL.  </P> <P> Creating a game that is fun to play is serious business for Brian Hersch.  </P> <P> "There is an underlying presumption that since game playing is frivolous, then  game making is frivolous," said Hersch, the creator of such adult board games  as "Outburst" and "Taboo."  </P> <P> "I don't think it's frivolous at all. I damn well better (take it seriously) or  I won't be successful. It's my business."  </P> <P> This no-nonsense approach has made Hersch one of the rare winners in the  competitive contest to create a hot-selling adult board game. Six years after  Trivial Pursuit mania swept the nation and unleashed a flood of adult board  games, the category is now stagnant, leaving board game makers hard at work to  come up with the next hit that will end up on thousands of holiday gift lists  year after year. Many industry players also see the current economic slump as a  way of boosting sales.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been anything hot and sexy for adults since Pictionary," said  Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, a New York-based trade magazine,  referring to the 5 1/2-year-old game based on charades.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure the category is going great guns," said Carlat. "The stuff with  board games is that there is only one really hot and sexy one that drives the  business."  </P> <P> Most entries in the adult board game category have not even come close to  reaching the 100,000 sales mark, which qualifies them as successes and help  ensure a spot on crowded store shelves. Even those who have created a hit game  have trouble matching their success with a new and different item.  </P> <P> "It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said game maker Robert Angel, who has not  come up with a successful new game since creating Pictionary, which has sold 20  million sets in various versions -- including Bible Pictionary. "We know we  have gotten lucky."  </P> <P> The adult board game category had long been a backwater of the toy industry,  and was dominated by strategy games such as Othello and Risk. But  question-and-answer games such as Trivial Pursuit -- which has sold more than  40 million sets in its different versions -- were less intimidating and  appealed to a broader group, with a minimum amount of strategy and a heavy  reliance on common knowledge and popular culture. Shipments of adult board  games totaled $158 million in 1989, according to the Toy Manufacturers of  America.  </P> <P> With strategic games, "you are into the game itself, into winning," said Chris  Hixson, a veteran game player who was browsing through the Glendale outlet of  the Game Keeper, which stocks more than 30 adult board games. "But with Trivial  Pursuit and Pictionary, you are into having fun with people and enjoying  yourself."  </P> <P> "The game becomes the vehicle for (social) interaction -- it's no longer the  focal point," said Phil Orbanes, a toy and game industry consultant and former  chief of research and development at Parker Bros. "These new games do not put  too much of an emphasis on the feat of winning. It's more on the experience" of  playing.  </P> <P> Trivial Pursuit "was a very important step forward for the board game," said  David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst at American Securities in New York.  But, "if we eliminate Trivial Pursuit from the discussion, you will discover  that there has not been an overwhelming increase" in adult board game sales.  </P> <P> The games also exploit the common experiences and knowledge of the nation's  baby boom generation, which grew up with a plethora of toys. "They were the  most coddled generation in history when it came to. . .play things," said  Orbanes.  </P> <P> Brian Hersch, the Century City-based real estate developer turned board game  maker, says that television game shows have also played a role in addicting  baby boomers such as himself to board games.  </P> <P> "Playing games was just part of life," said Hersch, who grew up playing Risk  and Clue and watching "To Tell The Truth" on television.  </P> <P> Hersch's biggest hit -- Outburst, a free-association word game that has sold 3  million copies -- weaves in all the traits that have made for successful board  games. In Outburst, competing players, for example, are given a minute to come  up with as many responses to such statements as "Commands You Give a Dog"  listed on playing cards.  </P> <P> "It takes in everybody's common knowledge," said Hersch. "This is not an  intellectual experience, playing a game. We know this isn't brain surgery."  </P> <P> In fact, games linked to technical or obscure subjects -- such as high finance  in Trump the Game -- turn most players off. These games "were too heavily  involved with what appeared to be high-level finance," said Orbanes. "That's  too intimidating to most people."  </P> <P> Rules are a crucial concern to board game designers since adult players of  today have little patience. "I have to have you understand the game in three  minutes," said Hersch. "I can kill the game if the rules are too complicated.  It's critically important to keep a steady pace, an enlivened pace. If you have  to keep going back to the rules, people say 'who needs this?' "  </P> <P> Game boards and score-keeping devices, which are not essential to playing many  of the games, help define the limits of the game and lend it a competitive  zeal. "You don't have to have a board to play," said Hersch. "But a lot of  people won't play unless its competitive."  </P> <P> With skimpy advertising budgets, board game makers rely heavily on word of  mouth to boost sales. "If you get the game to play well, then they you have the  start of word-of-mouth," said Bob Reiss, a New Jersey-based businessman who  created a trivia game based on TV Guide magazine and is now working on a  project with a love-and-marriage theme. "If it doesn't play well, they don't  come back. You get one chance."  </P> <P> Despite a weakening economy, adult board games might appeal to a growing number  of budget-conscious consumers, despite price tags of $30 and up. "Some people  will have to give up their vacation or going to the theater," said Reiss.  "People who are watching their money will want to play games" instead.  </P> <P> Many game players would agree. Davern Kroncke, a Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit  fan from Santa Rosa, Calif., says she invites friends to dinner at her house  and then plays games after her children go to bed.  </P> <P> "It's a time for us to get together, to laugh, unwind and have a lot of fun,"  said Kroncke, a 39-year-old dental hygienist. And "it's economical," she said.  </P></p>

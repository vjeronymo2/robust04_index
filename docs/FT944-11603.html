			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Dollars 1.6bn Chinese jet order McDonnell Douglas Aircraft yesterday signed a Dollars 1.6bn order for 40 medium-sized twin-engine jets from a Chinese delegation during a three-day trade conference in Washington on telecommunications and transportation. The order was welcomed by Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, as another bit of good news as the mid-term elections approach. The agreement had originally provided for all the jets to be made in China, but to meet the rapid growth in the Chinese aviation market, 20 of them will now be built in the US over the next four years, raising the value of the order. Engines will be produced by International Aero Engines in Connecticut. The delegation is expected to place a number of orders to counter the soaring US bilateral trade deficit. The Chinese are also pushing their case for China's admission into the World Trade Organisation as a founding member.</p>

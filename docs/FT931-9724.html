			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Road network sell-off proposed: Trunk route users could pay tolls - New agency would control system THE GOVERNMENT plans to hive off Britain's 6,600-mile national road network to an agency called Highways Command as a prelude to possible privatisation. Tolls could be introduced on trunk roads as well as motorways to offset the Pounds 2bn-a-year bill for road building and repairs. Confirmation of the plan came with the publication of the Transport Department's annual report yesterday, which lists Highways Command with some smaller departmental activities as a candidate for agency status. The new body would take responsibility for all Britain's trunk roads and motorways. Although these account for only 4 per cent of the country's total road length, with the rest owned by local authorities, they carry 32 per cent of all traffic and 56 per cent of goods traffic. At present all trunk roads and motorways are toll-free. However the government has said that a green paper to be published this spring will propose charges on these routes to help meet the cost of the road programme. The strong cashflow from tolls would for the first time raise the possibility of privatising the network, either through an outright sale or through a form of franchising. Officials stress that the plans are at an early stage and no timescale has been set. News of the proposals comes days after the approval by the German ruling coalition of plans to privatise its 7,000-mile autobahn network . The plans have provoked a furore among German motorists because they would be accompanied by the introduction of user fees which would be put towards the cost of restructuring the heavily-indebted railways. Although there are some privately-built toll roads in Europe, particularly in France, no country has yet moved towards the privatisation of all or part of its national road network. Britain has recently taken hesitant steps towards encouraging the private sector to design and build toll motorways, but so far these have made little progress. Only one project, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, has yet been agreed and still has to go through the planning process. Britain's road network will be the last significant part of the national transport infrastructure to remain in state hands when the planned privatisation of the railways is complete. Critics of British transport policy have frequently suggested that the Department of Transport is biased towards roads because this is the only form of transport for which it retains executive responsibility. With roads hived off to a separate executive agency, the Transport Department's only remaining responsibility would be for the strategic planning of the national road network. There are already more than 80 executive agencies providing government services such as the payment of benefits and vehicle licensing. Each is headed by a chief executive who is given considerable freedom to manage the agency within a framework of objectives set by the sponsoring department.</p>

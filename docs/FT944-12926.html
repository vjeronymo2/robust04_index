			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Sport: Sparring begins in San Diego - The intrigue surrounding the Americas Cup regatta / Sailing There are lots of comparisons going on in San Diego right now. Men versus women. Wide against narrow. The occasion is the International America's Cup Class world championship. Most of the teams that will compete in the Cup itself, beginning in January, have a boat entered in this 'check-out' regatta, so-called because of the opportunity to check out the opposition prior to the main event. Intense interest is focused on the all-women crew sailing the America3 yacht Kanza. It is the first time at this level of sailing that women have raced against men in a world-class event. Initial fears that a deficit in body strength would handicap 'the Cubettes' seem to have been wrong. 'These boats aren't terribly physical. It's about talent and mind-games,' said Dawn Riley, one of the afterguard and the only woman aboard Kanza with previous Cup experience. Olympic gold medals and world championships abound among the other 15 crew. America3, funded and sailed by energy billionaire and amateur yachtsman Bill Koch, walked away with the Cup in 1992. Koch admitted to having spent Dollars 70m on the programme, much of it on high-technology R &amp; D rather than training and technique. His designers produced yachts that were long, narrow and heavy when compared to the opposition. They were also much faster. Two of the new generation of IACC boats built since then will be racing this week; oneAustralia and the Japanese entry JPN-30. It will be fascinating to see the extent to which they have followed the hull design trend started by Koch's technical gurus but far from universally believed in by the opposition. Koch's presence is largely a consequence of a dispute with IRS officials. His 1992 campaign was via a not-for-profit foundation which gives considerable tax benefits to the donor, in this case Koch. The IRS told Koch that his tax-breaks depended on continued involvement in the Cup. Putting women on the boat began as a snook-cocking exercise aimed at the taxman but has unintentionally proved an inspired move in terms of sponsorship and media coverage. Papers such as USA Today, hardly known for its yachting, have been giving a great deal of coverage, consumer companies which make products for women have been keen to provide support, and the television networks cannot get enough onboard footage of the Cubettes. Among the more traditional participants, none has attracted more attention than the Australian challenger John Bertrand, head of oneAustralia. Bertrand, skippering the wing-keeled Australia II, took the Cup away from America in 1983. It was the first victory by a challenger in 132 years, the longest home-run in international sport. Since then Bertrand has done little sailing, concentrating instead on a business career. It may be that his business contacts helped him to put together a complete Dollars 30m sponsorship package, largely supported by Phillip Morris, while other challengers struggled in the customary financial mire. Bertrand has his first new boat racing this week, with a second being built. That is proving his undoing. OneAustralia has a design co-operation programme with the rival Australian campaign funded by Sydney property entrepreneur Syd Fischer. All four boats will be drawn by the same 'think-tank' in which each group has shares and board members. Every other Cup team is up in arms. They believe that this arrangement drives a winged-keel through a cost-control agreement ratified after the 1992 Cup. This limited competitors to two new hulls. Although a 75ft carbon-fibre canoe body need cost only Dollars 1m or so, the research underlying each new hull may cost 10 times that. So, if Fischer and Bertrand are working as a single team, they might greatly increase the effectiveness of their research and build three prototypes where everyone else can build just one. It looks certain to become a matter for the international jury convened to administer the Cup. The US courts have already become involved. If Bertrand's new boat proves fast this week, the already sharpened knives will be out and flashing. On the defender side, the dominant figure of Dennis Conner will be on the water doing what he does best: learning everything and giving away nothing. His Stars &amp; Stripes 91 is the oldest boat in the class and is scarcely competitive. Yet with a new yacht due for delivery in mid-November, and talent such as Paul Cayard to augment Conner's 20 years of Cup experience, one should never underestimate him. No one will be able to miss the Russian chartered entry from the St Petersburg Yacht Club. For reasons not yet clear the old Il Moro I has been repainted with a black hull and yellow decks and mast by her new crew and renamed Vek Rossii. Since the New Zealand challenge is choosing to miss the regatta for tactical reasons, at least there is no risk of the Ivans being mistaken for the All-Blacks.</p>

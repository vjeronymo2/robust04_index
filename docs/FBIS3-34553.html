[rupees]  6,297.69 crore in the first nine months of the current financial  year, April-December 1993, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee  said, while inaugurating the regional conference of UK chartered  accountants here today.    He further said that the foreign exchange reserves had  improved appreciably to U.S. $9.9 billion as on January 1, 1994  from the level of U.S. $1 billion obtaining in June 1991.  However, he said, there was no room for complacency and India  had to take all the initiative required to promote productivity,  modernisation and competitiveness of Indian industries. The  process of liberalisation was irreversible and needed to be  pushed forward, he added.    The Minister urged the Indian businessmen to upgrade the  technology in manufacturing processes to achieve their  competitive edge in the international market as this will help  in pushing the exports at the targetted level. He said that  increasing the competitiveness of our exports was the only  viable alternative for long-term balance of payment problem.  The Government on its part has already taken certain measures,  for upgrading the technology of the economy to boost the  exports, he added.    The increase in exports by 20 per cent during April-Dec.  1993  over the corresponding period of the previous year and decline  in imports by 1.3 per cent during the same period is result of  the measures taken by the Government to step up exports. As a  consequence the balance of trade has come down to U.S. $732  million during April-December 1993, compared to U.S. $3,555  million during the corresponding period of the previous year,  Mr. Mukherjee said.    The Minister said that the estimated balance of trade during  current financial year 1993-94 may be less than U.S. $1 billion  as compared to pound sterling 3.3 billion for the year 1992-93.  The increase in exports and foreign direct investment (FDI)  were cited as the main reasons for improvement in the balance of  payment position by him.    Speaking about the next phase of the reform process, the  Commerce Minister called for an integrated strategy to further  exports.    In particular, he stressed upon reform in the commercial  banking sector with regard to cost and quality of credit,  bridging of information gap and adjusting policies to suit  environmental concerns.</p>

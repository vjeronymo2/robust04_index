			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: German orders likely, says Qichen CHINA is likely to place large orders with east German firms, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Speaking to journalists at the end of a three-day visit to Germany, he said China was pleased that Bonn had barred the sale of warships to Taiwan earlier this year. It might buy items such as river barges and railway carriages from east Germany, Qichen added, but he did not specify the likely size of any orders. The Bonn government has said German firms are negotiating 300 projects in China, with a total value running into billions of dollars. Qichen described his visit, during which he met Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leaders, as a success and said relations between the two countries had entered a new phase. Germany, eyeing the vast markets of China, has been pushing to normalise relations since Bonn lifted sanctions imposed in protest at Beijing's killing of pro-democracy student demonstrators in June 1989. In January it barred the sale of 10 submarines and 10 frigates worth DM12bn (Dollars 7.4bn) to Taiwan for fear of angering China, which disputes Taiwan's sovereignty. German government sources said they could not exclude the possibility that Kohl might accept a long-standing invitation to visit China but no date had been fixed. The German branch of the human rights group Amnesty International said the human rights situation in China remained serious, with torture common in prisons and the number of executions rising alarmingly. Shanghai Airlines, China's first independent airline, yesterday ordered five Boeing 767-300 widebody jets worth Dollars 450m, adds Paul Betts. The deal follows the order last month by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) for 20 Boeing 737 and one 757 aircraft for a total of Dollars 800m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to accept these two petitions for temporary exemptions from the labeling requirements until the dates specified by the petitioners. No company may exceed its deadline without first obtaining approval by the EPA. If the need for an additional extension is required by either company, an addendum to the petition must be submitted to the Agency requesting an extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Upjohn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that in this case, the alternative identified in the petition is neither potentially nor currently available, due to additional Federal requirements regarding approval or disapproval of the substitute, which preclude the company from implementing the change until after a determination under such requirements is made. The circumstances are outside of the company's control. Absent the FDA requirements, Upjohn would be able to introduce the alternative substance to its sterilizing operation. This proposed determination is consistent with regulations implementing section 610 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 which state that companies seeking Federal approval of substitute chemicals or reformulations may receive a temporary exemption (ninety days) from the product ban requirements (58 FR 69667). In those regulations, EPA recognized that other Federal approval processes can be time-consuming and beyond the control of the manufacturer. Until approval is obtained, a substitute is not potentially available. EPA maintains that it would be inappropriate for the federal government to deny a manufacturer a temporary exemption from the labeling regulations while at the same time preventing them from implementing a substitute pending receipt of a required Federal approval for their alternative substance or process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. DuPont  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that DuPont's request for a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements is appropriate given the task and the uncertainties it has encountered and continues to face in developing a substitute and implementing a major process change to replace an existing system that currently depends on the use of a CFC. DuPont contends that its alternative process is not potentially available until the company is certain that the alternative process works in its facilities. In order for the company to ensure that large scale production is possible, it must first construct new facilities, test the functioning of the new systems and perform full scale production tests. Until production tests are completed in these facilities, due to significant differences in technical design, no substitutes are potentially available. DuPont indicates that current problems it is experiencing with the pilot facility are due to unanticipated and unknown factors, requiring delays in testing of the new design until the problems are resolved and the necessary modifications are made to the system. However, as the new system is undergoing the required tests, DuPont is constructing its new facilities. The designs of the facilities are based solely on the results of the trials at the pilot facility, rather than on existing designs, thereby creating unknown obstacles which can significantly impede the company's switch to an alternative process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that a substitute process is not potentially available for the fiber product, which currently depends on a process that uses a CFC, until the company can be reasonably assured that its new systems actually work with the candidate substitute and can produce a product that meets the company's and its customers' quality standards in a large scale production process. While EPA believes that this waiver should be granted until January 1, 1996, EPA would like any information on whether extending the waiver to this January 1, 1996 is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Changes to the Conditions of the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to establish provisions to ensure that petitioners meet the conditions agreed upon in a petition exemption. Companies that receive a temporary exemption from the labeling requirements must notify EPA if the agreed-upon conditions of the exemption change in any way, such as a modification in a Federal entity's schedule for evaluation, slippage in a company's implementation of an alternative substance or process, or a shift in corporate priorities. Failure to notify the Agency of such changes to the agreement will result in the Agency's withdrawal of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Authority for the action proposed in this notice is section 611(e) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7625&hyph;1(a)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

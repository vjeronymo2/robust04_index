			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / EC non-committal on coal aid MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, received a non-committal response yesterday from the European Commission to his outline proposals for supporting the UK coal industry. Mr Heseltine met Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition commissioner, and Mr Abel Matutes, who has taken over responsibility for energy and transport, for general discussions about EC and UK policy. As expected, neither commissioner was able to comment in detail on the UK suggestions, which have not yet been adopted by the British cabinet. Mr Heseltine wants to ease the pressure on the British industry, and has considered the imposition of a system of levies on consumers' electricity bills. That would amount to an indirect subsidy that would allow generators to buy British coal. An official for Mr Matutes said that the commissioner would study Mr Heseltine's plans, but it was too early to say what reaction the commission might have. British diplomats said Mr Heseltine had not come to Brussels expecting a firm response from the new commissioners.</p>

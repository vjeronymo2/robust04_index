			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Ruling coalition parties  failed Wednesday [13 April] to come closer to naming a successor  to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Quarrels over how  to choose a replacement for Hosokawa, who suddenly offered to  resign on Friday, resumed one day after executives of the ruling  parties agreed to avert a split in the coalition and form a new  government under the current framework.    With the decision Tuesday to maintain unity, Foreign  Minister  and concurrently Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's chances of  being named the next premier was almost certain.    Wrangling between the groups resumed Wednesday morning,  however, when Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head  of the new party Sakigake (Harbinger), aired his grievances over  the selection process. Takemura told reporters that leaders of  the coalition parties must first exchange views on the shape of  a new coalition government before finding a successor to  Hosokawa.    This was in contrast with an agreement among the secretary  general-level coalition representatives that their caucus, not a  forum of coalition chiefs, would have the authority to take  charge of selecting the next premier.    Sakigake decided later to boycott a meeting of ruling party  executives until a forum of coalition chiefs was given the  authority to select Hosokawa's replacement. The move could  result in a split in the eight-month-old coalition.    The party insists that coalition heads should meet first to  discuss the mandate of the coalition representatives' caucus --  the highest decision-making body under the Hosokawa  administration -- and the selection of a new premier candidate.    It also points to the need for the coalition partners to  synchronize their basic policies, decide on the framework of a  new coalition government and select a candidate for the  premiership.    "It runs counter to the founding principles of our party to  approve a decision on a new premier through backroom talks," a  senior Sakigake official said. "We cannot help but become an  opposition party."    In the absence of a Sakigake figure, the executives of the  other ruling parties agreed in their Wednesday evening meeting  to continue discussing the matter on Thursday morning, coalition  officials said.    Social Democratic Socialist Party (SDP) Secretary General  Wataru Kubo told a news conference that SDP Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama will ask his coalition counterparts to meet all  together so as not to isolate Sakigake and cause the ruling  union to collapse.    "The SDP chairman says he wishes to do his best to realize a  meeting of coalition chiefs, which will allow Sakigake to come  back and hammer out an accord on how to solve this difficult  problem," Kubo said.    Kubo, the No. 2 man in the largest coalition contingent,  added he will report to Thursday's gathering of coalition  representatives on the outcome of Murayama's efforts to bring  together all the heads of the ruling parties.    Murayama had twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition  chiefs -- once Monday and again Tuesday -- to break a stalemate  over the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa and avert a  collapse of the coalition.    Sakigake, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP  favored the selection of a new premier at a forum of the  coalition party leaders. But leaders of four coalition partners  -- Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Komeito, Hosokawa's Japan  New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party --  rejected the bid and boycotted the two sessions.    The row over the procedures to pick a candidate to replace  Hosokawa stems from the deep gulf between the  moderate-to-leftist Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more  conservative Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies  and some key national policies.    Bickering between Sakigake's Takemura and Shinseito's Ichiro  Ozawa, the main coalition strategist, over political management  is also regarded as a source of trouble within the coalition.    Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday reaffirmed his  desire to run for the highest government office, even by  defecting from the primary opposition party with fellow LDP  members.    Some LDP sources said late Tuesday night Watanabe gave up  the  idea of defecting from the once-dominant party due to the  unlikelihood of his garnering a sufficient number of supporters  from among LDP members to succeed.    The Shinseito-Komeito camp has also explored the possibility  of fielding Watanabe, a close friend of Ozawa, as a candidate to  succeed Hosokawa, should he bolt from the LDP along with a large  number of his followers and join the coalition.</p>

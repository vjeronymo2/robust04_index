			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Observer: Adios Granada The house of Warburg is not accustomed to being sacked. As the UK's most successful investment bank, it can afford to be fastidious about the clients it deigns to serve. What an affront, therefore, when one of Warburg's less successful customers dares to intimate that it might obtain better financial advice elsewhere. Nevertheless, the defector, Gerry Robinson, new chief executive of television and leisure group Granada, is clearly not in awe of Warburg's reputation, even though partly indebted to the bank for his job. For Warburg's part, having been dumped as Granada's financial adviser in favour of Lazard Brothers, it has haughtily resigned from its separate role as Granda's joint broker. So why does the group want a new adviser? The official explanation is that Robinson worked closely with Lazard when he headed Compass, a fast-growing service company. But Granada was never happy about the high-handed way the City demanded the sacrifice of the group's chief executive in return for agreeing to a vital rights issue. At the time, some Granada employees felt that Warburg had crossed the fuzzy boundary between giving advice and interfering in the company's affairs. But the money came rolling in, and as one Warburg wag said: 'It's the first time anyone has been sacked for saving a company'. Perhaps this sort of arrogance helps explain the decision.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, June 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian  Province is expanding its fourth airport, Jinjiang Airport,  which is located in Quanzhou Prefecture, and it is expected to  go into trial service next may.    Built in 1954, the airport used to serve the military forces  only. It was given approval by the central government to become  a civil airport in July last year.    A local official in charge of the project said the expansion  will require a total investment of 180 million yuan (some 2.1  million U.S. dollars).    Upon completion, the modern airport with an annual handling  capacity of 650,000 passengers will be able to accommodate large  and medium-sized planes, and link Quanzhou with Hong Kong,  Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai by air.</p>

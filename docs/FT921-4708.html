			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Heaven and Hell: Passion, argument and perpetual change - Marx and the true meaning of a socialist idyll MARXISM'S most alluring innovation has become its most glaring weakness. It offered to deliver Heaven on earth; to create a world of harmony from a world of conflict and imperfections; to realise in real, material life the aspirations that previously were invested in some offshore spiritual world. All of society, not just well-behaved individuals, could make it into the socialist Heaven. The drawback became obvious. The main attraction of this Heaven was that it could be made on this earth. That meant progress towards it could be measured much more accurately than an individual's inner, moral progress towards the spiritual Heaven offered by religion. This religious Heaven is always around the next corner. The socialist Heaven is meant to arrive in the measurable here and now. The masses of eastern Europe have seen the evidence and they have given up waiting. Yet, the drawback to the traditional socialist vision of Heaven is not just that it takes an awfully long time and great human sacrifice to create. The idea is flawed fatally. Central to the socialist Heaven is the abolition of choice. There will be abundance because socialism will have unleashed the creative and productive potential which was kept locked-up by the inequities of capitalism. Abundance will allow people to have what they want, without foregoing anything else. They will not have to choose between mutually exclusive alternatives. As a result there is no conflict. Abundance allows all preferences to be reconciled. Altruism becomes possible because people no longer feel threatened by the fear that, unless they hold on to what they have got, someone will take it away from them. There is no need for a state to impose laws because the citizens of socialist Heaven have no incentive to break any law, or infringe anyone else's rights. Everyone gets along with everyone else. People become transformed. Where once they were cynical, grasping, selfish, vain, cruel and ignorant, they will become noble, kind, gentle, altruistic, considerate and educated. They live in a pastoral world, rather like a Lake District valley, where all the material riches of industrialisation co-exist miraculously with the clean air and sparkling streams of a land in which men and women can roam free to commune with their creative spirits. The flaws in this vision are only partly that socialist economic planning has delivered shortages and pollution rather than environmentally friendly abundance. The first problem is the idea of abundance itself. This socialist idyll is just one version of a productivist visions of Heaven thrown-up by industrialisation - visions of a society of untrammelled wealth created by unleashing the huge productive power of modern technology to exploit natural resources and manufacture them into usable products. This ideal of unending abundance meeting ever expanding human appetites is no longer tenable. A modern version of Heaven will have to be informed environmentally. It will be based upon people living in balance with nature by restraining their appetites, in deference to the demands of the environment. The old socialist vision of Heaven was based upon man conquering nature. New progressive visions will have to be based upon a more responsible and accommodating approach to man's place within nature. That does not mean a modern Heaven would revert to medieval craft production. The old socialist vision was of a Heaven full of manufactured products, physical, tangible, material things made of steel and glass. New progressive visions will be influenced by the growth of micro-electronics, which is re-drawing the line between the material and the non-material world more effectively than either religion or Marxism. Soon, we will be able to pass from the ordinary, hum-drum world and step into a non-physical world of flickering electronic images. Already, many children spend much of their days glued to computer games and videos while their parents sit at computer screens in their offices. Future machines will transport us into worlds - Wild West towns, forests, swimming under the sea  -which appear to be real but actually are generated electronically. For the generation of children which is just starting school, Heaven might be a room full of Nintendo games, walls of screens, banks of computer terminals and karaoke machines. Forget the pastoral idyll of the Lake District: give them neon lights, a cacophony of sound and a stream of loosely-connected images. The socialist view of Heavenly society is flawed more fundamentally. It would not merely be technically and morally difficult to create a society of abundance and altruism. There is a deeper problem: it would not be a society at all. The old vision of Heaven is a society at rest. After a long march, the collective reaches a point where conflict and argument fade away. It finally can settle down. It has found truth and moral certitude. This harmonious, Heavenly society has overcome all the tensions that bedevil everyday earthly societies. The trouble is that these tensions are not an unwelcome by-product of society - they are at its very heart. They are produced by the diversity of values and differences of view among individuals which give society its energy. Diversity and difference, tension and argument are the lifeblood of society, not an unwanted social pollutant. The best societies are dynamic because they are rich in diversity and innovation. They are open and pluralistic and they encourage experimentation and imagination. For too long, we have laboured with an ideal that the zenith of human activity is to be in a state of complete rest. This appeals deeply but is quite wrong. For me, Heaven is a society which is as active and fluid as possible. Heaven is a world of great passion, multi-lingual argument, expanding knowledge, momentous discoveries, perpetual change and unending motion. The drawback is that it would be utterly exhausting.</p>

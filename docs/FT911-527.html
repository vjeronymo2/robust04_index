			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage selling hits Nikkei in thin trading ARBITRAGE-related selling depressed the Nikkei average, which finished lower yesterday in spite of the overnight jump on Wall Street and falling bond yields, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed down 163.21 at 26,274.29 - a 0.8 per cent fall on the week  -after rising 128.71 on Thursday. It hit a day's high of 26,449.06 in the morning, but drifted down to a low of 26,212.64 on light index selling by investment trusts. Volume remained low at 340m shares, up from 330m. Advances marginally outpaced declines by 474 to 468, with 179 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section issues rose 1.30 to 1,991.15 and, in London trading, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index declined by 2.01 to 1,497.32. Investors continued to trade in small and medium-capital stocks. The small-capital stock index on the first section rose 0.53 per cent while the second section index gained 0.45 per cent on strong volume of 25m shares. The over-the-counter index fell 54.55 to 3,227.98 on profit-taking.

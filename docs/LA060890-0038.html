			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR LOSES BID TO SPEED ACTION ON WATER  PROGRAM  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley sought unsuccessfully Thursday to hasten City  Council consideration of a mandatory water rationing program designed to cut  consumption by at least 10% from 1986 levels.  </P> <P> Bradley was angered by a proposal by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to delay  the council's hearing on his plan until June 27.  </P> <P> It had been scheduled for June 15, but Flores persuaded Council President John  Ferraro to postpone the hearing because only 10 lawmakers were scheduled to be  present. All 15 are expected on June 27.  </P> <P> "This important action deserves the attention of the entire council," said  Flores, chairwoman of the Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  </P> <P> But Bradley, who has been calling for speedy action on his plan all along,  urged the council to schedule an earlier hearing.  </P> <P> "Summer is already on us and will soon be gone. That's the point at which we  need the best efforts if we are going to make any achievement this year,"  Bradley said.  </P></p>

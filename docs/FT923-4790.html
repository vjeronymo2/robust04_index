			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur delays issue Inntrepreneur Estates, the joint venture company set up by Grand Metropolitan and Courage in 1990, has decided to delay its Pounds 250m debenture issue until the UK economy shows signs of recovering. The issue was expected to be launched this summer, writes Sara Webb. The debenture will be used to extend debt maturity profile, bankers said. It has about Pounds 1.2bn outstanding in five-year banking facilities which it wants to refinance. The company raised about Pounds 1.5bn from a syndicate of banks in 1991 for the acquisition of pubs. The main Pounds 1.33bn credit was syndicated among 20 banks, arranged by Citicorp, SG Warburg, Barclays and NatWest.</p>

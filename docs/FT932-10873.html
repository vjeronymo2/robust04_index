			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Escape from ERM squeeze - The top few fund management companies are strengthening their grip on the Pounds 370bn occupational pension fund sector. They are satisfying the demands of trustees by delivering high performance and consistency NEVER IN the history of pension fund investment has so much been invested on behalf of so many by so few. By the end of last year the top six external investment management companies controlled UK pension fund portfolios worth Pounds 110bn. If you add in the top few in-house managers, led by PosTel with Pounds 20bn, it is likely that only about 10 or a dozen managers control half the Pounds 370bn total value of UK pension funds. Yet, at one level, the gravitation of assets towards the most successful managers is no more than a normal process in a competitive market place. Last year this was underlined by the way that many managers beat index returns, both in terms of the UK and global stock markets. More than two-thirds of all the funds measured by WM outperformed the All-Share return in 1992, half of them by a full percentage point. International outperformance was even more clearcut, with the average overseas equity portfolio returning 19.7 per cent compared with just 16.4 per cent on the World ex UK Index. However, this may have represented an unusual combination of favourable factors. In 1992, for instance, most UK managers were helped by their low weightings of plunging pharmaceutical stocks, and they were also light in Japan, the worst major international market. But, as fewer and fewer managers come to dominate, their big bets can have a disproportionate impact, sometimes for good but with worrying longer-term implications. Excessive concentration could increase the risks of investment and create distortions. The focus of the problem changes from time to time, however. A few years ago institutional investors were being roundly attacked for too readily supporting aggressive takeovers, and for helping to generate undue short-termism. But at present there are scarcely any contested takeover bids so the criticism has shifted, concentrating, for instance, on the pressures exerted on British companies for excessive dividend payments. Last year's investment returns were much more fragile than they looked, depending as they did on a final quarter which delivered, on average, some 14 percentage points of the 20.3 per cent annual return (excluding property). For much of last summer pension fund managers had a nail-biting time as their traditional strategy of investing primarily in inflation-proof assets, notably equities, threatened to clash violently with the UK's anti-inflationary commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism. September 17, Black or White Wednesday, depending on your point of view, played into the hands of most pension fund managers by substantially enhancing the value of the UK equities which typically make up almost 60 per cent of the average portfolio. The sterling value of overseas equities and bonds was also greatly increased. So, it all worked out well in the end, but, nevertheless, the fundamentals of UK equity market valuation are stretched. Company profits were flat, and although they may well bounce back in most cases in 1993, dividend cover will remain historically poor. Dividends are especially important to pension funds, and not just because they can claim back the tax on them. In the UK, actuaries value the assets of pension schemes primarily on the basis of the income they generate, rather than market values. Pension fund managers therefore take a dim view when companies cut dividends - the impact on scheme surpluses could be serious. There have been many cases of companies raising new capital through rights issues primarily to finance the flow of dividends. A large part of the forthcoming Pounds 1.2bn rights issue by ICI/Zeneca, for example, will go straight out again in dividends not covered by short-term profits. Government statistics show dividends from the company sector as a whole continuing to rise quite strongly throughout the recession, from Pounds 19bn in 1989 to Pounds 25bn in 1992. However, new privatisations may have had something to do with this, and the growth in dividends paid out by constituent companies of the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index finally ground to a halt in 1992. While pension funds continue eagerly to lap up company dividends, they equally continue to shun conventional British government securities. According to WM, pension fund holdings of fixed interest gilts continued to fall last year, and at 4 per cent of portfolios on average are no bigger than the investments in foreign currency bonds. Another 3 per cent slice of portfolios is in index-linked gilts. Do the pension funds risk retaliation if they continue to be unresponsive to the government's financial difficulties? After all, the government has a Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 financial year and is now running monthly Pounds 3bn gilt-edged auctions. That is one explanation of the unexpected company tax changes in the March Budget. By cutting the rate of tax on dividends which could be reclaimed by pension funds and other exempt investors from 25 to 20 per cent the treasury effectively imposed on pension funds a dividend tax worth perhaps Pounds 450m a year. More subtly, the relative appeal of gilt-edged interest, and other non-dividend income, has been enhanced. The gross UK dividend income received by pension funds has effectively been reduced by 6 1/4 per cent. Little explanation of this has been offered by the government, which has justified the ACT changes primarily in terms of the transitional cash flow benefit to companies rather than the permanent diminution of income of exempt shareholders. But it is certainly possible to argue, theoretically, that a primary original 1970s objective of the UK imputation system of corporation tax  - to remove the previous tax bias against dividends as opposed to retentions - has been overwhelmed in recent years by the rapid growth of tax-exempt investors, notably pension funds. Indeed, a bias has developed towards overdistribution. One other cloud on the horizon is being anxiously watched. It is the possibility that the present overwhelming predominance of final salary-based pension schemes in the UK might be disturbed by a swing towards money-purchase schemes which sidestep the controversy over surpluses. There is no evidence that such a shift is happening yet, except among quite small companies, but there is nervousness about what recommendations the Goode Committee on pension law reform will make next September. Possibly, new burdens and costs might be imposed upon companies operating final salary schemes. There is in any case concern about the response of companies when widespread pension contribution holidays come to an end and the full cost of final salary-linked schemes must once again be borne. Do we have Rolls-Royce pension schemes in the Ford Mondeo era? With unemployment high it is no longer necessary for companies to offer generous pension schemes to attract and retain employees. There is little sign that companies will actually dismantle existing arrangements. But a recent survey by the Alexander Consulting Group suggested that if companies were starting again with a clean sheet only 29 per cent would launch a final salary scheme (although 78 per cent have one now). A widespread switch to money-purchase schemes would pose big challenges to fund managers. Instead of having a single very long-term client in each scheme they would have thousands of individual, shorter-term investors. They would need to invest in lower risk assets, to address the needs of scheme members approaching retirement. Moreover, the greater participation of individual scheme members and, probably, trade unions, would require investment managers to act much more like retail institutions, offering simple, but flexible, products and seeking to build customer-friendly images. It would be a major change of approach for institutions, such as Mercury Asset Management and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, which are highly successful at dealing with professional pension consultants and trustees but scarcely have high profiles as far as the public at large is concerned. If a shift towards money purchase were ever to become pronounced, it would be likely to reverse the gravitation of money towards the top managers and to lead to the kind of institutional proliferation more typical of the retail investment market. But for the time being the harsh process of natural selection continues in the highly competitive world of pension fund management, and success still belongs to the few.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana is hosting Austrian President Thomas  Klestil who has arrived for a two-day official visit at the  invitation of Slovene President Milan Kucan. Branko Maksimovic  reports about the first round of talks with the top officials of  our state:    [Begin recording] [Maksimovic] The great interest shown in  Slovenia for the Austrian referendum on EU membership shows that  this is also important for Slovenia, which will, in the case of  a positive outcome, draw closer to Europe, too. This was the  idea that Dr. Klestil emphasized at the first meeting with the  reporters after one hour talks with President Kucan and after  the meeting of both delegations, which also comprised Carinthian  Governor Christoph Zernatto and Styrian Governor Josef Krainer,  and Defense Ministers Fasslabend and Kacin. In his statement,  President Milan Kucan rounded up the contents of the talks so  far as follows:    [Kucan] The visit of President Dr. Klestil is the first  official visit of an Austrian president to the independent  Slovenia, a confirmation and a reflection of good relations with  a long tradition, and affirmation of the trust that was formed  during the process of Slovenia gaining its independence --  during the war for our independence and efforts for our  international recognition. I view this visit as a part of  intensified cooperation between the countries and the presidents  of Central Europe, which is helping to strengthen the awareness  about spiritual, cultural, and the civilization belonging to  this region that is gaining importance in the new Europe because  it is bringing its values to it. This visit also allows, in  accordance with the tradition of good relations and the achieved  mutual trust, the solution of some issues that have been  accompanying our relations for many years. At this moment, this  does not merely involve the questions connected with the  expatriates' bureau [zdomska centrala] and the issue of economic  cooperation and the deficit that Slovenia currently has in these  relations, but also several concrete proposals of which  President Klestil will speak with Prime Minister Drnovsek. I  would like to emphasize here that we could not have avoided the  problem of rights and the protection of the Slovene minority in  Austria in these talks. In connection with this, we also  discussed the fate of the Austrian State Treaty.    [Maksimovic] Let me add that, at the above-mentioned meeting  with Slovene Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek, the Austrian guest  handed him a comprehensive memorandum containing concrete plans  for economic cooperation. A charter on Austrian assistance in  the education of the refugee children in Slovenia was signed at  noon in the presence of both presidents. From the remaining  program of today's visit, let me single out that President  Klestil will, in approximately an hour, speak in the Slovene  Parliament and at 1800 open the House of the Carinthian Slovenes  together with President Kucan.

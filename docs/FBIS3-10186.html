			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emanuel Neri] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho is  willing to dispute the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] presidential nomination with Orestes Quercia at the PMDB  convention. He demands, however, that some conditions be met.  Fleury wants those coordinating his candidacy to create a  movement around him to enable him to face Quercia on an equal  footing. He wants to avoid engaging in an electoral adventure  and being used as an anti-Quercia instrument.    Last week in Brasilia, Fleury became convinced that he could  seek the presidential nomination. In less than 24 hours --  between the evenings of 24 and 25 February -- he received the  support of ranking members of his party. Yet Fleury refused to  leave Brasilia as a candidate. Addressing a group of PMDB  deputies who were prepared to launch his candidacy, Fleury said:  "Hold it! Not yet."    A meeting with PMDB deputies on the evening of 24 February  was the highlight of his visit to Brasilia. Of the 99 deputies  in the PMDB bloc in Congress, 48 were there. The promoters of  Fleury's candidacy believe as many as 70 members of the PMDB  bloc in the Chamber of Deputies could support Fleury. They also  believe between 25 and 27 PMDB senators support him. Fleury is  scheduled to dine with these senators this week.    If he agrees to run, Fleury could surprise former Sao Paulo  Governor Quercia. Fleury's aides began on 25 February to draft  a map outlining support for Fleury state by state. This  evaluation shows Fleury has the support of most PMDB members in  10 states. It is expected that he has almost overwhelming  support in major states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Minas  Gerais. It is also expected that most delegates to the PMDB  convention from Rio de Janeiro and Bahia States favor Fleury.    PMDB members from the states of Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso  do Sul, Espirito Santo, Alagoas, Rio Grande do Norte, and  Pernambuco are still expected to support Quercia. The remaining  states are considered either pro-Quercia or undecided. Sao  Paulo State, which is considered pro-Quercia, has the largest  number of PMDB delegates. Of the 625 municipalities in the  state, the PMDB has 362 mayors; most of them -- with rare  exceptions -- are loyal to Quercia.    Quercia also controls the PMDB bloc at the Sao Paulo  Legislative Assembly, where 20 of the 26 deputies are loyal to  him. Fleury and Quercia are, however, even regarding the 14  PMDB federal deputies; each has the support of seven deputies.  The pro-Quercia faction appears to be strong in the states of  Para, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Goias, and Ceara. In Parana State,  the PMDB answers to Governor Roberto Requiao, who also dreams  about the presidential succession.    The promoters of Fleury's candidacy have emphasized other  factors that favor their candidate. They contend that most of  the strong PMDB gubernatorial candidates support Fleury. This  is true of Antonio Britto (Rio Grande do Sul), Tarcisio Delgado  (Minas Gerais), Divaldo Suruagy (Alagoas), Garibaldi Filho (Rio  Grande do Norte), Wilson Campos (Mato Grosso), and Gerson Camata  (Espirito Santo). The list also includes weaker candidates,  such as former governor Moreira Franco (Rio de Janeiro) and the  candidate to be nominated by the PMDB in Santa Catarina State.  Moreira Franco, who admits that he would prefer Britto for the  presidency, yesterday met with Quercia in Rio de Janeiro. He  later said he will call Fleury tomorrow to ask if he plans to  seek his presidential nomination.    Another factor favorable to Fleury is the support from all  PMDB national leaders. Luiz Henrique, the PMDB president; Pedro  Simon, the government leader in the Senate; Luiz Carlos Santos,  the government leader in the Chamber of Deputies; and Tarcisio  Delgado, the PMDB bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies, are  all opponents of Quercia. Simon has already announced his  support for Fleury and Santos is the leading promoter of  Fleury's candidacy.    Fleury is aware that the support he is receiving is prompted  more by resistance to Quercia than by his own electoral appeal  and has made it clear that he will not join an anti-Quercia  front. He wants his candidacy to be an option to help the PMDB  remain undivided over the presidential succession issue. He  also voiced disagreement over the way some people have announced  their support for him.    "Fleury's candidacy is more palatable than that of Quercia,"  Simon said. Fleury wants his support to be centered on  political issues, without making any reference to Quercia.  Loyal to Quercia, Para Governor Jader Barbalho distrusts the  expressions of support for Fleury. He said: "It is a wedge  being used by our adversaries to divide the PMDB in Sao Paulo,"  adding: "Behind the promotion of Fleury's candidacy by the Rio  Grande do Sul leaders is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] candidacy."    His failure to draw the support of PMDB governors is another  problem for Quercia. Except for Barbalho, none of the other six  PMDB governors has voiced support for Quercia. Goias Governor  Iris Rezende, who was a Quercia supporter, hopes to become a  presidential candidate. Fleury's supporters are trying to  persuade Rezende to run on Fleury's ticket. Amazonas Governor  Gilberto Mestrinho has also remained silent. Paraiba Governor  Ronaldo Cunha Lima has declined to state his position. Both  Mestrinho and Cunha Lima were considered allies of Quercia.  Tocantins Governor Moises Avelino has no leaning toward Quercia  and Parana Governor Roberto Requiao is an avowed foe of Quercia.  Fleury's supporters expect to obtain the support of the PMDB  governors.</p>

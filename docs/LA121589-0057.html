			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Petition for 'Homeroom': Parents and teachers in Watts have vowed to petition  ABC to save "Homeroom," a canceled half-hour comedy series they say helps keep  their kids in school. "All we're saying is give the show a chance," said Jim  Goins, who counsels school dropouts in the Watts area. "There's not that many  shows of color that deal with educational issues, and we're in a dilemma right  now as far as having black male role models," Goins said. "Homeroom" stars  Darryl Sivad as a man who gave up a lucrative job in advertising to teach at an  inner-city school. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

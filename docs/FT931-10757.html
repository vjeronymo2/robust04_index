			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / International Company News: Renault just breaks even in final quarter RENAULT, the state-controlled French car company yesterday added to the gloomy mood of the European motor industry, when it announced that it just managed to break even in the final quarter of 1992 having made a healthy profit in the first three quarters of the year. The Renault announcement, which came only a few days after the collapse of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle manufacturer, reflects the cost of rationalising the French group's operations and the problems of Volvo, its Swedish partner. Renault doubled pre-tax profits to FFr7.43bn (Dollars 1.38bn) in the first nine months of 1992, from FFr2.93bn in the corresponding period of the previous year. The group also achieved a healthy increase in sales to FFr135.26bn from FFr122.22bn over the same period. Last year was Renault's most successful year in terms of volume sales since 1983. The group sold 2m cars and 1.87m light commercial vehicles, thanks to strong growth in France and gains in market share within the declining European market. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, had previously warned that its performance had deteriorated in the final quarter of the year. This was partly due to the problems at the Volvo group. Renault's share of the Swedish company's losses in the first three quarters of last year amounted to FFr40m. However, Renault was also hit by the cost of its ongoing rationalisation which has reduced its workforce by a quarter in the past five years. The group plans to cut the workforce by another 2,249 people in 1993. Moreover, it suffered from the impact of the September currency crisis which strengthened the French franc against other European currencies thereby reducing Renault's reported profits and making it more difficult for the French company to remain cost-competitive in its export markets.</p>

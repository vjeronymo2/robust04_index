			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking in the Federation Council on Thursday, the  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the Cabinet  intends to pursue a rather tough fiscal policy.    He reported plans to pay 3 Tn rubles over the first four  months of the year towards the state debt to enterprises, this  is only one-third of the state's total debt.    According to his forecast, inflation would mount at a rate  of  under 20% over 8 months of this year. In January, inflation  growth was about 25%, which the minister blamed largely on last  year's decisions to index amortization deductions and raise a  number of tariffs, as well as on inflationary expectations.    By the end of the year, inflation is to be curbed "down to  7-9% and may be down to 3-5%," Shokhin said.    In his words, the government will pursue a tough fiscal  line,  will oblige enterprises to account for all their expenses, and  will provide funds only for concrete projects. The minister  believes that this could keep taxes under control.    He spoke in favor of selective structural policy and  remarked  that over the 10 days as economics minister he could not be  proud of the fact that centralized funds had not been spent  where they might have done the best good.    In regard to social security, Shokhin stressed the need for  effective help to the poor. He recognized as fair the IMF's  criticism of Russia for its neglect of social security.    He spoke in favour of fixing an official unemployment limit.  Official statistics put the number of unemployed at 1 Mn, but by  other estimates, there are 4 Mn without work plus 4 Mn  unregistered jobless.    On economic cooperation with CIS countries, Shokhin wished  that cooperation with them to be closer "but not at the expense  of our interests." In his words, negotiations are still under  way with Belarus on how to integrate the monetary systems of the  two countries. This mechanism, he said, is to be ready by the  week-end.    Although Russia has a positive balance of trade with its CIS  partners, Shokhin spoke with anxiety about the flow of capital  out of Russia. He voiced hope that better legislation could  return this money to Russia. In foreign trade, the government  will continue the course toward liberalization, including the  reduction of a number of quotas and the abolition of export  tariffs.    Shokhin on the whole rejected the proposals carried in the  report on the social and economic situation in Russia, drawn up  by three noted economists Leonid Abalkin, Nikolai Petrakov, and  Stanislav Shatalin. The paper "is appealing from the point of  view of what should not be done," Shokhin said. But the  proposals are too general by nature, he added.    The Economics Ministry will formulate a more detailed view  on  the report after its discussion by the ministry's board next  week, Shokhin said.</p>

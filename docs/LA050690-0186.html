			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DECISION THAT IS PROTECTING DOLPHINS SHOWS THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A  DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> Once again, an individual has made a difference ("Film Turns Tide for Dolphins  at StarKist Tuna," April 14).  </P> <P> Here's to Samuel F. LaBudde, the biologist-photographer, whose painful-to-watch  videotape documented the killing of dolphins during tuna fishing operations.  </P> <P> And here's especially to Jerry Moss, A&amp;M Records executive, who took it a  step further and met at lunch with Anthony J. F. O'Reilly of H. J. Heinz Co.,  to persuade that firm's top man to boycott tuna at StarKist that had been  caught using dolphin-killing methods. Untold numbers of animals will be spared  cruel and needless deaths because of Jerry Moss' persistence and dedication.  </P> <P> And finally, here's to O'Reilly as well. His announcement of such a boycott  started the snowball rolling, prompting other tuna packers to announce similar  policies.  </P> <P> Here's to dedicated individuals like these everywhere and the profound, humane  differences they -- and all of us -- can make.  </P> <P> CASEY KASEM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Sudanese delegation attending the meeting of  the subcommittee on humanitarian affairs set up by the  Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD]  today issued a statement following the end of the negotiations,  which were conducted in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi 6-12 April.    The statement said that the government delegation had signed  the draft agreement put forward by Operation Lifeline [Sudan] on  opening peace corridors to transport relief materials and  humanitarian aid, which confirmed the agreement of 23 March  specifying that aid should be transported in a practical and  secure manner as cheaply as possible. It also laid down that  the relief aid should be sent to new destinations by air, road,  river and rail, to ensure that those in need were fed regardless  of what party controlled the areas in which they were present.    The statement said that Operation Lifeline officials and the  IGADD committee on humanitarian affairs had succeeded in  arriving at an agreement which would guarantee that those in  need would receive relief materials and humanitarian aid in the  combat zones. The statement went on to say that the Sudanese  Government, by signing the agreement, was merely upholding its  firm stance of not permitting food to be used as a weapon. The  government reiterated its determination to arrive at a peaceful  solution to relieve the suffering of war victims in southern  Sudan, sufferings which were imposed by the rebellion.    The statement expressed the Sudanese Government's hope that  the other parties also sign the agreement, stressing that the  government was totally confident that the heads of state of the  IGADD committee would do everything in their power as mediators  to persuade the rebel movement to do its duty by signing the  agreement, because political extremism and obstinacy would  result in innocent civilians having to bear the consequences.

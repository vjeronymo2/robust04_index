			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Scots economy reported to be slipping back The Scottish economy, which outperformed all other UK regions during the recession, has begun to slip back in the recovery, according to Scotland's main economic research organisation. The Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University says that although Scottish manufacturing output has risen faster than that of the UK as a whole since 1992, this is almost entirely due to rapid expansion by the electronics sector. Without the electronics sector manufacturing output would have declined. 'The recovery in Scottish manufacturing is much more narrowly based than manufacturing in the UK,' the institute says. Its latest quarterly bulletin points out that official statistics for output by the production and construction industries in the second quarter of 1994 (the latest avail-able) show a fall of 1.1 per cent in Scotland compared with a rise of 1.8 per cent in the UK. In the year to the second quarter of 1994, output in production and construction grew by 3.3 per cent against 3.4 per cent in the UK. Over the two years from the second quarter of 1992 production in Scotland grew by 6 per cent compared with 8.1 per cent for the UK. Manufacturing output in Scotland grew by 7.5 per cent over the two years, outpacing the UK's 5.1 per cent. However Scotland's advantage was almost entirely due to a rise of 64.2 per cent in the electrical and instrument engineering (electronics) sector, compared with a rise of 19.4 per cent in the UK. Only two other industrial sectors in Scotland - oil processing and chemicals and fibres - showed growth in the two-year period, while mechanical engineering, and metals and metal goods showed sharp declines.

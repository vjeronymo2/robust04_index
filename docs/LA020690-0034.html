			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Schlumberger Limited: The New York firm's 1989 earnings dropped 7% from a year  earlier to $441 million.  </P> <P> Revenue totaled $4.7 billion, down 5%. The oil drilling and oil field service  company attributed results to the previous year's $1.2-billion stock buyback,  which reduced interest income in 1989 by $63 million. However, higher oil  prices in late 1989 helped its oil field businesses recover from a slump in  1988.  </P></p>

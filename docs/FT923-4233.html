			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Claremont Garments benefits from strong link with M and S THE CONTINUING strength of Marks and Spencer's ladies wear sales helped Claremont Garments (Holdings), the clothing maker, increase pre-tax profit by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.83m in the six months to June 27. The comparable pro forma figure of Pounds 2.32m was for Claremont's last six months as part of the Alexon Group before manufacturer and retailer demerged. Turnover advanced to Pounds 21.7m (Pounds 20.7m), of which more than 90 per cent went to M and S. Leaving aside the discontinued men's wear business, the underlying sales improvement was 10 per cent. Operating profit also rose 10 per cent, to Pounds 2.91m (Pounds 2.65m). Mr Peter Wiegand, chairman, said M and S ladies wear was standing up well to the recession and Claremont was supplying an increasing proportion. With two acquisitions since the half-year, its share of the M and S ladies clothing market stood at about 9 per cent. Although M and S was holding down prices, 'it has given us more quantity to go with the pricing policy, so we benefit from increased efficiency in the factory.' Work on garment engineering was also enabling a better margin to be made on low-priced clothes. Since J&amp;J Fashions was bought for Pounds 27m, accompanied by a Pounds 22.4m 2-for-5 rights issue, two small factories had been closed. J&amp;J would double the group's turnover to about Pounds 105m. Its operating margins of 3 to 4 per cent left plenty of scope for improvement. At the end of June, gearing (pre-acquisition and rights issue) was similar to the year-end 15 per cent, when net debt was about Pounds 2m. Gearing was expected to be near 25 per cent by December. Earnings per share rose to 6.6p (5.4p). The interim dividend of 3.3p compared with a demerger payment of 3p. COMMENT When Claremont and Alexon started trading as two separate entities in July last year, Claremont closed at 163p and Alexon at 390p. The idea was that the solid, efficient M and S supplier would be a nice little yielder and that the retail brands would sail to a higher rating. Instead it is Claremont that looks as though it has been unleashed, closing yesterday at 224p, while Alexon (down to 184p) has succumbed to the high street malaise - a malaise that has not affected M and S with its value-for-money ladies wear. Even within the M and S cocoon, Claremont has done well to hold its impressive margins. It really does implement the nostrum that 'there is no end to cost-cutting'. If it can apply the same rigour to J&amp;J, the rewards will be considerable. With the second half traditionally stronger, pre-tax profit is forecast to top Pounds 8m this year, a prospective p/e of 13.5. It deserves its premium to the textiles sector. While the shares look fully priced now, acquisition benefits could add 15 per cent to earnings next year, making the shares a strong hold.</p>

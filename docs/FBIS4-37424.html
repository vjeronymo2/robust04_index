			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] In the name of God. The terroristic and shattering  incident which resulted from the Monafeqin  [hypocrites--pejorative term for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization,  MKO] planting a bomb in the holy shrine of the eighth imam,  peace be upon him, which has resulted in over 100 martyred and  injured, has greatly wounded the religious and human  sensitivities of the Iranian people and the Muslims of the  world. It has generated a wave of abhorrence among the people  and the officials and is being condemned at home and abroad.    The question that arises here is: What was the objective  behind this unprecedented crime? Why did the cold-hearted  Monafeqin choose a holy site such as the hallowed shrine of Imam  Reza--peace be upon him--for this crime and why violate its  sanctity?    According to political observers, the firm bond between the  people and the Islamic system is the most important objective  that the criminals have targeted in this latest atrocity. Right  from the onset of the [Iranian] sixties decade, when the  misanthropic visage of the Monafeqin was revealed, the bond  between the devout Muslim people of Iran and the Islamic system  has constantly been the target of their attacks. However, due  to the popular bias of the Islamic system which is endowed with  an extensive popular base as well, all the plots of the  Monafeqin against this system were foiled.    Following the demise of Imam Khomeyni, the great leader of  the Islamic Revolution--may God's peace be upon him--the powers  of world arrogance have sought to drive a wedge between the  people and the Islamic system by resuming their plots. The  grand ceremonies on the anniversary of the demise of the imam a  few weeks ago and the extensive support and allegiance of the  people for the lofty status of the Velayat-e Faqih [supreme  jurisconsult], once again inflicted defeat on the powers of  world arrogance.    Failure to undermine or change the course of the Islamic  Revolution has aroused the ire of the powers of world arrogance  and its hypocrite agents to the extent that on the anniversary  of Husayn's 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram, when Prophet  Muhammad's grandson, Husayn, was martyred], they attacked a  group of mourning people of Iran in the holiest site in our  country. This atrocity, however distasteful, has been endured  with Husayn-like revolutionary fortitude by the Muslim people of  Iran. Similar crimes by the blind-hearted [kurdel] Monafeqin,  which include their attacks on worshipers at Friday  congregations, the martyring of some Friday imams and people,  have not been able to disrupt the bond between the people and  the system. On the contrary, these crimes have served to  further consolidate this bond and thus to disgrace the enemies  of the people and Islam, more than ever.</p>

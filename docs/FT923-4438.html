			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Monuments to genius and history - Architecture THE BEST kind of architecture is hard to compare with anything else. However, what good buildings have in common is that they clearly express a moment of history. From the Pantheon in Rome to the Guggenheim Museum in New York, architects have produced landmark buildings that measure history and yet are independently distinguished. Publishers are now understanding that there is a good niche for books that concentrate on individual masterpieces rather than books that generalise about a period. Architectural history is marked by individuals of genius who produce occasional buildings of genius. A German publisher, Ernst und Sohn Verlag fur Architektur und technische Wissenschaften, has seen the point of this sort of publishing and for around DM30 (Pounds 10.70) you can find elegant enlightenment about a series of good buildings. I was very struck by the volume on Rudolf Steiner, Goetheanum, Dornach photographed by Thomas Dix and written by the Cologne architectural historian Wolfgang Pehnt. The Goetheanum is undoubtedly one of the icons of the Expressionist movement as well as being the key work of the great anthroposophist Rudolph Steiner. This book shows the building looking like a mountain lit from inside. In different lights the Goetheanum on its hillside near Basel becomes completely organic - strange, beautiful and always suggestive of some other worldly place. On a much more homely level is the volume of the Ernst and Sohn series dedicated to the houses at Fredensborg in Denmark by Jorn Utzon, the architect of the Sydney Opera House. This is a book that makes the caring Sixties, when these houses were built in quiet courtyards with a community centre, look like ancient history. How we could learn today from these modest but sensitive houses] What a sense of peace and order and Scandinavian calm. The other most beautiful thing that the sensitive photographs of Jens Frederiksen reveal is the acute awareness of the landscape. There is none of that isolated 'landscaping' - more a sense of perfect harmony with the land and a strong sense of the scale of the walls being carefully considered with the scale of the trees. The Ernst and Sohn series is known as the Opus series; it is well produced and the volumes are written in German and English. It will range widely, from a volume on Fatehpur Sikri to one on Zurich railway station by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. They are available at good art bookshops A book of an apparently more coffee table appearance is Great Irish Houses and Castles by Jaqueline O'Brien and Desmond Guinness, (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, Pounds 30). But do not be put off by the gloss and glamour of this book. Although it deserves the old accolade of sumptuous it is more than that. Mr Guinness knows these houses perhaps better than anyone in Ireland and the photographer, who has been whizzing over the houses in helicopters and taking her lights into the great rooms, is famous for her photographs of horses. But she is not daunted by the difficulties of architectural photography. The results are very beautiful. Having stayed in some of these houses, I was a bit surprised by the pristine order that they all appear to have acquired for the camera . . . But Irish houses, especially the great Georgian ones such as Russborough, Florence Court and Castletown, demonstrate that the classical house is habitable and elegant and comfortable. Mr Guinness, with his first wife, founded the Irish Georgian Society - one of the most entertaining and effective conservation bodies in the world. He wears his knowledge and enthusiasm lightly; his book makes you want to be in Ireland. The world of the modern architect in Britain is now the subject of considerable scholarly research and publishing. RIBA Publications have just published a monumental volume about one of the heroes of modernism in this country. Berthold Lubetkin Architecture and the Tradition of Progress by John Allan (Pounds 60) is an amazingly thorough book which is interesting as social history as well as architectural history. Lubetkin was born in Russia in 1901, fleeing first to Paris and then to London in 1931. He is famous for the Penguin Pool at London Zoo and for the work of his firm Tecton - which includes the Highpoint flats in Highgate, London, as well as much public housing and health building for the Borough of Finsbury. He seemed to be perfectly fitted to design the mining town of Peterlee, County Durham, for which he was the master planner, in the late 1950s. Its social programme fitted his beliefs - 'that architecture can be a committed driving force on the side of enlightenment.' But he failed and had to resign, a disillusioned man who abandoned architecture and took to farming. His Russian emotionalism won the day and he was sadly embittered until the end of his life in 1990. Mr Allan's tribute is a daunting but effective biography of the man and his period, essential reading for anyone interested in what went right and wrong architecturally and socially in 20th century Britain.</p>

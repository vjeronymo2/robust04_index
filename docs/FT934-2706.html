			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / US and EU edge nearer deal on trade A seesaw session of world trade talks that started in a mood of crisis ended early today with the US and EU apparently having settled wide-ranging disagreements which were jeopardising a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. Most critically, dispute over US hopes to dilute anti-dumping rules have been settled, with officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade saying 95 per cent of the Uruguay Round text had now been agreed. The US and EU have still failed, however, to reach agreement on opening Europe's markets for television and films. Other important areas such as financial services and shipping continue to leave the important services sector in the balance. Intellectual property rights and a successor to the US-EU aircraft code were also unresolved. Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, said after talks broke up that the session had been an 'amazing success' and that the treaty text was almost complete. The progress came after Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU negotiator, cancelled plans to return to Brussels on Sunday evening. He and other senior trade officials continued talks with their US counterparts at the EU's trade mission in Geneva until the early hours. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who was to hold a breakfast meeting today with Sir Leon, said: 'We've made tremendous progress.' He said that beside the audio-visual dispute, the farm trade issue was still open. A Gatt official said the aim now was to complete texts for an overall agreement by late today. This, he added, depends on the US and EU wrapping up their differences. He said the Gatt secretariat hoped to distribute the texts to heads of delegations late in the day. The Trade Negotiations Committee, which oversees the Uruguay Round talks, will hold a meeting tomorrow. Earlier yesterday, before talks resumed in the evening, Mr Sutherland accused the US and EU of blocking progress. His accusations came as US President Bill Clinton telephoned French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, British Prime Minister John Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an effort to rescue the talks. The discussions, which began with a breakfast-time disclosure by Sir Leon that the talks were 'in crisis', involved nerve-racking brinkmanship that appeared to leave successful outcome of the trade talks by the December 15 deadline in the balance. While speculation spread that negotiators were examining exclusion of financial services from the negotiations, later comments confirmed that the US-EU dispute over access to Europe's television and film markets was the key stumbling block. At the EU summit in Brussels, which ended on Saturday, Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, said it might be necessary to 'stop the clock' on the Wednesday midnight deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round. That followed adoption of a hardened EU position on audiovisual trade, textiles and demands by France and several other member states for tougher trade weapons. But Mr Sutherland dismissed the possibility of changing the deadline as 'a misapprehension of the highest order'. French officials believe the summit guidelines to EU negotiators to secure special, separate treatment for European cinema and broadcasting should be sufficient for the French government to get a Gatt deal through the National Assembly this week.

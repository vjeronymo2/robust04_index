			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: Worth counting Trust the Germans to be industriously minting money even in the teeth of a recession. The Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden recently announced that it has counted 106,010 wealthy souls with assets in excess of DM1m in western Germany, representing an increase of 19 per cent on a three-year comparison. Stuttgart possesses the highest density of such well-heeled citizens, followed by Munich and then Dusseldorf. How is it done? Mostly by taking figures that relate to er, 1989. Asked the reason for this uncharacteristic tardiness, officials explain that 'the statistical rhythm' has been upset by reunification, that catch-all for all evils in western Germany these days.</p>

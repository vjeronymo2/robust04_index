			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Tallinn, Mar 02, BNS -- Estonia is considering  changing the level of its delegation for negotiations with  Russia and may even break off the talks because of Russia's  unconstructive approach, Estonia's chief negotiator Ambassador  Vaino Reinart said today at a press conference after the 17th  round of talks.    The reason for this is the Russian delegation's announcement  that the final deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Estonia is still open and that the pullout continues  according to a timetable approved in Moscow, which is known only  to the Russian side.    Head of the Russian delegation, Ambassador Vasiliy Svirin  said that Russia's promise to withdraw its troops by Aug. 31,  made during the 15th round of talks in January, "is no longer  the order of the day," since Estonia has failed to keep its  earlier promises. [passage omitted]    Estonia's top negotiator said the government plans soon to  address the issue of the future of the talks.    Svirin said Estonia's intention to change the level of the  delegation or to break off the talks will cause "certain  tensions" in Estonian-Russian relations.    "On March 1 we informed Estonia of the changes in the  make-up  of our delegation," the Russian diplomat said. "We included  several deputy ministers in it, which shows our interest in the  negotiations."    In the 17th round of talks Estonia again asked Russia to  present a list of Russian citizens residing in Estonia. The  proposal, regrettably, met with a refusal, Reinart said.    No progress was made on the border issue. The parties only  agreed that the working groups on border and humanitarian issues  would meet before the next round of talks to discuss citizenship  problems. An agreement in principle was reached also on  reviving a joint working group to address the issue of a  juridical evaluation of Russia's annexation of Estonia in 1940.    The parties did not set a date for the next round of  negotiations.</p>

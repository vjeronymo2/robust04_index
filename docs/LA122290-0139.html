			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL TO HIKE OUTPUT AT PLANT IN WILMINGTON  </P> <P> Unocal Corp. said Friday that it will spend $515 million to increase gasoline  production at its Wilmington refinery and upgrade equipment to meet new federal  clean air standards.  </P> <P> The project, to be completed in late 1993 -- subject to regulatory approvals --  would boost current gasoline production by about 10% over the current level of  roughly 80,000 barrels a day, said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane.  </P> <P> It will enable Unocal to produce reformulated gasolines, designed to produce  lower auto emissions under guidelines to be established pursuant to the federal  Clean Air Act signed by President Bush last month.  </P> <P> The project will also reduce sulfur oxide emissions from the refinery.  </P> <P> Unocal will build a 55,000-barrel-per-day processing unit used in making  gasoline, a hydrogen plant and related sulfur recovery units.  </P> <P> The proposed upgrade will require permits from the city of Los Angeles and the  South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> Unocal will finance the upgrade out of internal funds.  </P> <P> The refinery has a capacity to process up to 108,000 barrels of crude oil a day  into such products as gasoline and fuel oil.  </P></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BPC looks forward to flexible digital future Mr John Holloran, British Printing Company's chief executive, describes the digital revolution in the printing industry as, 'the most exciting thing since movable type.' He believes the use of digital technology will enable commercial printers like BPC to become even more efficient and provide customers, including magazine publishers, with a 'more flexible, faster and more creative service' - probably on a European-wide basis. Mr Holloran's vision of the future of the printing industry is tied up with the plans to float BPC, the UK's largest commercial printer with about 20 per cent of the UK high volume magazine printing market, on the London Stock Exchange. The flotation is expected to place a value of about Pounds 250m on BPC, which was known as BPCC until Mr Holloran led a management buy-out from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire in January 1989. Mr Maxwell is always refered to in BPC as 'the previous owner.' Funds raised through the flotation are expected to be used to repay debt associated with the Pounds 240m buy-out, backed initially by Electra and Candover, and will eliminate about Pounds 25m a year in interest costs. This will free BPC to invest even more heavily in new technology and the setting up of a Europe-wide network of printing plants. BPC has already invested heavily in new plant and equipment in the UK as part of a Pounds 108m capital investment programme undertaken since the buy-out. As part of this programme the group's 25 main plants, which include both gravure and web-offset print plants, have been linked together by an electronic network and digital design studios have been created for each of the main businesses. 'We have spent Pounds 5m on IT alone,' says Mr Holloran. He also claims that the investment has been customer driven. For example BPC worked closely with the Radio Times to improve and develop the product. At the same time the group has been completely restructured. Before the buy-out Mr Holloran says BPC was a collection of 40 separate businesses riddled with infighting and lacking focus. In the two years following the buy-out the group was restructured and the workforce has been cut from 7,500 to 5,000. The group operates in six main markets, magazines, catalogues, books &amp; journals, packaging, labels and security documents such as cheque books and direct mail. The magazines and catalogues division is by far the largest, accounting for more than 50 per cent of group turnover. It prints more than 1bn magazines each year on 27 web offset and 6 gravure presses including eight of the top 10 weekly magazines - the other two are printed in Germany by a competitor. Among the titles it prints are the Radio Times, TV Times, Bella, Woman's Own, Country Life and Readers Digest. It also produces books and journals, as well as catalogues for Thomson Holidays, Next and Argos. BPC prints 125m labels a week for customers like Heinz, Nescafe and Cadbury and claims a 4 per cent share the highly fragmented labels market together with a 2 per cent share of the folding carton markets. Its folding cartons are used to package Silk Cut cigarettes, Mcleans toothpaste, Thorntons' chocolate and Twining's tea. BPC produced operating profits of Pounds 19m last year on turnover of Pounds 317.6m. Mr Holloran says that now is the right time for a flotation because of the recovery in the printing market.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Car output at highest level for nearly 20 years British car production last year reached its highest level since 1974, with Rover moving further ahead of Ford as the UK's largest carmaker. Rover's output of cars last year totalled 408,804, compared with Ford's 271,793, although the latter's total rises to 301,380 when Jaguar output is included. In 1992, Rover produced 378,797 cars, compared with a combined total of 322,946 cars from Ford and Jaguar. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the UK's total car output last year reached 1.38m, nearly 7 per cent higher than in 1992 and the highest since the 1.53m units reached in 1974. However, this was in contrast to commercial vehicle output, which declined further to the lowest level since 1958, mainly as a result of a steep drop in demand in Continental Europe. The figures emerged as Ford announced that short-time working had ended at its Transit van plant at Southampton, and that output of Escorts from its Halewood plant on Merseyside was being increased as a result of continuing recovery in the UK vehicle market. Ford produced 127,065 light commercial vehicles, compared with only 19,940 by Rover. Total car output last year continued on its rising trend, up 6.47 per cent to 1,375,524 units, the highest since 1974. This was in spite of lower output at Vauxhall and Peugeot.

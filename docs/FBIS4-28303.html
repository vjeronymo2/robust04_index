			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the Korean Buddhists Federation sent a letter to Buddhist  organizations in Asian countries on June 1 concerning the fact  that the Japanese authorities have begun to operate in real  earnest the fast breeder reactor "Monju" which was named after  "Maijusri" (Bodhisattva of Wisdom).    "Monju" is the Japanese pronunciation of "Bodhisattva of  Wisdom".    Noting that the prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju",  starting operation in April, is a plutonium breeder reactor for  manufacturing nuclear bombs, developed by the Japanese  militarists for the purpose of nuclear armament, the letter says:    With no excuse or fair words can the Japanese ruling  quarters  justify their abuse of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom" to this "devil-  incarnate".    If the Japanese militarists' moves to gratify their ambition  for a nuclear power by abusing even the name of Bodhisattva are  not checked today, they would use another name of Bodhisattvas,  Buddhist doctrines and Buddhist sutras to reduce us to slaves of  their nuclear weapons and scapegoat falling victim to a nuclear  holocaust tomorrow.    A nuclear disaster that may be caused by the Japanese fast  breeder reactor "Monju" will cover the entire Asian region just  as the sufferings and damages imposed by the Japanese  imperialist aggression in the first half of this century had  become a tragedy for the whole of Asia, not confined to any one  country.    All the Buddhists and Buddhist organizations truly valuing  human life should pool their minds and efforts irrespective of  their respective borders and schools to expose and condemn the  Japanese militarists' criminal acts of insulting Buddhism, and  decisively remove from the earth in the name of Buddhism the  Japanese fast breeder reactor which is becoming a hotbed of  nuclear calamities behind the sign of "Bodhisattva of Wisdom".    The letter expresses the expectation that the Dharma friends  in different countries will rise as one in the sacred struggle  to frustrate Japan's nuclear power ambition and prevent a  nuclear war in conformity with their fundamental aims of  achieving peace and happiness of mankind.</p>

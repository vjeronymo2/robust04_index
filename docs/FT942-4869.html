			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Farm subsidies remain in place Agricultural subsidies in the industrialised world barely declined last year in spite of government pledges to reduce them, the OECD reported yesterday. In its latest annual review of agricultural policies and trade, the OECD estimated that combined transfers to agriculture from consumers and tax payers in its member countries fell by less than 1 per cent to just over Dollars 335bn last year compared with 1992. The OECD said the reform of agricultural policies in its member countries had been 'limited and uneven'. Total farm support increased last year in the US, the European Union and Turkey and was little changed in Finland, New Zealand and Switzerland. Farm support, measured in national currencies, fell elsewhere in the OECD.</p>

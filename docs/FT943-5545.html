			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Thais detain religious leader The Thai government yesterday detained the leader of the messianic Al-Arqam Islamic movement, indicating that he would be expelled to Malaysia, which has sought to have the sect banned throughout South-East Asia. Police stopped Mr Ashaari Muhammad and his followers as they travelled to Chiang Mai, where the religious leader has been in self-imposed exile for six years, according to Mr Jailani Jasmani, Mr Ashaari's press secretary. Mr Ashaari was told he was now an illegal visitor because he was one of 10 sect members who had their passports cancelled by the Malaysian authorities. A Thai foreign ministry official said: 'We have had requests from the Malaysian government, which does not want these people here. We gain nothing by allowing him to stay in the face of the requests.' The Al-Arqam movement is not banned in Thailand, a mainly Buddhist country.</p>

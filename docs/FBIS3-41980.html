General al-Majid, dubbed "Ali Chemical" in Iraq, has been  made acting Governor of al-Basrah in addition to his position  as Defence Minister. From there, he personally supervised the  chemical attacks in September against the Shias in the marshes,  according to Husayn Shahristani, formerly Iraq's top nuclear  scientist.    The General is an expert in genocide and depopulation; he  was  personally responsible for poison-gas attacks against the Kurds  - such as the one on the town of Halabjah in 1988 - during  Saddam's "Arabisation" drive in the north.    He extended the system of forced removal under which some  100,000 Kurds fled the country. In 1990, he was made governor  of the newly annexed Kuwait. There, he oversaw the exodus of  civilians while attempting to conscript Kuwaiti men into his  Iraqi army.    Now, General al-Majid is turning his talents to a  three-pronged programme finally to depopulate the southern  marshes. "When Saddam realised the southermost marshes were not  drained, and the rains started again after the summer, he  decided to speed up the exercise," Dr Shahristani, on a visit to  London, told the Independent. So in addition to the draining  that has turned most of the south into a modern desert, General  al-Majid launched a chemical attack on the population on 26  September. "He has sent word to the Shia fighters that that he  will do to them what he did to the Kurds," said Dr Shahristani.    He is also rounding up Shia men and executing them  summarily.  Dr Shahristani, himself a Shia, has met relatives who have had  to claim the bodies from Abu Ghurayb jail in Baghdad. They  speak of decomposition beyond the stage of identification.    Dr Shahristani, who quit Iraq's nuclear energy programme in  1979, said the chemicals used in the south were different from  those used in Halabjah. "These are newly made, with tear-gas  and a cocktail mix of lethal ingredients. These do not require  much equipment. They can be made in university laboratories, or  the equipment can easily be buried."    Eyewitnesses have told Dr Shahristani the chemicals were  fired in shells by mortar. They spoke of "bodies changing  colour to yellow or orange with blisters". As many Iraqi  soldiers appeared to have died as Shia civilians. The soldies  fell with their gas masks on. Only the victims strong enough to  walk to the Iranian border have got out to tell the tale.    dr Shahristani will today take his case to the Foreign  Office. UN inspectors,charged with ensuring Saddam complies with  resolutions to destroy weapons of mass destruction, are due to  visit the area soon. Six weeks on, it is expected the evidence  will be difficult to find.</p>

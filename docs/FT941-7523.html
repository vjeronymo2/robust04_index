			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Credit Lyonnais seeks to raise Pounds 2.3bn from asset sales Credit Lyonnais, the French state-controlled banking group, is planning to sell more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.29bn) of assets over the next two years to repair its balance sheet. A spokesman confirmed the bank's policy of disposing of a significant part of its investment portfolio, although he declined to specify the exact target. 'The amount and the timing will depend on market conditions,' he said. The move is an important step in the loss-making bank's restructuring, which is also expected to include a state-backed capital increase of between FFr3bn and FFr4bn and the transfer of non-performing property assets to a newly created shell company. Industry analysts described the decision to sell assets as a positive step. They estimated the bank suffered losses of up to FFr4bn in 1993 which could push its capital ratio below 8 per cent. 'It is a good move,' said Mrs Jennifer Oliver Martin, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'It should strengthen the balance sheet by reducing assets and achieving some capital gains.' Observers said the first move would probably be a reduction in the bank's relatively liquid shareholdings in listed companies. These include stakes in Bouygues, the construction group, Bollore, the engineering and shipping company, and Navigation Mixte, the diversified holding company in which Credit Lyonnais holds 14 per cent. The bank also holds stakes in several state-owned companies, including Usinor-Sacilor, the steel group, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace group. The total value of Credit Lyonnais' shareholdings is estimated at about FFr55bn. Credit Lyonnais declined to comment on other elements of its restructuring plan. Negotiations with the government concerning a capital increase and the creation of a shell company for property loans are, however, thought to be near completion.</p>

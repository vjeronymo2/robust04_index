			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Federalism also divides S Africa: Debate over the future form of government AS MARCHERS of the African National Congress (ANC) lay dying in the dust on Monday after a protest aimed at forcing the South African government to abolish the Ciskei black homeland, government experts in Pretoria were unveiling plans to do just that: to merge Ciskei and the nine other black homelands into a federal South Africa. President F W de Klerk was addressing a conference of pro-government parties on the subject of federalism: what Mrs Helen Suzman, the veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, calls the 'f' word. She has captured the vehemence of the debate over whether South Africa - surely one of the most ethnically, racially, culturally and linguistically divided nations on earth - can best be governed as a federal or a unitary state. There is no more difficult issue in South African politics; and when negotiations eventually resume on a new constitution, this debate will be the toughest to resolve, for it goes to the very heart of how political power will be shared in the new South Africa. Federalism might seem an obvious solution for the problem of diversity and conflict. As Oxford political scientist R W Johnson points out, writing in yesterday's Johannesburg Star newspaper, 'nowhere else in the world has the democratic government of so large and various a population even been attempted without resort to federalism'. Unfortunately for those who favour a federal solution in South Africa - the government, the powerful Inkatha Freedom party, and the liberal Democratic party - the very concept has been discredited by decades of apartheid, which was itself a demented version of federalism. For the guiding principle of apartheid was that each of South Africa's peoples - white, coloured, Indian, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Swazi, etc - should be granted the right of self-determination in their own nation state. Accordingly, 10 black tribal states were created (now known as homelands). Each was to have gained independence (four did accept independence, while the other six are known as 'self-governing' states), as part of a confederation of regional states including white South Africa. Given that background, it is scarcely surprising that the ANC views the government's plans for a federal South Africa as a renewed attempt to 'divide and rule'. And in a sense, it is right. The government sees devolution of power to regional and local levels as the best means of preventing domination by an omnipotent black government ruling from Pretoria. Independent constitutional experts argue that if ethnic and tribal minorities feel they have no chance of ever winning power, they will have little time for democracy. If they see a chance to exercise power at regional level - with all the patronage and privileges that that implies - they are less likely to revolt. But the ANC is deeply suspicious of this argument. Its goal has always been to create a colour-blind South Africa where tribal divisions are subsumed in a single nationhood. But the main complaint voiced by the ANC is not that the government would use federalism to build anti-ANC regional power bases, but that it would be used to preserve white privilege. 'The struggle was aimed at fighting white privilege,' says Mr Zola Skweyiya, head of the ANC's constitutional team, 'but the National party's regional policy is designed to ensure white privilege is preserved. What black government can accept that?' The government counters that none of its proposed seven federal provinces would have a white majority, so white domination of regional government would be impossible (though it acknowledges that the Western Cape province could be ruled by non-Africans, because whites and coloureds, the mixed race people who share a language and culture with Afrikaners, would be in the majority there). But at the local level protecting whites is clearly one of Pretoria's aims. The aim is that crucial issues such as education and health should be handled at local authority level and, after decades of residential segregation, these authorities will not become integrated overnight. The ANC does not dismiss devolution out of hand. Indeed, it pays lip service to the need for regional governments to bring democracy 'closer to the people'. ANC constitutional experts say central government in South Africa should have roughly the same powers as those in Germany. But they make clear that the goal of their regional policy is developmental, not political. They want to redistribute resources from richer regions to poorer ones, and insist that central government must have the power to achieve this.</p>

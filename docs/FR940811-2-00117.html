The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 made substantial changes to the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) provisions. One change made Medicare the primary payer of benefits for disabled Medicare beneficiaries who do not have a current employment status with an employer. Previously, the private employer plan was the primary payer. Employers are required to notify the Medicare contractor of the name, date of birth, sex, social security number, and health insurance claim number of each Medicare beneficiary covered under the private plan who does not have a current employment status so that the carrier's records are annotated to show Medicare is the primary payer. To comply with the law an employer needs to know whether disabled employees are eligible under Medicare. For railroad employees, the Railroad Retirement Board is the best source for this information. The existing routine use permits disclosure of Medicare status to an employer, but only for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under the private plan. The modification would authorize the RRB to furnish Medicare status to the insurance company acting as agent of the employer for the purpose of enabling the employer to comply with the new provisions of the law. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Railroad Retirement Board has determined that this proposed routine use meets the compatibility requirement because it is a necessary and proper use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed routine use (``ee'' for RRB&hyph;21) would authorize the RRB to disclose to an insurance company administering a medical insurance program for railroad workers non-medical information relating to determinations of sickness benefits by the RRB for purposes of determining entitlement to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses under the program. Presently, under certain circumstances, the insurance company cannot determine from the medical bills submitted for reimbursement or current data available to it whether a railroad worker remains disabled. In these cases, the insurance company requires the employee to furnish proof of disability. This usually requires the employee to have a form completed by the treating physician, which causes a delay in reimbursement and often additional cost to the employee. When the plan calls for direct payment by the insurance company, the inability of the insurance company or its agent to determine entitlement in such cases results in a delay and an inconvenience to the railroad worker. Disclosure of the information as proposed in this routine use would eliminate these problems for the affected railroad workers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Railroad Retirement Board has determined that this proposed routine use meets the compatibility requirement because it is a necessary and proper use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By authority of the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Beatrice Ezerski, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary to the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

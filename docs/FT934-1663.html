			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / M&amp;G surges as recovery plays pay off Shares in M&amp;G jumped 30p to 995p yesterday as the fund management group announced a 36 per cent increase in its final dividend for the year to September 30. Full-year pre-tax profits advanced 29 per cent from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 50.9m. Funds under management rose 45 per cent, helped by buoyant stock markets and a strong improvement in the group's relative investment performance. M&amp;G follows a 'value investing' style - looking for shares with artificially depressed prices - which tends to suffer during recessions, but performs very well in periods of recovery. The group's sales of unit trusts (sales minus redemptions) were just Pounds 92m for the year to September 30, against an industry total of more than Pounds 7bn. Mr Peter Emms, marketing director, said the trust traditionally did not attract a large share of institutional unit trust sales, nor did it offer a high income fund. Some unit trust launches have offered yields as high as 10 per cent and have been very successful. But Mr Paddy Linaker, group managing director, did not feel that such products were appropriate for M&amp;G clients. He warned of the problems unit trust groups faced in the 1970s, when 'withdrawal plans' led to the erosion of investors' capital in the 1973-74 bear market. M&amp;G's sales showed signs of improvement in the second half and all four of its UK equity income funds are in the top 10 per cent of the sector over the year to September 1. It has more Personal Equity Plan accounts than any other UK company. At September 30, unit trust funds under management were Pounds 6.32bn (Pounds 4.15bn); investment trusts were Pounds 662m (Pounds 456m); life and pension funds were Pounds 2.14bn (Pounds 1.55bn); and institutional investor clients were Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 2.45bn). Total funds under management were Pounds 12.46bn (Pounds 8.59bn), or Pounds 10.56bn after allowing for double counting. Revenue from investment management was Pounds 63.7m (Pounds 59.4m). Marketing and commissions expenditure was Pounds 13.17m, down from Pounds 18.53m in 1991-92 when the company launched two investment trusts. Administration expenditure was Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 17.9m). The group's insurance activities contributed Pounds 12.69m (Pounds 10.19m). The accounting treatment of this business will change this year to reflect the EC Insurance Accounts Directive. The final dividend is increased from 11p to 15p, making a total of 25p, against 20p. Earnings per share rose from 36.4p to 47.8p. Lex, Page 20</p>

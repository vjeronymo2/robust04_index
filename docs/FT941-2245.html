			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Observer: Pro Bono publico? Edward de Bono, the skilled self-publicist who has made himself a name for thinking laterally, believes the time has come for a fresh approach to the world's economic problems. Ten out of ten so far. As well as writing in yesterday's FT on the need for a bit of imagination in tackling employment issues, he's crafted a think-tank paper for the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation. In the latter, he proposes inventing something called 'target currencies', with companies like IBM creating their own economies by issuing their own currency. De Bono says the idea could be extended to cover sectors; people would be paid in 'housing currency' or 'luxury goods currency' or 'supermarket currency'. He believes this would enable governments to manage the overall economy much more selectively - particular sectors could be stimulated without triggering all-round inflation. A secondary market would enable people to trade between different types of currency. 'It would be like the human body with membranes separating the various currencies.' He points to examples already existing in prototype: the US Food Stamp programme and Singapore's Central Provident Fund, which holds a portion of people's salary but allows them to borrow against it or invest it. Oh, of course; socialism with a human face.</p>

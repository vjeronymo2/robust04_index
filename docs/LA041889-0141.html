			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINESE YOUTHS, TROOPS CLASH AT PARTY HQ;  </P> <P> STUDENTS CALL FOR FREEDOM, DEMAND TALK WITH PREMIER  </P> <P> Thousands of Chinese students tried to force their way into the national  Communist Party headquarters in the heart of Beijing today but were repulsed by  lines of troops.  </P> <P> A massive crowd of students calling for democratic freedoms and demanding to  speak with Chinese Premier Li Peng surged against the gates of the heavily  guarded Zhongnanhai Compound, witnesses said.  </P> <P> About 5,000 onlookers cheered them on as they clashed with soldiers in scenes  never seen in 40 years of Communist rule.  </P> <P> The unprecedented protest came on the fourth day of mounting unrest after the  death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, popular among students  because he championed the rights of intellectuals. Today's action followed  student demands for democratic freedoms and rehabilitation of the former party  chief.  </P> <P> Witnesses said scuffles broke out as the demonstrators confronted police  guarding the gates but that the protest settled into a tense standoff between  students and authorities shortly before midnight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unrest on Campuses  </P> <P> Hu's death Saturday has triggered widespread unrest on Beijing campuses where  students have spoken out against the forced resignation in 1987 of the  reformist leader.  </P> <P> A large crowd of students also demonstrated early today at Fudan University in  Shanghai, China's biggest city, college sources said.  </P> <P> Although the demonstrations are the biggest spontaneous gatherings in Beijing  in 13 years, diplomats doubted that the students would succeed in shaking the  authorities as they did with nationwide rallies for democracy and freedom in  1986.  </P> <P> "This time is different. I do not feel the tension," one veteran European  diplomat said, remarking on the almost festive mood in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Student protests in late 1986 contributed to Hu's downfall at the hands of  party hard-liners who launched a campaign against "bourgeois liberalization,"  code words for Western political ideas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tribute Slated Saturday  </P> <P> So far the authorities have chosen to ignore the students and emphasize their  own praise for Hu as a great revolutionary while glossing over the  circumstances of his dismissal.  </P> <P> Two official newspapers with a reputation for being more liberal have even  encouraged the students, though indirectly.  </P> <P> Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, once Hu's close ally, has not made public comment  on the death of his old friend.  </P> <P> Hu's successor as party leader, Zhao Ziyang, is expected to make a speech in  tribute at a special memorial service in the Great Hall of the People on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Informed Chinese sources said up to 10,000 students could be invited to join  the ceremony to take the sting out of their protests.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus said on Czech Radio today that changes in the Czech  Government were only natural and their number was not excessive  as compared with stabilized West European states. He was  commenting on Petr Pitha's resignation as education minister  last Wednesday and his replacement by Ivan Pilip yesterday. Both  are members of the Christian Democratic Party (KDS). Klaus said  that health reasons were really behind Pitha's resignation.    Pitha is the third minister to leave the present government  which emerged from the June 1992 elections. The other leavers  were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party, ODS) and  Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both were  criticized for their performance as ministers.    Asked whether the government was considering the dismissal  of  Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM), and  whether this step would harm coupon privatization as indicated  by some dailies, Klaus said: "The idea that coupon privatization  could be threatened by the dismissal of one person belongs in  the category of jokes." "Tomas Jezek's future in this or  another post is by no means connected with coupon  privatization," Klaus stressed.    Speculations about the dismissal or resignation of Jezek  (Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) appeared especially in  connection with the last scandals accompanying the sales of the  shares of some enterprises held by the FNM.    Klaus also dismissed speculations that he or the government  coalition would have discussed Jezek's firing as "simply  erroneous." He added that he himself learnt only from the press  that a majority of the members of the FNM governing body were  starting to consider Jezek's dismissal.    On Saturday the left-orientated daily RUDE PRAVO, referring  to an unnamed "coalition source", wrote that Klaus, together  with Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda (ODA) and Privatization Minister  Jiri Skalicky (ODA) had decided on Thursday not to dismiss Jezek  for the time being. According to the paper, the dismissal was  demanded by six out of the nine members of the FNM governing  body, chaired by Skalicky.</p>

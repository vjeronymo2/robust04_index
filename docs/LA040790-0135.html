			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. TAXPAYERS COUGH UP EARLY AND OFTEN  </P> <P> Despite their reputation for hating taxes, Orange County residents -- who face  tax time twice this month -- are among the most punctual in the state for  paying up, a survey by the state controller's office says.  </P> <P> The county's relatively low delinquency rate for property taxes -- about 2.3%  last year -- ranked it eighth among the 58 California counties for the  percentage of its tax bills paid on time.  </P> <P> The only big counties with fewer procrastinators per taxpayer were Santa Clara,  Santa Barbara and San Mateo.  </P> <P> Far worse at meeting property tax deadlines were Los Angeles and Riverside  counties, with delinquency rates of 4.6% and 4.7% respectively. The county that  claimed the highest percentage of property tax procrastinators in California  last year was tiny Tuolumne, outside Yosemite National Park.  </P> <P> "Orange County is very affluent," explained county treasurer-tax collector  Robert L. Citron, the man to whom property owners write checks this time of  year.  </P> <P> And punctuality pays, he said. "You won't find many large taxpayers who would  pay late. The penalties would be too high," he said.  </P> <P> Those who miss the deadline -- which is Tuesday for the second installment of  county property taxes -- face a 10% penalty, plus a $10 fee for processing the  late payment, Citron said.  </P> <P> Citron's office sent about 679,400 real estate tax bills for the fiscal year,  which began in July, 1989. The total property tax bill for the county this year  is $1.47 billion.  </P> <P> Since January, money has been pouring into the treasurer's office at a pace of  about $2 million a day. That includes those who are paying early as well as  those who missed the December deadline for paying the first half of their taxes  for the fiscal year.  </P> <P> For those who may feel taxpayer blues at the prospect of paying both property  and income taxes in the span of a week, consider the county's top 10 tax bills  for the year. They are in order:  </P> <P> Irvine Co:. -- $37.4 million.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell: -- $16.8 million.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison Co.: -- $14.2 million.  </P> <P> Rockwell International: -- $6.5 million.  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft: -- $6.3 million.  </P> <P> Walt Disney: -- $5.4 million.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas: -- $4.7 million.  </P> <P> Unocal Co. -- $4.2 million.  </P> <P> Koll Management Co.: -- $4 million.  </P> <P> Marriott Corp.: -- $3.8 million.  </P></p>

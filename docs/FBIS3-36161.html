The figure for 1992 equalled 33 per cent and the 1993  increase was caused mostly by the budget article called "Other  Expenses" which the ministry did not specify in its report on  Tuesday.    The "other expenses" grew from 13.4 per cent in 1992 to 21.4  per cent in 1993.    Defence expenses dropped from 14.3 to 12.4 per cent.    Although the major share of appropriations goes to the  national economy, it decreased from 34.5 to 27.3 per cent.    More money was allocated to "social and cultural measures" -  23.1 per cent in 1992 and 24.9 per cent in 1993.    Approrpiations for science, police, governing and  controlling  bodies, as well as for foreign economic activities varied from  1.6 to 5.1 per cent in 1993.    Finance Ministry experts said that budget spendings  increased  because of credits for grain purchases in Russia, for conversion  and loans to CIS states.</p>

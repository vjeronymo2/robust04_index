			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM says  Israel and the United States have taken practical steps to  implement the F-15E Eagle aircraft deal. The first batch of the  advanced aircraft will de delivered to Israel in 1997. The  newspaper notes that these fighter planes will enable Israel to  reach distant targets, including Iraq and Iran.    In its comment today, AL-AHRAM says this deal has added  another dimension to the arms race in the region. It has also  provided further proof that Israel and the United States want to  maintain their military superiority over the Arabs. In  addition, Israel will use this superiority as a bargaining chip  in any settlement with the Arab countries.    AL-AHRAM warns that Israel's desire to strengthen its  military arsenal might harm the peace process because the other  states might find themselves compelled to increase their  armament capabilities to achieve a military balance with Israel.  All this will lead to an arms race in the region.</p>

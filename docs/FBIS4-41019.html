			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN learned today that Ukraine's Ministry  of the Environment has agreed technical requirements for a  system of radiation monitoring in Ukraine. The requirements  were worked out by the British company PA Consulting Group, in  accordance with the EEC program of technical assistance to the  CIS (TACIS). They were agreed following expert appraisal by  Ukrainian departments involved in radiation monitoring and  accident control.    Kostyantyn Rudya, deputy head of the directorate for nuclear  and radioactive safety of Ukraine's Ministry of Environment  [name and title as received], told UNIAN that the agreement  makes it possible to launch the first part of the Gamma-1  monitoring system for nuclear power plants, which constitutes  the first part of a radiation unit in Ukraine's environmental  monitoring system which is being developed in coordination with  the Ministry of Environment. According to Kostyantyn Rudya, the  EEC wishes to receive immediate reports on radioactive accidents  at Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station] which could  have transboundary effects.    Ukraine's Ministry of Environment, taking national interests  into account, has attached additional conditions to the  technical requirements submitted to the EEC mission in Ukraine.  These include the widest possible use of Ukrainian equipment,  services, and organizations by the Gamma-1 contractor.  Ukraine's Ministry of Environment has also expressed an  interest in Ukraine's participation in approving criteria for  the choice of contractor in a competition to be held by the EEC.</p>

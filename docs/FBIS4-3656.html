			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] According to XINHUA, President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng today sent a message of condolences in  connection with the death of former U.S. President Richard Nixon.    The message says: We are shocked to learn that Mr. Richard  Nixon has died of illness, and we wish to express our profound  condolences.    Mr. Nixon was a statesmen with strategic foresight and  political courage. When he was U.S. President, he and the late  Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai opened the gate of Sino-U.S.  relations and created a new situation for the relations between  the two countries. After he was relieved of his office, Mr.  Nixon continued to concern himself with Sino-U.S. relations and  make important contributions to safeguarding and developing the  two countries' relations.    We are convinced that, under the joint efforts exerted by  China and the United States, Sino-U.S. relations which the late  Mr. Nixon cared about certainly will continue to improve and  develop. We wish to express our sincere sympathy to Mr. Nixon's  family.    Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen also sent messages of  condolences.</p>

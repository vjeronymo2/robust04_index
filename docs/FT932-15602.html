			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Russia warns on new Serbia sanctions PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia warned yesterday that tighter sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be counter-productive. A draft resolution on sanctions is due to be debated by the UN security council on Monday. It is aimed at stopping and checking all traffic along the Danube, closing several border crossings between Serbia and its neighbours, banning all shipping in Yugoslavia's territorial waters, and seizing what remains of the country's assets abroad. Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, said any new sanctions, intended as pressure by the international community to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, would have the opposite effect. 'This would be an untimely and harmful step,' he said, after talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader. Mr Churkin added that the conflict in Bosnia 'would escalate', implying that the Bosnian Serbs were determined to continue fighting regardless of international pressure. However, Mr Nikola Koljevic, a senior Bosnian Serb leader, said new proposals made by Mr Churkin would be acceptable to the Bosnian Serbs. He said the Russian plan envisaged amending the shape of the Bosnian map drawn up by the international peace negotiators. The map, accepted by Bosnia's Croats and Moslems, entails dividing the republic into ten autonomous provinces, largely on ethnic lines. But the Bosnian Serbs have steadfastly refused to accept the boundaries because the map does not give them full control of eastern Bosnia, a crucial bridge for linking Serb-held territories in south-west Croatia with Serbia proper. The US indicated yesterday it wanted an early UN vote on sanctions, despite Russian misgivings. But the US, Britain and France have been anxious not to press Moscow too hard before the referendum on April 25, when Russians will decide how they should be ruled. Agencies report: The value of the Yugoslav dinar, drastically eroded by inflation and sanctions, has been set by the Belgrade government at 48,000 to the US dollar. The previous official exchange rate had been 750 dinars to the dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Foreigners denounced  the pressure campaign of the United States and its followers  against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    Alhaji A.B. Ziblim, general secretary of the National  Convention Party of Ghana, in a statement June 7 expressed deep  apprehensions over the pressure campaign of the United States  and some other countries, saying the "presidential statement"  published by the UN Security Council recently cannot be  construed otherwise than part of the sinister political plot to  destroy socialist Korea.    He contended that the Secretariat of the International  Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN Security Council should abide by  the principles of justice and impartiality, instead of complying  with the unreasonable demand of the United States.    E. Balanandan, Politburo member of the C.C. [Central  Committee], Communist Party of India (Marxist), in his statement  June 5 referred to the U.S. act of inveigling even the UN  Security Council and the IAEA in its campaign against the DPRK,  ignoring the unique status of the DPRK after it temporarily  suspended the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the  Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty. He demanded that the United  Nations renounce the double-standard policy and approach the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula on the principles of  respect for sovereignty and impartiality.    E.K. Ganguli, director of the Asia-Pacific regional office  of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in an interview with  the KCNA correspondent in India June 5, denounced the anti-DPRK  campaign of the United States and its followers and strongly  urged that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be  solved fairly through talks between the DPRK and the United  States.    D.P. Maheshwari, chairman of the Indian Federation for World  Cooperation and Cultural Relations, in an interview with the  KCNA correspondent in New Delhi June 6 condemned as dastardly  the acts of the United States in refusing to come out to  third-round talks with the DPRK, kicking up a clamorous row for  pressure against the DPRK on the basis of a unilateral and  biased report submitted by some members of the IAEA Secretariat  without so much as a study of the Korean-style method of reactor  core refueling at the experimental atomic power plant.    A tough measure cannot be a solution to the issue, he said,  adding that the U.S. imperialists should draw a proper lesson  from the ignominious defeat it sustained in the Korean war and  act with discretion.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall SHORT-DATED D-Mark fut-ures fell back sharply yesterday after a Bundesbank council member was reported to have said that the time was not ripe for cuts in official German interest rates, writes James Blitz. Money market dealers were clearly expecting today's Bundesbank council meeting to reduce the Lombard and discount rates, which currently stand at 9.00 and 8.00 per cent respectively, by 50 basis points. Three-month German cash continued to hover at around 7.75 per cent, a good 1/2 percentage point below the level at which the Bundesbank offers cash to commercial banks in its weekly securities repurchase tender. However, Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank council member, was reported to have told a financial news agency that the Bundesbank should not lower rates while inflation remains stubbornly high. His comment spoiled the generally optimistic mood in Germany, and the June Euromark contract retreated 6 basis points to close at 93.18. The mood in the German money market in the run-up to today's council meeting has certainly not been promising. Money market conditions remain tight because of the introduction of minimum reserve requirements. German call money yest-erday came down to 8.50 per cent, from 8.60 per cent earlier in the day, after the Bundesbank injected a net DM16.4bn into the market. The allocation was described by some dealers as generous, but others pointed out that it was rather meagre when other factors were taken into account. The recent issue of short-term bills - or Bulis - and the tax collection season have removed a lot of liquidity from the market. In sterling markets, the June futures contract remained under strong pressure following the UK chancellor's indication in the Budget that the level of British base rates was consistent with economic recovery. The June contract ended at 94.29, some 6 basis points down from its previous finish. At this level it is pricing three-month money in the summer at 5.71 per cent. Three-month cash closed yesterday at 5 15/16 per cent, unchanged on the day. Tight liquidity conditions in the discount market pushed the overnight rate as high as 30 per cent at one stage.</p>

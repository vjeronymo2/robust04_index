			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong growth at Canadian bank Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth-largest bank, had a strong second quarter and said the economy was continuing to recover, particularly in Ontario, its main market. Net profit for the three months ended April 30 was CDollars 158m (USDollars 114.4m) or 50 cents a share, down slightly from the first quarter, but up from CDollars 90m or 27 cents a share a year earlier. Return on assets was 0.69 per cent (0.45 per cent) and on equity 12.7 per cent (7.5 per cent). Average earning assets rose 11 per cent to CDollars 85.5bn. Loan quality continued to improve, but the loss estimate remains unchanged at CDollars 450m for fiscal 1994 - CDollars 112m was charged to the second quarter. Other income rose 24 per cent, with strengths in brokerage commissions, investment management fees, swap trading and foreign exchange revenues. Non-interest expense was up 13 per cent, mainly because of expansion in the bank's securities business. Productivity ratio was stable. First-half net profit was CDollars 326m or CDollars 1.02 a share against CDollars 170m or 51 cents a share (before a restructuring charge). Return on assets was 0.71 per cent (0.23 per cent) and on equity 13.1 per cent (3.4 per cent). Total assets at April 30 were CDollars 93.4bn, up 13 per cent on the year.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pittard hit by higher sheepskin prices SHARPLY HIGHER sheepskin prices hit profits at Pittard Garner, the leather company, which yesterday reported a 16 per cent drop at the pre-tax level to Pounds 1.76m for the year to December 31. Mr David McDonald, chairman, said the price of sheepskins had almost doubled between September and December. This was partly due to the effects of devaluation which made UK sheepskin more attractive to foreign buyers, consequently driving up the price. He said, however, there would be a benefit from devaluation in the current year. Sales in the year fell just 1 per cent to Pounds 96.8m. However, after the disposal or closure of the fellmongery and tanning businesses, continuing operations showed a 5 per cent growth in turnover. Having warned at the interim stage that trading would be difficult, Mr McDonald said second half profits had been 'a disappointing setback'. The clothing and chamois division had suffered operating losses of about Pounds 900,000 amid weak demand. Nevertheless, Pittard was committed to this division in the long-term, he said. The gloving division increased sales and operating profits by 10 per cent on the back of better overseas sales. The shoe and leather goods operation showed a 25 per cent increase in profit, although Mr McDonald said 1991 had been depressed by losses from the tanning business, now closed. On a comparable basis profits were maintained at similar levels. The final dividend is held at 1.5p, for a total of 2p (1.5p). Earnings fell from 6.4p to 4.7p per share.</p>

In a press statement, al-Fahum said we emphasized more than  once the importance of coordination with all Arab countries,  especially Syria, in order to attain the just and comprehensive  peace we want. However, the PLO's influential leadership  continues to offer concessions to an enemy that does not want  peace, but works to impose capitulation on the PLO.    Al-Fahum urged the PLO leadership to stop its policy of  relinquishment and to cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements so it  will be able to work for Palestinian national unity and to  restore coordination with the Arab countries, especially Syria,  and to continue the struggle to attain the Palestinian people's  right to return, self-determination, and to set up their  independent state on their national soil.</p>

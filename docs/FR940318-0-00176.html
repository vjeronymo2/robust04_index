			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency's basis for proposing to restrict use of HCFC&hyph;141b is that this compound has a comparatively high ODP_0.11. This is the highest ODP of all the HCFCs; in fact, the ODP for HCFC&hyph;141b is nearly equal to the ODP for MCF (0.12). For this reason, the Agency concludes that replacing MCF with HCFC&hyph;141b is unacceptable, since using HCFC&hyph;141b in place of MCF would not provide the environmental benefits that the phase-out was designed to achieve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To analyze the impacts from use of HCFC&hyph;141b as a CFC&hyph;113 replacement, the Agency estimated HCFC&hyph;141b use over time in each of the cleaning end uses, and projected health effects due to ozone depletion with the help of the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework model. The modeling period starts in 1990 and measures health effects expected for people born before 2030.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The findings of this modeling show adverse health effects of the magnitude commonly associated with the use of ozone-depleting compounds. For example, in the case of metals cleaning, the Agency projected that use of HCFC&hyph;141b to replace MCF where technically feasible could yield approximately 40,000 additional skin cancer cases and approximately 1,000 additional skin cancer fatalities compared to use of non-ozone-depleting substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that these figures and the availability of superior substitutes as described in the section on acceptable substitutes justify the proposal to list HCFC&hyph;141b as an unacceptable substitute. The Agency believes that, in almost all applications, other solvent cleaning substitutes are available that meet industry performance and safety criteria. To reach its decision on HCFC&hyph;141b use, the Agency also took into account the cost of other alternatives. The analysis suggested that, although HCFC&hyph;141b can be used with modification to existing equipment, the capital costs for the retrofit and the materials costs in combination would be so high as to render other alternatives comparatively affordable, even though they require new equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;141b will be restricted as a substitute only where other alternatives exist to CFC&hyph;113 for the application in question. Several companies have already contacted the Agency, indicating that they have tested available alternatives to CFC&hyph;113, and that in some cases only HCFC&hyph;141b meets performance or safety criteria. The most commonly cited reasons for needing to use HCFC&hyph;141b are either applications where a non-flammable solvent is required or where sensitive parts could be destroyed by use of other cleaning systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these applications of HCFC&hyph;141b, the Agency may find that the uses are acceptable subject to limitations if it determines that these critical uses persist beyond the grandfathering period provided in the listing. For EPA to issue a narrowed use acceptability listing, companies who believe they may need to use HCFC&hyph;141b past the effective date must first contact EPA, since the Agency has not yet received any indication from users of a technical need to use HCFC&hyph;141b past the grandfathering period granted under the unacceptability listing. Narrowed use acceptability listings are described in more detail in section VII. of the Preamble. Companies interested in submitting a SNAP application for a narrowed use are encouraged to contact the Agency at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of the grandfathering period. Companies that intend to use HCFC&hyph;141b within the parameters of the final unacceptability listing and who will cease using HCFC&hyph;141b after the expiration of the grandfathering period need not contact the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the decision to restrict HCFC&hyph;141b use as a CFC&hyph;113/MCF substitute for metals cleaning will have little effect on industry since few vendors of HCFC&hyph;141b have been selling HCFC&hyph;141b as a metals cleaning substitute. Companies in this end use sector that want to replace CFC&hyph;113 with HCFC&hyph;141b and use it beyond the date described in this SNAP determination should review the section referenced above. The Agency expects to receive few such requests, however, since most metals cleaning is currently performed with MCF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Electronics cleaning. (a) HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends. HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends are unacceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in electronics cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations to be granted by EPA, if necessary, as CFC&hyph;113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective date for this prohibition is 30 days after the date of the final rule for new equipment (including retrofits made after the effective date) and January 1, 1996 for existing equipment. The structure and reasons for this unacceptability listing are the same as those for the decision on HCFC&hyph;141b as a metals cleaning substitute. As in the metals cleaning sector, the Agency will grant narrowed use acceptability listings in limited cases for use beyond the grandfathering period of the listing, as necessary. As discussed earlier in this action in section VI.B., the Agency is authorized to grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate under the four-part test established in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra Club  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  supra.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has conducted the four analyses required under this test, and it has concluded that the balance of equities favors a grandfathering period of two years for existing equipment in this application. The prohibition set forth in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established practice, as use of the substitute was allowed previously. Existing users of HCFC&hyph;141b who switched from class I substances into this solvent invested in this substitute on the assumption that it would be considered an acceptable substitute. It would impose a severe economic burden on these users to prohibit their use of the substitute immediately, with no provision of time to allow them to recover their investment in existing equipment or acquire new equipment in a timely fashion. These factors taken together appear to outweigh any statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately to existing users, especially since the restriction would apply immediately to new equipment using HCFC&hyph;141b, which would serve to prevent further ozone depletion from use of HCFC&hyph;141b in this application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with metals cleaning applications for HCFC&hyph;141b, the Agency modeled potential HCFC&hyph;141b use in electronics cleaning applications over time, and projected health effects due to ozone depletion with the help of the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework model. For electronics cleaning, the maximum market penetration for HCFC&hyph;141b as a replacement for CFC&hyph;113 is 90 percent. With this penetration, the model predicted approximately 400 additional skin cancer fatalities and 30,000 additional skin cancer cases compared to uses of non-ozone-depleting substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Precision cleaning. (a) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends are unacceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning, with acceptability subject to narrowed use limitations to be granted by EPA, if necessary, as CFC&hyph;113 replacements after the effective date of this listing. The effective date for this listing is 30 days after the date of the final rule for new equipment and as of January 1, 1996, for existing equipment. The structure and reasons for this decision are described in the section on metals cleaning. As discussed earlier in this action in section VI.B., the Agency is authorized to grandfather existing uses from a prohibition where appropriate under the four-part test established in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sierra Club  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  supra.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has conducted the four analyses required under this test, and it has concluded that the balance of equities favors a grandfathering period of two years for existing equipment in this application. The prohibition set forth in this action clearly represents a departure from previously established practice, as use of the substitute was allowed previously.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Russian Economics Minister  Aleksandr Shokhin today informed the Council of the Federation,  the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, on the government's  plans concerning the budget, taxes, crediting, and the  agricultural policy.    This item on the council's agenda has triggered rather keen  debates. The council wanted the prime minister to personally  deliver a report on the government's policy and to answer their  questions.    Speaker of the Council of the Federation Vladimir Shumeyko  told the MPs that Premier Chernomyrdin was expected to chair a  meeting of the government today and then fly to Minsk. This  triggered a heated discussion and the speaker was asked to begin  "immediate talks" with the head of the Russian Government. It  was moved to delete the item from the agenda if the premier  refused to deliver the report. The government was blamed of  disrespect for the upper chamber of the parliament.    Chairman of the Karelian Supreme Soviet Viktor Stepanov  urged  his colleagues "not to stir up passions around the government"  and to hear the economics minister's information, as proposed by  the government, and then, possessing concrete data, to hear a  report by the prime minister himself. After several futile  votes, the deputies decided by a roll-call vote to meet  Chernomyrdin at any time suiting him today.    The discussion was interrupted by the arrival of Shokhin,  who  took the floor and informed the deputies on the government's  plans. He stressed that the main trend of the budget policy  would be to toughen financial discipline. The high rates of  inflation during the past month "is not a result of the  government's January policy, but of earlier decisions, and also  of the political situation in mid-January, provoked by growing  inflation".    The economics minister recalled that it was necessary to  complete the privatisation process before July 1st, and to think  over the next stage of privatisation, over the "effective use of  joint-stock property".    In the sphere of social policy, the government plans to  check  the dropping living standards and to stabilise them. It is  necessary to render effective support to concrete sections of  the population. Shokhin admitted that the scope of latent  unemployment was sufficiently large, noting that it was  impermissible to stop enterprises in several sectors of the  economy.    Touching on the problem of the rouble zone, the minister  stressed that the merger of the currencies of cis countries  should not be detrimental to Russia. He noted that firm  negotiations were being conducted with Belarus, "marked by  sufficiently comprehensive and tough quantitative demands".    The upper chamber of the Russian parliament took note of the  minister's information.</p>

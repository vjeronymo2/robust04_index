			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHERMAN SMASHES EDISON RUSHING RECORD  </P> <P> Edison High School tailback Shane Sherman can give you 1,091 reasons why he  shattered a school rushing record Friday night that had stood for nine seasons.  </P> <P> The five starters on Edison's offensive line average 200 pounds per man, and  behind their 1,091 pounds of bulk, Sherman carried 31 times for 307 yards --  the seventh-highest rushing total in Orange County history. Edison easily  defeated host St. John Bosco, 48-27.  </P> <P> "I'm absolutely overwhelmed," said Sherman, who shattered the mark of 238  yards, which was set by Kerwin Bell in 1979 against Pius X.  </P> <P> "But the credit goes to the blockers. Everyone -- the line and the receivers --  blocked great."  </P> <P> Sherman sat out the fourth quarter of the game, after Edison had the victory  wrapped up. He had gained 185 yards in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Sherman scored four touchdowns on runs of one, six, and 53 yards. And he scored  on a 12-yard pass from quarterback Donnie Smith.  </P> <P> Sherman's longest runs were of 53 and 52 yards.  </P> <P> Edison (3-2) begins league play next week against Huntington Beach (4-1) at  Orange Coast College.

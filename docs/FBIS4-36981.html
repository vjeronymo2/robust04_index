			<p>BFN     [Text] The two-day AICC-I [All India Congress Committee-I]  session has concluded with a call to find technology which can  produce quality goods in the small-scale sector. Addressing the  concluding session this evening in New Delhi, the party  president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, said this is necessary for  adopting Gandhian philosophy in the present context and to  overcome the problem of social costs associated with this  industry. He called upon the developed countries to join hands  with developing nations in this campaign and said such programs  should be innovative and time bound.    Making a dig at the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] for its  demand that India should go nuclear, Mr. Rao reiterated that the  country would keep its options open. The decision will be based  on disarmament trends in the world. We cannot play with weapons  of mass destruction, he observed. Mr. Rao said there can be no  question of one upmanship in this matter. He charged some  political parties with misleading the people over the issue.  Mr. Narasimha Rao underlined the need for strengthening the  party's setup at the village level in a time bound manner. The  Congress-I president said that the practice of giving party  tickets to the relatives of leaders should be stopped as it has  created resentment among the rank and file.</p>

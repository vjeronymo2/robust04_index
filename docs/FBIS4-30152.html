			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 23 (OANA/ANTARA) -- President Suharto  here Thursday called on the people to be aware of the nation's  diversity, but not to exaggerate the nation's differences.    "We should not exaggerate differences existing among us. We  should not forget that we are committed to being a united  nation. Our slogan is unity in diversity. We are diverse but  are determined to be united," the president said.    Receiving students from the fourth course of the National  Defence Institute (Lemhanas) at the Bina Graha Presidential  Office, the head of state said that the main challenges being  faced by Indonesia are issues regarding human rights, openness,  democratization, and the environment.    "Human rights, openness, democratization, and environmental  issues could be abused to create unrest at home," Suharto said.    If this happened, he added, it would threaten national  development and weaken national stability.    The president was accompanied by Defense and Security  Minister Edi Sudrajat and Lemhanas Governor Lt. Gen. Mutoyib.    He said the challenges facing Indonesia from outside are the  negative impacts of economic globalization and the penetration  of foreign cultures due to sophisticated technology and  information systems.    Lemhanas Governor Mutoyib reported earlier that the Lemhanas  course began on February 5 and would last until June 25. It is  being attended by 95 participants, including 39 senior armed  forces officers and officials from government departments,  non-governmental agencies, and social organisations.    President Suharto told the course participants that it is  the  duty of a leader to change a challenge into an opportunity, a  weakness into a strength and to explain to the people what is  happening around them.    "The duty of a leader is difficult to carry out if the  relevant parties do not provide support. Therefore, a leader  must have a wide horizon and a mature personality" Suharto said.</p>

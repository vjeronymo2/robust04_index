			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / CrossRail revival backed by 130 MPs Plans to revive a bill promoting the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail project were boosted yesterday when it was announced that more than 130 MPs have put their names to a motion backing the plan. Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury, said he expected to table a motion early next week calling for the private bill committee to look again at the proposal to build an east-west underground rail link. CrossRail, which has the backing of British Rail and London Underground, suffered a surprise rejection last month when the four-strong committee of MPs turned it down. The route did not include links with the Channel tunnel rail link or the Heathrow Express. 'Replies are still coming in and I am optimistic we will have a lot more names by the beginning of next week,' said Mr Lidington. 'We have obtained unprecedented cross-party support.' In an unusual move, Conservative whips have given permission for parliamentary private secretaries, who as part of the government 'payroll vote' normally do not get involved, to sign the motion. Its backers include seven Liberal Democrat MPs, with the remainder split equally among Conservatives and Labour. Mr Lidington said backing had come from across the country. Senior figures supporting the motion include Sir Peter Hordern, chairman of the public accounts commission, Mr John Watts, chairman of the Treasury select committee; Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922 backbench committee; Mr John Prescott, Labour employment spokesman; and Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman.</p>

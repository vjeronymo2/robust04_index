			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen </F> Ivanov]    [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- In the near future a specially  convened "council of professionals" will adopt an official  decision on Russia's creation of a new cosmodrome in the Far  East. One can evidently bank on a positive decision on this  problem after the Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his  support for the idea of the creation of a space test-range  during his visit to Blagoveshchensk.    The sum of four trillion rubles specified by Boris Yeltsin  as  being necessary to upgrade the former missile division at  Svobodnyy is the equivalent of approximately $2 billion dollars,  while the continued operation of Baykonur for 20 years on the  terms of its lease from Kazakhstan will cost 2.3 billion. If one  considers that in its version of the lease agreement for  Baykonur Kazakhstan has raised the price of its lease to $480  million a year, 2 billion will be "run up" in just a few years.    In addition at the expiry of the period of lease the  Kazakhstan side will be left with all the launching pads, since  there is no question of the equipment being dismantled and  removed. A number of experts consider therefore that it would  be more beneficial to invest the same funds into the creation of  Russia's own cosmodrome within its own territory, since it is  hardly likely that anyone could make territorial claims on Amur  Oblast.    The oblast itself is according to Vladimir Polevanov, its  head of administration, "all for the cosmodrome." Indeed  Svobodnyy-18 could right now accept 10,000 people to start its  full-scale construction. In all the space port would provide  56,000 people with jobs.    Meanwhile, prior to the convening of the "council of  professionals", which will involve designers, producers and  operators of space rocket equipment, planning work is already  under way at Svobodnyy-18 to upgrade the rocket silos for the  launching of Rokot carrier-rockets, the first of which is due to  be launched in early 1996.</p>

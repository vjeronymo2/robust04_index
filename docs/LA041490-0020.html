			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDS OF TRADE SWITCH DIRECTION  </P> <P> If there is still anyone who thinks the Kings made a horrible deal in trading  Bernie Nicholls for Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato, it's evident they don't  know a thing about hockey.  </P> <P> Contrary to what most of the critics have been muttering, it will probably go  down as the second-best trade in Kings' history. (If you have to ask what the  first was, then you probably don't have an opinion to begin with.)  </P> <P> DAN BURNETT, Glendora  </P></p>

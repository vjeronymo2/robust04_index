			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial: "Boosting Small Businesses"] </F>   [Text] The process of making concrete the commitment to  boost small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia will  continue. In its Technical Working Meeting at Cipayung, Bogor,  the Functional Group [GOLKAR] proposed the establishment of a  guaranty board and a loan fund ("guarantee fund") to channel  bank credit to small and medium-sized businesses. The largest of  the sociopolitical organizations also proposed that from 1 to 5  percent of the profits of state-owned businesses be set aside  for small businesses and cooperatives.    Naturally, this is good news for small and medium-sized  businesses, which encompass about 34.4 million adults. GOLKAR's  proposal represents a further concrete commitment to help small  and medium-sized businesses. The proposal is probably not a  coincidence and represents another of the steps taken by the  government to strengthen the status of small and medium-sized  businesses in the country.    GOLKAR clearly was also awakened by the fact this these  groups needing help are still having problems in getting credit  from banks. Bank credits flow more easily to big businesses.    In a seminar in Jakarta at the end of April, which was  attended by operators of about a thousand small and medium-sized  businesses throughout the country, complaints were heard about  the stiff requirements imposed by banks. The businessmen feel  they are treated as stepchildren, and they recognize the fact  that bank credits flow more smoothly to big businesses. GOLKAR  possibly was motivated by hearing those grievances.    The government views small and medium-sized businesses as  strategic groups. Through them, the government is expanding  prosperity. These groups have special features. For example,  they absorb large numbers of workers. Furthermore, they adapt  better to economic recession than the big businesses owned by  the "big shot" industrialists. They also more easily act as  subcontractors to big businesses.    For the takeoff phase, the government apparently is not  depending only on big businesses but is counting on the role of  small and medium-sized businesses. In some countries, there is  controversy about who will be relied upon for the takeoff phase:  Will it be big business only, or will small businesses be  involved, too? In Indonesia, the government sees the role of  small and medium-sized businesses as important.    The government has taken a variety of steps to boost these  groups. One of the steps was Presidential Decision No. 16/1994,  which gave them opportunities for access to markets. It says  that about 10 percent of the total value of government  expenditures will be used to buy products from small-and  medium-scale businesses. Total government expenditures are now  estimated at 20 trillion rupiah. When this provision is carried  out, these groups will be truly helped.    Many countries have in fact established special institutions  to channel credits to small and medium-sized businesses.  Thailand, for example, has long had such an institution, and the  results have been very satisfying. In other words, credit is  obtained more smoothly by small businesses, without anyone  exercising any effort to make it difficult.    The recent reports of unpaid loans on the part of big  businesses should open our eyes to the fact that big businesses  do not always repay bank credits promptly. As far as we have  observed, one of the reasons banks are reluctant to extend  credit to small and medium-sized businesses is the assumption  that big businesses, because of their strong capital positions,  will more quickly repay the credits they obtain. Action against  big businesses that abuse credit is a must, but it would be wise  for us to use the moment to realize again the strategic role  played by small and medium-sized businesses.    In this connection, the words that Minister of Finance  Mari'e  Muhammad spoke at the GOLKAR technical working meeting at  Cipayung are very relevant, namely that it would be  "unthinkable" for the government to continue to give protection  to big businesses. The minister of finance said, however, that  it would be "objectionable" for small and medium-sized  businesses to be given unlimited protection.    The position of taking the side of the small and weak is a  humanitarian law of ethics. To take the side of small and  medium-sized businesses does not mean ostracizing big  businesses. The sociological reality that the small constitute  the largest group is a strong reason for taking their side. We  welcome GOLKAR's determination to take concrete action to  strengthen small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia.</p>

The watchword will be "a tougher opposition," and to this end  the People's Party leadership has decided to focus its line on  corruption and the government's economic failure, making it  clear that "the person responsible is Felipe Gonzalez," People's  Party leadership sources told LA VANGUARDIA.    The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] congress will  mark  the turning point for the definitive change of strategy, since  they wish to prevent Gonzalez from "capitalizing on the closing  of ranks around him" that could occur, and to this end Jose  Maria Aznar and the main party leaders will touch on matters of  corruption and economic failure.    According to the sources consulted, an instance of the  change  of strategy will be the speech that the People's Party chairman  will deliver at the convention to be held by the party in  Torremolinos 26 March, which will be the starting signal for the  preliminary campaign for the European and Andalusian elections,  and an event that will be attended by several European leaders.  However, it will be in the opposition leader's speech in the  state-of-the-nation debate scheduled for 12 April that Aznar  will deliver an all-out criticism of the government and, more  specifically, of Felipe Gonzalez -- in contrast to his recent  speeches in the house.    Again according to the People's Party leadership sources we  consulted, corruption is crucial in the situation that the  country is experiencing, and they now believe that "it was a  mistake" not to raise the issue in the last television debate  between Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar on the eve of the  general election, after they had based much of their campaign on  condemning government corruption.  <H5>  Process of Decomposition </H5>   The People's Party leadership believes that "this issue is  ours" and they cannot remove it from their line, "giving the  impression that there has been some kind of shady deal with the  government to cover everything up," although Aznar has already  begun to raise this issue, to which he did not refer for many  months. For instance, at a public meeting held in Alcazar de  San Juan in Ciudad Real yesterday, he said that "the country is  experiencing a process of decomposition that Felipe Gonzalez is  unable to halt," and that "every day we come across a new  scandal." The People's Party will try to take advantage of the  committees of inquiry that have now been set up in the Congress  [of Deputies] -- especially the one dealing with the Roldan  affair and Banesto [Credit Bank of Spain] -- or the appearances  that could take place with respect to the confidential funds,  "which are already tainting the Moncloa Palace."    This new strategy will also differ in procedures. Aznar, who  has not met with Felipe Gonzalez since 28 December, "does not  intend to do so" until the elections, which will mark for the  People's Party the time to decide whether to try to bring about  a change of government, if the Socialists lose the elections.    For that reason, the same sources assert, nor will  photographs of People's Party and PSOE leaders negotiating the  democratic impetus be repeated. This does not mean that there  will not be talks. The two parties' spokesmen in the Congress  -- Rodrigo Rato and Carlos Solchaga -- "are talking," but they  will do so not publicly, "but as we have always done, and always  making it clear that one side is in power and the other side in  opposition."    These negotiations will be confined to renewing the  institutions: "This is normal; there had to be an agreement  between the PSOE and the People's Party to renew other bodies in  the previous legislative term, too." The aim is "not to give  the impression that there is an understanding between government  and opposition," since there is none.    The key to these talks will be the renewal of the Spanish  Radio and Television Company board, without which, the People's  Party asserts, "there will be no agreement for the other  institutions." According to the same sources, although the two  parties' stances are very far apart right now, "there could be  an agreement next week." The problems lie in the fact that  while the People's Party wants the number of board members it  proposes "to be the same as that for the PSOE-CiU [Convergence  and Union] coalition," the Socialists utterly reject this stance.</p>

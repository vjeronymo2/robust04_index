			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For price-to-price comparisons only, we also made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made no adjustment for freight charge differentials claimed by Roldan because of the lack of data on the record concerning the nature of the adjustment claimed. We intend to obtain further information and to verify the reported data. We will revisit this issue in our final determination based on verification findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Acenor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of calculating FMV, we used the sales from Acenor to its unrelated customers and CV, as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on packed, ex-factory and delivered prices, where applicable. We made an adjustment for home market inland freight (including inland insurance), where applicable, under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a), as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We re-calculated home market and U.S. credit expenses because Acenor reported its U.S. imputed credit expense in pesetas and its calculation overstated this expense because of an error in decimal placement. In addition, for those sales with missing shipment dates and payment dates, we calculated credit expenses based on the average payment period for the respondent's sales reported with shipment and payment dates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For price-to-price comparisons only, we also made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.

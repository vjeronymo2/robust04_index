			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report SILVER set a life-of-contract low at 355 cents a troy ounce on Comex in early trading after speculative selling by commodity funds. Comex warehouse silver stocks were up 2m ounces at 272m ounces. Further support was pegged at 350 and then 340 cents. 'Silver's actually looking quite interesting now, it's quite healthy to have a shake-out now and again and should encourage the buyers to emerge at these lower levels,' one London dealer said. New York arabica COFFEE futures were bolstered in early trading by low delivery notices against the March contract. London COCOA futures edged higher as international cocoa agreement talks got under way in Geneva (see above). The market could be poised to make another attempt to breach key resistance around Pounds 745 for the May contract. Trading in LME BASE METALS was dull, with light downside pressure in all markets barring ZINC. There is little in the way of news to fan interest in the market at present, while physical activity remains fairly low key. Compiled from Reuters</p>

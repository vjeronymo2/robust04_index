			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Shaul Eisenberg: Correction An article published in the Financial Times on December 8 incorrectly stated that Mr Shaul Eisenberg of the Eisenberg group of companies had recently hosted a visit to Israel by the governor of Jiangsu province, China. Mr Eisenberg actually hosted the governor of Jiangxi province. Furthermore, Mr Eisenberg points out that his United Development Incorporated has had discussions about the possibility of co-operating with Burger King to open a chain of restaurants in China but has not won the franchise as we reported. Detailed negotiations have not yet begun, Mr Eisenberg says.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Tarmac chief to be TML co-chairman MR JOE DWYER, chief executive of construction group Wimpey, will later this week stand down as the British co-chairman of Transmanche Link (TML), the Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel. He will be succeeded by Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, one of the five British members of TML which also has five French members. TML is locked in a row with Eurotunnel, the project's operator, over which of them should pay for the large rise in building costs. Wimpey said that when Mr Dwyer took the job he indicated that he would stay for about a year. He had done this and now wanted to con-centrate on running Wimpey. The consortium said Mr Simms would continue to represent the best interest of contractors. There would be no softening in the campaign to get Eurotunnel to pay for changes in design and contract conditions which had pushed up the price of the job. Negotiations between TML and Eurotunnel have ground to a halt. Wimpey said Mr Dwyer might have remained longer if talks had been continuing and if he had felt that there was a chance of a settlement. Eurotunnel said it was being held to ransom by contractors over the Tunnel's opening date, which has already been delayed by at least seven months compared with an original target date of May 15 this year.</p>

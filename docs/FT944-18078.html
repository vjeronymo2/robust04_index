			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's wipes the slate Yesterday's judgment in favour of the Gooda Walker names represents an overdue mucking out of a very dirty Lloyd's of London stable. There is considerable uncertainty about the amount of money that Gooda Walker names will eventually receive, but the ruling should pave the way for settlement of at least some of the outstanding litigation against Lloyd's. The eventual payout will be borne substantially by other Lloyd's names who provided errors and omissions cover to those now found negligent. This does not necessarily mean fresh calls on the Lloyd's market, as most of the expected losses have already been provided for. The judgment will probably accelerate the exodus of individual names from the market, but potential corporate investors will recognise that the ruling relates to the past. The new Lloyd's offers rather appealing prospects for those convinced that the market has made a clean break with its recent history. For the 1993 financial year, Lloyd's is expected to make a profit of Pounds 800m-Pounds 1bn. The worst underwriters at Lloyd's have been driven out. Those that remain are highly selective in taking on new risks: the market's capacity will only be about 75 per cent utilised this year. Lloyd's biggest problem is that it must still set up reinsurance to cover pre-1986 risks, primarily on US asbestos and pollution claims. Investors may be unwilling to commit substantial new capital until the new arrangements are in place at the end of next year.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P target of corporate analysis THE Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket group majority owned by Germany's Tengelmann retailing group, is to be the first company targeted by New York state's large pension fund in a campaign against poorly performing management. New York's move represents a significant advance by the US movement for better corporate governance, which seeks to give shareholders a greater say in the affairs of companies with weak results. Until now, action by institutional investors against such companies has been led most vociferously by the Dollars 71bn California Public Employee Retirement System. New York, is becoming more publicly aggressive as it has developed a computer-based system to track the financial performance of top US companies. Mr Edward Regan, Comptroller of New York state, said yesterday the Dollars 56bn pension fund would vote against the election of A&amp;P's slate of directors at its annual meeting in July. It would also seek the support of other shareholders for an amendment to the company's by-laws which would force it to include in its annual proxy or shareholder voting material statements from large shareholders wishing to comment on the group's performance. The fund owns 260,000 of A&amp;P's 38.2m shares outstanding. Tengelmann's 53 per cent ownership of the chain means New York's campaign cannot succeed without the support of the German company, and this seems unlikely. But the state's stance, if followed by other institutions, could send a powerful message of shareholder dissatisfaction. It is an accident of timing that A&amp;P is the first company to be targeted under the state's recently-completed corporate performance analysis system, which has compiled data on 900 of the largest US companies. However, Mr Regan said A&amp;P was not only 'an underperformer, but its response to deal with its problems and improve its long-term outlook is anaemic and unacceptable.'</p>

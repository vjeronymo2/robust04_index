			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAVRATILOVA DESPERATE FOR VICTORY ON CLAY COURT  </P> <P> Top-seeded Martina Navratilova says she needs to win on clay if she is going to  wrest the No. 1 women's tennis ranking from Steffi Graf.  </P> <P> But Navratilova, who has not won a clay court tournament in nearly two years,  is not making any predictions about this week's $500,000 Family Circle Magazine  Cup, where she is the top seed.  </P> <P> "I'm not looking down the road too far. I've just got to get back and think  about every match," she said after defeating Halle Cioffi 6-2, 6-1 Tuesday in  the second round of the event.  </P> <P> Navratilova was to return to action today against Isabel Cueto, the No. 12  seed. The No. 2 seed -- Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario -- opens play in the tournament  against Mary Lou Daniels.  </P> <P> Katerina Maleeva of Bulgaria defeated Linda Harvey-Wild of Hawthorn Woods,  Ill., 6-1, 6-2 today in a second-round match. Maleeva, ranked 10th in the world  and seeded fifth in this event, had a first-round bye, and Harvey-Wild easily  won her opening match 6-0, 6-1 over Hellas Ter Riet.  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati was scheduled to play a second-round match later today  against Angeliki Kanellopoulou of Greece.  </P> <P> Navratilova said her toughest competition this time is "my next round. I can  have stiff competition from a lot of people. A lot of players are good on this  stuff, and they play on it more than I do."  </P></p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Observer: Falling standards Never before has John Major, leader of Britain's least popular big political party, spoken so frankly about his thoughts on everything from formula one grand prix racing to Britain's female cricketing team and the rush to buy new L-registered cars. In happier times, the prime minister's column in yesterday's News of the World might have been tagged a world exclusive. However this label was reserved for fresh insights into footballer Paul Gascoigne's love life. It is not the first time that down-at-luck Tory politicians have tried to communicate with the masses by standing in for regular NoW columnist, Lord Woodrow - voice of reason - Wyatt. Indeed, Lady Thatcher once did it. But it is hard to believe that she would have allowed her contribution to be upstaged by a tubby footballer's reminiscences of how a 'chocolate Teddy girl tried to tempt me from my Sheryl'. Meanwhile, Observer hopes that Norman Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer, will be given a chance of using the NoW to get a few things off his chest before his old chum Lord Wyatt returns on September 5.</p>

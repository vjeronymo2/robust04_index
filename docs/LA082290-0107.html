			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> FREE PARKING ENDS IN PIERSIDE AREA  </P> <P> The hub of the city's downtown redevelopment center, which this summer has  begun opening one building at a time, on Tuesday was officially christened a  new shopping and entertainment district.  </P> <P> That is, the city began charging for parking.  </P> <P> Parking in the Main Promenade Parking Structure, which had been free since it  opened a week ago, now costs up to $5 a day.  </P> <P> The parking structure on Main Street between Walnut and Olive avenues serves  shops, restaurants and theaters that have begun opening in the Pierside  Pavilion, a cornerstone of the area's redevelopment project.  </P> <P> Non-validated parking now costs from $1 for one hour or less to $5 for four or  more hours. The charge drops to a flat $1 rate at night.  </P> <P> Many of the businesses in the area will offer patrons discount validation  stickers. During an unspecified introductory period, validated parking will be  free for up to two hours, and $1 for each additional hour. The city charges  Pierside Pavilion tenants 25 cents for each validation sticker.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday approved the rates, after lengthy discussions  between city officials and business representatives. City officials estimate  the parking fees will bring the city $297,000 in revenue a year. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S Unit Trust replaces manager MARKS and Spencer Unit Trust Management, the unit trust arm of the clothing retailer, said it has replaced one of its three quantitative fund management companies with a manager offering a traditional stock selection approach. Some leading pension fund consultants have recently been urging clients to consider selecting managers with contrasting styles to avoid a concentration of investment in a single type of stock or sector. Mr Robert Colville, managing director of M&amp;S Unit Trust Management Ltd, said the shift occurred in the company's UK Selection Portfolio with Pounds 220m in assets which invests exclusively in UK equities. Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford has replaced Delaware International Advisers as investment managers of 30 per cent of the assets effective October 1. The two other managers are BZW Investment Management - which uses quantitive techniques to invest in a portfolio of stocks that matches the FT-A All Share Index - and GMO Woolley - which uses quantitative techniques to pick so-called value stocks. Delaware had been using quantitative techniques to develop so-called dividend discount models. 'We are conscious of too great a similarity in the management styles of Delaware and the other two investment managers', Mr Colville said. While performance of all three managers has been very good over the past 18 months, a recent analysis of equities in all three portfolios showed a heavy concentration in what are regarded as cyclical stocks, an exposure which he believes is unlikely to offer the best returns in the future.</p>

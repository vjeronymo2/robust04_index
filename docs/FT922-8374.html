			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Shadow boxing in the Labour ring: The leadership contest and signs of schism in opposition thinking are delaying a far-reaching post-mortem says Ivo Dawnay Just a month after its humiliating fourth successive election defeat and only days after a drubbing in the local authority polls, the Labour party is still proving fiercely resistant to deep-rooted change. A few fragile green shoots of new thinking have sprouted as to how the party should address its future. But for each there are numerous party traditionalists cautioning against further revision of long-held orthodoxies. It remains unclear whether Labour is ready, able or willing to take the steps necessary to reverse what some think might be a trajectory of permament decline - or for that matter to decide what those steps should be. Evidence of disarray came last Sunday when a tentative olive branch from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, met a chorus of public criticism from senior Labour figures. Despite this some are known privately to support the significant strand in the party now favouring a measure of inter-party collaboration. Increasingly, there are signs of a profound schism between the 'one last heavers', who advocate only a fine-tuning of policy and party institutions, and the radical reformers, some of whom want not only a Lib-Lab electoral pact but even a review of Labour's historic commitment to wealth redistribution. The traditionalists cling to Harold (now Lord) Wilson's definition of Labour's objectives as 'an irreversible shift of wealth and power in favour of working people'. But the reformers counter that such goals merely confirm an outdated Marxist world view that threatens Labour's survival. A prime example is Clause Four of Labour's constitution - the controversial commitment to state control of the means of 'production, distribution and exchange'. The traditionalists argue that to reopen the debate on what is largely now a symbolic clause would court unnecessary internal strife. Others, like Mr Frank Field MP, say that tackling such anachronisms is essential. 'Some say leave it alone as it is only symbolic. But the whole point is that the public understands symbols. That is exactly why we should discuss it.' With the election for leader and deputy leader in full swing, Mr John Smith and Mr Bryan Gould, the two contenders, are eschewing such controversies and concentrating on how best to woo the two main strands of party opinion without offending either. In consequence, the perennial struggle for party unity is postponing a root-and-branch post-mortem that addresses the reservations of the electorate. One senior frontbencher, close to the Smith camp, recently remarked that the serious rethinking of the party's future would only come in about 18 months, possibly within two years of the next general election. Two parallel though interlinked debates are now in train. The first attempts to address reforms to the party itself, in particular the role of the unions: the second centres on Labour's goals and policy agenda. Both are highly influenced by how the party interprets its recent defeats. For some, like Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general union leader, the election result was a profound disappointment but not a disaster. Labour gained more than 40 seats, he has pointed out, cut deeply into the Liberal Democrat vote and was within 1,000 votes of victory in 17 - enough to have missed a hung parliament by an ace. For that reason, he cautions calm. Union representation at the party's annual conference could be retained at a lower level, he says. It could be 'democratised' by rule changes requiring delegates to be directly elected by co-workers, free from the control of the union leadership. The union role in Labour's electoral college could go altogether. In the past four years, he argues, Labour discarded unpopular policies, but concentrated too heavily on damage limitation. Now it needs to improve presentation, get off the defensive and explain its agenda more clearly. 'Do we need a radical reappraisal of policies?' Mr Edmonds asked. 'For God's sake, what do we campaign on if we abandon an element of redistribution, support for the public services, individual workplace rights and equal opportunities?' But to the radical reformers, such prescriptions are seen as Micawberism gone mad - a recipe for further decline that fails to acknowledge the profound changes wrought by the Thatcher years. The new social landscape, they say, has sharply eroded collective loyalties and promoted individualism in a way that forces Labour to address its appeal not to the community as a whole, but direct to the citizen. They point out that in a deep recession Mr Major managed to hold the Conservative vote steady at 42 per cent, leaving Labour more than seven points adrift. To the party's horror, polls showed that the increase in its so-called core votes - council tenants, unskilled manual workers and the unemployed - was less than among affluent professional voters. Advocates of profound change say that without a reassessment of the party's paternalist view of the citizen's relationship with the state - indeed of the very nature of what a modern political party should be - Labour will end up as no more than an anachronistic pressure group for the industrial north, the Celtic fringe and the underclass. At an election post-mortem seminar, the Labour Co-ordinating Committee - a group representing reformers in the constituencies - concluded that the party was now widely identified with the vested interests of the state sector, dominated by the public sector unions. The adoption of a positive attitude towards the market and a readiness to embrace changes in the management of the welfare state were now a prerequisite for victory, it decided. 'At the moment, we make voting for Labour sound like an act of altruism,' Mr Mike Craven, the LCC secretary, said. Where, then, do the two leadership contenders stand between what might be not unfairly be caricatured as the blue-collar traditionalists and the smart-suited radicals? The answer is: catering to both. As Mr Tom Sawyer, the National Union of Public Employees deputy leader and influential head of Labour's home policy committee has put it: 'They are setting out their stalls to where they think people are, not where they think they ought to be.' Supporters of Mr Gould, the long-shot challenger, are keen to present him as both left-wing and reformist. But his differences with Mr Smith are often more of tone and style than of substance. Charges that his advocacy of devaluation represents a reversion to the outdated politics of the 1970s are firmly denied. Mr Gould insists that while he is pro-Europe he is also determined that the progress to a single currency should embrace a continent-wide debate as to how to achieve it, while also securing full employment, a minimum wage and employees' rights. All that is aimed at the old left. To the new radicals, his claim is that he has a breadth of imagination and an appeal to the south of England that Mr Smith lacks. In Mr Smith's camp, initial irritation at the audacity of Mr Gould's challenge has turned to relief. It has allowed the shadow chancellor to rebut charges that the leadership was being decided by union bosses in smoke-filled rooms. He has pledged to reduce their future role in the party more swiftly than might otherwise have been the case. To meet criticism of his tax plans from the party's reformist wing, he has offered a full-blown review of tax and benefit policy through a new Commission on Social Justice open - as would be Labour's current review of electoral systems - to other interested parties including the Liberal Democrats. Arguably more important as an indicator of his alertness to Labour's predicament are Mr Smith's observations that the challenge is to reconcile the interests of the two-thirds of society that are relatively well-off with those of the one third that is not. His analysis attempts to address the thorniest question for Labour: the resistance of modern income taxpayers to make sacrifices for the poor. Both leadership contenders veer to the radical reforming wing of the party, claiming that everything except Labour's commitment to redistribution is open to challenge. But the left-wing candidates contesting the deputy leadership, Mr John Prescott, the transport spokesman, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary, both reject as defeatist any accommodation with the Liberals or adoption of electoral reform. One front-bench critic, however, comments: 'It is all very well for Prescott to boast about how they love him in Hull; what he needs to explain is why they hate him in Harlow.' Ultimately, this question of Labour's sharply differing appeal north and south of the Wash to Severn line is far more crucial than bickering over the merits of proportional representation or the value of a deal with the Liberal Democrats even if these issues must, eventually, be addressed. Of the more prominent shadow cabinet members, only Mr Tony Blair, the shadow employment secretary, has dared raise the crucial issue of whether Labour has adequately addressed 'a tide of history' that is altering the relationship between citizen and state. The Conservatives have already laid a claim to the title of champion of consumer interests. To be credible, many believe, with Mr Blair, that Labour must leapfrog them. The best of the Kinnock legacy - the decline of dogmatic leftism and factional politics alongside the party's new-found determination to win  - have all helped build Labour's credibility. Mr Smith, as the all but certain next leader, will be well-placed to add to that achievement not least by virtue of his authoritative yet pragmatic personality. What is more, a phalanx of Labour MPs - many of them frontbenchers, Scots, or new arrivals from the April election - believe above all in preserving the unity achieved over the past five years. But in the bitterness of defeat, Labour's discipline and cohesion is again at risk. To reverse its electoral decline, the shadow chancellor must skilfully forge an alliance not merely between the 'one last heavers' and the advocates of more deep-seated change. To achieve that end and to win over millions of disenchanted Conservatives, many now believe he must abandon Mrs Beckett, his preferred candidate for deputy, and harness Mr Gould to the cause.</p>

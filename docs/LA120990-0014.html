			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: READER BEWARE  </P> <P> Variety, the show-biz weekly, was "kidding a bit" with last week's splashy,  Page 1 headline -- written in Japanese characters. So says editor Peter Bart,  who translates the headline: "Buyer Beware" -- a reference to the recent  purchase of MCA Inc. by the Osaka-based electronics firm Matsushita.  </P> <P> Bart and executive editor Caroline Miller got the idea when they heard a  reporter say she had dreamed that Variety, itself a subsidiary of a British  firm, was published all in Japanese.  </P> <P> With Matsushita's planned $6.1-billion acquisition of MCA and Sony Corp.'s  purchase of Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures last year, Japanese interests have a  stronghold in the U.S. movie business.  </P> <P> Bart says there was no intention of offending the Japanese buyers, just an  effort to follow in the tradition of the paper's much-fabled quirky headlines.  He decided not to print a translation, but to let the headline "be something  folks can discuss at their local sushi parlors."  </P> <P> Bart's interpretation of the headline, which accompanied his own article:  "Matsushita perhaps didn't consider all of the ramifications of the purchase.  There are political and cultural problems they face." David J. Fox  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the State </F> Committee for Federation and Nationalities Affairs, by Natalya  Koposova: "Sergey Shakhray: I Am a Cautious Person"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Koposova] Your style in  politics is sometimes taken as a challenge....    [Shakhray] I am generally a cautious, prudent person. And  if I act this way, it means there is a plan. Besides, I have my  own principles. I do not think politics is a dirty business.  It is just necessary that moves and actions should be public,  intelligible. [passage omitted]    [Koposova] Do you regret your openness?    [Shakhray] Why should I? My answer was really honest. I  said: "There is a time for everything." And I cited three  conditions given which one can aspire to the presidential  office. First, to be trusted by people. Second, to have  political structures nominate you. Third, you must have initial  funds for an election campaign. They singled out only one idea:  he wants to be president.    [Koposova] Some observers have gathered the impression that  you are drifting away from the president. Some, on the  contrary, continue to see you as the "president's permanent  representative." What is the real position?    [Shakhray] I do not think either are right. I set off on an  "independent voyage" on 6 May 1992.    [Koposova] But while on this "independent voyage" you  remained a "president's representative" at the Congress, at the  Constitutional Court's CPSU hearing....    [Shakhray] Nothing of the kind. I was no longer his  representative at the Congress. The whole thing at the  Constitutional Court was on a voluntary basis. I was not paid  for it. I was a rank-and-file member on the Supreme Soviet  Committee for legislation. The reason was that I cannot tell  people no. [passage omitted]    [Koposova] How do you visualize the further federative  process given the fact that not all federation components have  voted for the Constitution?    [Shakhray] The Constitution was approved by citizens, not  the components. Citizens approved it -- the Constitution is in  force in all components of the Russian Federation. Having  written in stone the principle of equality of components of the  Russian Federation, the Constitution incorporated the first part  of the Federation Treaty, namely, the sphere of delimitation of  powers in the republics. I have said more than once that the  Federation cannot arise overnight -- this is a complex process  spread over many years....    [Koposova] Still, you expect the republics to agree with  these arguments and sit back?    [Shakhray] The year 1994 will be a year of interethnic and  regional frictions, and conflicts -- this much is apparent to  me. This process is unfortunately inevitable.    [Koposova] It is apparently in order to ease the process  that you had an idea for setting up a news corporation. I  realize the need. A very short time ago, the former "Ostankino"  chiefs prevented you from going on the air....    [Shakhray] I was hoping that this blocking, especially on  television, would end as the election campaign got under way.  But this was not to be. The hushing up continues. The news  corporation will comprise a newspaper, a magazine, and radio and  television devoted to the same regional and national subjects.  It is shameful that for more than a year and a half I have been  trying to arrange for premises for the State Committee for  Nationalities Policy. This problem typifies the authorities'  attitude to the nationalities and regions policy in our country.  Moscow, Russia's capital, is unable to provide a normal  building for personal contacts between representatives of 150  peoples and representatives of 89 regions.    [Koposova] Is there any progress?    [Shakhray] There is. Two stories in one building have  already been won.    [Koposova] How do you assess the resignations of your  associates in the Party of Russian Unity and Accord?    [Shakhray] This sort of an attitude to the leaders of the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord will lead to a position where  the party in the Duma will have to take a more wary stand toward  drafts from the top.    If one is to speak seriously about coalitions in parliament,  we will not be subsumed in some sorts of associations, but we  are ready to cooperate with the democratic groups. Despite the  fact that our own people continue to slight us. Even PRAVDA  writes that the votes garnered by the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord are an appreciable gain for the democratic bloc, whereas  our own people say that Shakhray diverted the votes. It is  simply because we have a different program, and different voters.    I do not rule out the chances of interaction with Civic  Union, the Democratic Party of Russia, even with the Communist  Party, on a range of questions: the preserving of the Russian  Federation, the consolidation of the Commonwealth in the sense  of further economic and political integration, the war on crime.    [Koposova] The president has once again stated his intention  to create his own party, from various democratic forces at that.  What do you think about this idea? Will you take part?    [Shakhray] The party cannot consist of Russia's Choice, the  Democratic Party of Russia, Yabloko, the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord, etc. A party is a qualitatively different  association. We support the president, but this does not  indicate that we are going to be a component of his party.    [Koposova] Many today are analyzing mistakes of the election  campaign. Are you going to draw lessons too?    [Shakhray] By all means. But this is not all. Who said the  elections have been lost? Given today's economic situation,  where wages are unpaid for months, the Constitution has been  passed. And the democrats in the parliament have three times as  many seats as in the previous one. As for our party, we cleared  the 15-percent hurdle in 70 regions. In many republics we also  left behind both Zhirinovskiy and Russia's Choice.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> PENTAGON QUICKLY LEARNS THAT CHENEY IS IN CHARGE  </P> <P> In his first day on the job, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney got lost in the  basement of the Pentagon. Two and a half weeks later, people are asking him for  directions.  </P> <P> Three days after taking office on March 17, Cheney fired the acting Air Force  secretary and told the Navy secretary to start looking for a job. The next  Friday, he publicly dressed down the Air Force chief of staff, a four-star  general, for "free-lancing" defense policy on Capitol Hill. The next Wednesday,  he dismissed the undersecretary of defense in charge of weapons acquisition.  </P> <P> Ten weeks into the Bush Administration, the Pentagon finally has a boss.  </P> <P> Cheney denied in an interview Tuesday that his goal is to put the generals and  admirals "back in a box" or that he sees a need to reassert civilian authority  at the Defense Department. But his actions have sent an unmistakable signal to  everyone in the sprawling agency, 2 million men and women in uniform and 1  million civilians, that Cheney is running the show.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Power Struggle Denied  </P> <P> "Obviously, I believe in civilian control," Cheney said, speaking to a small  group of newspaper reporters in his gold-carpeted Pentagon conference room.  "That's my job -- to run the department. To do that, it's necessary from time  to time to lay down markers of what is expected. But I don't feel as if I'm  engaged in any kind of a struggle with anyone for control of the department."  </P> <P> The six-term Wyoming congressman compared his Pentagon job to that of a  cowpuncher in charge of a wayward herd. "It's a big department with a lot of  bright, capable, talented people in it. Oftentimes, they don't move in the same  direction. Sometimes, you've got to get them herded up and headed down the  right trail."  </P> <P> Cheney entered the Pentagon under extraordinary circumstances. The department  had been essentially leaderless since President Bush took office on Jan. 20.  Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, a holdover from the Ronald Reagan  Administration, ran the agency while the Senate bitterly debated former Texas  Sen. John Tower's fitness to be defense secretary.  </P> <P> In the ensuing vacuum, all sorts of decisions were deferred, from budgetary  matters to key personnel appointments. Only one of the department's two dozen  top officials -- Deputy Defense Secretary-designate Donald J. Atwood -- had  been named.  </P> <P> Tower was rejected by the Senate, 53 to 47, on March 9 because of his history  of heavy drinking and his close ties to defense contractors. Bush nominated  Cheney the next day; the Senate confirmed him a week later.  </P> <P> Cheney already has sent the White House a list of his choices for most of the  top policy-making positions at the Defense Department. He has rejected most of  the "Tower Mafia" who were expected to get top jobs had Tower been confirmed.  </P> <P> Cheney brought with him a number of former House aides, including David  Addington, who will hold the title of special assistant to the secretary of  defense and who will occupy a spacious office adjacent to Cheney's suite.  </P> <P> The office previously housed an Air Force colonel who controlled the critical  paper flow to the secretary and who has been moved to a smaller office down the  hall. The secretary's paper work is now routed through Addington.  </P> <P> Addington formerly served as Cheney's aide on the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence. He has also worked at the Central Intelligence  Agency and at the White House as a legislative affairs aide.  </P> <P> "I feel I have the requirement to have the best possible people available  around me," Cheney said Tuesday. "I think there are duties and obligations,  responsibilities that are most appropriately given to a military officer;  others are most appropriately given to a civilian."  </P> <P> Cheney said that replacing the colonel with a civilian was not intended to  downgrade the military officer's post or to freeze the uniformed services out  of the secretary's office. But that is how the move is being read throughout  much of the building.  </P> <P> Addington's appointment "gives policy power to civilians who are supposed to be  making policy," said an approving senior military officer who formerly was a  military assistant to a senior civilian official at the Pentagon.  </P> <P> "Cheney, if he curbs the military influence in the office of secretary of  defense, will be off to a good start," the officer said. "These guys are  advocates for their services more than anything else. (Cheney's office) ought  to be all civilian."  </P></p>

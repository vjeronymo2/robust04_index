			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service recognizes that while some populations of the fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp are found on protected public and private lands, almost all are located in areas that are not secure against adverse impacts to these animals. Please refer to Factor D below, for an expanded discussion on landownership patterns and protection for these species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 19:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter said the scientific articles containing data on the fairy shrimp that were used by the Service are ``primitive and unreliable'' and the taxonomy of these crustaceans is ``confused''. However, four recognized crustacean biologists noted that the taxonomy of fairy shrimp found in California had been reviewed recently in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and the taxonomic status of these species is widely accepted by current authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the best and most recent systematic information from a number of reliable sources, including Eng  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1990), D. Belk (pers. comm., 192), and M. Fugate (pers. comm., 1992), the Service maintains that the Conservancy fairy shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the longhorn fairy shrimp are valid species and no further taxonomic studies are needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 20:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several respondents, including Congressman Wally Herger contended that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a ``taxonomically unstable species''. One commenter stated that taxonomic confusion between Lemmon's tadpole shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lepidurus lemmoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp should be resolved prior to any listing decision. Several commenters stated that the taxonomy of tadpole shrimps is unresolved and recommended that the Service not list the animal. Expressing a contrary position, three recognized authorities on crustaceans provided information showing the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a biologically and taxonomically valid species. They reported that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is distinct in both morphology and ecology from Lemmon's tadpole shrimp, which is restricted to alkaline lakes is western North America. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the best and most recent systematic information from a number of reliable sources, including Lynch (1972) and various crustacean biologists) (R. Brusca,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992; M. Simovich,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992; J. King,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt,.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992), the Service maintains that the vernal pool tadpole shrimp is a valid species and no further taxonomic studies are needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 21:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four respondents expressed concern that the Service was going to list the ricefield tadpole shrimp ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Triops longicaudatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) a pest in rice fields in the Central Valley. They further stated that protection of this animal would be an ``economic disaster'' for rice growers of California. Alternatively, three recognized crustacean authorities provided information showing that the rice field tadpole shrimp is only distantly related to the vernal pool tadpool shrimp. They stated that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> T. longicaudatus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is known to occur in the Central Valley only in rice fields while  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. packardi  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is found only in vernal pools. One of the crustacean biologists stated that based on genetic studies, the two species are separated by genetic distances on the order of those normally found between crustacean orders (J. King,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992). In addition, the four crustacean biologists noted that the two species are morphologically distinct and are easily distinguishable from each other. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The findings in this final rule reflect the published taxonomic literature and the expert opinion of recognized crustacean biologists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 22:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters stated that Federal, State, and local regulatory processes provide adequate protection for the crustaceans. Two respondents said that listing would directly affect agriculture, industrial, and commercial development in areas that have been meticulously planned and subject to State laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and California Subdivision Map Act. Some commenters noted the wetlands ``no-net-loss'' policies of several State and county agencies, while other cited section 404 of the Clean Water Act. On commenter analyzed data for a group of 29 development projects in the Sacramento area and found that 56 percent of the vernal pools at these project sites had been preserved and 0.9 hectare (2.2 acres) of vernal pools provided as mitigation for each acre impacted under Corps permit conditions pursuant to section 404 requirements. The commenter stated that this group of projects is representative of the level of preservation afforded vernal pool habitat in the Sacramento area and further concluded that this level of protection may be equaled or exceeded for projects requiring section 404 permits throughout the range of the five species. Another commenter noted that the Corps recently classified vernal pools at a proposed project site in Sacramento County as ``aquatic resources of national importance''. According to the commenter, this designation will cause the Corps to more closely evaluate impacts to vernal pools from proposed projects and thus provide significant protection to vernal pool habitat for the five crustacean species during a six-month time extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expressing a contrary position, several other commenters noted that Federal, State, and local laws have been ineffective in providing protection for these species. The Mount Lassen Chapter of the California Native Plant Society provided data on the destruction of two vernal pool complexes known to have been inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the City of Chico. They provided information on two other vernal pool complexes in Chico that are located on properties proposed for residential development. Another commenter stated that vernal pools in Santa Rosa have been eliminated despite the protective provisions of State law (CEQA). A number of respondents noted that destruction of vernal pools commonly is allowed if an attempt is made to create artificial habitat as compensation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While vernal pool habitat has been preserved permanently under special conditions of section 404 permits for a number of projects, significant areas of vernal pool habitat continue to be lost in spite of the Corps jurisdictional authority to regulate these wetlands under the Clean Water Act. Since 1987, the Service has been tracking the Corps' implementation of Nationwide Permit 26 within the area of responsibility of the Service's Sacramento Field Office. A Service report produced in October 1992 showed that the Corps' Sacramento District authorized filling of 189 hectares (467 acres) of wetlands between 1987 and 1992 pursuant to Nationwide Permit 26 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1992). During this same time period, the Corps' San Francisco District authorized projects under Nationwide Permit 26 that filled a total of 104 hectares (257 acres) of wetlands of which 15.6 hectares (38.6 acres) were in the Santa Rosa Plain. The report notes that these figures are conservative estimates because notification of agencies for projects affecting less than 0.405 hectares (1.0 acre) are not mandatory. The Service estimates that a majority of the wetland losses permitted in the Sacramento District constitute vernal pools. In addition, between December 1, 1992, and June 15, 1993, the Service identified 10 unauthorized projects in Sacramento and Butte Counties that destroyed or damaged between 8.5 and 15 hectares (21 and 37 acres) of vernal pool habitat (D. Strait, pers. comm., 1993). The projects were not authorized because landowners either were not required or failed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the section 404 permitting process. In addition, gravel mines are proposed for significant areas in the Sacramento Valley, including an approximately 404 hectare (1,000 acres) site south of Mather Air Force Base that contains the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Under recent changes in the Corps of Engineers regulations, some gravel mining activities will be regulated. However, in the past, most of these activities were not subject to the provisions of the Clean Water Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

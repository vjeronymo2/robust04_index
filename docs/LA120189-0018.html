			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MOORPARK TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Moorpark 97, Rio Hondo 61 -- Jerry Markray, a 6-foot-8 center, came off the  bench to score 17 points as the Raiders coasted in a first-round game at  Moorpark College.  </P> <P> Winless Rio Hondo (0-7) turned the ball over to a scrappy Moorpark defense on  its first four possessions. Guards Charlie Cangelosi and Sam Crawford each  converted a pair of baskets for an 8-0 lead that would steadily increase  throughout the game.  </P> <P> Cangelosi and Crawford each scored 14 points and forced numerous turnovers. The  Roadrunners committed 21 turnovers in the game.  </P> <P> "I did some gambling on defense tonight but my team backs me up and we come up  with the ball at the right place at the right time," Crawford said.  </P> <P> The victory puts Moorpark (5-2) into the championship quarterfinals against  Citrus College tonight at 7.

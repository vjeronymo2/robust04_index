			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> All revisions to such data (both additions to and deletions from the preceding data) shall be submitted to the Commission as part of the next annual report period. Serial number reports for new covered products are due sixty days after the annual effective mandatory labeling date for each product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Section 305.11 is amended by revising the heading of paragraph (a), by revising paragraph (e), and by adding paragraph (f) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;305.11  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Labeling for covered products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Labels for covered products other than fluorescent lamp ballasts, fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, incandescent lamps (including incandescent reflector lamps), showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals_. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=3 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (e) Lamps.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) (i) Any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously on the product's principal display panel with the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The number of lamps included in the package, if more than one;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The design voltage of each lamp included in the package, if other than 120 volts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The light output of each lamp included in the package, expressed in average initial lumens;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The electrical power consumed (energy used) by each lamp included in the package, expressed in average initial wattage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) The life of each lamp included in the package, expressed in hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The light output, energy usage and life ratings of any covered product that is a medium base compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall appear in that order and with equal clarity and conspicuousness on the product's principal display panel. The light output, energy usage and life ratings shall be disclosed in terms of ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' respectively, with the lumens, watts and hours rating numbers each appearing in the same type style and size and with the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' each appearing in the same type style and size. The words ``light output,'' ``energy used'' and ``life'' shall precede and have the same conspicuousness as both the rating numbers and the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours,'' except that the letters of the words ``lumens,'' ``watts'' and ``hours'' shall be approximately 50% of the sizes of those used for the words ``light output,'' ``energy used'' and ``life'' respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The light output, energy usage and life ratings of any covered product that is a medium base compact fluorescent lamp or general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), shall be measured at 120 volts, regardless of the lamp's design voltage. If a lamp's design voltage is other than 120 volts, the disclosures of the wattage, light output and life ratings shall in each instance be followed by the phrase ``at 120 volts.'' Labels for lamps with design voltages other than 120 volts also may disclose the lamps' wattage, light output and life at the designed voltage ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ``Light Output 1710 Lumens at 125 volts'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) For any covered product that is an incandescent reflector lamp, the required disclosure of light output shall be given for the lamp's beam spread and be followed clearly and conspicuously by the phrase ``at beam spread.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp, the required light output disclosure shall be measured at a base-up position; but, if the manufacturer or private labeler has reason to believe that the light output at a base-down position would be more than 5% different, the label also shall disclose the light output at the base-down position or, if no test data for the base-down position exist, the fact that at a base-down position the light output might be more than 5% less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) For any covered product that is a compact fluorescent lamp or a general service incandescent lamp (including an incandescent reflector lamp), there shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed on the principal display panel the following statement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> To save energy costs, find the bulbs with the light output you need, then choose the one with the lowest watts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (vii) For any covered product that is a general service incandescent lamp and operates with multiple filaments, the principal display panel shall disclose clearly and conspicuously, in the manner required by paragraph (e)(1) (i)&hyph;(iii) and (vi) of this section of the Rule, the lamp's wattage and light output at each of the lamp's levels of light output and the lamp's life measured on the basis of the filament that fails first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any covered product that is a general service fluorescent lamp or an incandescent reflector lamp shall be labeled clearly and conspicuously with a capital letter ``E'' printed within a circle and followed by an asterisk. The label shall also clearly and conspicuously disclose, either in close proximity to that asterisk or elsewhere on the label, the following statement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> *[The encircled ``E''] means this bulb meets Federal minimum efficiency standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

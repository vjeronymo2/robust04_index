			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of India (10): Millions of bells are waiting to ring - Telephones Correction (published 1st December 1994) appended to this article. For the past year and a half, Ms Boli Medappa been waiting for the phone to ring in the suite which she occupies at the Sheraton hotel in New Delhi, writes Gordon Cramb. She is the India representative of US West, the Colorado-based telecommunications company which, like many other industry multinationals, is seeking a role in one of the world's largest potential telephone markets. After several 'wrong numbers', US West and other the foreign service providers are starting to receive calls from the Indian licensing authorities. In the last few weeks a batch of eight cellular licences has been granted with minority foreign participation, two apiece to offer mobile phone services for the first time in the four biggest cities. By the end of the year, tenders should be out for the right to provide basic telephone facilities in any of 18 regions of the country in competition with the current government monopoly. This follows the unveiling in May of a government telecoms policy which recognised that its public sector monopolies would not be able to meet growth in call traffic and, more particularly, demand for lines. India has less than one line per 100 people, one of the lowest levels of phone availability in the world, and would-be subscribers can wait a decade for a residential connection. Initially, peripheral services such as paging and electronic mail were opened to private operators in 1992 - 'deregulated' is the wrong word, as the bureaucrats at the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) attached a sheaf of requirements to such licences. Pager companies are, to take an example cited by an industry executive in Delhi, obliged to maintain a huge electronic archive of messages relayed months or years in the past. The cellphone licences initially awarded were challenged in the courts by unsuccessful bidders and there followed a round of musical chairs as part of which Bharti Telecom, a local maker of handsets whose bid has been backed by small-scale European interests, moved the proposed site of its service from Bombay to the area around Delhi. Bharti won a Delhi franchise as a result but Tata Cellular, an offshoot of India's biggest industrial group, failed to capitalise on a legal intervention which for a time put it back in the running. It lost the potentially lucrative Bombay slot to rival ventures backed by France Telecom and the originally excluded Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong. This time Tata did not immediately appeal. An eccentricity of that contest was that bidders were required to propose a pricing structure, and were awarded points under a secret system based in part on how cheaply they said they could offer a service - but the department then fixed a tariff regime and will allow price competition, if at all, only at the margins. The formula under which revenues will be shared with the government operator is one of the main issues yet to be resolved before tenders are invited for new entrants to provide basic telephone services covering each of 18 regions of the country. The carve-up, which approximates to India's state boundaries, has got another clutch of telecoms companies from abroad jostling for the prime positions. US West, which has more than Dollars 1bn ready to invest in India, has for example long had its eyes on the south of the country where economic growth is vigorous. Long-distance traffic is to remain a national preserve for the next five years, disappointing industry analysts who view that end of the business as more lucrative than providing local links to thousands of villages. Although Ms Medappa says that 'we didn't ask for that and didn't expect it,' many think interstate services will be opened up earlier than the government has indicated. Mr D K Gupta of the Telecoms Commission, the department's policy unit, says India's needs in long-distance communications are less acute than for basic services. The primary role of the new entrants is to supply at least a quarter of the 10m lines which the country aims to add by March 1997. He notes that local services 'have not been opened up even in many developed countries. We are starting with these.' The aim will be to provide universal access to a telephone rather than a universal service - in other words, public phones in more remote villages rather than one by every bedside. Wireless technology will help bring down the cost of putting in place a regional network, but there is a suspicion among Indian commentators that the private sector operators will seek to skim the cream off the urban business market in order to get the return on capital they seek. If so, that would remove the DoT's best customers - who by one estimate account for 15 per cent of the lines but 80 per cent of the revenue. But Mr Gupta, satisfied that the DoT will remain the predominant operator, also says that it will have its work cut out meeting its own quota of new connections. To the previously cossetted public sector unions, which have been aghast at the changes, he offers the reassurance: 'Whatever we have by way of overstaffing will be compensated for by expansion' in a market which is growing by some 20 per cent a year. The DoT anyway remains protected by its effectively zero cost of capital and its exemption from tax. Moreover, it controls the selection of its competitors and the terms under which they will operate. The telecoms regulatory authority to be established under the new regime will also report to the minister and will, says Mr Amit Sharma of Motorola, the US equipment manufacturer, 'take time to establish a credible record' of neutrality. The authority, in the process of being constituted, will rule on tariffs, monitor quality of service and ensure connectivity between service providers. Worries over its role, and the commitment of the government to even-handedness, have been fuelled in recent weeks by a spate of upheavals within the ministry. Mr N Vittal, architect of many of the reforms, departed abruptly from his post as its chief civil servant - he was telecoms secretary and chairman of the telecoms commission - after clashes with Mr Sukh Ram, telecoms minister, who is suspected of being less than wedded to liberalisation. Mr Vittal's replacement, Mr R K Takkar, has expressed his intention, however, to 'get cracking' with the programme. At the same time, movement has been slow on a scheduled relaunch of the Euroequity issue to reduce the government's holding in Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the international carrier, which was aborted earlier this year because the market saw it as overpriced. The issue is now to be underwritten, but just as the lead managers were dusting off the prospectus Mr B K Syngal resigned as VSNL chairman. A further delay ensued. VSNL is one of two opportunities for indirect investment in the sector. A minority stake in Mahangar Telephone Nigam, which controls telecoms services in Bombay and Delhi, is also being floated. A missed opportunity so far has been a failure to exploit the growth in cable television networks serving the biggest Indian cities. CORRECTION In the survey of India published on November 8 it was incorrectly reported that Mr B K Syngal had resigned as chairman of VSNL, the international telecoms carrier. He remains in that post.</p>

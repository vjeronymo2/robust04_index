			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Rise in judgments against debtors A SHARP rise in consumer indebtedness as a result of the recession is suggested by figures for county court judgments in England and Wales last year, David Barchard writes. The total number of judgments, made when someone defaults on a debt, reached a record of 1.8m last year. Details of judgments in county courts are used by banks, retailers, and other consumer-credit bodies when deciding whether to lend to individuals. Details of a judgment against a debtor are held for six years, and the person may find it difficult to obtain credit in that period. Judgments against debtors last year were 22 per cent up on 1990, but this may partly reflect the fact the procedures for notifying judgments to the Registry Trust, which keeps a record of bad debts, were improved during the second half of 1990.</p>

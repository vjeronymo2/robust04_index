			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yonko Kalpazanov: "Is It a Question of Personal </F> Choice?"]    [Text] We are once again confronted with a case of  coinciding views between the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD]  and the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. Their leaders have  assumed similar stands in connection with Professor Berov's  illness and the ensuing results for the government. They claim  that it is a question of the prime minister's personal decision  whether he wishes to remain in his post or resign, whether he  should choose between his health and a political career.  According to the aforementioned leaders, it is the same whether  the prime minister should go to Brussels for a week or whether  he should go for treatment to the government officials' clinic  at the Military Hospital.    The unanimity is not surprising; it only confirms the  prevailing conviction that the NSD is an offspring of the BSP.  The only reason for surprise is the lightheartedness with which  both political organizations are treating issues of crucial  importance for our country.    After one week abroad, Mr. Berov is supposed to resume the  prime minister's seat and continue chairing the government  (although with rather doubtful chances of success, as a matter  of fact) and to bear the responsibility for the country,  according to Article 108, paragraph 2, of the Constitution.  After several weeks in the hospital, the prime minister is  expected to undergo a few months of rehabilitation treatment in  a special clinic or at home. Throughout all this time, he is  neither subjectively nor objectively in a position to bear the  responsibility for the government. This would be the time of  missing responsibility, which is so convenient for the  destructive intentions of Balkan and Bulgarian communism and its  satellites.    It is naive to believe and cynical to claim that an  individual who has suffered a severe heart attack, who has  undergone surgery including four bypasses, and who is 70 years  old could once more assume the fully fledged leadership of the  state, especially considering his "achievements" at a time when  he was in good health.    Good intentions and personal ambitions should give in to the  laws of human physiology. The commentaries about Prof. Berov's  illness are frequently lacking in objectivity, under the  influence of emotions.    We are all mortal. It is an understandable human reaction to  feel sympathy for those who are suffering from ill health.  Nevertheless, when Bulgaria's vital interests are at stake,  truth should prevail over courtesy. We should have the courage  to tell the truth in a spirit of tolerance and to bear it with  stoicism.    For objective medical reasons, Prof. Berov is no longer in a  position to preside over the Bulgarian Government, especially  considering the difficult period that our country is going  through. An incapacitated prime minister with two deputy prime  ministers, who are notorious offsprings of "mature socialism" in  command, means to further accelerate the pace of  recommunization, which is already under way in our country, to  an unprecedented extent. Prof. Berov's remaining in his post,  and even a delay of his resignation, would be detrimental to his  health and a disaster for Bulgaria.    The prime minister's resignation, and hence the resignation  of his cabinet, is not a matter of personal choice but an  absolute necessity for the preservation of our national  interests. Let us hope that Prof. Berov, whom, as I am  convinced, we all wish a prompt recovery, will come to a  decision that should be worthy of himself and would make things  easier for Bulgaria.</p>

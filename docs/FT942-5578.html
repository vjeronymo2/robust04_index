			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: ING lifted by strong insurance operations ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, increased net profit by more than 25 per cent to Fl 501m (Dollars 270m) in the first quarter of 1994 from the same period of 1993. Turnover was down slightly at Fl 9.31bn compared with F 19.40bn, partly reflecting the deconsolidation in April 1993 of two insurance subsidiaries, Orion and the NRG. The profits advance was helped by strong insurance returns. Pre-tax results from insurance surged by nearly 50 per cent to Fl 354m from Fl 243m. Sharp increases were reported for life and general insurance, while losses narrowed in ING's non-life business. The deconsolidation of Orion and NRG meant ING was able to reduce most of its exposure to the loss-making reinsurance business. ING's insurance operations in the Czech Republic contributed to profits for the first time in the quarter. The jump in insurance profits contrasts with a more moderate 5.4 per cent increase in pre-tax banking profits to Fl 314m from Fl 298m. For the whole of 1994 ING expects its results to at least match those for 1993.</p>

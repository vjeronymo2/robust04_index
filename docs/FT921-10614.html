			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Reynolds nears winning post in PM stakes / A report on the political comeback of the man who was sacked by Haughey THE Irish punter who in 1983 placed a IPounds 50 bet at 14-1 that Mr Albert Reynolds, then a government parliamentary spokesman on industry, would succeed Mr Charles Haughey as leader of the Fianna Fail party and become prime minister should be a happy man tomorrow. Ireland's biggest bookmaker, Paddy Power, which took that bet, yesterday shortened the odds on Mr Reynolds to 20-1 on, 'and we still look as though we are going to lose a lot of money,' a company manager said. Ireland's next Taoiseach will be elected by the Fianna Fail parliamentary group tomorrow after the formal resignation of Mr Haughey, who said last week he would be stepping down 'to further advance the best interests of the country.' A 1982 telephone-tapping scandal resurfaced last month, culminating a series of controversies in which Mr Haughey had become embroiled during the past six months. He was presented by his government coalition partners with the option of resigning or facing a general election. Having widespread support in the parliamentary party in addition to that of almost half the cabinet, including the finance minister, Mr Bertie Ahern, Mr Reynolds can confidently expect to be sworn in as Taoiseach next Tuesday. His only challengers are the health minister, Mrs Mary O'Rourke and the agriculture minister, Mr Michael Woods, (25-1 and 40-1 respectively). Born 56 years ago in Rooskey, a small village in the western county of Roscommon, Mr Reynolds was educated in the local Catholic school and found his first job as a wages clerk on the Irish railways. Following a path trodden by many young men from the west of Ireland, he emigrated to Canada, but returned in the early 1960s to join his brothers in the running of the family dance hall business, established by his father in Rooskey and expanded by the younger Reynolds to other towns. As a keen amateur country and western singer, he would often appear on stage in jeans, boots and cowboy hat crooning into a microphone. He moved to Longford, where he and a partner in 1970 set up a petfood factory to process previously exported trimmings and offal from the local slaughterhouses. This provided the financial basis for his launch into politics. The factory is now managed by his son and is set for a IPounds 4m expansion through an acquisition in continental Europe. He apparently first became involved in the Fianna Fail on his return from Canada, working up through the party. He was a Longford county councillor from 1975-79 and was first elected to parliament in 1977. On the election of Mr Haughey as prime minister in 1979, he was brought into the cabinet as transport and telecommunications minister. He was then given the industry and energy portfolio until 1982, after which he spent spent five years as an opposition parliamentary spokesman. Back in government in 1987, he became industry and commerce minister and in 1988 became finance minister, the post from which both Mr Haughey and his predecessor, Mr Jack Lynch, advanced to the premiership. However, Mr Reynolds came close to ending his career last November, when he was sacked by Mr Haughey for leading a party leadership challenge. He was criticised by some for mounting the challenge prematurely. A life-long teetotaller, devout Catholic, and a chainsmoker until he gave up four years ago, Mr Reynolds is married with two sons and five daughters. Speaking to businessmen last week he said that tackling unemployment must be at the top of the political agenda in 1992 and that the Irish economy should be 'an instrument in the creation of a society in which nobody feels left out.'</p>

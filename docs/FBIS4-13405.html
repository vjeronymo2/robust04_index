			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The No's of King Husayn"] </F>   [Text] For the first time since the Zionist usurpation of  Jerusalem--the jewel of Arab and Islamic cities--in 1967, Amman  and Jerusalem yesterday met in a wonderful spiritual meeting  under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn, descendant of the  Hashemites, who has great spiritual and historic memories in his  heart and mind of the holy city, following the steps of the  Hashemite family.    Yesterday's awe-inspiring historic celebration in Amman and  Jerusalem on the occasion of completing the third  Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of  the Rock was an occasion for the Arabs and Muslims to  contemplate the difficult situation our nation is facing. This  situation calls on everybody to reconsider the current  deterioration in relations and seek to restore solidarity and  reconciliation with the conscience, the mind, and the soul.    His Majesty King Husayn's call during the pan-Arab speech he  delivered on this blessed historic occasion was amazing. He  called on the nation to rise up to save Jerusalem and stand  against every siege, oppression, and alienation.    Within earshot of all Arabs and Muslims, leader King Husayn  uttered three no's which sum up the reality of the nation's will  and reflect the feelings, sentiments, and aspirations of the  masses in every Arab and Islamic nation. No to any solution  that does not restore Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem. No  to any solution that does not secure the historic and legitimate  rights of the people of Palestine on their chaste national soil.  And no to any peace that is not acceptable to the future  generations--a peace that they will not protect and defend.    It is no secret to the observer that the three no's His  Majesty King Husayn uttered are constants of the Jordanian  policy our country has been following in all its political  activities since the Israeli occupation of our territories.    His Majesty King Husayn's donation to cover the expenses of  the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and  the holy Dome of the Rock and his donation to rebuild the pulpit  of Salah-al-Din al-Ayyubi stand witness to the great prestige  the Holy City occupies in the heart and mind of his majesty the  king and the Hashemite family. As King Husayn said yesterday,  the Hashemite's association with Jerusalem "stands above the  fray of political ploys and Earthly greed." Therefore, the  leader made a new Hashemite pledge when he said: "We will keep  our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's rights in  it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city in  accordance with the international legitimacy."</p>

			<p>Fresh      signs of consumer goods shortages have recently emerged in  North Korean media.  Seeking to ease what seems like a desperate  fuel situation, a 20 January article in the government paper  Minju Choson urged the use of a heretofore untapped fuel  resource: soot.  Soot, the article said, should be combined with  unburned coal gleaned from ashes produced at industrial plants to  make briquettes.  Putting the best face on a bad situation, the  article claimed that briquettes made of soot and ash are odorless  and can be used indoors for heating and cooking "like kerosene,"  because the sulfur compounds in them have already been burned  off.  Since both soot and ash are abundant byproducts at the  numerous boilers at thermal power plants and other industrial  enterprises, the article went on, they should be "inexhaustible."  The article conceded that the challenge now confronting the  proponents of the scheme is learning how to separate "unburned  coal" from ash for use in making briquettes and called on  guidance functionaries'' to dedicate themselves to this task.     Pyongyang has also applied a similar recycling approach to the  food sector.  A 28 January Minju Choson article touted North  Korean scientific prowess that has created "artificial meat" out  of soy bean dregs resulting from oil extraction.  This "tasty and  nutritious" substance, the article claimed, is also easy to  digest, keeps well, and is "very inexpensive."     (AUTHOR:  CHANG.

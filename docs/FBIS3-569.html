			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major Pierre Buyoya, former president of </F> Burundi, by correspondent Monique Mas in Paris on 9  March--recorded]    [Text] [Buyoya] In this country, the people speak the same  language and share the same culture. There are no ethnic  territories, but the ethnic factor has been used in the  struggle for power. (?In this framework), ethnic feelings have  been created and have become a reality. Democratization has  fallen into the trap of ethnicity--first during the elections  and then afterwards. I think the use of force on 21 October was  the manifestation of the ethnic radicalism--of the ethnic  extremism--of certain elements who, using the Army as a base,  committed (?a crime). So what followed after that--the massacre  of people inside the country--is the manifestation of ethnic  radicalism. On the one hand, there is Tutsi radicalism, and  then there is Hutu radicalism. When the extremists met, that  created the tragedy we have seen.    [Mas] Nevertheless, the government and parliament--in other  words, the institutions--have been set up in spite of  everything. However, there is one institution, the Army, which  seems to have great problems with regard to one part of the  nation. A majority of the Burundian nation appears to feel  great mistrust for the Army.    [Buyoya] The Burundian Army is, first, a consequence of the  history of Burundi. Indeed, there is today an ethnic  component--the Tutsis--who are the majority in the Army. So the  problem we face is that, because of propaganda and politics, the  Hutus have been led to mistrust the Army.    The question is: What can we do to change the situation? I  think that reforms had been started to make all segments of the  population of Burundi (?feel at home) in this Army. The Army  has probably also been manipulated and used by politicians. I  did not think it was an Army initiative to protect this or that  individual, or to adopt this or that political position. The  fact is, however, that the Army was used for political ends by  other people--people who think that to be against the Army is  politically advantageous, and others who think that to get the  Army to take part in shows of force like that of 21 October is  advantageous. Moreover, the Army had even agreed that reforms  could be carried out. Those who need to make the reforms-- in  other words, the political authorities, the politicians--must  know then that the troops must be reeducated to learn what their  place and their role is today.    [Mas] So the Army has to be reformed. Meanwhile, how is  security to be ensured in the country?    [Buyoya] For me, to create security does not mean increasing  the number of policemen, the number of troops or anything. It  means, first and foremost, clear and precise orientation toward  peace by the authorities.    We sometimes find equivocal attitudes and speeches, which  means that organized groups in this or that category even  believe they have support when they create chaos. First, we  need to drop this tendency that we have had for so long of  walking a tightrope ethnically and politically when dealing with  certain questions-- especially the question of security. There  must be a consensus for peace.    To take the actual case of the Army: It is true that the  tragedy started off from the Army. Today, however, I think the  Burundian Army--or at least its staff, its organized  structures--has declared its loyalty to the government. Now the  government, the political authorities, must be able to use the  Army like the other structures of the state to make peace. So,  if tomorrow the Army rejects this, if there are elements in the  Army working in the opposite direction of this loyalty, this is  a problem that has to be solved. The political authorities have  to solve it.    I think what we need today is this determination to be able  to reverse the tendency. This is essential: If we do not  manage to do this, Burundi will be on the way to civil war.</p>

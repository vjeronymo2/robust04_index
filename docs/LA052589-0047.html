			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BRADLEY, COELHO TARGETS OF U.S. CRIMINAL PROBE  </P> <P> Preliminary criminal investigations of both Mayor Tom Bradley and House  Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) have been opened by the Justice Department  in Washington in connection with their financial dealings with Drexel Burnham  Lambert Inc., The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Although details of the investigations are not known, a central question being  examined is whether Bradley and Coelho, who have acknowledged that they made  investments through Drexel, illegally received preferential treatment,  according to two sources close to the investigation. The inquiry also is  expected to examine whether Drexel offered investment opportunities to the two  Democratic officeholders with the hope or expectation of receiving favored  treatment in return.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, newly obtained records show that Bradley -- in a deal that was not  available to ordinary investors -- purchased $100,000 in "junk bonds" through  Drexel's high-yield department in Beverly Hills. The March, 1986, transaction  suggests that the mayor had an unusual relationship with the junk bond  department headed by Michael Milken.  </P> <P> Bradley apparently lost most of his investment, a previously undisclosed  purchase of Gibraltar Financial Corp. bonds, according to two independent  sources familiar with the transaction. But his access to a private placement of  the Gibraltar bonds by Milken's department appears to be inconsistent with the  mayor's recent statement that he was "not aware" of receiving any investment  opportunity not available to the general public.  </P> <P> The mayor has refused to elaborate on his ties to Drexel, although he has  acknowledged that he has an account with the firm. Asked to comment on the  Justice Department inquiry, Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said Wednesday that  "the mayor has no knowledge of any such investigation."  </P> <P> Coelho, who earlier had declined to comment on the matter, late Wednesday night  said: "I am confident that the report of a preliminary investigation is  inaccurate. In Washington's current atmosphere, such stories based on rumor or  leaks are perhaps inevitable but no less regrettable."  </P> <P> The investigations of Bradley and Coelho are being conducted by the Justice  Department's Public Integrity Section, a unit responsible for looking into  allegations of corruption against judges and other political figures. The  decision to open the probes came after an unusual disagreement between U.S.  attorney's offices in Los Angeles and New York over whether facts in the case  warrant such serious action, sources said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sensitive Treatment  </P> <P> Because of the sensitivity of even preliminary investigations of political  figures, they normally are authorized only after a thorough study of the  available facts and after the attorney general gives his approval. The Justice  Department declined Wednesday to comment on the matter.  </P> <P> The decision to open a preliminary investigation of Bradley represents a  significant step beyond the decision last week by the U.S. attorney's office in  Manhattan to subpoena records of the mayor's transactions with Drexel.  </P> <P> That subpoena was issued in connection with a "broad-based" inquiry into the  investment firm's dealings with politicians. Launching a preliminary  investigation, by contrast, is the first official step in the Justice  Department's formal procedure for deciding whether the facts warrant no further  action or instead justify launching a full-scale grand jury investigation  leading to possible criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> Bradley and Milken are acquaintances who have appeared together at Drexel's  annual junk bond conference -- informally known as the "Predators' Ball" -- and  at a variety of programs benefiting charity and nonprofit organizations. Since  1983, Bradley has received at least $125,000 in campaign contributions from  Drexel and its network of employees and associates.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, at Bradley's instigation, Coelho persuaded California's two  senators and the Los Angeles congressional delegation to intervene on behalf of  Drexel in settlement negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The agency was seeking to force Drexel to move its junk bond department from  Beverly Hills to New York.  </P> <P> As previously reported, Coelho bought a $100,000 Drexel-issued junk bond with  the help of a $50,000 loan from Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. that he  failed to disclose as required by law. Columbia Chairman Thomas Spiegel, a  close associate of Milken, also has acknowledged assisting Coelho by  recommending -- and then helping finance -- the highly unusual junk bond  purchase.  </P> <P> Milken stepped down as head of the hugely profitable junk bond department in  March, after he was indicted on federal racketeering and securities fraud  charges. He has pleaded innocent.  </P> <P> Bradley's investment in the Gibraltar bonds -- technically referred to as  senior subordinated debentures -- was revealed in records turned over to The  Times by the mayor's office in response to a state Public Records Act request.  Two sources familiar with the mayor's finances said Bradley invested in at  least two other previously undisclosed junk bonds issued by Drexel, though it  is not known whether the transactions were handled by Milken's unit.  </P> <P> Milken's junk bond department normally dealt only with institutional investors,  such as insurance companies, mutual funds and banks. Former Drexel employees  said in interviews that the department maintained accounts for only a very  select, limited number of individuals, primarily top executives at companies  that did business with Drexel and friends and relatives of Milken and employees  of the department.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Real Good Advice'  </P> <P> For the junk bond unit's preferred customers, "the most important thing you get  is product (securities) that generally the average retail client does not see,"  said one former Drexel executive, who asked not to be named. "The other thing  you get in the high-yield department is real good advice. These are the people  who have put together the deal. . . . They are aware of the shortcomings or the  advantages. That's the type of advantage you don't always get from a retail  broker."  </P> <P> The records obtained by The Times consist of a log of correspondence to the  mayor from various Drexel officials. The letters and packages described in the  log range from one official in the municipal finance department raising the  possibility of new public financing methods to others sending paperweights to  the mayor. Several of the 28 entries to Bradley from Drexel are marked  "personal and confidential."  </P> <P> The records show direct communications between the mayor and Milken's junk bond  department, including a letter from an administrative employee in the  department, Jillian H. Mendorff. The letter enclosed a form that the mayor  needed to sign to authorize the sale of the Gibraltar bonds in January, 1989.  </P> <P> Gibraltar Financial officials confirmed that its bonds were sold in March,  1986, by Drexel under a private placement, which meant that they were not  offered to the public. The bonds were available only to clients of the junk  bond department and were not registered with the SEC for public trading until  more than eight months later.  </P> <P> Such private placements were not available to Drexel's regular retail  customers, said one former Drexel retail broker.  </P> <P> "The only way you could get those private placement bonds was to deal directly  with the high-yield bond department," the broker said.  </P> <P> Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, refused to discuss the Gibraltar offering.  Wall Street traders, however, said the Gibraltar bonds were not considered a  "hot issue," meaning that there was not an exceptionally high level of investor  interest and that the bonds did not shoot up significantly in value after they  began trading publicly.  </P> <P> Bradley sold the bonds in January after the ailing thrift's bond ratings had  declined for months, said two independent sources familiar with the  transaction. The mayor sold his bonds only days before the company disclosed  that federal regulators considered the company's main subsidiary, Gibraltar  Savings, "a troubled institution" operating in an "unsafe and unsound  condition."  </P> <P> A securities analyst familiar with the Gibraltar bonds said that, if the mayor  sold them in January, he would have received only between 20 and 30 cents on  the dollar for his original investment. The mayor, therefore, would have lost  between $70,000 and $80,000.  </P> <P> Based on what is now known about the transaction, Bradley's purchase of the  bonds does not appear to violate any rules or laws, although one SEC source  said there may be a question about whether Drexel violated rules concerning  private placements in selling to the mayor. The rules, in most cases, limit  private placements to "sophisticated investors" who have substantial assets and  a high degree of investment savvy.  </P> <P> This story was reported and written by Times staff writers Jack Nelson and  Ronald J.

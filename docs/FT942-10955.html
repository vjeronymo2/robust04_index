			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Baffled by a mystery rule Some time ago, an acquaintance took out a Small Business Development Loan. When he came to clear this, his accountant estimated he still owed some Pounds 9,000 interest. But the bank involved claimed that, because the 'Rule of Three' applied, he owed more than Pounds 30,000 interest. Just what is this Rule of Three? Frustrating though it is to admit, we have drawn a blank on your query. No one we have contacted has heard of any Rule of Three. This includes the Department of Trade and Industry and several senior representatives of the investment and banking world. Our only suggestion is that your acquaintance returns to his lending bank for further clarification. (Reply by Murray Johnstone Ltd).

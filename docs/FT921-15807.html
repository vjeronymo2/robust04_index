			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Warm reception for new issues in dollar sector PENT-UP demand for dollar securities, following the strong rally in the US bond market over the Christmas period, ensured a positive reception for Dollars 1.25bn worth of new issues in the dollar sector yesterday. Although few swap opportunities are available, many borrowers are keen to lock in fixed-rate funds at historically low rates, and dealers are predicting a wave of dollar deals. The Canadian province of Ontario launched a Dollars 1bn seven-year deal via Merrill Lynch, which was considered fairly priced, offering an initial yield spread of 56 basis points above the comparable US Treasury. The success of the deal, boosted by strong Japanese demand, should help pave the way for further issues by Ontario, which is expected to have a hefty borrowing programme again this year. Demand for fresh paper is exaggerated by the lack of current-coupon paper trading below par, even in the US Treasury market, after the recent rally. Bullish sentiment is skewing demand towards the longer end. However, a Dollars 250m five-year deal for Toyota Motor Credit Corporation also met strong demand. The triple-A rated issue, priced to yield 43 basis points above the curve, attracted both institutional and retail buying. Meanwhile, the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn 10-year issue due to be launched today has already met strong buying interest, and is expected to be oversubscribed. Demand in the Ecu bond market has been boosted by lack of supply and bullish sentiment on European markets generally. Uncertainty about the Ecu's future has abated since the Maastricht summit. Dealers said interest is focused strongly on the longer end of the market. Short-dated paper, mainly swap-driven, is proving difficult to sell, as rates at the short end of the yield curve are not attractive compared with short-term deposit rates. Investors are keen to buy longer-dated paper which would benefit more from any rally in the market. The Council of Europe yesterday launched the first sizeable Ecu transaction since the run up to the Maastricht conference. The Ecu500m issue, fungible with an outstanding Ecu500m deal with nine years to run, met strong demand, despite its premium issue price. The deal was bid at 103.05, above its reoffer price of 103. A two-year deal for General Electric Capital Corporation met little demand, according to dealers, but the lead manager, IBJ International, said that Swiss retail investors are expected to buy the deal. In the French market, Credit Foncier launched a FFr500m eight-year deal with redemption linked to the CAC-40 French stock index. The structure of the deal ensures that the investor cannot lose any principal, but benefits each time the index exceeds a predetermined threshold. Elsewhere, a DM200m five-year deal for Fiat Finance &amp; Trade was considered fairly priced and met firm, mainly domestic, demand. But some investors were deterred from buying a DM500m deal for Austria, despite the strength of the credit, because the bonds can be redeemed early at the option of the borrower. In the Swiss market, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development raised SFr50m through an issue of loan certificates via Swiss Volksbank. The paper will not be actively traded. The Bank of Greece plans to launch a Dollars 250m offering of five-year bonds which will be sold in Europe, the Far East, and also in the US under the provisions of the SEC's Rule 144A. The deal, Greece's first in the straight dollar bond market, is designed to diversify the investor base of a borrower which has in the past relied largely on bank financing.</p>

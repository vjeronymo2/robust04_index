			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS MISSING FROM FIRST TEAM OF ALL-MISL  </P> <P> The All-MISL Team, selected two weeks before the playoffs began and announced  Wednesday, reflects the Sockers' 25-27 regular-season record -- none of the  players from the league champion were selected to the first team.  </P> <P> Defender Kevin Crow was named to the second team, and midfielder Branko Segota  and defender George Fernandez were honorable mention.  </P> <P> Socker playoff MVP Brian Quinn, who had career post-season highs for assists  (17) and points (26), said the voting by two media members in each league city  was fair based on the regular season. Quinn, a midfielder, missed 18 of those  games because of a hamstring strain and then a groin strain. He was not among  the 18 players selected.  </P> <P> "We didn't have any star performers during the regular season to warrant it,"  Quinn said. "It's nice to have the championship."  </P> <P> Said Crow: "Brian Quinn had probably the best playoff season in the history of  the sport but missed (so many games) during the regular season," Crow said.  </P> <P> Crow finished the season with 92 blocked shots and 20 points in 51 games.  During the playoffs, he had a club-record 37 blocked shots, second best ever.  In his five previous MISL seasons, he had been on the All-MISL first team four  times and honorable mention once. His sixth All-MISL mention as a defender ties  Kansas City's Kim Roentved for the league record.  </P> <P> During the regular season, Segota had 27 goals and 34 assists in 44 games. He  has earned All-MISL mention eight times in nine years, tying Steve Zungul for  the most ever.  </P> <P> This is the first all-league honor for Fernandez, after seven indoor seasons.  Fernandez had a team- and career-high 98 blocked shots and was the MVP of the  MISL All-Star game in San Diego. He has played in 132 consecutive  regular-season games, 177 including playoffs. Both are club records.  </P> <P> All-MISL  </P> <P> First team: Tatu, F, Dallas; Jan Goossens, F, Kansas City; Preki, M, Tacoma;  Wes McLeod, D, Dallas; Bruce Savage, D, Baltimore; Scott Manning, GK,  Baltimore.  </P> <P> Second team: Michael King, F, Cleveland; Dale Mitchell, F, Kansas City; Tim  Wittman, M, Baltimore; Kevin Crow, D, Sockers; Mike Powers, D, Dallas; Joe  Papaleo, GK, Dallas.  </P> <P> Honorable mention: Dale Ervine, F, Wichita; Domenic Mobilio, F, Baltimore;  Branko Segota, M, Sockers; Fernando Clavijo, D, St. Louis; George Fernandez, D,  Sockers; Slobo Ilijevski, GK, St. Louis.  </P></p>

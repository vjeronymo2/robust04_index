			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 5 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Presidents  Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Rafael Angel Calderon of  Costa Rica signed a bilateral free trade agreement in Mexico  City. The treaty will expand their economic exchange as of  1995. Salinas de Gortari and Calderon signed the document at a  ceremony in Los Pinos presidential residence after the Costa  Rican president's arrival in Mexico for a two-day visit that  will end tomorrow.    Costa Rica is the first Central American country to sign a  free trade agreement with Mexico. The latter is holding similar  negotiations with Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and  Honduras.    "This treaty will allow a greater flow of commerce and  investments between our countries" and will strengthen the ties  of friendship and cooperation between Mexico and Costa Rica,  Calderon said in a speech he gave at the event, which was also  attended by Salinas de Gortari. Calderon said: "The 21st century  begins for Costa Ricans" with the signing of this treaty. He  said the agreement represents "a great step toward" Costa Rica's  future integration into NAFTA, signed by Canada, the United  States, and Mexico, which has been in effect since January.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCMACKIN TEMPERS EL CAMINO REAL BATS  </P> <P> Reed McMackin admittedly has the fabled temper of an Irishman.  </P> <P> So, too, it seems, does Ryan McGuire.  </P> <P> And both showed it in Tuesday's West Valley League baseball showdown between  Chatsworth and El Camino Real highs.  </P> <P> Still smarting from an early-season loss to McGuire and El Camino Real,  McMackin, a senior right-hander, psyched himself into a controlled rage for the  rematch. And he confounded the Conquistadores, hurling a three-hitter with six  strikeouts as the Chancellors emerged with a 9-3 victory at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The win moved Chatsworth (16-4-1, 8-3-1 in league play) to within two games of  first-place El Camino Real (13-2-1, 10-1-1) with both teams scheduled to play  again Thursday at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> "I wanted to come out and beat them and prove to people that I had some stuff,"  said McMackin, who improved his record to 7-2. "It was kind of a moral victory.  I've never pitched well against these guys."  </P> <P> McMackin was charged with the loss last month when El Camino Real defeated  Chatsworth, 6-2. McGuire, a senior left-hander who has signed to attend UCLA,  allowed only one hit in 5 1/3 innings to earn the win.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, McGuire (5-1) walked five batters in the first inning (he threw 47  pitches) and eight by the time he exited in the fourth with Chatsworth ahead,  5-0.  </P> <P> McGuire, who was hitless in three at-bats, also struck out twice -- both times  swinging at 3-2 fastballs. He has struck out only five times this season.  </P> <P> Afterward, a visibly disgusted McGuire sarcastically remarked that his head was  elsewhere.  </P> <P> "There is no excuse for a performance like that," McGuire said, fuming. "I  didn't pitch well at all. The first inning was a pretty good indication of how  I was throwing. I had a lousy day."  </P> <P> Despite wildness, McGuire struck out the side in the first inning and limited  Chatsworth to a 2-0 lead. He struck out the side in order in the second inning  and in the third collected his seventh of eight strikeouts.  </P> <P> McGuire, however, walked three more batters in the fourth and allowed three  hits as Chatsworth scored six times.  </P> <P> Adam Pearlman and Mike Mancuso did the most damage with run-scoring singles in  the inning.  </P> <P> McMackin retired 11 of the first 12 batters he faced before El Camino Real  struck for two runs -- one unearned -- in the fifth.  </P> <P> McMackin doused the threat with consecutive strikeouts of Sean Boldt and  pinch-hitter Evan Howland with a runner at second.  </P></p>

For the past few months, the units of the Western Army's  territory have been making great efforts to guarantee every  worker the resources that will allow him to do his work with a  maximum of security for his life. Also, existing technical  difficulties in various types of equipment -- especially that  used in engineering tasks -- have been solved by means of  interesting innovations. Regrettable work accidents have thereby  been avoided. Among those centers with best results is the  Western Army's rearguard technical safety unit [unidad de  aseguramiento tecnico de retaguardia], which has made over 1,800  gloves for use in soldering or in agricultural activities.    Sixteen papers are being analyzed here today, selected from  the 50 submitted at the grassroots level. A jury will choose the  best six, which will then be presented at the Army's ninth  science and technology forum. They will also (?be presented) in  the campaign at the level of the [entire] Armed Forces,  scheduled for 14 and 15 June, which happens to be the 20th  anniversary of the [creation of the] FAR's [Revolutionary Armed  Forces'] technical inspection and labor protection specialty.</p>

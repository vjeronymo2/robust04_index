			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: France sharpens missile strategy  -David Buchan examines global reorganisation of the defence industry French missile-makers' international negotiations are gathering pace. Matra is pledged to form a joint missile company with British Aerospace (BAe) by the end of the year. Aerospatiale is locked into similar discussions with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) with a view to merging their missile interests into a single unit with a market share rivalling Hughes of the US. The role of the French missile companies will be crucial to any industry reorganisation. For one thing, there are more of them than in any other European country. In addition to Matra and Aerospatiale, there is Thomson-CSF, the heavyweight of French defence electronics, and a host of smaller electronic suppliers. France has also cut its defence equipment budget by less than other European countries in the last three years, and plans to increase it slightly next year, to FFr103bn (Dollars 17.5bn). The French defence sector's total turnover has declined from its high point of FFr124.5bn in 1990 to FFr113bn last year, largely due to the drop in export deliveries, to FFr29bn. New orders, however, hit a record FFr45.7bn last year, with Taiwan's decision to buy Dassault's Mirage jets and Matra's missiles, and Abu Dhabi's purchase of the Leclerc tank made by France's state-controlled Giat Industries. A recent parliamentary report forecast that 40,000 jobs would disappear from the defence and aerospace sectors, but that the precipitous fall-off in civil aviation business and space research was mostly to blame for this. Mr Henri Conze, procurement chief in the French defence ministry, believes the current merger talks among missile-makers may set in train a wider reorganisation in defence electronics. Mr Conze, who runs Europe's biggest defence equipment budget, predicts that '1994 will be the year of mergers and concentrations in the European missile industry'. The most advanced of the talks is the planned joint venture between Matra and BAe, whose missile products and markets complement each other. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chairman, recently confirmed that the marriage was likely to be consummated by the end of this year. Formal control will be split evenly between the two parent companies. However, Matra is confident of gaining management control because, even without its Taiwan order, its dowry of missile orders is larger than BAe's. Aerospatiale acknowledges that its talks on merging its missile business with Dasa are less advanced, and points out that the two companies took more than two years to negotiate their Eurocopter joint venture. However, the two companies have already worked together for 20 years in their joint Euromissile arrangement. In any event, the German orientation of Aerospatiale should do the company no harm with Mr Conze, who has proposed setting up a Franco-German arms agency as the possible precursor of the European arms agency, foreshadowed in the Maastricht treaty. Might these two joint entities then merge to form one big European missile-maker? Matra, BAe, even some people at Dasa, favour that. Aerospatiale says it is open-minded at this stage. So is its owner, the French government. 'It is not impossible,' says Mr Conze, 'though at present it is impossible to say whether the two joint ventures would stay apart, or come together, or have some gentleman's agreement to share markets or products.' However, he believes that the imminent mergers in the actual manufacture of missiles could lead to changed relationships in other parts of the missile business. These include 'upstream' designers of entire weapons systems, such as Thomson and BAe, which are also to be found 'downstream' as suppliers of missile components. There is also French companies such as Dassault Electronique, SAT, and Sagem; German companies such as TST (part of Dasa) and BGT (part of Diehl); and British companies such as GEC-Marconi. 'Sorting out the missile-makers is the easiest part, but other areas may have to be tackled,' says the French arms chief. Having formed a joint venture with Shorts of Belfast on very short-range missiles last March, Thomson-CSF is standing aloof from the current missile merger game. Its president, Mr Alain Gomez, has a more urgent dossier on his table: the government's desire to know soon whether the defence company should be privatised with or without Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE). The privatisation of Aerospatiale is clearly more distant. And this is not just because of deepening losses - FFr 870m in the first half of this year - which Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, hopes soon to remedy with a capital increase. Presenting the company for sale before the 1995 election would almost certainly provoke a row with President Mitterrand, who has on several occasions proclaimed his opposition to putting France's nuclear missile-maker into private hands.</p>

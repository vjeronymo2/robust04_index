			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard allows police to test truncheon alternative MR MICHAEL HOWARD yes-terday used his first speech as home secretary to accept a police request that new batons should be tested as a replacement for truncheons. But he also signalled a fresh approach for the Tories on crime prevention. In a speech to senior police officers, Mr Howard adopted language previously more familiar to the Labour party, saying he felt 'passionately that we must do everything we can to build a strong and effective partnership between the police and the public'. Mr Howard also indicated that he was keen to steer away from the confrontational style of his predecessor Mr Kenneth Clarke, and that he wanted to co-operate with police forces in enhancing the role of local police authorities. Trips to police stations have been a high priority for Mr Howard. He spent Tuesday night on patrol with the Metropolitan Police in Brixton. Local police authorities are to be given responsibility for setting their own budgets and will draw up with the chief constable local policing plans setting out priorities and how they will be met, Mr Howard said. He said responsibility should be devolved as far as possible so that police officers closest to the problems can do their job with the minimum of interference. A white paper on the organisation, structure and management of the police service will be published soon by the Home Office. Mr Howard said that an effective partnership between the police and the public would give the 'best possible' chance of fighting crime successful-ly. He announced that an new side-handled baton was to be tested in an effort to give more protection to the police, particularly to women officers. The baton is collapsible, meaning it is less conspicuous to carry than rigid versions. Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said the move was, 'sensible, particularly because of the problems policewomen are facing - with increasing numbers of attacks on them'.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Aircraft subsidies talks resume EC and US negotiators began last-ditch talks on subsidies for civil aircraft manufacturers yesterday, determined to resolve remaining differences. 'We really are going into this session here tonight with the purpose of finishing this,' said a senior EC official before the meeting began. The talks were expected to run late into the night and could continue today even though the two sides' self-imposed deadline for a solution expired at midnight. This is the third time in a fortnight that Mr Hugo Paemen, EC senior trade negotiator, and Mr Michael Moskow, US deputy trade representative, have met for talks centred on the level of direct government subsidies for Airbus Industrie, the EC manufacturing consortium, and indirect grants for US manufacturers. Both sides have commented on the positive atmosphere of last week's Washington talks. The problem now is working out the exact levels of subsidy each side will allow the other and concede on behalf of its own manufacturers. Negotiators are thought to be talking about direct subsidy levels of between 30 and 35 per cent, compared with the EC's original offer to reduce the level to 45 per cent. In return, the US would have to peg indirect support to perhaps as low as 5 per cent.</p>

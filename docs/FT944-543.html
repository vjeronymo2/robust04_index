			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Russian oil market reform A new system of regulating the Russian foreign and domestic oil markets will come into force on January 1, according to a senior Russian official. The system seems certain to run counter to the views of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and thus threatens the delivery of the crucial aid to the Russian budget by these institutions next year. Mr Andrei Dogayev, a deputy trade minister, told the Interfax news agency yesterday that a new system - scrapping the oil export quotas but replacing them with a requirement on oil companies to dedicate 65 per cent of their output to domestic consumers - had been 'definitively agreed'. He also said that the present system, under which 14 approved companies will have the exclusive right to export oil, would be maintained, and that tariffs and other methods would be used to regulate exports.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why the west must support the role of women in Russian politics Sir, Your correspondent, Leyla Boulton, writing on women in Russian politics ('Few ladies in red', December 4/5), highlights a truly critical factor the British and other western governments should be taking seriously and putting money into - namely, the manner in which women throughout the former Soviet Union and satellites are being shoved out of politics and civic life to a really startling degree. Over the past year I have been putting on workshops for women would-be politicians in central Europe from Bucharest and Budapest and Brno and Warsaw to Prague, for Harvard University's Project Liberty. A fortnight ago we put on a two-day workshop in Prague on 'handling the press and media in the post-totalitarian era'. Our workshop presenters included Gemma Hussey, former Irish cabinet minister, Bernadette Vallely, director of the Women's Environmental Network, Dr Jara Moserova, a Czech MP and former Czech ambassador to Australia, the BBC's impressive local 'stringer', Zdena Tomin, and me, as the founder of the all-party 300 Group for women in politics and public life in the UK. The weekend was incredibly successful. We need to repeat such events at least six times a year in each of the central and eastern European countries. But it is harder for Project Liberty (because, I presume, we are energising, educating and training women for democracy) to get decent funding than the proverbial chimera to prod a western government in the place it matters - the pocket not the rhetoric. How come we can subsidise tobacco growing in regions where they would be far better off growing food crops for under-nourished populations, yet Project Liberty and the marvellous resources it can call on from trainers in the UK and the Irish Republic and US has to look like it is begging? Without women taking a full civic role in central and eastern Europe we and our children will have a thousand Bosnias to watch on television for decades to come.

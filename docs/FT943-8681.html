			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Observer: Thingamajig The good news is that Sir William Purves, HSBC Holdings' panjandrum, has finally held his first press conference in London to talk about the profits of his giant banking group which gobbled up Midland Bank some time ago. The bad news is that Sir Willie - who has presented results in his beloved Hong Kong until now - did not let off any verbal fireworks. Instead, journalists were treated to a benign canter through the figures. Apart from ruminating about what 'my old mother in Edinburgh' might think about the group's bond losses and a passing reference to 'the governor of the Bank of England, and whatnot', Sir Willie's dry humour was kept under control. An entertaining first outing, but Sir Willie can do better.</p>

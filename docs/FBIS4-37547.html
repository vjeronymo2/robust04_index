			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah, followed </F> by remarks in response to questions by unidentified  correspondents; after an extraordinary meeting of the Council of  Ministers in Beirut on 20 June--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Samahah] The Council of Ministers held an  extraordinary session this evening that was attended by his  excellency the president of the Republic.    During the session, the Council of Ministers approved the  law  on audiovisual media and referred it to the Chamber of Deputies  for ratification. [passage omitted]    As approved by the Council of Ministers this evening, the  audiovisual media law is basically characterized by the tendency  to diversify the types of media establishments and guarantee  their respect for the spirit and text of the Constitution, the  national accord document, and the principle of enhancing  Lebanese impunity based on integration and [word indistinct].  Moreover, it takes into consideration the adoption of a modern  approach, both legally and practically, to the components of  audiovisual media with a view to giving media establishments a  legal status as being more serious establishments that basically  depend on the national Lebanese production in their programs and  freely select programs that respect our family, social, and  national values to enrich the minds of our viewers and listeners  and keep them informed about local and foreign news. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] What about political programs and newscasts?    [Samahah] Political newscasts will be unrestricted for the  establishments that apply for a license as public institutions  broadcasting political news and programs within the context of  established laws.    [Correspondent] Were amendments introduced on the law?    [Samahah] This 13-chapter and 47-article law underwent an  in-depth discussion by the Council of Ministers and by the ad  hoc committee before and after the cabinet session. Many  amendments were introduced to enrich the law out of the  cabinet's carefulness to safeguard the citizen's constitutional  freedom.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Samahah] In the bill approved this evening, the government  does not accept the state's control of shares in any mass media,  apart from what the state already owns in Tele-Liban. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Will you permit mass media to broadcast the  proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies session tomorrow at the  suggestion of Speaker Nabih Birri?    [Samahah] We discussed the speaker's suggestion to let  private mass media broadcast the proceedings of the Chamber of  Deputies session tomorrow. The Council of Ministers decided to  make this exclusive to Tele-Liban.    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Samahah] The law did not address encouraging or  discouraging  the parties to do that. Just like other public institutions and  citizens, parties have the right to have their own beliefs and  to express these beliefs [words indistinct]    [Correspondent] Is it possible to allow private radios to  broadcast newscasts at present, before the bill is enforced?    [Samahah] Up to now, nothing can be added to the cabinet  decision on 23 March to suspend newscasts, until the bill is  enforced. I cannot add anything to that decision. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Samahah] Practical measures to retype the law will be taken  tomorrow or after tomorrow [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [question indistinct]    [Samahah] According to the new law, the employment agency  can  own 35 percent of the shares of the radio or television company.  Regular persons cannot own more than 10 percent of shares.  [passage omitted]</p>

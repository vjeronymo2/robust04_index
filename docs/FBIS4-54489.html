			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 29 Apr 94 carries in  its regular 10-minute newscast two reports on fighting in the  republic.    Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports on the  situation  in the town and says that "the chetniks have withdrawn outside  the 3-km exclusion zone on the left bank of the Drina River, but  on the right bank, they are still on the positions that they  occupied before the arrival of the UN Protection Forces. It is  true that they are quiet and there is no sniper and antiaircraft  activity in the town and surrounding villages. However, there  is large-scale looting. They [Serbs] are systematically taking  everything from the villages of (?Bubijer) and Fazlagici, and  there is sporadic torching of property. The chetniks on the  northwestern part of the front used artillery to target civilian  targets in Brdarici, [name indistinct], and (?Unje). Moreover,  they attempted an infantry breakthrough in the region on  Brdarici."    Mirudin Aldobasic, correspondent from the 7-South Operative  Group Information Service, reports that "a large concentration  of tanks and other armored hardware has been sighted in the  areas of Putnikovo Brdo, Plane, and Usce, and artillery on the  northern and western parts of the front, particularly in the  wider areas of Kriz, Kalosevic, and the Tesanj-Teslic  demarcation lines. The aggressor is also carrying out  large-scale regrouping on the western slopes of Mt. Ozren and is  directing the massive equipment toward (?Sevadlije), Jagotic  Polje, Srbuk, and Maglaj. Overnight and early this morning, the  Serbian terrorists have been perpetrating constant small arms'  provocations. Snipers are also active on most of the front."</p>

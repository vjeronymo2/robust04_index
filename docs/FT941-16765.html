			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Secret payments by Lonrho alleged: Writ claims director got Pounds 555,000 for help against Fayeds Lonrho is alleged to have paid Pounds 555,000 to the former finance director of House of Fraser, a man who supplied damaging information on the owners of Harrods to the Bank of England and a House of Commons select committee. Details of the alleged secret payments to Mr Graham Jones, which included Pounds 100,000 paid into a Liechtenstein bank account, are disclosed in a writ lodged in the High Court yesterday by House of Fraser, which is owned by the Egyptian Fayed brothers. The Lonrho memo authorising the Pounds 100,000 payment to Mr Jones said it was for 'his assistance with House of Fraser matters'. House of Fraser is suing Mr Jones for breach of confidence. The writ says that in 1990 Mr Jones supplied financial information to Lonrho which helped the conglomerate in its propaganda war against House of Fraser. Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's joint chief executive, had been fighting the Fayeds since 1985, when they bought House of Fraser for Pounds 615m. He had always wanted to own the store group and believed that the Fayeds had won it by deception. Last October he made peace with the Fayeds and is understood to have given them documents allowing them to launch their case against Mr Jones. 'I will not make any comment at all,' said Mr Jones, who resigned in November as chief financial officer of Qantas, the Australian airline, when asked yesterday about the payments. The writ says that between April 1990 and June 26 1991 he received Pounds 555,418.07 from the Lonrho group. He had left House of Fraser in January 1990 with a compensation package the company described as substantial. Mr Jones had also signed a letter terminating his employment in which he undertook not to disclose confidential information about the company. The writ says that in June 1990, Mr Jones supplied information to a Bank of England manager, Mr Peter Filmer, that the Fayeds were not fit to own Harrods Bank, a small banking subsidiary of House of Fraser. In April, Mr Jones had written to the Bank governor, at that time Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, claiming that Mr Mohamed Fayed had wanted to circumvent regulations preventing the bank receiving a Pounds 100m deposit from the Sultan of Brunei. The Bank was unaware that Lonrho was paying Mr Jones. In June 1991, it forced the Fayeds to surrender their management control of Harrods Bank to an independent trustee, although the Fayeds retained control of non-voting shares in it. However, it is understood that the Bank took this action mainly as a result of an investigation into the House of Fraser takeover by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors, which said that the Fayeds had dishonestly misrepresented their origins, wealth and business interests. Mr Jones is also alleged to have informed the House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee, which was examining House of Fraser's ownership of Harrods Bank, that its banking facilities would be withdrawn in the following 18 months. A member of that committee said yesterday that even if the committee had known Lonrho was paying Mr Jones, the committee would not have changed its view that the Fayeds should give up control of Harrods bank. The writ says Mr Jones tried to persuade House of Fraser's banks to withdraw their loan facilities. Mr Ernie Cole, who was then a senior executive of Midland Bank, which was House of Fraser's lead bank, said yesterday he had several conversations with Mr Jones and was 'not pleased' to be told of the alleged payments to him by Lonrho. Mr Terry Robinson, a former Lonrho director who was responsible for compiling propaganda documents attacking House of Fraser, said yesterday it was 'extremely surprising' that Lonrho had provided information to the Fayeds on its relationship with Mr Jones. Mr Rowland yesterday referred all questions on his relationship with Mr Jones to the Fayeds. Harrods boss moves to settle an old score, Page 4</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Banesto and after Back in July Spain's fourth largest bank, Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), raised about Dollars 775m from international and domestic investors. The offer, to which the highly respected US bank J. P. Morgan lent its imprimatur, was a notable success. Yet within less than five months Banesto has had to be rescued by the Bank of Spain. Its directors have this week been unceremoniously hoofed out and nominees of the central bank put in their place to restructure the institution. J. P. Morgan's name is a little less illustrious. Such an abrupt reversal of fortune and reputation is a matter of concern not only to investors in Banesto, but to the wider financial community. As yet, details of the deterioration in Banesto's finances remain scarce. To that extent, all conclusions must be provisional at this stage. Yet it is clear that the scale of the increased provisions required to cover the fall in the value of its assets would leave it substantially in breach of the central bank's capital adequacy requirements. That is the only possible interpretation of the Bank of Spain's decision to provide a guarantee of liquidity in domestic and foreign markets. The more difficult questions concern the speed of the deterioration, and the failure of J. P. Morgan to see what was coming. Representatives of the US bank repeatedly described Banesto as a low-risk investment. Yet by conventional banking standards its balance sheet was fundamentally unsound. As the owner of Spain's biggest private sector industrial holding company, it was excessively exposed to fluctuations in the value of its share stakes in large Spanish companies. Indeed, the formal documents to the flotation in July emphasised that a majority of the companies in this industrial portfolio were in basic industries characterised by high fixed costs and volatile earnings. Industrial exposure Banesto's industrial exposure was, in fact, in excess of the Bank of Spain's required ceiling. But it had been given until 1998 to reduce these holdings to the appropriate extent. It was bound to remain vulnerable as long as this old-fashioned industrial banking structure remained in place. An increase in provisions against the fall in the value of these investments will no doubt prove to be one of the factors that has led to the rescue. Another will be the deterioration in the loan book due to the recession in Spain. While Banesto is predominantly a retail bank, it is heavily exposed to the small and medium-sized businesses that suffer disproportionately in any downturn. Moreover, an aggressive management had expanded the loan book very rapidly at the peak of a protracted and euphoric economic upturn. This ill-timed dash for market share inevitably leaves Banesto in weaker shape than many of its rivals. Warning signs Other tell-tale warning signs were the readiness of the management, under Mr Mario Conde, to alienate the Bank of Spain, which would have preferred Banesto to find a partner in one of the country's more healthy banking groups. Mr Conde's reluctance to accommodate an institution that wields draconian power over the Spanish banking system cannot have helped his case. While there is a widespread suspicion that the Bank of Spain has treated Banesto with unusual severity, there must also be a question mark over the quality of banking supervision. Banesto was subjected to an inspection of supposedly unusual rigour a year ago. In the light of this week's events, it looks as though the inspectors may not have been quite as rigorous as they should have been. The problems of international investors in Banesto are probably best seen as an inevitable part of the learning process in cross-border investment. Banking practice in continental Europe, despite its apparent profitability, is not always quite what it seems to the foreign observer. Spanish accounting is notoriously opaque and the worth of an audit report, despite the familiarity of an internationally known company's name, can vary substantially from country to country. There will be more upsets in cross-border banking deals, just as there will be financial scandals in emerging stock markets. The surprise with Banesto lies more in the blow to J. P. Morgan's reputation than the rescue of the bank itself.</p>

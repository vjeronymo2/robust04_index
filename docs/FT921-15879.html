			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Anti-peace forces strike a blow in Yugoslavia: Some elements want both EC and UN out of the country THE SHOOTING down of a European Community helicopter north of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, yesterday comes at a crucial juncture in peace negotiations involving the United Nations and the EC. The tragedy appears to be in the interests of no one side in the conflict. But a western diplomat said: 'Some forces simply do not want the peace process to succeed.' Diplomats said the timetable for the negotiations could be jeopardised by the incident unless all sides - Croat, Serb and federal army - insisted that the peace process continue even in the face of violent defiance by uncontrolled elements. Croatia wants a ceasefire and UN forces in order to speed up recognition of its independence. It also needs stability to cope with half a million refugees and to rebuild its war-torn economy and infrastructure. The Serbian government wants a ceasefire because an anti-war movement is growing in the republic, along with shortages of raw materials, and it fears that it will be isolated by the international community. Sections of the army, which remains out of political or constitutional control, want a ceasefire because they know that if the war spreads, they will not be able to consolidate their gains. However, according to western military attaches, hardline army nationalists who oppose Croatia's independence, and who support Serb nationalist rebels inside Croatia, appear determined to fight on. Today, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, is due to hold talks with Mr Milan Babic, head of Serbs in the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina in southern Croatia. Mr Babic, and other hardline Serb nationalist leaders in eastern Slavonia, east of Croatia, recently defied the Serbian leader's acceptance of the latest UN-sponsored ceasefire and the deployment of UN troops. They said they would refuse to disarm, or allow UN troops be deployed in these Serb-inhabited regions. By challenging Mr Milosevic, Serb rebels in Croatia appear to be acting independently of Belgrade and increasing the possibility of a formal split. In Bosnia-Hercegovina, the authority of Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the republic's Serbs who has close contacts with Mr Milosevic, is also being undermined by nationalist Serbs. These Bosnian Serbs are threatening to support the rebel Serbs in Krajina by declaring their own republic, and defying any ceasefire. As unity among Serbs weakens, a formal split among Serbs in these three republics could not only scupper the peace process but also lead to a spread of the fighting to the ethnically-mixed republic of Bosnia. Western diplomats said radical factions in the federal army could end up supporting nationalist Serbs in Croatia, and in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia. 'Yesterday's tragic incident could well play into the hands of the Serb nationalists, who, unlike many Serbs in Serbia, do not want an end to the fighting until they have their own separate republics,' one said. The issue of recognition of four of the six Yugoslav republics is one of the items under discussion tomorrow when the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia is scheduled to reconvene in Brussels. On January 15, EC countries will decide on recognising the republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Said a western diplomat: 'Some forces simply want the UN and EC to forget about recognition, and get out of Yugoslavia. All sides in the conflict should defy these people.'</p>

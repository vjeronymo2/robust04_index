During the  interview, the Dalai Lama -- stressing a realistic line -- said  that complete independence for Tibet has become quite  impossible, and the future of Tibet lies in the federation of a  Tibetan autonomous government with the PRC Government. It will  be interesting to see how the Chinese government will react to  the Dalai Lama's proposal for an autonomous Tibetan government  and federation.    The Dalai Lama stated, "The autonomous government delegates  its powers in relation to foreign policy and defense to China."  He disclosed that China has already been unofficially informed  of this plan. He also indicated that officials of the Tibetan  government in exile have been making behind-the-scenes contacts  with the Chinese leadership, and certain developments can be  expected in the near future.    However, regarding the frequent anti-China demonstrations in  the Tibet Autonomous Region presently under PRC rule, the Dalai  Lama said this is "a reflection of serious violations of human  rights." He urged Western nations to continue to pay serious  attention to the violations of human rights occurring in Tibet.    Furthermore, the Dalai Lama expressed serious concern about  the environmental problem in Tibet, claiming that due to the  Chinese government's program for rapid economic development in  the Tibet Autonomous Region, there has been serious erosion of  top soil, and large scale destruction of the natural  environment. Linpoche [name as published], vice chairman of the  Tibetan Parliament in exile, who was also present at the  interview, criticized the PRC Government's deforestation. He  said the total area of forest in Tibet, which was 220,000 square  km in 1949, had diminished to 130,000 square km in 1985, and  this continues to decrease.    The Dalai Lama also strongly protested China's "cultural  genocide," claiming Tibetan culture, which has a history of its  own centering on Buddhism, is deteriorating gradually owing to  the PRC Government's uniform school education in the Tibet  Autonomous Region.</p>

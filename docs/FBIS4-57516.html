			<p>BFN     [Text] The Panamanian foreign ministry has dismissed a  deputy's charges that the Cuban Government intervened in the  electoral campaign to favor the opposition, the Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD], which won the 8 May elections. A week  before the elections, Leo Gonzalez, a deputy from the  Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement, presented a series of  documents to the Panamanian foreign ministry allegedly revealing  that the Cuban Government had provided support and technical  advice to Ernesto Perez' electoral campaign, which will put the  PRD at the helm of the nation on 1 September.    The foreign ministry reached the conclusion that the  documents are a forgery; it therefore closed the investigation  and dismissed the information revealed by the deputy.    Miguel Martinez, Cuban charge d'affaires in Panama, said he  had affirmed from the beginning that the documents were forged  and that he was confident that the Panamanian foreign ministry  would handle the issue carefully.</p>

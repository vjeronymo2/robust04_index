			<p>CSO     [Text] The central government plans to crack down on  rapidly increasing pollution and reinforce environment laws in a  sweep of 10 provinces next month.    The probe is being organized by the Environmental Protection  Committees of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State  Council.    All violators will be punished and their actions released to  the media, said Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing  committee.    Wang said some people still work against State laws and  stipulations on environmental protection.    New industrial projects have been built without reporting to  the local environmental departments and some have caused large  amounts of pollution.    The poaching, killing and sale of endangered animals under  national protection is still rampant in some places.    And inspectors will be looking to get rid of small cement  plants, paper mills, petrochemical works and smelting furnaces  that have been banned but are making a comeback.    The new effort will target 10 provinces and autonomous  regions: Hebei, Jilin, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan,  Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi.    The inspections will check on law enforcement, environmental  controls and wildlife protection, in addition to the  implementation of STate regulations on forestry, water and soil  preservation.    Song Jian, Director of the State council's Environment  Protection Committee, called for changes in the law to include  criminal penalties as severe as those faced by smugglers and  drug traffickers.    Such penalties should include jail, he said.    Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental  Protection Agency (NEPA), reported the illegal poaching, killing  and smuggling of protected wild animals had survived despite  repeated government sweeps.    Some hotels and restaurants still make a fortune out of  dishes based on rare animals.    Xie said some regions have brought in foreign projects that  fall short of Nepa requirements, while others have imported  harmful waste.    Technologically poor equipment and a lack of  counter-pollution measures in many rural enterprises account for  severe pollution and ecological disturbance in a wide range of  areas, he said.    City residents most often complain about pollution from  waste  water, waste gas and trash and noise.    Some areas have eagerly launched high energy and  pollution-prone projects at the expense of the environment as  they greedily pursue short-term economic benefits, the official  said.    Air quality in only a few of the 500 major cities has  reached  the State's first-grade standard, he added, and acid rain has  spread from South China to some hinterland districts.</p>

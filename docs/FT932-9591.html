			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Anger at water sell-off proposal DELEGATES yesterday left the government in no doubt that they want it to abandon any idea of transferring the ownership of Scotland's water industry to the private sector. Speakers in the opening debate at the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh were warmly applauded as they urged ministers to drop outright privatisation from the options they are considering for the restructuring of the water industry. Mr John Young, a former Tory leader of Glasgow district council, said the government should 'show the red card' to privatisation. Scottish Office ministers are drawing up a scheme for restructuring the water industry when local government moves in 1996 from a two tier to a single tier system under a scheme whose details have yet to be finalised. The water and sewerage industry needs to be restructured because it is currently run by the nine regional councils which are to disappear under local government reform. Ministers want to bring in private capital to fund Pounds 5bn of improvements, half of it to be spent bringing standards into line with EC directives, without recourse to public funds. Tories are acutely aware that the privatisation of water is highly unpopular with Scots, with 98 per cent opposing it in a recent opinion poll. Ministers are thought to favour some form of franchising or other ways of bringing in private capital rather than outright privatisation. Flotation would anyway be very difficult to achieve within the lifetime of this parliament. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish local government minister, denied opposition claims that the government had decided on privatisation, in his reply to the local government debate. It would take account of the responses to the consultation paper. It was examining all the options. He said nothing in favour of water privatisation. 'Our task is simply to face up to reality, it is not a question of ideology. Our task is to ensure the most sensible structure to raise the financial resources available,' he said.</p>

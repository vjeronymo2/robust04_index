			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Palestinian Authority member Dr. </F> Samir Ghawshah in Tunis by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jerusalem; date not  given; from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] The PLO headquarters in Tunis is preparing  to close following instructions given by Yasir 'Arafat nearly  one week ago to close of the offices before 15 June in  preparation for the move to the self-rule area. Several  committees have been set up in various offices to follow up this  issue. On this subject, Palestinian Authority member Dr. Samir  Ghawshah says:    [Ghawshah] We are preparing all necessary steps now for  leaving for the Gaza Strip and Jericho area. A number of the  revolution's cadres are preparing themselves. A large number of  security men and policemen who were in Tunisia have left for  Gaza and Jericho. We hope that these preparations can be  completed as soon as possible and before the end of this month  at most.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, have all buildings used by the PLO  leadership in Tunis been handed back to their owners?    [Ghawshah] What happened was that certain buildings and  certain administrative offices that were used by the security  and police forces were decided to be handed over to their owners  before 15 June.    [Mu'addi] Will all offices of the Palestinian leadership be  moved to the self-rule area, or will some offices remain in  Tunis?    [Ghawshah] Most of these offices will be moved, but some  offices will remain, especially the Political Department, which,  according to the agreement, will play its role in following up  political contacts and foreign relations.    [Mu'addi] There are reports saying that 'Arafat's office and  his residence will remain at his disposal at present. Does this  mean that his permanent place of residence will remain in Tunis?    [Ghawshah] I do not think so. On the contrary, his place of  residence will be in the Palestinian territories, and mainly  between Gaza and Jericho, but this does not counter the fact  that brother Yasir 'Arafat has a number of headquarters in a  number of Arab countries, one of which will be in Tunis.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about the arrival of Palestinian  Authority members in the self-rule area? There are conflicting  reports about this subject.    [Ghawshah] As I said, we hope that this will take place  soon,  and that preparations be made as soon as possible so that the  Palestinian Authority will carry out its role in all fields, in  a manner that serves the causes of our people.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, what about appointing the rest of the  Palestinian Authority members?    [Ghawshah] Contacts and consultations are still going on. We  hope that the rest of Palestinian Authority members will be  appointed when the authority arrives in the homeland.</p>

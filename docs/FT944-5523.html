			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Ariane crash may prompt premium rise The crash of a European Ariane rocket and its US satellite payload into the sea off French Guyana on Thursday could prompt a rise in insurance premiums for next year's satellite launches. The insurance industry expects that the accident will mean satellite insurance underwriters will make a loss this year. The crash could also open the way for emerging launch projects in Russia and China. Worldwide claims on satellite insurance policies so far this year total Dollars 736m (Pounds 470m), according to Mr Simon Clapham, lead satellite underwriter at Lloyd's of London. That includes more than Dollars 200m resulting from the crash of the PanAmSat-3 satellite and its launch vehicle. Mr Clapham said the latest setback to Ariane would lead to a reappraisal of rates for planned 1995 satellite launches where insurance cover has not yet been agreed. 'Underwriters are likely to increase rates for these programmes,' he said. Insuring satellites is a notoriously volatile business but has been very profitable for many insurers. Lloyd's insurance market underwrites the biggest share of world satellite policies. About Dollars 35m of the cost of the latest claim was placed at Lloyd's. The latest crash, caused by failure of a third-stage motor, according to Mr Charles Bigot, Arianespace president, brought to seven the number of Ariane rockets lost in 70 space shots since 1979. The previous failure on January 24 this year was also caused by problems with the third stage. Failures have sometimes led to delays as long as 16 months. US-based PanAmSat said it planned to launch a replacement within a year for the lost satellite. 'It's not a major setback. We have a long-term outlook, and we are looking at the next 10-20 years,' said Mr Andrew Jordan, vice-president for the Asia-Pacific region. Hughes Aircraft Company, the designer of PAS-3, had already built components for a spare PAS-3 that could be completed within a year, Mr Jordan said. The satellite was to have covered North and South America, Europe and Africa. Arianespace engineers will seek to recover the wreckage to see why a new version of the rocket's third stage, utilising a new mix of oxygen and hydrogen, failed to ignite properly after the first two stages had brought it to an altitude of 218 kilometres. 'We hope to be back in business soon,' said Mr Bigot at the Kourou launch site in French Guyana. PanAmSat-4, which will cover the area between Hong Kong and Europe, including India and Africa, will be launched on schedule in April or May 1995, he said. Ariane rockets have put 94 satellites and 24 auxiliary loads into orbit successfully. Arianespace has contracts worth FFr17.1bn (Pounds 2bn) to put another 38 satellites into orbit.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Merit in paying MPs by performance Sir, You reported on September 1 that the royal household is to go on to merit pay ('Queen decrees pay by merit') and that Norman Lamont is to work two or three days a week in the City to supplement his MP's salary of Pounds 30,854 ('Lamont returns to City as Rothschild director'). In the interests of providing value for money to the electors/taxpayers and performance incentives for MPs, has the House of Commons considered introducing performance-related pay for itself? Pay could be positively linked to the hours an MP spends providing 'exceptional service' in representing constituents, and inversely related to the time devoted to company directorships, journalism, writing memoirs and sundry other pursuits. Most MPs, presumably, would welcome such an arrangement. David Mannering, 2 Stapleford Close, Chippenham, Wiltshire</p>

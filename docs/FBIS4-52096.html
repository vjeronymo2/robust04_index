			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN Board of Editors: </F> "Continue To Renovate the Thinking on the Task of Defending the  Fatherland--Issues and Solutions"]    [Text] "New Thinking on the Task of Defending the  Fatherland--Issues and Solutions--Research and Exchange of  Opinions" is a new regular section opened in TAP CHI QUOC PHONG  TOAN DAN in 1993. It debuted with an essay of an advisory  character by the board of editors published in issue No. 1/1993.  The section has received an enthusiastic response from large  numbers of leadership, management, and commanding cadres, and  from theoreticians and scientific researchers of various sectors  and levels at the center, in localities, and in the people's  armed forces. By summing up realities in conjunction with  carrying out theoretical research, the section has expressed  numerous opinions, has conducted exchanges of experiences, has  brought up issues, and has suggested solutions. Some of these  opinions have been accepted and are gradually being introduced  into life; some have considered on the occasion of the  preparation for the Midterm Party Conference of Delegates; and  some others call for further research and exchanges of opinions.    The board of editors of TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN  advocates continuing to expand this section of the journal in  1994 for the same set purposes[.sup]1[/], on the basis of the  review of the initial steps of the socialist renovation process  in general and the renovation of the task of defending the  fatherland in particular as laid down by the midterm party  conference of delegates and reflected later in various party  resolutions and state positions and policies.    To contribute to summing up the initial steps of the  renovation process in the task of consolidating national defense  and defending the fatherland, this article raises the  following issues, which are also issues calling for continued  research, exchanges of opinions, and suggestion of solutions in  TAP CHI QUOC PHONG TOAN DAN this year.    1. Hostile forces' strategic thinking and our new  concepts of the task of defending the fatherland.    Monitoring the schemes and tricks used by imperialism to  oppose and sabotage socialism in the Soviet Union, Eastern  Europe, our country in the past, we can see that since the  beginning of the 80's the strategic thinking of  imperialism has changed.    From resorting to armed violence combined with  nonviolent tricks such as politics, psychological warfare,  espionage... as the main way to oppose and sabotage  us, imperialism has shifted to relying on tricks involving  nonuse of armed violence such as politics, psychological  warfare, espionage, economy, culture... as the main  thrust, combining them with military deterrence and  limited armed aggression, which may turn into war of aggression  if an opportunity presents itself and if imperialism believes it  can achieve victory within a short period of time. Other hostile  forces have also strongly switched to different maneuvers,  including the "soft war" trick combined with threat of armed  violence and "hard war."    Pursuing its "peaceful evolution" strategy, imperialism is  feverishly and openly opposing and sabotaging the Vietnamese  revolution by means of "free market economy" and "political  pluralism-democracy-human rights" in various domains: economy,  politics, theory and ideology, culture, art, way of life.... It  is prepared to combine subversive rebellion of reactionary  forces inside the country and military deterrence and armed  aggression from abroad. An extremely dangerous thing is that  imperialism is taking advantage of our renovation undertaking  itself--which also advocates market economy, but one that is  oriented toward socialism--and our broadening of socialist  democracy in an attempt to divert our renovation process to  capitalism. We can predict that, when the United States lifts  the embargo, the enemy's scheme will be stepped up with new  tricks--both subtle and glaring--through direct action or under  the United Nations banner. Thus, danger will develop right in  the opportunity created by the lifting of the embargo.    Along with the hostile forces' activities are the  destabilizing factors in our internal ranks that we should not  ignore: Although our country has overcome the most difficult  periods of the socioeconomic crisis, it still has not yet  extricated itself from the crisis; although progress has been  made in the implementation of democracy among the people, many  limitations still remain; corruption and smuggling activities of  some people in the state machinery are still serious, causing  legitimate indignation among the people; contradictions among  the people and religious and ethnic issues can easily be  exploited by the enemy to incite public opinion; erroneous  political tendencies in a number of circles....    All this combines to increase the dangers threatening the  security of the country and of the socialist regime--dangers  that lie hidden in many domains of social life. All these  possibilities and contingencies have been correctly forecast in  various party resolutions. The obvious question is that we must  frustrate the "peaceful evolution" strategy and other schemes  and tricks of the enemy in peacetime. At the same time we must  be prepared to cope with all limited armed aggressions and even  with wars of aggression. We do not exaggerate the danger of war  of aggression, but we should not be subjective and off our guard.    From the aforementioned situation and considering the  characteristics and background of the current national struggle  and class struggle, we can set forth a number of new  concepts of national defense as follows:    -- The security of the country; the independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the nation; and the  stability of the socialist regime depend chiefly and primarily  on political stability, economic growth, and scientific and  technological development. At the same time, they depend on our  national defense and security potential, on the deterrent might  of the people's army and people's armed forces, on the people's  public security's capability to ensure political security and  social order and safety, and on the people's vigilance.  Therefore, to defend the fatherland we must concentrate on the  task of economic development and national construction; at the  same time, we must devoted ourselves to consolidating national  defense and security. Developing the economy in accordance with  the socialist orientation implies the defense of the regime and  the fatherland, although national defense still has its own  requirements and although we still have to combine economic  development with national defense to make the people prosperous,  the country powerful, and the society just, healthy, and  civilized.    -- Nowadays to defend the fatherland is to defend the  socialist regime, a task closely linked with the defense of  national independence and sovereignty and the state's  territorial integrity (including the land area, the airspace,  the sea, the continental shelf, and the exclusive economic  zone); with the defense of the peaceful labor and the lives and  property of the people; and with the defense of the national  characteristics against both foreign aggressors and internal  enemies. We should criticize the erroneous concept that although  the socialist regime might collapse we could still have the  necessary stability and confidence for building an independent,  free, prosperous, and powerful Vietnamese fatherland. As past  realities in the Soviet Union showed, if the socialist regime in  Vietnam collapsed we can predict what Vietnam and its people  would become in view of the schemes of the hostile and  reactionary forces at home and abroad aimed at exploiting and  provoking contradictions in our internal ranks. If that  happened, could we have peace in order to make the people  prosperous and the country powerful and to defend national  sovereignty?    -- National defense must be a general strategy in which  national defense is closely combined with  security and foreign relations; and even  national defense, security, and foreign relations themselves  must be closely combined with economic development and  national construction in all respects. In this strategy,  security and foreign relations would become increasingly  important as attacking spearheads, while the army and national  defense would serve as deterrent fists.    For this reason, we must not make light of the role of the  people's army and the people's armed forces. Only with  sufficiently strong national defense potential and a  sufficiently strong people's army will we be able to deter local  and foreign hostile forces from engaging in adventurism, to  ensure a peaceful environment for economic development and  national construction, to create the basis for guaranteeing  political security and social order and safety, and to secure  the necessary position and strength for the conduct of foreign  relations. This is not to mention the fact the army is also  duty-bound to participate in ensuring political security, in  economic building....    Building the all-people national defense, the people's army,  and the people's armed forces is not an undertaking solely  designed to prepare us for war; on the contrary, first and best  of all it must be aimed at rolling back the danger of war,  contributing to frustrating all enemy schemes in peacetime  (peaceful evolution, subversive rebellion), consolidating peace,  and, at the same time, creating greater potential in all domains  so that we can stand ready to defeat wars of aggression in any  situation.    Generally speaking, that is the modern thinking on the  task of defending the fatherland, which calls for the  development of a modern model of national defense and  the abandonment of the classical thinking on and model of  national defense based solely on military forces, although in  the modern thinking on national defense the role of armed  violence is by no means eliminated; on the contrary, great  importance must still be attached to this role. Thus, in the  modern model of national defense not only modern weapons and  equipment are mentioned, although appropriate modern weapons and  equipment are still necessary.    2. Proceeding from the characteristics of the situation  in our country, in the region, and in the world, we must  thoroughly understand the revolutionary tasks, the socialist  renovative line of the party in the national defense and  military domains, and must actively build the all-people  national defense system and the people's armed forces.    The initial success of the renovation undertaking in the  domains of military work, national defense consolidation, and  armed forces building is primarily a success of the thorough  understanding of the situation and tasks of the revolution and  the socialist renovative line of the party. To determine the  remaining problems in this domain as well as the directions to  follow in resolving them, we should learn from the  aforementioned lesson. And that lesson is none other than a  thorough understanding of the Marxist viewpoint that the  military must submit to politics and depend on socioeconomic  conditions.    Reality has shown that the situation and tasks of the  revolution and the socialist renovative line in the economic and  political domains have a substantial impact on the building of  the all-people national defense system and the people's armed  forces. We can cite here some characteristics that have the  greatest influence:    -- The peaceful situation, which is different from war,  although this peace is not yet steady.    -- National construction is the foremost task, a factor  different from the past, when fighting was the primary task.  Construction means that we must overcome backwardness and  poverty, a task many times as difficult as the fight against  imperialism and feudalism, as Uncle Ho used to say.    -- Development of a multisectorial commodity-based economy  and a socialist market economy and implementation of an  open-door policy; this is different from the past, when a highly  centralized, planned, and subsidy-based economy narrowly  confined in the socialist system was in force.    -- Meeting our own needs for weapons, equipment, and supply  of materials for national defense and war; this is different  from the past, when we relied on international aid.    -- Building of a Vietnamese rule-of-law state of the people,  by the people, and for the people under the Communist Party  leadership; this is different from the past, when the party  assumed many duties of the administration.    -- New developments of the modern scientific and  technological revolution in the world, which marks a new  qualitative advance of human civilization and profoundly  influences the economic and military affairs and all domains of  social life of each nation and throughout the world.    From the characteristics of the aforementioned situation and  tasks, we can see that:    We have much experience in war especially experience in war  of liberation, mainly on the mainland and in the building of  wartime armed forces. However, we still have little experience  in consolidating national defense and in building peacetime  armed forces. Naturally, we still have to pay utmost attention  to the fact that peace is not yet steady and that there still  are many unsettling factors.    Worse still, we lack experience in building national defense  and the armed forces on the basis of the socialist market  economy and in the process of building a Vietnamese rule-of-law  state under the Communist Party leadership.    We are good at conducting all-people war but have little  experience in building the all-people national defense system  and in conducting war for national defense on land, in the air,  and on the sea--our country can be called a "marine state"  because its sea area is three times as large as its land area.  Therefore, we are still unable to satisfactorily combine  national defense with economic building and various aspects of  national construction in which we should pay much attention to  combining national defense activities with economic building on  the sea. National defense building remains narrowly confined in  many respects and is considered an exclusive duty of the  Ministry of National Defense, the people's army, and the  people's armed forces; this task has not yet been open to all  society and has not yet really become an undertaking of all the  people and all branches of the state from the central to the  local level, especially the central level. We have not yet  promptly made the most of the many achievements in the national  renovation undertaking....    Some positions and policies of our party and state on  national defense and army building have not yet been in harmony  with the market economy and peacetime construction; the supply  of materials and budget for this task has not yet been  rationally ensured as permitted by the situation of the country.    There still are hitches in the relationship between the  party  leadership and the state management. Party resolutions have not  yet been institutionalized; many resolutions have not been  implemented. To a certain degree the state still operates on its  own initiative, on the basis of personal relations, and  according to negotiated agreements.    The problem here is that we must learn from and improve on  past, diversified experiences and creatively apply them to the  new conditions, situations, and tasks. We must overcome  conservatism and empiricism while opposing dogmatism and the  state of being divorced from reality in the past there had been  some dogmatism and empiricism in emulating the socialist  countries; now there may be dogmatism and empiricism in  emulating the capitalist countries.    We must overcome the remaining shortcomings and weaknesses  and see to it that our entire political system, including the  party, the state, and the mass organizations, really participate  in further consolidating national defense and building the  people's armed forces. This means that we must thoroughly  understand the all-people national defense viewpoint in the  conditions of the socialist renovation undertaking, and  must pay greater attention to closely combining national  construction with national defense.    We must strengthen the party's centralized and unified  leadership over the two strategic tasks of building and  defending the fatherland, and over national defense and security  work and foreign relations. We must institutionalize the party's  decisions on national defense and security and on people's armed  forces building; and must strengthen the state management of  national defense work. All party and administrative  organizations at the center and in localities, party groups, and  party affairs committees of the various ministries, departments,  services, and mass organizations at the center... must attach  special importance to leading and managing the national defense  task according to their functions and duties and must closely  combine the two strategic tasks.    The Conference on All-People National Defense Work held in  November 1993 brought up and resolved numerous important issues  such as opposing "peaceful evolution," educating party and state  cadres and the people in national defense; building defense  zones; building mobilization-ready reserve forces and preparing  them for wartime mobilization; and building militia and  self-defense forces. Obviously, these tasks can be accomplished  only if there is an aggregate strength of the entire people  under the party leadership and state management combined with  broad mass movements.    There is a major issue of national defense relating to the  entire national construction task and bearing mostly on various  ministries, departments, and services at the central level--an  issue that needs to be settled--namely the question of  combining national defense with economic development and  other aspects of national construction and with investment in  the building of national defense industry in order to  strengthen economic potential and achieve political stability  while strengthening national defense potential. Only on  this basis will we be able to draw up accurate wartime  mobilization plans, to maintain high combat readiness, and, when  required by the situation, to turn the potential of the country  and of the all-people national defense system into the strength  of people's war for national defense.    We all know that combining national construction with  national defense is an element of the model of socialism in  Vietnam, as reflected in the six characteristics and seven basic  directions stated in the seventh party congress Political  Program. Settlement of this relationship will have an impact on  the entire national development process in general and on each  aspect of economic building, national construction, and national  defense in particular. This impact is evident and direct in  areas such as the building of infrastructure, communications and  transportation, roads, airfields, piers, post and  telecommunications; in major, long-term economic plans and  projects; in economic projects relating to foreign investment.  As stated above, this problem has become more complicated in  the conditions of the multisectorial economy operating in  accordance with the market mechanism; this is different from the  past, when there were only two economic sectors--the state and  collective sectors--in the highly centralized planned economy.    To satisfactorily carry out the tasks of economic building,  national construction, and national defense, and to skillfully  combine the two strategic tasks, party and state cadres and the  mass organizations must have knowledge of military and national  defense affairs and military cadres must have knowledge of  economic and legal matters and other fields.    We must institutionalize party decisions and strengthen  the state management of national defense and armed forces  building.    -- We must determine in the Constitution and the law the  national defense duty of all citizens, various economic sectors,  production and business organizations, sociopolitical  organizations, various ministries, departments, and services of  the state at the center and in localities.    -- We must have a national development strategy encompassing  the economy, national defense, and other areas of construction,  and combining the two strategic tasks, which include the  national defense strategy or the national defense and security  strategy.  -- We must adopt major policies to ensure implementation of  the national defense and armed forces building tasks.  -- We must have an adequate budget; this budget must be  reflected in the Law on State Budget and concretely  determined in government plans and programs of action for each  period of time (five-year and annual plans and programs). The  national defense budget is not limited to the budget of the  Ministry of National Defense but also includes the military  budget contained in the general budget of various sectors at the  center and in the budgets of various localities.    -- The Ministry of National Defense must fulfill its  functions as the principal state management organ in charge of  national defense and as a capable staff of the party and other  state services in national defense matters. The ministry must  inspect the implementation of national defense tasks by various  state services, localities, production and business units,  economic sectors, social organizations, and citizens.  -- The ministries, departments, and services at the center  must have components (or specialists) in charge of monitoring  national defense work in order to, first of all, satisfactorily  fulfill their functions and duties in relation to the national  defense task and, at the same time, to satisfactorily carry out  the national defense task pertaining to their functions and  duties.    -- We must develop the mechanism of party leadership and  state management in the field of national defense and armed  forces building.    Concerning the building of the people's army and the  masses' armed forces in particular, we must do the  following:    As a result of our strategic adjustments, our military  organization has now been radically turned into a  peacetime military organization with its three  categories of troops reshaped in accordance with peacetime  conditions and with the market economy (they are different from  the organization of the three categories of troops during  wartime and in the highly centralized planned economy).    The problem here is to enhance the quality of the  people's army and of all the three categories of troops so that  they can meet the demands of peacetime political and military  tasks, have sufficient strength to deter hostile forces, and  join the entire people in achieving victory in case of  hostilities.    To step up the building of the revolutionary, regular,  well-trained, and gradually modernized people's army, we must  basically renovate our thinking on building the people's army in  peacetime and in the market economy, on the basis of applying  and developing the principled experiences in building the  revolutionary army and people's army over the past few decades.  We must continue to carry out research on and determine the  total troop strength and the rational relationship between the  standing army and the reserves. We must renovate the  organization of the forces of the three categories of troops,  the armed branches and services, the rapid-reaction mobile  force, the stationary force, and the militia and self-defense  forces in the multisectorial economy. We must do research on  combining the military draft system with the volunteer system  and broaden the career soldier system. We must basically  renovate the army building and army welfare policies and should  not confuse the national defense policy with the social welfare  policy. We must restore the image of Uncle Ho's soldiers and  enhance the standing of the people's army and the officers corps  on the social scale of value. We must satisfactorily meet the  legitimate and reasonable material and spiritual needs of  soldiers, officers, and their families when they are on active  duty as well as after they have returned to civilian life. We  must develop the people's army politically and build pure and  strong basic party organizations in the army. We must provide  the officers corps with college education in keeping with  President Ho Chi Minh's concept of turning workers and peasants  into intellectuals, and must develop a new model and set new  targets for officer training according to the three levels of  army officers. We must rearrange the military school system in  the common training system of the state. We must adopt a policy  aimed at attracting talents to serve in the army. We must  acquire some new weapons and equipment in conjunction with using  and maintaining the weapons and technical equipment currently  available. We must improve the quality of military education and  training, step up the building of the regular army and  comprehensively strong units by stepping up research on military  science and technology, on other social sciences, and on the  humanities, and by combining practical review with theoretical  research. We must improve the economic efficiency of the units  engaged in production and economic building. We must enhance the  combat readiness of various units, care for the material and  spiritual life of cadres and soldiers, and build the army into a  wholesome school of culture appealing to the youth. We must make  army building a task really of the entire party and people and  of all the political system so that it can fully benefit from  the achievements in the renovation undertaking in terms of  people, spirit, intellect, ethics, and material and technical  base, with attention paid to the scientific and technological  achievements in the gray area between people's livelihood and  national defense.    Cadres and soldiers of the people's army themselves must  actively strive to fulfill all tasks entrusted by the party, the  state, and the people in the national renovation undertaking to  defend--and contribute to the building of--the socialist  Vietnamese fatherland. In this way they will be making practical  preparations for celebrating the 50th anniversary of the heroic  Vietnam People's Army (December 1944-December 1994).     Footnote    1.

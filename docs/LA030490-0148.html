			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-AIDE HIRED AS NEW BEVERLY HILLS MANAGER;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: MARK SCOTT IS QUITTING HIS 2-MONTH-OLD JOB AS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  CHIEF FOR SANTA CLARITA TO SUCCEED HIS FORMER BOSS.  </P> <P> Faced with the imminent departure of their veteran city manager, members of the  Beverly Hills City Council called on one of his former top aides to take over  at a time when the city faces the pressure of increased costs for completion of  its monumental Civic Center.  </P> <P> Mark Scott, who left Beverly Hills for the new city of Santa Clarita two months  ago, said that he mulled over the invitation while he was snowed in at Lake  Arrowhead during a weekend ski trip last month.  </P> <P> "I had just hit 40, and when people hit 40 they do things," Scott said of his  recent departure from Beverly Hills, where he was in charge of planning,  transportation and building and safety before he became director of community  development in Santa Clarita in December.  </P> <P> Although the moving boxes were hardly unpacked at his new office, the siren  song of his old employers proved impossible to resist, he said.  </P> <P> "It's just that this is my home away from home," Scott said of Beverly Hills.  "Hopefully, my mid-life crisis will be over real quickly."  </P> <P> Scott will be making about $115,000 a year in his new job. He is scheduled to  succeed City Manager Edward S. Kreins on April 2.  </P> <P> Kreins, who ran city government for 10 years, announced his retirement shortly  after a payment dispute stalled construction of the Civic Center project in  January. He will stay on through June as a consultant to his successor.  </P> <P> Although budget officials say Beverly Hills will not have to raise taxes in the  foreseeable future, Scott will be required to make higher interest payments to  finance construction of the Civic Center and renovation of the 58-year-old City  Hall while maintaining the city's high level of police, fire and other  services.  </P> <P> The annual interest payment, now about $6 million, is scheduled to go up to  $8.5 million in July as part of a 30-year refinancing that raised $115 million  last November.  </P> <P> Although the refinancing was intended to pay for construction costs and provide  several million dollars extra to finance other programs, a $14.5-million  dispute with the city's general contractor may eat up much of the money.  </P> <P> The city has already paid about $52.5 million for its new police headquarters  and a renovated and expanded library, which were 90% completed before  contractor J.A. Jones Inc. walked off the job in mid-January.  </P> <P> A new fire headquarters and parking structure are already complete, and work  continues on the City Hall renovation.  </P> <P> "The budget is going to be tough," Scott said. If he had it to do over,  "there'd be things we'd do differently. Anybody here would tell you that."  </P> <P> In choosing Scott, the council decided to go with a known quantity rather than  stage a nationwide search for a new city manager.  </P> <P> "Everyone who has worked with you agrees that more than being efficient, you  are caring and have sympathy for people, which is important," Mayor Max Salter  said when Scott's appointment was announced at a special meeting of the City  Council on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We've worked with you day in and out. You've been on the firing line, and  you've shown the ability to meet that high standard," said Vice Mayor Allan L.  Alexander. He also praised Scott as an effective communicator.  </P> <P> Scott will be replacing a strong-willed executive who prided himself on hiring  all but one of the city's top 20 executives during his 10 years on the job.  </P> <P> But Scott said he has no problem with a suggestion by Councilman Robert K.  Tanenbaum that hiring of key staffers be done with the consent of elected  officials. Tanenbaum raised the idea at a cocktail party held last week to  launch his reelection campaign.  </P> <P> "When smart city managers hire people, they confer with their city councils in  any event," Scott said.  </P> <P> Scott, who came to Beverly Hills as executive assistant to Kreins in 1983, had  been director of environmental services for three years in Beverly Hills when  he left for Santa Clarita, whose population of about 150,000 compares to 30,000  for his once and future employer.  </P> <P> "We're very surprised and saddened to see him go, because Mark is a very  excellent worker and person," said Gail Foy, spokeswoman for the 2-year-old  city, which covers 40 square miles and includes the communities of Saugus,  Newhall, Valencia and parts of Canyon Country.  </P></p>

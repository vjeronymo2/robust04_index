			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter withdraws plans for CST reconstruction JUPITER TYNDALL has withdrawn plans for the reconstruction of CST Emerging Asia Trust. The change of plan is the latest in a series of aborted proposals by Jupiter, which has been battling to keep control of several trusts in its stable. The plan would have attempted to eliminate the discount through the issue of zero coupon convertible unsecured loan stock to replace the bulk of the trust's ordinary shares. No-one at Jupiter was available yesterday to explain why the proposals were withdrawn. Recently Jupiter withdrew reconstruction plans for Pacific Horizon, another trust in its stable, which it once planned to merge with CST Emerging Asia. The boards of Pacific Horizon and European Project Investment Trust have now appointed new investment managers to replace Jupiter. Jupiter Tyndall has built up a 29.9 per cent stake in the shares of CST Emerging Asia.</p>

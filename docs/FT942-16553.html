			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: QMH turns in small operating profit A return to operating profits in 1993 and a rise in hotel values were reported yesterday by Queens Moat Houses, the group which is in talks to restructure its Pounds 1.22bn debt burden. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said progress was being made on the refinancing. He said: 'We won't put in place a structure which might work. We are determined it will be a structure that will work.' The accounts for 1993 were prepared on a going concern basis, depending on the success of a refinancing package. The package is expected to include a substantial conversion of debt into equity. Mr Coppel said he aimed for a deal which would allow existing shareholders to retain as much of the enlarged equity as possible, but he could not promise they would recover the value they had had before the collapse a year ago, because that value was never really there. Some banks have sold part of their exposure, with the Royal Bank of Scotland confirming that it had sold a small amount of debt, believed to be less than Pounds 10m. The buyer is understood to be an American bank which was willing to abide by 'London Rules' on restructurings. RBS is believed to have sold at about 60 per cent of face value. Although it has a continuing exposure to QMH debt, it has resigned from the steering committee of lenders. Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors which prepared the controversial 1992 property valuation of Pounds 861m, revalued the hotels at Pounds 915m. This included a figure of Pounds 474m for the UK hotels, up 21 per cent, and Pounds 439m for the continental European hotels, down from Pounds 474m. Mr Coppel said part of the rise in UK hotel values was due to improved trading conditions and increasing buying interest in hotels. But, he said, it also reflected work done by the new management team to improve the business. UK operating profits rose from Pounds 8m to Pounds 18.5m. He said that in the second half of last year the management had begun 'to get the business back on track'. The emphasis had now been put on sales and marketing, while costs had been cut and financial controls improved. In the longer term, the continental European hotels are expected to be sold. In the UK, QMH aims to concentrate on a core chain of hotels which were valued at Pounds 55,500 a room, up from Pounds 45,500 in the 1992 valuation, which Mr Coppel said was close to values of comparable chains. Group turnover fell 1.6 per cent to Pounds 381m. Operating profits were Pounds 18.4m, compared with a loss of Pounds 700,000. A surplus on revaluation of Pounds 26m was taken through the profit and loss account, compared with the Pounds 804m write-down in 1992. Interest payable was Pounds 110m (Pounds 113m), although QMH only paid its debenture holders and continental European lenders in full. Part of the interest due to UK banks was rolled into the principal, and net debt rose Pounds 58.2m to Pounds 1.22bn. The pre-tax loss was Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 1.04bn) and the retained loss was Pounds 59.1m (Pounds 1.08bn). Thanks to the property revaluation, though, the shareholders' funds improved from a negative Pounds 388.9m to minus Pounds 377m. Losses per share came out at 6.4p (116.9p).</p>

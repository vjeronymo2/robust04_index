			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Unemployment fears surveyed People in high-risk groups for unemployment, such as young males and council tenants, are less concerned about losing their jobs than those in safer groups such as middle-aged southerners with mortgages. According to an analysis of MORI interviews with 9,000 adults between April and December, young people aged 18 to 24 are heavily over-represented among the unemployed. They form 34 per cent of the total - with 20 per cent saying they are 'very concerned' about being made redundant. Conversely, the interviews show that 35 to 44-year-olds with housing and child-rearing commitments are considerably less likely to be unemployed, forming only 11 per cent of the total - yet 23 per cent of them are 'very concerned' about losing their jobs. In the south of England, with 34 per cent of the unemployment total, 44 per cent were worried about unemployment, compared with 22 per cent in the north, with 31 per cent of the unemployed total.</p>

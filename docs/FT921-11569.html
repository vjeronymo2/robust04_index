			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Democrats irked by Bush's tax cuts deadline DEMOCRATIC party leaders yesterday bristled at the March 20 deadline by which President George Bush has challenged them to pass his package of tax cuts, reports George Graham. 'I think the president's decision to set an artificial deadline will not be helpful. He's demanding that Congress approve, in 50 days, a proposal he's been working on for 90 days, and he's still fine-tuning it,' complained Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. But Mr Bush's Republican supporters were enthusiastic about the prospects of using the momentum from the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening to meet the deadline. While Democrats complain that March 20 is simply too soon to work through all the legislation Mr Bush has proposed, some Republicans are threatening to obstruct congressional business unless they receive a commitment that the whole package will be put to a vote by then. Mr Newt Gingrich, minority whip and leader of the Republicans' right wing in the House of Representatives, has threatened to block the 10-day recess Congress traditionally takes in February, at the time of the national holidays commemorating the birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Republican party officials hope that, if the economic growth package fails to pass by March 20, Mr Bush will be able to lift his re-election campaign by attacking 'do-nothing' Democratic legislators. A political organisation run by Mr Gingrich is aiming to raise Dollars 17m to help Republican challengers in 170 Democratic congressional districts it regards as winnable, hoping for a congressional majority. Some political analysts warn, however, that this electoral strategy could backfire on Mr Bush, who may find it hard to shift the onus for action away from the presidency and on to the Congress. The legislation the Democratic-controlled Congress sends to him for signature may be substantially different from the package Mr Bush has proposed: he would then face the dilemma of accepting measures unpalatable to his Republican supporters, or using his veto, and risk being blamed for obstructing efforts to do something about the recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa voiced anxiety Wednesday that trade conflicts between  Tokyo and Washington may take place "one after another" unless  Japan significantly reduces its trade surplus with the United  States.    Hosokawa made the remarks during a session of the House of  Councillors Budget Committee before it passed the third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. The extra budget was  finally approved as it was passed at the plenary session of the  upper house.    The premier said the U.S. has been "irritated" by its trade  deficits with Japan of more than 50 billion dollars annually.  "I am afraid similar problems may repeatedly occur one after  another unless signs of improvement come out visibly," said  Hosokawa, referring to a U.S. announcement last week which  unveiled steps to impose sanctions against Japan in a dispute  over access to the Japanese cellular phone market.    The announcement was made a few days after Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new  framework to slash Japan's trade surplus.    Hosokawa said he wants to find a way to solve the trade  imbalance, stressing the importance of relations between Japan  and the U.S. "We should make every effort to stabilize  Japan-U.S. relations. It is not only a bilateral relationship  but has impacts on Asia and Pacific regions," Hosokawa said,  adding the U.S. presence in the region gives a sense of security  to other countries in the region.    The prime minister also said he is aiming for an alliance of  ruling parties to compete with the largest opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election of the House  of Representatives. He said the seven ruling parties cannot win  the election if they field separate candidates.    Hosokawa, however, denied he is after a two-party system. "I  have said Japanese politics will become a moderate multiparty  system, not a two-party system. I still think so," he said.    The prime minister reportedly wants to remove Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who is opposed to the two-party  system.    Takemura and former SDP [Social Democratic Party] Chairman  Sadao Yamahana, also state minister in charge of political  reform, voiced their support during the session for a multiparty  system.    Hosokawa said he will decide whether to reshuffle the  cabinet  after hearing the opinion of governmental and ruling parties'  officials.</p>

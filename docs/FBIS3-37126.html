I am convinced that the stabilization of the  internal political situation in our country will promote the  ratification of the Russian-Georgian agreement in State Duma",  Vladimir Chikovani, commander of Georgian Interior Ministry's  troops has told today SNARK in his exclusive interview.    "I hope very much that consultations and experience exchange  with our Russian colleagues will help us to form interior troops  and to improve their activity", said General Chikovani.    Refuting the statements that Russian troops take part in  order providing in criminal regions of Georgia, Vladimir  Chikovani declared: "It is out of the question. The Russian  guys are not engaged in any incident on Georgian territory, but  those connected with the Group of Russian troops in  Transcaucasia."    Speaking on the Abkhazian problem, Vladimir Chikovani  mentioned that for realization of the Geneva Agreement on  Abkhazia a necessity may arise to return to the idea of creation  joint Georgian-Russian Interior troops. Earlier this idea was  discussed last year at the Sochi negotiations, devoted to the  Abkhazian conflict's settlement.</p>

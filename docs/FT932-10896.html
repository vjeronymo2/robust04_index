			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY coffee futures fall still further NEW YORK'S arabica coffee market was again in steep decline in late trading yesterday as the roller-coaster ride of recent weeks continued. The July contract was off more than 2 cents at one stage at 56.25 cents a lb after an overnight fall of more than 5 cents. London's July robusta market followed cautiously, trading only 300 lots in the first one and a half hours, and closed down Dollars 29 at Dollars 860 a tonne. Last week nearby New York prices rose by more than 9 cents after US certified stocks fell by 100,000 bags (60 kg each). Analysts in London yesterday suggested that the fall in the high level of stocks had been taken as the first evidence that a widely-expected drawdown in stocks for the 1992-93 year had begun. Funds, commission houses chartists and speculators plunged into the market. A further fall was expected this week, but in the event US stocks rose by 15,000 bags to 5.58m bags - and last week's buyers bailed out. 'The market has been flying in the face of fundamentals,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker. 'People are going to have to revise their production and consumption estimates for 1992-93.' He believes the figures will show the market to be in balance for the season just ended, and is expecting production to exceed consumption by 5m bags in 1993-94. One London trader said he had been surprised at the speed of New York's retracement on Tuesday, but the close below 60 cents a lb made it inevitable the market would fall further. He suggested strong support between 54 and 56 cents a lb.</p>

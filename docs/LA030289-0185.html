			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNTIMELY SIGNS;  </P> <P> '50S DINER ORDERED TO COME BACK TO THE FUTURE, REMOVE STYLISH WINDOW DECALS  </P> <P> Just like the 1950s-era diners it tries to emulate, the Busy Bee Cafe in  downtown Ventura sports decals on its front window advertising, "Malts,  Burgers, Shakes, Sodas, Chili, Sundaes."  </P> <P> And like so many diners of that period did, the Busy Bee boasts, in six-inch  block letters painted so that snow appears to have fallen atop them, that the  cafe is "Air Conditioned."  </P> <P> But in the 1950s, Ventura had no Architectural Review Board and no ordinance  regulating commercial signs.  </P> <P> These days, the city takes a dim view of ersatz "American Graffiti" decor along  historic Main Street. Much to the chagrin of owner Ed Warren, who opened the  popular restaurant 1 1/2 years ago, officials have ordered the signs removed as  too large and too garish.  </P> <P> "If this were on any old street in any old town, it wouldn't be that bad," said  David Sargent, one of three architects on the city's seven-member Architectural  Review Board. "But, as it is, it's the only building on that particular street  with those particular graphics and it sticks out."  </P> <P> Warren, who has collected about 300 signatures from customers in preparation  for his appeal at a March 27 meeting of the board, called the order arbitrary  and confusing.  </P> <P> "We think the signs blend in nicely," he said. "They contribute to the feel and  the ambiance of the place. . . . I don't understand exactly what they're trying  to tell me."  </P> <P> Beyond the question of whether the malt signs will stay, however, the dispute  strikes an increasingly familiar refrain in Ventura, where there are few  aesthetic guidelines to help developers meet the constant cries to preserve  small-town charm.  </P> <P> Although such design standards are to be discussed when the City Council  reviews Ventura's general plan later this year, officials in the meantime often  make subjective judgments about a project's style, regardless of its other  merits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Project Turned Down  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago, for instance, the council rejected an upscale three-unit  condominium project that, even though it met virtually all city zoning  standards, was considered too tall and bulky to stand next to a quaint,  European-style inn on the same downtown street.  </P> <P> "It can be an arbitrary decision," said Fred Goodrich, an associate city  planner who assists the Architectural Review Board. "It just isn't written in  the book, what is good design."  </P> <P> Warren, who owned the cafe, then called Warren's, from 1963 to 1978, thought  that he had found a good design when he bought back his restaurant in 1987 and  adopted the 1950s-era style that was sweeping trendy diners in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But in a routine inspection of the Busy Bee in May, a city code enforcement  officer found that Warren did not have the needed permits for any of the signs  on the building facade.  </P> <P> Warren applied for and the Architectural Review Board approved a neon rendition  of the cafe's namesake that hangs above the storefront. But the funky soda shop  decals had to go, board members said.  </P> <P> A city code limits the total area of signs on commercial buildings to one  square foot for every foot of storefront, which, for the Busy Bee, translated  into 26 square feet of signs. Of that, however, only 20% can be used for  product advertisement, the law says. And the decals along the bottom of  Warren's window occupy 19 square feet, or about four times as much window as  they should have.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Denied  </P> <P> Warren went to the Architectural Review Board in October asking for an  exemption, but was told that the signs were just "too much" for his storefront  and the neighborhood, Goodrich said.  </P> <P> On a drive down Main Street, one can find numerous signs more obtrusive than  Warren's decals, including the likeness of a large Arabian genie hoisting the  name of a carpet store above his head, a multicolored hot-air balloon atop a  furniture store announcing a going-out-of-business sale, and even a big, ragged  banner advertising a sale on color film printing at a camera store next door to  the Busy Bee.  </P> <P> Officials, however, explain that they do not have the manpower to enforce sign  standards at every business in the city. Moreover, they say, some of the  gaudiest signs were in place before Ventura adopted its sign ordinance in 1971.  And, they add, temporary banners fall into a special category, which permits  them to fly for 90 days a year as long as they're not up for more than 30  consecutive days.  </P> <P> "There are ugly signs all over the city," Sargent said. "As we have the time  and personnel to deal with them, we do. . . . The Busy Bee is better looking  than a lot of storefronts on Main Street and just not as good as some others."  </P></p>

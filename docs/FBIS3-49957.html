			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic,  minister for foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina,  said today that the joint statement signed today in Geneva by  the ministers for foreign affairs of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia "does not infringe on the  integrity and sovereignty of the republic of Serb Krajina."    A public statement signed by Jarcevic says that this joint  statement, signed by Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic,  envisages mutual recognition, normalization of relations and the  introduction of representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb.  "The Republic of Croatia can sign international treaties and  make agreements only for the territories under its control and  those that are not disputable," the statement says. Invoking  CSCE documents, as stated, cannot imply the borders desired by  the government of the Republic of Croatia, but the real ones.    Jarcevic stresses that the joint statement by Yugoslavia and  Croatia in its reference to the UN Charter "relates to those  provisions that regulate peaceful solutions to disputes and a  people's right to self-determination," something "that implies  the will of the people of the republic of Serb Krajina  articulated clearly at their referendum, the statement  emphasizes."    The government of the republic of Serb Krajina, as stated,  welcomes the peace process in the area of the former Yugoslavia  and the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia, and believes that  "this will contribute to the restoration of peace along the  borders between the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of  Croatia.</p>

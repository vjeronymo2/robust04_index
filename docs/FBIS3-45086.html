			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Chao: "Countdown to Launch of </F> Satellite"]    [Text] Preparations are in full swing to launch the  country's first geostationary weather satellite, the China  Meteorological Administration (CMA) said yesterday.    Experts are working on ground station facilities and testing  equipment and the satellite, called Fengyun-2 (FY-2) will be  launched sometime this year.    FY-2, the third Chinese meteorological satellite since 1988,  will be located in geostationary orbit 35,800 kilometres above  105 East Longitude which runs through west-central China, CMA  officials said.    They said the satellite will be able to monitor  meteorological changes over a third of the globe.    Meanwhile, China is to import a supercomputer from the  United  States to improve its newly-opened medium-range numerical  weather prediction (NPW) system, which can forecast changes four  to 10 days in advance. The U.S. machine will replace the  domestically-made Yinhe 2, China's most advanced supercomputer.  CMA officials also said a new continental weather station will  be set up this year at a place 3,816 metres above sea level in  West China's Qinghai Plateau.</p>

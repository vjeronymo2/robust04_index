			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] New Army units are expected to be armed soon, as  a result of an agreement reached between the government and the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] today, regarding the  selection of weapons for the future army. A meeting held  between the government, Renamo, and the United Nations at the  Military Club in Maputo this afternoon decided to send a  tripartite team to Chimoio on 8 April to select the weapons to  be used by the new army [words indistinct] to the Joint  Commission for the Formation of the Mozambique Defense Armed  Forces for the subsequent distribution to the new army units.  Another issue discussed today was the issue of the 16,000  troops demobilized by the government in 1992 before the signing  of the General Peace Accord. A source from the United Nations  presiding over the meeting told Radio Mozambique that the  parties came to the conclusion that there is no technical reason  preventing these soldiers from receiving a demobilization  subsidy.

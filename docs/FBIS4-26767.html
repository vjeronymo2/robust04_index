			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Newsletter by XINHUA reporters Jiao Ran (3542 3544), Zhao </F> Peng (6392 7720), and Lu Yongjian (7773 3057 1696):  "Zhongnanhai Shows Concern About Floods]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 24 Jun (XINHUA) -- Many areas in  Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi in southern China have  been deluged by floods since early June. The water levels of  the Xi Jiang and the Bei Jiang have risen rapidly, areas in the  Zhujiang Delta are threatened by the biggest floods since the  founding of the republic, Changsha has been besieged by floods,  and areas outside Nanchang have been submerged. [passage omitted]    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee  and chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Premier Li  Peng have many times telephoned the leaders of the  flood-stricken provinces and regions and the State Flood Control  and Drought Relief Headquarters to ask about the floods, the  damage they have done, the fight against floods, and relief  efforts. They have also expressed their cordial regards to the  cadres, masses, officers and men of the People's Liberation Army  [PLA] and the armed police forces, and public security personnel  engaged in the fight; and instructed party and government  departments in the flood-stricken areas to make sure that  people's lives and property are safe, that proper arrangements  are made for their living necessities, and that the masses are  organized to combat the disaster.    On 15 June, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to Guangdong  to inspect the flood situation. He has time and again inquired  about the flood situation there and the arrangements made for  the flood victims and efforts to combat the floods. When  informed that Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang were  all stricken by floods, he immediately gave important  instructions, urging all principal leaders to organize and lead  the masses in the stricken areas to fight the floods. He also  exhorted everybody to demonstrate the socialist system's  superiority and carry forward the fine tradition that "whenever  people in one area have problems, people in all other areas will  come to their support." He said party members, government  personnel, soldiers, and people should work with concerted  efforts to battle the floods.    On 20 June, the flood situation in southern China became  more  critical. In the morning of that day, Premier Li Peng chaired a  special meeting in Zhongnanhai to further plan the fight against  south China's floods. When the meeting began, he first conveyed  Jiang Zemin's important instructions on fighting the floods.  One day earlier, on the afternoon of 19 June, Premier Li Peng  had called the State Flood Control and Drought Relief  Headquarters to inquire about the flood situation. He stressed  at the meeting that current flood control should give priority  to ensuring the security of the Bei Jiang embankment and the  Zhujiang Delta, rescuing those people who have been marooned by  floodwater, and making sure that people in stricken areas have  enough food and other necessities, are not stricken by  epidemics, and have the assistance they need for reconstruction.  The meeting decided to send central working groups, headed by  Zou Jiahua, Wen Jiabao, and Chen Junsheng and other leading  comrades, to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi to combat  the floods and provide relief services along with local party  members, government cadres, soldiers, and people.    Speaking on behalf of the party Central Committee and the  State Council, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who was on an inspection  tour in Liaoning, telephoned Hunan on the morning of 20 June to  express his regards for the five million soldiers and people  fighting the floods there. [passage describing the busy work in  the State Meteorological Center and the State Flood Control and  Drought Relief Headquarters omitted]    At the meeting held on the morning of 20 June, Premier Li  Peng urged roadway departments to make sure that supplies for  battling the floods are promptly delivered. On the morning of  22 June, the first document signed by Guo Lin, vice minister of  railways, was an emergency circular drafted the night before  instructing all railway bureaus to ship relief supplies to  flood-stricken areas ahead of shipments of other goods. The  circular instructed that "urgent missions must be carried out as  soon as they are handed down." Since 21 June, persons in charge  of railways have been working around the clock to take charge of  the delivery of supplies needed to combat flooding and drought.  As soon as it received Fujian's telegrams requesting assistance  on 23 June, the Ministry of Railways immediately dispatched  eight trains loaded with relief supplies to the flood-stricken  areas. Relevant departments of the State Council, including the  ministries of water resources, agriculture, and public health,  have already done a great deal of work to combat the floods and  provide relief services. [passage omitted]    In accordance with instructions issued by the CPC Central  Committee and the Central Military Commission, the PLA General  Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, and the  General Logistics Departments issued a joint circular on 20 June  urging all local units to take an active part in the fight  against floods and rush to the most dangerous flood-stricken  areas.

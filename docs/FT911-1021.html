			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Argentine minister renews plea on inflation MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, has renewed pleas for the public to support the latest anti-inflation policy. In a national broadcast on Tuesday evening, the minister acknowledged that the campaign was President Carlos Menem's fourth assault on inflation since taking office in 1989. 'The results this time can, and must be, very different. We are convinced that we can and must inaugurate not months, but decades of stability and growth,' Mr Cavallo said In April he introduced Argentina's most coherent and stringent attack on inflation yet. The results so far have been impressive; inflation fell to 5.5 per cent in April from 11 per cent in March, interest rates have plummeted to 1.5 per cent a month, industry is booming and officials expect 2 per cent growth this year. However, Mr Cavallo said stability could only be achieved by stamping out tax evasion and by eliminating the budget deficit. Although tax revenues increased in April by a third to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.17bn) over March's Dollars 1.5bn, the government remains Dollars 200m in deficit.</p>

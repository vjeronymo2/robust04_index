			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (11): New lending cut short - Financial institutions in New York FEW AMERICANS are unaware of the growing Japanese presence in their domestic economy. Japan's products have made heavy inroads into the automobile and consumer electronics sectors, much to the chagrin of US manufacturers, who are calling to politicians for help in this election year. Yet the Japanese build-up in the US financial services industry has gone largely unnoticed. In the state of New York, which accounts for by far the largest proportion of foreign bank activity in the US, Japanese banks now have 55 branches and agencies, according to the latest data, with total assets of Dollars 244.6bn. A further 21 state-chartered trust companies bring the asset total to Dollars 272.1bn. This represents 55 per cent of all foreign bank assets subject to regulation by New York state. As regulators are quick to point out in the wake of the BCCI scandal, the US assets of one of the big Japanese banks outstrip those of BCCI in its entirety. Bank of Tokyo, which has had a North American presence for more than a century and ranks as the largest foreign bank by any measure, boasts assets of almost Dollars 50bn in the US. The size of its commercial and industrial lending is about 40 per cent larger than the loan book of its nearest competitor. On Wall Street, the big four Japanese securities houses have earned the respect of their domestic rivals, although it would be wrong to say that they are held in awe. While Nomura and Daiwa hold dominant positions in the underwriting of international bonds, they have remained in the second tier of the US market. Last year, Nomura took 16th place in domestic lead underwriting and Daiwa 19th, according to figures from Securities Data. Both houses are primary dealers in the US government bond market, giving them a pivotal role in the purchase of government paper by Japanese institutional investors. Nomura, Daiwa and their smaller competitors - Nikko and Yamaichi - have also acted as a major conduit for US investment flows into the Tokyo stock market, even if these have now slowed to a trickle. Japan's financial emissaries abroad have been unable to escape the economic and political upheavals at home. Even before the recent slide in the Tokyo market cut the value of their reserves, Japanese banks were being forced to cut back international lending to comply with new capital adequacy standards. In the US, where the Japanese share of total bank assets more than doubled in the 1980s to around 12 per cent, new lending has ground to a halt. Quite apart from their own capital restraints, the Japanese banks have seen the US recession hit hard at their lending activities. In the real estate sector, where Japanese institutions invested heavily during the boom of the late 1980s, the impact on the banks has been particularly severe. Provisions against non-performing US real estate loans have increased substantially. From June 1989 to June 1990, approximately the last year of the boom, Japanese banks pushed up their US real estate assets by more than 70 per cent, to just under Dollars 30bn. Among the top 20 foreign bank branches and agencies with most real estate exposure, Japanese institutions located in New York and Los Angeles accounted for all but one, according to figures compiled by American Banker. The Japanese securities houses are also suffering from the changing climate. Faced with a declining equity market at home, Tokyo institutions are cutting their investments abroad and the flow of funds into the US government bond market is drying up. 'We are seeing a fall in volume and a shrinking in margins, even though our business as primary dealers remains profitable', says a spokesman for Daiwa Securities in New York. With some success, the big four have built stand-alone businesses in the US, reducing reliance on the Japanese market. New York has become a base for cross-border activity in corporate finance, especially mergers and acquisitions, and Nomura has acquired a significant stake in the independent house, Wasserstein Perella. But the securities houses are also using the US as a testing ground for new financial products that may eventually find their way to Japan. Nomura, once rumoured to be keen on buying the Wall Street firm of Kidder Peabody, then hired the firm's president, Max Chapman to run its US operations. Chapman has spearheaded a drive by Nomura into derivative products. Daiwa's spokesman defines its US business as a 'periscope operation', seeking out skills and techniques that could be transplanted to Japan. Commercial paper is one activity already highly developed in the US but still a fledgling business in Japan. Daiwa is also building expertise in asset securitisation, especially in the mortgage area, with an eye on its potential back home. The Japanese have also made some inroads into the highly competitive business of asset management on behalf of US pension funds. They have been helped by the decision of several leading funds to boost their international investments, although the securities scandals in Japan have prompted public concern on the part of some pension owners, notably the Californian Public Employees Retirement System, the country's largest. As for the banks, their hectic growth over the past decade will probably never be repeated. That does not mean their substantial presence in the US will shrink dramatically; New York is too significant a financial centre to allow much reduction in activity and the Japanese also value their local presence. But others take a more serious view. John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, told executives in Chicago last September that, as a by-product of the fall in the Tokyo stock market, the role of Japanese banks in the international financial system had been virtually eliminated. 'They are no longer players (in the system) and one would not expect them to be players again for the next five to 10 years because of this adjustment in the value of their equity portfolios', he added.</p>

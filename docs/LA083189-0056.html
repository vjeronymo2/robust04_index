			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH : LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE AMONG THEATERS UPSET BY STATE ARTS COUNCIL  RATINGS  </P> <P> Some of Southern California's largest and most important theaters are reeling  from the poor ranking they received last week from the California Arts Council.  </P> <P> The La Jolla Playhouse, South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa and the Los Angeles  Theatre Center are incensed at large cuts each sustained in CAC grant awards,  cuts that are the result of a modified evaluation procedure that the theaters  say they don't completely understand.  </P> <P> "I'm outraged by the CAC's lack of comprehension (of artistic excellence),"  said the Theatre Center's Bill Bushnell. "No one is going to convince me that  La Jolla, LATC and South Coast are not among the best theaters in the state."  </P> <P> In slicing La Jolla's grant from $47,363 to $22,949, the CAC cited (among other  things) a deficit that "seems out of control" and an outreach program whose  artistic quality "could be developed" and currently shows a lack of "ethnic  diversity on board, staff and audiences."  </P> <P> "The deficit ($703,000) is obviously a concern of the CAC," said La Jolla  managing director Allan Levey. "It's a much larger concern of ours. It's not  easy to find money for deficit reductions," he added, reiterating that a  three-year $250,000 National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant awarded La  Jolla in February will be used to bring the deficit down.  </P> <P> "We have the shortest playing season and smallest number of seats" of any  regional theater, he said, explaining that because of the playhouse's tie-in  with UC San Diego, on whose campus it resides, seasons -- and therefore earning  power -- have been limited by the university's needs.  </P> <P> The first of two new on-campus theaters is expected to be ready by March, 1991.  "That will allow us to expand to a nine-month season and generate more funds,"  Levey said.  </P> <P> CAC funding for the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which has had a stormy  financial history, took a modest tumble from $37,982 last year to $33,671 this  year, because of "ongoing managerial problems," the CAC report said.  </P> <P> "The drop is the least of my concerns," Bushnell said. "What's abundantly clear  is that if you don't play by established rules you don't score."  </P> <P> South Coast, an award-winning theater with what California Arts Council  theater-grants administrator Ray Tatar described as "a model administration,"  saw its 1989 award drop to $81,950 from $106,400 in 1988.  </P> <P> The 23% cut in funding over last year leaves the theater hard put to understand  why. "In the past, we had been told our outreach was exemplary," said producing  artistic director David Emmes. "This year we were slammed. If they want us to  do an outreach program -- which we want to do -- they are paradoxically cutting  the funds that make it possible. It's a curious sort of message.  </P> <P> "We were also told that representation of minorities on our board and staff  were low. What doesn't compute mathematically is why other theaters with  similar characteristics received funding either equal to last year or more.  </P> <P> "What concerns me most is that the apparent emphasis on the different criteria  seems to change every year. The nice thing about the NEA (National Endowment  for the Arts) is the sense of consistency about  </P> <P> how you're being evaluated. My only hope for the future is that, once these  things are set, the criteria will be better understood and will be applied with  some consistency from year to year."  </P> <P> The source of these inconsistencies apparently lies in the change in the CAC's  evaluation system. Two seven-member peer panels -- a discipline panel and a  newly created LBO (Large Budget Organization) panel -- rank theaters on two  bases: managerial soundness and artistic achievement (the discipline panel) and  the quality and multi-ethnicity of outreach programs (the LBO panel). Because,  as Tatar explained it, the new LBO panel this year ranked all theaters near the  low end of a 1-4 scale, the level of some of the awards fell accordingly.  </P> <P> But neither Emmes nor Levey is content to let things lie there.  </P> <P> "The information we've received," Emmes said, "has not satisfied us so far.  We're attempting to get more data and understand how we received the money we  received, to see if we have grounds for an appeal."  </P> <P> "What's tricky is the change in procedure," Levey said. "We don't agree with  the panel's comments. We're contemplating an appeal. Des (McAnuff, La Jolla's  artistic director) is out of town. I want to talk to him. I want to talk to  them (council members). And then we'll see. They smacked our hand, for sure. It  hurts, but when push comes to shove, we're still providing the goods. . . ."  </P> <P> MUSIC MAESTRO: Three revivals and one new musical make up the California Music  Theatre's 1990 season at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. It kicks off with "On  the Town" (Feb. 14-March 4), featuring Lorna Patterson, the music of Leonard  Bernstein and book and lyrics of Betty Comden and Adolph Green.  </P> <P> Next up will be the Mitch Leigh-Joe Darion-Dale Wasserman "Man of La Mancha"  (June 6-24) starring Robert Guillaume, followed by "Clothespins and Dreams"  (Aug. 8-26), a new piece set in a family-owned laundry yard in Harlem, 1911,  before the advent of the electric washing machine began to wreak havoc. The  show, with music by Ken Hirsch and book and lyrics by Ron Miller, will feature  Barney Martin and Eloise Laws.  </P> <P> Finally, that perennial favorite orphan, "Annie," with John Schuck, Tom Hatten,  Marcia Lewis and Lisa Robinson, will close the season (Nov. 28-Dec. 16, 1990).  There are tentative plans for "Annie" to play the Orange County Performing Arts  Center for a week after its Pasadena engagement.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Music Theatre is poised to open its next show of the current  season: "The Pajama Game," starring Pat Harrington and Mary Jo Catlett, Oct.  4-22. That will be followed by the final show of 1989, Gilbert and Sullivan's  "Iolanthe," Dec. 2-17.  </P> <P> Information: (818) 356-7469.  </P></p>

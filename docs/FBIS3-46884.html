			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-ki] </F>   [Text] With the release from their posts of Lieutenant  General Yi Taek-hyong (the 19th Class of the Korean Military  Academy, KMA), chief of the Strategic Planning Bureau of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] and member of Hanahoe, a  once-powerful ROK Army inner circle, and Lieutenant General Kim  Sang-chun (the 19th Class of the KMA), director of the  Operations Center at the JCS and Hanahoe member, and their  return to Army Headquarters on last 30 December, the public's  attention is focused on how National Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae will deal in the future with officers affiliated with  Hanahoe.    It was learned that the personnel reshuffle of the two  lieutenant generals this time was in line with the military  reforms by the ROK military authorities following the release  from his post in July last year of Major General Yi Chung-sok,  (the 21st Class of the KMA), director of the Operations Bureau  at the JCS, because of the "remarks" he reportedly made at a  dinner party of the JCS. (He was discharged from the Army in  August)    However, the fact that the two lieutenant generals had still  one year left in their terms of office at the posts and that  their release was the first personnel action taken by the newly  appointed minister, who was also a Hanahoe member, can be viewed  to be quite unusual.    On 30 December last year Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae  called  General Kim Tong-chin, chief of staff of the ROK Army, into his  office and had a 30-minute secret conversation with him. In the  conversation Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reportedly informed  General Kim Tong-chin of his plan to eliminate Army officers  affiliated with Hanahoe. Thus, the release of the two lieutenant  generals at the JCS became the first personnel action that the  new defense minister took after consulting with Chongwadae  [presidential office].    Accordingly, people are predicting that the National Defense  Ministry under the new minister will follow a "hardline" track  in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers. On the eve of the  Army's periodic personnel reshuffle of last fall, General Kim  Tong-chin, chief of staff of the Army, declared that  "Hanahoe-affiliated officers who have enjoyed thus far special  favor in promotion and duty position will be subjected to  disadvantage for one year." Our attention is focussed on whether  such a promise by General Kim will be carried out.    Moreover, many people indicate that there is a good  possibility that a conflict between the "hardliner" defense  minister and "lenient" chief of staff of the Army will take  place in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers.    On the other hand, some people hold that the fact that the  new minister was member of Hanahoe will rather narrow the scope  of his activity of handling Hanahoe-affiliated officers in the  future. This is convincing. Convincing is also the analysis that  President Kim Yong-sam's plan to "eliminate Hanahoe members  through a Hanahoe member" is based on his high-level political  calculation. Some people also indicate that although Defense  Minister Yi himself was a Hanahoe member, but belonged to an  alienated group within Hanahoe and that, therefore, he has not  good feelings toward Hanahoe itself.    Being a member of Hanahoe, if Defense Minister Yi withdraws  the disadvantage in promotion and duty position imposed on  Hanahoe members, this may create a serious conflict between  those officers from the KMA and those from non-KMA background  and between Hanahoe member officers and non-Hanahoe member  officers.    On the other hand, a section of the military circles  estimates that under the new government the principle of  eliminating Hanahoe-affiliated officers will be thoroughly  adhered to and that the emergence of those pro-U.S.-leaning  general officers or those general officers with some connections  with the United States will be remarkable.    In this connection, noting that the United States, which  exercised great influence in the military personnel affairs  during the era of President Pak Chong-hui, could not fully  exercise its influence during the fifth and sixth republics  because of the emergence of Hanahoe-affiliated officers a  military source predicts that the U.S. influence over the  military personnel affairs of the ROK Armed Forces will be  revived in the future.</p>

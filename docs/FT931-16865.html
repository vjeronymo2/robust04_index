			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Clinton to discuss Nafta with Salinas GOVERNOR Bill Clinton will hold talks with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico in Texas on Friday in his only meeting with a foreign leader during the transition period between the November election and his inauguration on January 20. Heading the agenda for what Clinton assistants called 'wide-ranging' discussions will be the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico. Although the treaty text has been signed by President George Bush, it still needs ratification by the US Senate. Mr Clinton shaded his views on Nafta during last year's election campaign, offering general support for the three-nation free trade zone but expressing reservations about some of its aspects. He may seek to negotiate side agreements strengthening some environmental and job protection measures embodied in the treaty. Mr Clinton has said that free trade with Mexico was desirable only if it was accompanied by a national economic strategy. But he has been under pressure from labour unions to preserve jobs and from Mr Richard Gephardt, Democratic leader, on both environmental and job protection. Mr Gephardt has said the Nafta treaty faces rejection in Congress this year unless parts are returned to the negotiating table. For Mr Salinas, who has committed his government to fiscal austerity in the coming year, much depends on the successful ratification of the treaty, which is a critical element in his economic reform programme. The president-elect completed the selection of his cabinet just before Christmas, but is expected to make a additional appointments, mostly to the White House staff, this week. Mr Clinton was due to return to Little Rock, Arkansas, yesterday afternoon after new year on the island of Hilton Head, off the South Carolina coast.</p>

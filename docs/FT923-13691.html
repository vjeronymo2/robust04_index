			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / EC to allow bank stake in Air France: 'Subsidy' likely to upset London THE European Commission is set to give Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) permission to buy an 8.8 per cent stake in Air France, the state-owned airline, in spite of the misgivings of Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. Commissioners are almost certain to approve the investment, which will cost the state-owned bank FFr1.25bn (Pounds 128m), on Wednesday. But Sir Leon is understood to be concerned that his Belgian colleague, Mr Karel Van Miert, the transport commissioner, did not go into enough depth in his inquiry into the deal. Sir Leon was narrowly defeated in the commission last November when he opposed Mr Van Miert's decision to wave through the French government's FFr2bn capital injection for Air France. Mr Van Miert decided in both cases that the capital injection did not amount to state aid and that a private investor would have acted in the same way as the government and BNP, in spite of the continuing losses of the airline. The latest decision could increase tension between London and Brussels over state subsidies to French companies. Last week, Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the British Overseas Trade Board, attacked the commission's decision to approve FFr6bn of government subsidies to Bull, the loss-making French computer company, claiming that the decision would distort competition in the sector. Sir Leon was responsible for the Bull recommendation, but allegations of illegal state aid for airlines are always examined by Mr Van Miert - often to the irritation of Brussels competition authorities. British Airways, the privately-owned national airline which is staunchly opposed to state subsidies in the sector, is also likely to criticise the Air France deal if it is given Commission approval. For its FFr1.25bn, BNP is to receive bonds which can be converted into shares in Air France at any time in the next eight years. The bonds pay a fixed 6.5 per cent interest rate. Plans to raise a further FFr2.59bn via a complex issue of subordinated floating rate notes have not been examined by the commission. The commission still has to investigate another Air France deal: the airline's BFr6bn (Pounds 100m) purchase of a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena, the Belgian national carrier. Sir Leon will be responsible for that inquiry because the agreement falls under normal EC competition rules and not the state aid code.</p>

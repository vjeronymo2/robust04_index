			<p>BFN     [Text] Osnabrueck (DPA) -- In connection with the  financing of the Eurofighter 2000, the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD] has made serious accusations against Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union). In an  interview with NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG (Friday edition), SPD  defense expert Walter Kolbow said that the ministry has  confirmed reports that the thrift version of the Eurofighter,  which Ruehe pushed through, gives rise to considerable  additional costs for development because of the necessary  changes. The SPD will demand clarification of the matter at a  Defense Committee meeting next Wednesday [13 April].    Deutschlandfunk radio reported that the German share alone  in  the costs of the four-nation project will rise by at least 300  million German marks [DM]. An expert report by the Federal  Audit Office even gave the additional costs as DM700 million.  Kolbow stressed that the combat plane will force Ruehe "to give  a political and financial oath of disclosure." The minister  must be aware of the fact that the Bundestag will not approve  one pfennig more than planned for the development of the  Eurofighter. Even disregarding the now mentioned additional  costs, Ruehe does not know how to pay for the plane's  development.</p>

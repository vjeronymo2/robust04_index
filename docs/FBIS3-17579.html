			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report under the "Expert Opinion" rubric: </F> "The War Against the Party System Took Its Toll"]    [Text] Moscow -- Asked whether Boris Yeltsin has an  alcohol dependency problem, one of Russia's leading addiction  specialists whom KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA approached replied  unambiguously: No.    He had visited Sverdlovsk on several occasions during  Yeltsin's time [as first secretary of the CPSU Oblast Committee]  and had learned from his colleagues about the first secretary's  reputation as a sober person, drinking far less than the  accepted norm in party elite circles.    The famous addiction specialist also considers as perfectly  illogical the supposition that Yeltsin acquired an abnormal  yearning for alcohol while he was first secretary of the Moscow  Gorkom [City Party Committee]. There is no genuine testimony to  this effect from his colleagues. Had such testimony existed, it  would have been inevitably used by Yeltsin's fierce opponents at  the time. Both the Moscow Gorkom and the CPSU Central  Committee, let alone the competent organs, were at that time  peeping through all possible keyholes, looking for an alcoholic  criminal.    Our interlocutor went on to offer his explanation of the  well-known situations which have engendered a mass of rumors.  Of course, he remembers Yeltsin's strange speech and the  mask-like expression on his face at the city party conference  when he was dismissed from the office of first secretary. In  his opinion, Boris Yeltsin, who had been taken there from the  TsKB [precise expansion unknown -- possible Central Clinical  Hospital], had been pumped full of medicines, possibly  narcotics. This may not have been done with malicious intention  (as it happened, according to claims by Tsedenbal-Junior, when  his own father was dismissed from office), it may have been part  of the prescribed course of treatment.    Ever since Yeltsin took the path of war against the  state-communist machine, and to this very day in fact, the  incumbent president of Russia has been, according to the  specialist's assertion, in a chronic psychotraumatic state [v  khronicheskoy psikhotravmiruyushchey situatsii]. He finds it  simply necessary to keep himself up with sundry tranquilizers  which, incidentally, is recommended for many people of his age.    As regards the Spanish crash [Ispanskaya katastrofa], our  interlocutor's opinion differs somewhat from the official  version. He believes that Boris Yeltsin suffered not only an  injury to his spine but also a cranial-cerebral injury. There  is no doubt that he suffers from acute pains, forcing him to  take painkillers as well as tranquilizers.    "You try and take something, if only a sleeping pill, at  night," he added. "The next morning you will probably not feel  quite yourself. Something like a hangover."</p>

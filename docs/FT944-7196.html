			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bayer, Hoechst in dye venture Bayer and Hoechst are to merge their textile dyes operations into a 50:50 joint venture in an attempt to revive profits and defend their market shares against low-cost competitors in Asia. The new company, expected to be established in mid-1995 and with aggregate annual turnover of DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), will mark a further important step in the consolidation of the German chemicals business. It follows a series of cross-border and inter-company deals which started in the recent recession as German chemicals groups strove to regain competitiveness and reinforce their companies better to withstand future cyclical slumps. Hoechst said markets for dyes had been subjected to deep-seated changes by new producers, notably in low-wage countries in Asia, which had led to losses. 'It is to be expected that this situation will become more severe,' it added. The new company will be based in Germany, while US operations are expected to be joined in a partnership. Most of Hoechst's PVC business has already been merged with the German chemical group Wacker's operations in a new company, Vinnolit, which is looking for a further partner to increase its critical mass. The group's plant protection business has also merged with that of Schering into a so-far successful venture, AgrEvo, which recently forecast sales of DM3.35bn this year and profits of about DM270m. AgrEvo yesterday announced the purchase of a majority stake in Stefes, a private agricultural chemicals distribution company with annual turnover of DM80m. Net earnings at Henkel, the German chemicals and consumer products group, rose 15 per cent to DM485m in the first three quarters of the current year as restructuring measures started to pay off. Sales rose marginally to DM10.5bn, according to an interim report, but fell in Germany. Reporting sales increases of 16 per cent in Asia and 12 per cent in the US, Mr Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus, chairman, said he aimed to reduce the company's dependence on Europe, and improve its position in consumer markets where there was an increasing tendency for retailers to stock only the top two or three leading brands.</p>

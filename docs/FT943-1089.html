			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Novelty of the short-term: Money market funds are catching on in Germany When German investors are offered champagne and caviar to tempt them to bring in new customers, something new must be up in a country where financial innovation proceeds cautiously rather than swiftly. In Germany, investors tend to be very much in the safety-first mould. The novelty is money market funds, now coming steadily on to the German financial scene since legal barriers to their sale were dropped last month. About 20 such funds have either been approved or are in the pipeline. With increased familiarity, investors will become blase about this new - for Germany - investment medium, offering immediate access to their money at interest rates higher than on fixed-rate deposits. To steal a march on its rivals, one big German bank set up two funds in Luxembourg while awaiting regulatory approval to base them in Germany. Commerzbank's funds - with minimum deposits of DM20,000 and DM100,000 for private and professional or corporate investors - have attracted nearly DM8bn (Pounds 3.2bn). Competitors tend to be disdainful about Commerzbank's marketing methods, including television advertising as well as its free champagne and caviar offer for clients introducing new business. But the bank, whose funds yield just more than 4 per cent against 3.5 per cent for term deposits, sees them as a way of raising new customers. Clearly, much of the money going into the funds comes from the bank's own fixed-rate deposit accounts, but Commerzbank reckons at least a quarter of the inflows represent new money. Other countries have had money market funds, which invest in short-term government, commercial and other paper, for some time. In the US, their volume totals nearly Dollars 600bn, while French funds have reached Dollars 250bn. In Germany, however, their significance goes beyond their likely attraction to investors. Their introduction represents an enhancement to the evolving status of Germany as a financial centre. 'This is more than a small step in the right direction,' says Mr Christian Strenger, chief executive of DWS, the Deutsche Bank fund management concern. 'This was one of the few elements still missing. It is important to have money market funds in the range of offerings. All mature financial markets have them.' If the Bundesbank had had its way, money market funds would never have seen the light of day. The central bank was concerned about their potential for undermining control of the money supply. To press home its point, the Bundesbank last month withdrew its short-dated paper (Bulis), saying it did not want to encourage short-termism in financial markets. This was re-emphasised last week by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the central bank, who said the federal and state governments should not turn to short-term issues. While the removal of Bulis takes some DM25bn of paper out of the market, fund managers do not see this as a great handicap. 'It's a pity that such a top quality investment is not available,' says Mr Strenger, but he and others see plenty of other investment opportunities. The German funds will obviously encourage more companies to issue commercial paper. There are about 60 CP programmes in D-Marks, including blue chips such as Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW. But the winding down of the Treuhand privatisation agency will remove the biggest programme, worth DM10bn. Mr Rudolf Siebel, Frankfurt-based investment fund analyst at the Moody's rating agency, says fund managers could have to accept more lower-grade paper from new issuers to offset the lack of government and Treuhand paper. However, the Bonn government's new 10-year floating rate bond, based on the three-month Frankfurt interbank rate - the Bundesbank is not too enthusiastic about this, either - will provide an additional investment. Mr Rolf Passow, head of DIT, the Dresdner Bank investment offshoot, hopes the funds will help popularise investment in funds generally as an alternative to fixed-interest savings. The next step would be to interest more people in share-based unit trusts. At present, 68 per cent of the DM325bn invested in German unit trusts is in bond funds. The potential prize is a big one. Germans have some DM4,000bn in private financial assets, 44 per cent of these in bank deposits. If more went into shares and funds, the effect on German financial markets could be considerable.</p>

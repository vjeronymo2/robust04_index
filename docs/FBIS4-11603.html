			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>   [Text] As you saw in this newscast, the situation is not  improving. On the contrary, the situation is getting worse, in  an environment of uncertainty, in the clashes in the main cities  and on the roads of the country.    The government has not implemented a state of siege, but it  is at an intermediate point, as putting troops on the streets  already illustrates the concern and inability of the police to  take complete control of the situation. I would not say there  is internal commotion, but the situation is reaching worrisome  levels.    The experience suffered by our colleague Cathia Rodriguez,  which you saw at the beginning of this newscast, was risky for  her personal safety because of the actions of common criminals,  thugs, who tried to lynch the policemen who were working in an  office in La Paz. This event shows that the situation is  beginning to get out of hand. I don't want to be an alarmist,  but this is worrisome. I believe there is little flexibility  from the government over negotiations that could provide some  option, some solution.    The Bolivian Labor Federation says it will not negotiate  under current conditions. The pressures are increasing, and the  government is beginning to face reality. It is up against the  wall, although paradoxically it holds the power. It opposes the  state of siege, but this could be a way out. But if the overall  situation is one of uncertainty and permanent confrontation, the  government will not achieve its goals. Deputy Ferrufino clearly  said: We are worried because of our impossibility of resolving  the problems.    It is time for the government to realize that the discovery  of a solution is in its hands, and this depends on a minimum of  flexibility, which we believe it lacks.</p>

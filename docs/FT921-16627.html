			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Calor Gas workers agree lump-sum deal DRIVERS AND production workers employed by Calor Gas have agreed an unusual pay deal under which they will receive lump-sum payments instead of an annual increase in basic salary. The deal is part of a small but growing trend among companies which want to keep down fixed costs but are anxious to avoid the harmful effects a pay freeze can have on employee relations. Increasing numbers of companies have implemented pay freezes as the recession has continued, some without the agreement of workers and unions. The attraction to employers of one-off payments is that any percentage rise in the following year will be based on salaries agreed two years previously and so will cost less than if the payments had been consolidated into salaries. Lump-sum payments are more expensive than freezes but are less likely to alienate workforces. In the Calor deal - details of which are reported in a forthcoming bulletin by Incomes Data Services, the pay research organisation - the company has agreed two separate payments. The first sum, paid immediately after the conclusion of the deal, which had a review date of September 29 last year, provided Pounds 851 for drivers and Pounds 836 for plant operators. These were the amounts the average employee could expect to earn over the coming year if a 4.2 per cent rise had been applied. A second lump sum, worth Pounds 135 for drivers and Pounds 133 for operators, will be paid after March providing sales targets in a 13-week period from December 29 last year are reached. The settlement, covering 1,000 of Calor's 2,500 employees, also includes substantial improvements to pensions and other changes to fringe benefits. Under the previous agreement, effective from September 1990, basic rates were increased by 9 per cent with a further 1 per cent, again subject to achievement of sales targets, available from April last year.</p>

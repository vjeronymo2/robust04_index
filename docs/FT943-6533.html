			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Sport: The myth that leads to drugs Yesterday the Commonwealth Games ended their two-week hold over Victoria, Canada and BBC television. When I was growing up, this short reign seemed to have a tremendous importance - second only to that of the Olympics, and cast in the same grand mould. To win a Commonwealth Games title was highly impressive and, whatever its colour, a Games medal had true prestige. Now these titles look like something quaint. Top athletes compete for them in a spirit of benign patronage, bestowing themselves upon their event rather as they might visit an ageing great aunt. If by some terrible fluke their medal is not gold, then it might as well have come out of a cracker for all the pleasure it gives them to receive it. Athletics has changed so much since the mid-1980s that it is hard, too, for the spectator to show the deference of old towards the Commonwealth Games. Accustomed as one is to seeing world class line-ups at the flick of a switch, it is impossible to take a proper interest in athletes whom one has never heard of, and whom one will never lay eyes on again after the race. Impossible, too, not to feel the absurdity that places nonentities side by side with superstars, and pits genuine amateurs against amateurs who have mysteriously earned hundreds of thousands of pounds. Athletes are competing in the same arena but in two different spheres: that of good club runner and the other of the world class talent. If an owner were to enter a greyhound in a 400 metre race against dogs capable of running two seconds faster, people would think him insane. In athletics however, this seems to be quite acceptable. What I love is the way the commentators strive towards egalitarianism. Moving through the line-up for the race, the degree of quavery respect in David Coleman's voice will remain the same whether he is introducing Colin Jackson, or, let us say, Nifty Mwambe in lane eight - 'now 36, was a Zambian youth champion'. Of course commentators can rightly do nothing else. But still I like to hear them do it; it seems so mannerly, somehow, like watching a man be as politely flirtatious with a plain woman as with a pretty one. The Commonwealth Games are mannerly. They retain the grace and good humour that I remember from years ago, and this can be seen in the demeanour of the athletes - no Dennis Mitchell's here. The superstars seem far happier than usual; partly, of course, because they are more likely than usual to win, but also, perhaps, because they are in closer contact than usual with their club running roots. It is strange really. In a sense one feels that, despite the vast disparity between Colin Jackson and Nifty Mwambe, this event brings them together and suffuses them with the same spirit. In another sense one wonders what the hell they are doing running against each other. Yes, the superstars are relaxed, more like real people than the highly-defined images that they have become to us. But this charming event is not the reality of their lives. The reality is something much more intense. It is an inescapable part of a much tougher modern world, and in it they are playing for much higher stakes. Over the past few years athletes have become, en masse, a phenomenon. They have come to define an absolute of physicality, which is a quality so worshipped by our society that the athletes too are worshipped, not merely for what they do but for what they are: young, fit, dedicated, successful. Encouraged by the money men, who recognised and exploited this phenomenon, athletes now act the part for their worshippers. Can you remember how they used to look, those white shorts flapping like handkerchiefs, those dank cotton vests, those unselfconscious bodies that never advertised the feats of which they were capable? Compare them with the glistening peacocks of today, strutting in their second skin of virulent lycra, and full of the sense that they are the cynosure of millions of envious eyes. In fact athletes seem as fascinated by their physicality as we are; together we collude in forcing the myth that they are almost god-like. If this myth clings lightly to every athlete, then it positively embraces the superstars. This is a heavy burden to bear, for all the rewards it brings. It is very nice to be worshipped. However, when expectations are not just high but almost unreal, failure assumes an inappropriate significance: if either Jackson, Christie or Gunnell had lost at the Commonwealth Games, obituaries of their talent would have been written immediately. Meanwhile, the mass of unknowns, standing in the lanes around them, yearn towards their deified image; yearn to leap the cavern that separates nonentities from superstars. Is it any wonder that there are those within the world of athletics who will do anything to enhance their abilities? Probably only if the myth of the god-like athlete were to be exploded would the problem of drugs disappear. And, paradoxically, if anything were to explode the myth, it would be the drug people. The extraordinary recent success of athletics has fed a monster within it. Watching the Commonwealth Games, one had the oddest sense that those past and present of athletics were there at the same time; events were conducted in true, uplifting, amateur spirit, yet who knew if any of the athletes were what they seemed? One had the sense too, that if athletics were to have a decent future, free of the taint that now touches both guilty and innocent, then it would do well to look to its past for guidance.</p>

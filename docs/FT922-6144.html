			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: A hostage to its UK parent's lost fortune / A look at the future of Galerias Preciados, the failed group's Spanish retail arm AS GALERIAS Preciados, Spain's second largest retail chain, prepares to change owners for the fifth time in 10 years following the collapse on Monday of Mountleigh, its UK parent, at least one group of employees will not be too concerned about their future. They are the 300 staff at the large Galerias store on Madrid's prestigious Calle Serrano who last Christmas won Pta12bn (Pounds 65.2m) in the country's biggest lottery. For the remaining 7,200 Galerias employees in each of its 29 stores around Spain, the future is once again heavy with speculation and concern. The administrative receivership of Mountleigh makes it 'inevitable' that Galerias would have to be sold, Mr Tim Hayward, one of the Peat Marwick receivers at Mountleigh, said in Madrid. Mr Hayward, who is in Madrid to outline the receivership at Mountleigh to senior Galerias management, also said one potential buyer had made an offer for the chain. It is believed this bid is being organised in New York and may involve Mr Nelson Pelz and Mr Peter May, the US investors who bought control of Mountleigh in late 1989 and subsequently sold half of their 22 per cent stake. Mr Michael Babcock, an American managing direc- tor appointed last year by Mr Pelz and Mr May, has also suggested he might try to look for support to buy the chain and it is highly likely that there will be other bidders. One possibility is Marks and Spencer, which has recently opened two stores in Spain and may be looking for more sites. But M and S is unlikely to want all 29 Galerias stores. Analysts say it will be difficult to put a price on the company. It is said to have debts of close to Pounds 200m and last year, under new American management, slipped back into losses after three profitable years. Galerias' biggest creditor is probably Mountleigh itself, which has guaranteed and raised some Dollars 150m (Pounds 85m) on Galerias' behalf in the past two years, principally in London. 'It is not our intention to ask for the immediate repayment of that money,' said Mr Hayward. 'It is our desire that Galerias continue to operate as a going concern and we hope to be able to see it into safe hands.' Galerias, which was yesterday trying to reassure suppliers and employees that its operations would not be affected by the Mountleigh receivership, has changed ownership four times already in the past 10 years. The chain was owned by the Rumasa banking and trading group which the Spanish government expropriated in 1983. It was subsequently sold on by the government to the powerful Cisneros family of Venezuela and, in 1987, to Mountleigh. Since its expropriation the group has made money only in the three years it was under the control of a management appointed by Mr Anthony Clegg, Mountleigh's founder. In the 1990-91 year sales rose 34 per cent to Pta97.6bn compared with 1987-88, while income had increased 36 per cent to Pta33bn. The new management under Mr Babcock has spent heavily on trying to take the chain up-market, refurbishing stores and on advertising. Although accounts for the last financial year, to April 30 this year, have not been published, and Galerias was not available for comment yesterday, sales growth is understood to have slowed to just 0.5 per cent while expenses have risen sharply. The group is thought to have ended last year with a loss of Pta3.8bn after net profits of Pta1.2bn in 1990-91. To combat its rising costs Galerias has been trying, with only partial success, to sell and lease back some of its stores. It has had some successes - although leasing has sent costs soaring - but as the Spanish economy has slowed down, so have property prices. Galerias' problems in selling its two sites in Barcelona are one measure of the problems it faces.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN MOROCCO-BOUND FOR A PARTY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, hardly anyone's definition of a party boy, will shuck  convention and join the jet set next week for a high-power, celebrity studded  birthday celebration in Tangier for publisher Malcolm Forbes.  </P> <P> A bit out of the ordinary for the strait-laced governor who celebrates  political victories with a heaping bowl of jamoca almond fudge ice cream, you  may wonder?  </P> <P> Perhaps a bit, conceded press secretary Kevin Brett. He confirmed that  Deukmejian and his wife, Gloria, will join about 800 special friends Aug. 19 to  celebrate Forbes' 70th birthday at the magazine publisher's castle overlooking  the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> "This may not be what people normally associate with George Deukmejian," Brett  said. But he quickly added: "They should understand it is not unlike Gov.  Deukmejian to meet with highly visible . . . individuals in the business  community, albeit in a social setting."  </P> <P> According to a Washington Post society column, invited guests include such  personalities as Elizabeth Taylor; Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee Iacocca;  television's Barbara Walters and Walter Cronkite; actress Dina Merrill;  designer Oscar de la Renta; Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli; Washington Post  chairman Katherine Graham; comedienne Joan Rivers and former Treasury Secretary  W. Michael Blumenthal.  </P> <P> Deukmejian and the governor of Rhode Island, Ed DiPrete, are believed to be the  only two political officeholders to attend, Brett said. He noted that the  Deukmejians' costs, including round-trip chartered jet fare from New York to  Morocco, will be paid by Forbes and reported on the governor's legally required  disclosure of gifts report.  </P> <P> Brett said Deukmejian, who is accompanied at virtually every function by at  least one staff aide, would not have office assistants on this trip. "I cannot  think of a similar situation where that has occurred," Brett said.  </P> <P> The press secretary refused to discuss how Deukmejian's name got on the guest  list, but he said "there is a familiarity with Gov. Deukmejian by Malcolm  Forbes himself." He noted that the governor's picture was on the cover of  Forbes magazine in 1984 and the publication printed a story about his program  to balance the state budget. Since then, the governor has met with the  magazine's staff, Brett said.  </P> <P> Brett said the Morocco trip will be sandwiched between long-scheduled official  state business conferences Deukmejian will hold with bankers, investors and  corporate executives in New York Aug. 16-22.  </P> <P> He said Deukmejian, as he has in the past, would meet with the finance  executives to discuss the fiscal condition of California and seek to attract  more investment in the state.  </P> <P> Deukmejian will fly to New York on Wednesday, meet with manufacturing  executives on Thursday, fly to Morocco on Friday, party on Saturday, return to  New York on Sunday, hold more conferences on Monday and return to California on  Tuesday.  </P></p>

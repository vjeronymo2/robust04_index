			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Hosokawa on a tightrope MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, will step on to a diplomatic tightrope when he goes to Seattle on Friday for the first summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. The Tokyo government aims to strike a balance between the conflicting ambitions of its US and Asian allies in a region which includes some of the world's fastest growing but most diverse economies. This requires sensitive handling by Japan. Most of Apec's Asian partners - China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - prefer to keep Apec vague and informal. That way, it can contain members of a region far more economically and politically diverse than Europe ever was, they argue. Some are also wary over what they see as attempts by non-Asian members led by the US to exert economic dominance through Apec. Officially, Japan stands somewhere in between the Asian and US camps. It hopes to gain regional influence by upsetting neither of them, even if it has no strong ideas of its own on how Apec should develop. It cannot afford to offend its traditional military protector and biggest trading partner, the US, with which it shares free-market policies, despite perennial rows over each other's alleged protectionism. Yet it is also keener than ever to develop Asian ties. The region is a growing destination for Japanese foreign investment and of increasing diplomatic importance as Japan takes a more pragmatic view of its US partnership after the end of the cold war. 'The US seems insensitive to Asians' feeling that Apec should not be a negotiating forum,' says a senior Foreign Ministry official. Japanese officials live in horror of further offending the touchy Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, who is suspicious of so-called white countries' Asian economic ambitions and has refused to turn up. Sensitive to concerns such as these, Mr Hosokawa will reject suggestions in the report that Apec should take part in negotiations on international trade liberalisation, say officials. He will call on partners to respect the political, social and cultural variety of Asian nations. At the same time, Mr Hosokawa will make one gentle step to pushing Apec forward by proposing a conference on cultural exchange. This could capitalise on the improvement in Japan-Asian relations achieved through apologies offered by Mr Hosokawa over the past few months for Japan's wartime aggression - the most explicit ever made by a Japanese leader.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Text] The highway checkpoints (Precos) set up by the  Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] have helped  to curb some of the drug trafficking, kidnappings, and assaults  in the national highway network. Therefore, as the institution  of federal justice announced yesterday, this type of police  checkpoint will soon be expanded.    The office stressed that there are currently 19 Precos in  operation, disseminated in 13 states of the republic with high  rates of crime on highways, noting that there is less insecurity  in those states now. The Federal Judicial Police forces detailed  to them have arrested large numbers of criminals, with a  presence that has prevented the commission of crimes to a  considerable extent.    The Precos operate in towns such as Ensenada, Baja  California; and settlements such as Benjamin Hill and San  Luis-Rio Colorado, Sonora; Los Mochis and Villa Union, Sinaloa;  El Sueco, Chihuahua; Gomez Palacio and Santiago Papasquiario,  Durango; Las Norias (Southern Highway, San Fernando),  Tamaulipas; Carapan (Glorieta Highway crossing) and Zitacuaro  (Southern Highway and Huetamo), Michoacan; and  Linares-Monterrey-Monclova Highway, Nuevo Leon. They are also  located at boundaries: in Guerrero; Michoacan (Ixtapa-Lazaro  Cardenas Highway); La Ventosa, Oaxaca; Gregorio Mendez, Tabasco;  Huehuetan and Comitan, Chiapas; and Caoba and Kilometer 56  (Chetumal-Carrillo Puerto Highway), Quintana Roo.    The PGR noted that these checkpoint operations are headed by  highly qualified personnel, including agents from the Public  Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Judicial Police, and a  representative of the Human Rights Commission, to prevent  irregularities and to ensure that their operations adhere  strictly to the law. Their only goal is to raise the levels of  security for persons traveling on the nation's highways,  especially the federal ones. Their intention is to reduce the  crime rate and to meet the demand expressed by various social  sectors for a resolute battle against the drug traffic and arms  contraband.    They are also required to cooperate with the state  governments to prevent kidnappings; and, if they should occur,  they must assist the local authorities in investigating them, as  well as intensifying the battle against the drug traffic.</p>

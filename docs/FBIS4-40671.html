			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The second round of inter-Tajik talks opened in  the Iranian capital 18 June. The delegation representing the  Dushanbe Government is headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, minister of  labor and employment, and the opposition is led by Otakhon  Latifi, Khudaiberdi Khaliknazarov, and others.    The opening ceremony of the second round of talks was held  in  the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' political research  center and it was attended by Ramiro Piriz Ballon [the UN  secretary-general's envoy to Tajikistan] and observers from  Russia, Iran, Pakistan, (?Afghanistan), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  and Uzbekistan. From Russia, roving Ambassador Aleksandr Oblov  and Sergey Tretyakov, Russian ambassador in Iran, are taking  part in the talks.    Speeches by Piriz Ballon, Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati, and the heads of the Tajik delegations indicate that  the main objective of the second round of the talks is to sign a  cease-fire agreement.    Having positively assessed the results of the first round of  talks in Moscow, the UN secretary-general's envoy said that the  agenda for [the second round of] talks was agreed during talks  [in Moscow] and a joint commission was formed on the issue of  refugees. He highly assessed the efforts of Russia and  observers from other countries and at the same time expressed  concern at the upsurge of hostilities including an increase in  terrorist attacks against Russian military personnel in  Tajikistan.    Piriz Ballon said that despite all these, serious  disagreements exist between the representative of the Tajik  Government and the opposition. He called on both sides to  strive for an atmosphere of mutual understanding during the  talks, to take measures to cease military and other hostile  operations, and to establish ways of observing future agreements.    Piris Ballon assured participants in the talks that the  United Nations and its secretary general are ready to provide  aid to assist the normalization of the situation by sending  experts and providing material aid for the repatriation of  refugees.    Pointing out the great importance of an end to conflict in  Tajikistan, he said that the establishment of peace in the  country is the only way to stability and prosperity in the  Central Asian region.    Iran's foreign affairs minister said at the opening ceremony  of the talks and at the subsequent news conference, that the  Tajikistan problem cannot be resolved by war. He rejected  claims that Tehran is exporting its Islamic revolution to  Tajikistan.    Shukurjon Zuhurov and Otakhon Latifi cautiously welcomed the  talks. However, some of their views show that serious  disagreements exist [between them] and that it will be difficult  to overcome them. [passage omitted]    The talks are expected to continue for 10 days. Working and  general meetings will also be held, attended by foreign  observers. It is also been reported that the third round of  talks will be held in Islamabad in the middle of July.</p>

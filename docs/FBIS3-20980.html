			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thierry Lucas: "From the Cire group: Printed </F> Circuits that Diffuse Heat"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE  introduction]    [Text] A new metal-base substrate quite suitable for power  electronics is currently being tested at Peugeot. It could also  be used in telecommunications.  Multiplexing considerably simplifies the electric wiring of  vehicles, but it requires the development of very specific  technologies. In particular, the printed circuit--the substrate  of electronic component interconnections--must possess three  qualities: good dissipation of the heat produced by power  components, small overall dimensions, and both at an affordable  price. The SMI (insulated metallic substrate) developed jointly  with Peugeot by BREE (a subsidiary of the Cire group) meets  these criteria. A preseries designed for use on 1,000 XM  vehicles is being manufactured; it will be used to test the new  process on a quasi-industrial scale.    The most original feature of SMI printed circuits is that  they use a metallic base instead of the standard glass-epoxy  material. Actually, the circuit is built on an aluminum foil no  more than 3 mm thick, which is covered with an insulating layer  on which the copper conducting plate is pressed. Additional  conducting layers can be obtained by using silver or  copper-based polymer pastes. When the circuit is equipped with  its components and mounted in the car, therefore, the heat it  produces can diffuse into the metallic substrate and from there  into the car body. This is an efficient solution that does not  require adding a heat sink on the circuit--the usual method to  improve heat dissipation in power circuits. According to Pascal  Poisson, the BREE manager, the savings achieved by not having to  purchase and install these heat sinks should offset the  additional cost of the metallic substrate, so that the cost of  the product would be about the same as that of a traditional  circuit.    Industrializing the SMI process required the development of  adequate production means. In particular, since aluminum foil is  a malleable material it cannot be machined with the equipment  traditionally used in making printed circuits. The metallic  plates must therefore be drilled, cut, and scribed with special  tools developed by BREE.    The conveying and loading/unloading systems were also  modified to accommodate the new substrate, which is heavier than  traditional substrates.    A total of 1 million francs was invested in preseries  production facilities. The Peugeot group's certification of the  insulated metallic substrate already created considerable  interest from other potential clients (in telecommunications).  They are waiting for the first results of the full-scale test  performed on the 1,000 XM vehicles which, according to BREE,  might warrant going on to mass production.</p>

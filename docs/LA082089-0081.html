			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATCHING WATCHERS  </P> <P> People in the media are in the business of selling illusion; but, increasingly,  they are beginning to believe the illusions themselves.  </P> <P> Such was the case when Daniel Cerone asked television critics "What America  Watches -- and Why" (Aug. 6). To believe that TV critics are authorities on  what motivates viewers to watch one program over another is to put up mirrors  and smoke screens. What is more interesting is how such critics themselves  influence what America watches. Indeed, TV critics create self-fulfilling  prophecies by telling the public what they are going to like or dislike and  why.  </P> <P> CAROLE LIEBERMAN, MD  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

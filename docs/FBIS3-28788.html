			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry  unveiled a tightened draft budget for fiscal 1994, projecting a  mere 1.0 percent growth, but virtually shrinking from the  initial fiscal 1993 budget.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii presented the draft,  totaling  73,081.7 billion yen, at an evening cabinet meeting and just in  time for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's meeting with U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday [11 February].  But Hosokawa may face difficulties in garnering U.S. support as  the ministry barely managed to maintain only a small growth.    The growth rate is higher than the 0.2 percent rise in the  fiscal 1993 initial budget after expenditures worth some 4,520  billion yen were squeezed through special accounting techniques.  Those measures included suspending 3,084.9 billion yen in  transfers to the debt-servicing account.    Without such measures to cope with expected low tax revenues  from the prolonged economic slump and planned income tax cuts,  the draft budget would have posted a year-to-year contraction, a  senior ministry official told reporters.    The austerity is more clearly seen in the general operating  expenditures -- the core of a state budget including public  works, defense, overseas assistance and other key outlays. Such  spending totaled 40,854.8 billion yen, up only 2.3 percent to  post the lowest growth since a 1.2 percent rise in the initial  budget for fiscal 1988 -- a year before Japan last issued  deficit-financing bonds.    Citing relatively strong spending in public works to lift  the  economy, Fujii told reporters that Japan could "win U.S.  support" with the budget along with a third supplementary budget  for fiscal 1993 budget, endorsed at the same cabinet meeting,  and a record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched  Tuesday.    Public works-related outlays came to 8,984.6 billion yen, up  4.0 percent for the third straight year.    A key principle stressed in the budget draft is to "consider  the economy as much as possible" to move it toward "a  full-fledged recovery phase as soon as possible in fiscal 1994  and on to stable growth in and after fiscal 1995." But "to  limit issuance of special (deficit-covering) bonds that leads to  uncontrolled deterioration of financial structure, (the  ministry) is making efforts to intensively and effectively  distribute funds amid limited financial sources while more  thoroughly reviewing expenditures," the draft says.    Amid a global trend of military cutbacks, the draft's  principle is clearly reflected in defense spending worth 4,678.8  billion yen, up a scant 0.8 percent to mark the lowest growth in  34 years.    Outlays for official development assistance (ODA) were  limited to 1,055.0 billion yen, up 4.0 percent. The growth is  lower than fiscal 1993's 6.5 percent, but the ministry official  said the total amount would be substantially higher in dollar  terms after the yen's sharp appreciation over the past year.    The draft estimates 53,665.0 billion yen for tax revenues --  the key income source -- down 12.5 percent for the second  consecutive year of lower projections.    Even if 4,377.0 billion yen in tax cuts are excluded,  estimated revenues are 3,366.0 billion yen lower than the  initial forecast in fiscal 1993.    Nontax revenues are expected to rise 104.8 percent to  5,601.2  billion yen, inflated irregularly through advanced loan  redemptions, and income from sales of the privatized Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shares is estimated at 172.5  billion yen, down 7.5 percent.    The special measures taken to raise revenues and squeeze  expenditures are thus leading to the limiting of allocations for  operating outlays. Given this situation, the ministry is to  issue a record 13,643.0 billion yen in government bonds,  consisting of 10,509.2 billion yen in construction bonds to be  used primarily for public works and 3,133.8 billion yen in  deficit-covering bonds to finance the tax cuts.    As a result, the bond revenue dependence comes to 18.7  percent of the budget, up from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993 and  the highest since 19.4 percent in fiscal 1987. The outstanding  balance of bonds tops 200 trillion yen for the first time to  reach about 201 trillion yen, up from an estimated 182 trillion  yen for the current year.    The ministry official expressed strong concern that a  further  rise in the bond balance would block the core spendings, and he  called for a tax reform by the year-end as the government and  the ruling coalition have promised.    Fujii said the government will make efforts to repay the  bonds to win public support.    The ministry also wants to return 1,544.8 billion yen  borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund in fiscal  1992 to cover a revenue shortfall.    As for other spendings, the ministry earmarked 14,360.2  billion yen for debt-servicing costs, down 7.0 percent, 12,757.8  billion yen for tax allocations to local governments, down 18.3  percent, and an unchanged 1,300 billion yen for various purposes  using revenues from NTT share sales.    Other ministries and agencies will now begin renegotiations  with the Finance Ministry to complete a government budget bill  by next Tuesday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received]--Muhammad Subayh,  Palestinian permanent representative to the Arab League and  secretary of the Palestine National Council [PNC], has said some  Kuwaiti elements have met with Zionist party figures, and are  providing huge financial assistance to the racist Likud Party.    In an exclusive statement to the INA correspondent in Cairo,  Subayh added that extending aid to the racist Likud Party is a  serious issue, particularly since this party advocates the  establishment of greater Israel extending from the Nile to the  Euphrates; calls for expelling Arabs from occupied Palestine; is  striving to annex Jerusalem, the Golan, and southern Lebanon to  the Hebrew state; and is engaged in instigation against Iraq.  He noted that such Kuwaiti conduct is condemnable and  unacceptable.    Subayh went on to say: If aid is to be extended, then Arab  and Muslim peoples everywhere, and in occupied Palestine in  particular, are in dire need of Arab aid. Extending aid to  Arabs and Muslims in general, and to the Palestinians in  particular, would be better than extending it to the fascists  who are occupying Arab lands. He described this development as  strange and unacceptable.    The PNC secretary urged Kuwaiti rulers to settle the  Palestinians' dues, as well as deductions estimated at some $70  million, which they are still holding.    The Palestinian official noted the statements made by Ari'el  Sharon, a key leader of the Likud Party, who has announced that  it is the Zionist authorities alone who will protect Gulf oil,  and that they will not allow any Arab country to develop and  progress and build a scientific base.    Concluding his statement, Subayh said the Palestinian people  condemn and denounce these Kuwaiti elements for supporting the  racist Likud Party and other parties at the expense of the Arab  nation and Palestine.</p>

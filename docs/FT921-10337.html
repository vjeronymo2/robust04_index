			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on National Insurance burden - Social Security HALF A MILLION people would have to pay more in national insurance contributions even if their annual salary was below the Pounds 21,000 ceiling, Mr Tony Newton, the social security secretary, said yesterday. Mr Newton warned that Labour's suggestion that contributions could be annualised to avoid that arising could not be introduced immediately and would cause widespread disruption. Every computer payroll system would have to be reprogrammed, he said. Labour disputed both claims. Defending the use of bonuses, commissions and overtime as important incentives, Mr Newton said the proposal would hurt those Labour said it wished to encourage, such as skilled workers, engineers and managers. In any event, he added, even if calculated on an annual basis, Labour's scheme would amount to a steep rise in the marginal tax rate of people earning between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000. 'Since they'd receive no extra benefits in return, Labour would effectively add 9p to their marginal tax rate - creating a new overtime tax pitched at a staggering 34p in the pound.' He conceded, however, that there had been an increase over the past five years in the number of those facing marginal deduction rates of more than 70 per cent, as a result of the interaction between the tax and benefit systems. The rise, from 290,000 in 1985 to 395,000 in 1990-91, reflected the introduction of more income-related benefits, he said. He also pointed out no one now faced a marginal rate of more than 100 per cent. Mr Newton also resisted the idea that contributions should simply be treated as part of the tax system.</p>

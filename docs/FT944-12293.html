			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Shakespeare's Language - Theatre If you love masterpieces in their original form, you may often feel alarmed at the way they are adapted, translated or deconstructed. I confess to a certain alarm at the current Everybody's Shakespeare season at the Barbican. Sure, it will be interesting to see what Germans, Japanese, Israelis, Georgians and others are doing with Shakespeare; sure, I wish I could see all the Shakespeare films. But we can bet that all this Bardomania will contain a fair share of Bardoclasm. I try to remind myself that I can love Carmen Jones as well as Carmen. But the fact remains that the prospect of a Peter Sellars Merchant of Venice makes me nervous. It is good news, then, that the Royal Shakespeare Company's own contribution to the season leads us right back to the heart of the Bard  - his language - in a week-long series of public workshops led by the company's brilliant veteran director, John Barton. Barton hurls no thunderbolts at us or at his actors and he reveals no special mysteries. He is the same source of rare good sense as in his 1984 TV series Playing Shakespeare, and as in many of his wonderful RSC stagings. He starts from the simplest premise: trust the text. And he asks the most basic questions: do the actors make the audience listen? What kind of character would say these words? Working from these sound beginnings, he helps his actors to reveal marvels. During the week, he will work with Judi Dench, Peter Hall, Jane Lapotaire, Fiona Shaw and others. On Monday, he tackled scenes from Henry V with Penny Downie, Harriet Walter and Tony Church. The latter gave us a hilariously characterful account of the Archbishop of Canterbury's fustian speech on the Salic law, but when Barton asked him to point up the speech's many proper names, we reached another level of meaning at once. And that level was to become yet more pronounced in later speeches, when we heard names, names, coming back with deepening nuances. As Church himself remarked, after Walter had given a vivid account of Henry V's reading the lists of the dead, Shakespeare personalised the names of the dead more than he had when they were alive - so heightening the play's considerable pathos. Barton threw Downie and Walter without any preparation into the delectable scene when Princess Katherine learns English from her maid, Alyse. Their account of this was a gem of spontaneity. Which was Barton's point: in Shakespeare's day, actors would have had no formal direction and little preparation for each new role. Today, we have to work to regain that natural entry into Shakespearian speech. But 'you won't bring Shakespeare alive without that Elizabethan sense of the language.' The antitheses of the Prologue; the broken sense of discovery in Mistress Quickly's account of Falstaff's death; the heightened effect of having the French king pronounce French names a l'anglaise; the drama to be mined from the Herald Mountjoy's speech if spoken with barbed suavity; the brilliantly deflationary conclusion given to the play by the Epilogue sonnet . . . all these emerged with new clarity. And as the veteran Church kept learning from Barton's points and his colleagues' performances, I remembered the exciting lesson I once learnt from seeing Ninette de Valois rehearse Robert Helpmann in a role she had created for him 41 years before: one is never too old to learn.

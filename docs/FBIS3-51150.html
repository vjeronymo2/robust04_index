This is the first wave of violence to take place this year  in  Venezuela, where a new tax has increased consumer products by 10  percent.    According to witnesses, the disturbances began when the  police fired shots and used tear gas against a "peaceful"  demonstration of residents who had blocked traffic on an  important avenue. The people were protesting the hike in public  transportation rates in effect since late December. The reports  add that two persons were wounded -- one by bullets -- during  the clash. A grocery truck on the outskirts of Barcelona was  looted and there were attempts to loot some stores in the  downtown area, but the police stopped them.    Although it was a people's protest, University of Oriente  students expressed solidarity with the protest and burned a city  bus.    At 1900 (2300 GMT) there still were serious traffic jams  throughout the city.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- Qin Wenjun, deputy  director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, pointed out on 21  February: The Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 Hong Kong  electoral arrangements are a matter between the Chinese and  British Governments. The Hong Kong Government has no right to  publish the contents of the Sino-British talks. If the British  side wants to publish the contents of the talks, these should be  issued through diplomatic channels. The British side should not  violate the principle of confidentiality agreed upon by the two  governments.    Qin Wenjun attended a Spring Festival get-together sponsored  by the "Hong Kong United Association for the Advancement of  Women in All Walks of Life" yesterday evening. When asked by  reporters about the British Hong Kong Government's declared  intention to publish the contents of the 17 rounds of the  Sino-British talks, he said: The British Hong Kong Government  should understand three points about this issue: First, the  Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements are a  matter between the Chinese and British Governments, and the Hong  Kong Government has no right whatsoever to publish the contents  of Sino-British talks. Second, at the start of the talks, the  Chinese and British Governments agreed on a common principle --  the principle of confidentiality, and the Hong Kong Government  should take this into consideration prudently. Third, if the  Hong Kong Government wants to publish the contents of the  Sino-British talks, these should be issued through diplomatic  channels. If the British side unilaterally publishes the  contents of the talks, it will violate the principle agreed upon  by the two Governments. He urged the British side to take a  prudent attitude.</p>

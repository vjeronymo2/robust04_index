			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENT LIFE: MOVING MAY BE BEST IF PROMISES ABOUT LUXURY UNIT ARE NOT KEPT  </P> <P> QUESTION: I recently moved into a 3-month-old luxury apartment in Encino. I was  assured that the building would be properly maintained and that no children  would be allowed on the second or third floors. I did not get any of this in  writing. Now, the building is filthy and there are some very noisy children  right above me.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, I have a three-year lease. The city's rent control people and  the city attorney's office say they can't help me because the building is  exempted from the city's rent law. What can I do? My lawyer thinks the only  remedies I have are to either move or sue. What do you think?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Your attorney is probably right about moving being a solution. I'm not  so sure about a lawsuit. If you decide to move, be sure to cooperate with the  owner's efforts to rerent the unit, as you may be responsible for rent until  it's rerented.  </P> <P> The city's rent control authorities cannot help since they are only empowered  to deal with rent-controlled properties.  </P> <P> If the filthiness of the building represents a health or safety problem, then  the county's health/safety department may cite the owner for the condition and  require him to remedy it. Likewise, you may be entitled to withhold a portion  of your monthly rent equal to the percentage of reduced services caused by the  filth.  </P> <P> The owner's oral promise to prohibit children on the second or third floors is  also very difficult to enforce since it was only verbal and is easily denied by  him. It may also constitute illegal child discrimination. You should always get  all important contract provisions in writing, and that goes beyond housing  arrangements to all contracts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Are Tenant's Rights in Condo Sale?  </P> <P> Q: I have been leasing an Agoura Hills condo for six months and the leases  expires in another six months. The owner of the condo has told me by phone that  he is putting the place up for sale. I don't really know what my rights are as  a tenant, and I'm hoping you can help.  </P> <P> In the lease that I drew up, it says that I get 60 days' notice to move out.  Here are my questions. Can I stay in the condo until the lease runs out, even  if it's sold? Is the 60-day notice to move provisions in my lease enforceable?  And what if the owner can't sell right away and I turn into a month-to-month  tenant? Can I still get 60 days' notice to move if that happens?  </P> <P> A: When your tenancy expires, you become a month-to-month tenant unless your  lease agreement has a "holdover" provision, making its terms applicable to the  post-lease period. Don't count on the owner voluntarily agreeing to a 60-day  notice provision in a month-to-month agreement because such a provision delays  a new owner's right to possession of the unit by an extra 30 days, which is not  a great selling point.  </P> <P> The 60-day notice to vacate written into your lease is enforceable until the  lease expires.  </P> <P> Similarly, you may occupy the unit to the end of your lease term, even if it  changes hands. That guaranteed right to occupy is why you signed a lease in the  first place. Making some tentative moving plans now, for six months down the  line, probably would not be premature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tenant Gone, but Left All His Possessions  </P> <P> Q: I am a 66-year-old widow. My husband left me a four-unit apartment building  in Inglewood that I am now managing for the first time.  </P> <P> My problem is that one of my tenants is an artist so he's gone a lot of the  time. He's in Paris now and I've heard that he isn't coming back, which would  be all right with me except that he owes me four months' rent at $300 a month  and I need the rent from the unit to supplement the $400 a month that I get  from Social Security.  </P> <P> I would like to know how I can get his things out of there to rerent the unit  to a tenant who will pay me some rent.  </P> <P> What can I do? Even if I can remove his things from the unit, I can't afford to  store them. What do I do with them? Any help you can provide me with is greatly  appreciated.  </P> <P> A: It's unfortunate that you have waited so long to do anything about this  problem. You could have acted much sooner, after the 14th day the rent was past  due and the tenant disappeared.  </P> <P> Your best course of action here is probably to serve the tenant with a Notice  of Belief of Abandonment. (It's available free to members of the Apartment  Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA). In Inglewood phone (213) 674-0463. Ask  for Mary Lou.)  </P> <P> To serve such a notice, the rent must be more than 14 days past due and you  must have a reasonable belief that the tenant has abandoned the unit, i.e.,  left with no intent to return. You, clearly, meet those two tests (assuming the  tenant has been away for the four months that the rent has gone unpaid).  </P> <P> If nothing happens within 18 days after you serve this notice (15 days if the  notice is served in person), both by posting a copy on the door and by mailing  a copy to any and all known addresses of the renter, you may then take  possession of both the rental unit and the renter's personal property.  </P> <P> If the property is worth less than $300, you may dispose of it in any way you  see fit.  </P> <P> If the value of the property is over $300, disposing of it is much more  difficult. You must inventory it, publish public notices of the pending auction  you must conduct, and then hold an auction at which you sell the property. The  proceeds of the auction, less expenses, are then turned over to the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renter Says Deposit Not Being Returned  </P> <P> Q: I recently broke a lease in the city of Orange. I moved out on Sept. 30 and  the rent was paid up until then. The unit was rented to a new tenant on Oct.  11. I understand that I was liable for the rent from Oct. 1 until it was  rerented, but the landlady won't give me the rest of my $1,000 security deposit  back. I left the place very clean. What can I do?  </P> <P> A: The owner cannot collect double rent as a penalty for your lease. You are,  as you say, only liable for 11 days rent. If all else fails, you'll probably  have to sue the owner of the property in small claims court to get the balance  of your deposit back. The filing fee is small and the clerks at most courts are  usually helpful with paper work.  </P> <P> Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine, a publication of the Apartment  Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), an apartment owner's service group.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Francisco Rubio; from the "Good </F> Morning From Mexico" newscast]    [Text] The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel  Ruiz Garcia, has announced that the draft documents that will be  entitled Commitments for an Honorable Peace, Commitment for  Peace, and Peace Declaration, are in their final phase.    He denied that national issues such as democracy and  modification of constitutional Article 27, which deals with  agrarian laws, have delayed the negotiations for peace.    [Begin Ruiz recording] There are 34 commitments. Two of  these commitments are not binding. They have to do with  democracy. From the beginning it was a known fact that they do  not form part of an agreement, strictly speaking, but that they  are an opinion made known to the national community. It is  expected that this opinion should have an impact on this  community. [end recording]    Ruiz said that some 10 or 12 points are yet to be negotiated  before an agreement is reached. Of these points, four or five  are of secondary importance.    [Begin Ruiz recording] The others have a certain level of  importance but because of linguistic difficulties they are still  being discussed. They are not fundamental for reaching an  agreement. We could say that a significant agreement has been  reached already. [end recording]    More than 72 hours after the doors of the peace cathedral  were closed -- something that spawned speculation that the peace  talks had been blocked -- Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that neither  the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas nor the  Zapatist National Liberation Army have been intransigent.    [Begin Ruiz recording] So far there has been intransigence  neither in the discussions of the agreements that are to be  approved nor in the position of either side. [end recording]    This information was provided during a news conference that  Bishop Samuel Ruiz held alone with reporters. He explained that  the final text of the agreements could me made known either  Tuesday [1 March] evening or Wednesday [2 March] morning.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market rejects Gas tale The stock market was alarmed yesterday at a story in the weekend press that British Gas may be forced into cutting its dividend by the end of the year, because of the impact of regulatory pressures on its profits. Gas is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday. The shares were by far the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, falling 9 1/2 to 284 1/2 p ex-dividend, and were the most heavily traded with more than 18m changing hands. Gas shares have moved erratically in recent weeks, plunging to 280p on April 28 following a profits warning, and racing up to more than 300p last week as the market gave a positive reaction to the Department of Trade/Ofgas report on competition and pricing in UK domestic gas supply. Many analysts were sceptical of the dividend threat story. 'Gas declined to discuss the dividend when it made its profits warning in April, and a dividend cut seems most unlikely this year,' said one. Another said that Gas will pay maintained dividends in the near term, although its ability to do so post-1996 depends on progress on cost-cutting. 'There is a long term risk to Gas's dividend but not so in the short term,' he added.</p>

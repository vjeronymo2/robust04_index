			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Big three Swiss banks seen as villains of the piece - Mr Vontobel's cautionary tale In the rankings of Zurich's gnomes, few  - if any  - outrank the blue-blood Vontobels. Thus, when a Vontobel speaks, the Swiss financial community listens. Yesterday, Mr Hans-Dieter Vontobel, chief executive of the eponymous family-controlled banking group, spoke loudly, launching a book* in which he argues that radical reforms essential to Switzerland's financial industry should not be implemented so quickly as to kill off most of the players. The villains of Mr Vontobel's piece are the big three universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse, which seem, perhaps unwittingly, to be doing just that. He argues that the big three are already far too powerful in Switzerland, dominating virtually every financial market and decision-making on the stock exchange and other collective institutions. 'In the end, that is bad for customers and bad even for Swiss politics,' he says. The big banks, however, are recognised to need a strong base to support their international aspirations. They have been snapping away market share from the small regional banks and demanding the public sector cantonal banks be weaned from their government guarantees. Mr Vontobel too would like to see the playing field levelled but, he says, the cantonal banks, which could be a major force in the market, need time to adapt to a new era. 'It would be bad to take away the guarantee right away  -maybe in 10 years.' In his book, he writes, 'More and more, it seems that the interests of the Swiss financial centre are diverging from the interests of banks working in the international arena. This fact should be borne in mind when considering conflicts over financial policies.' He also points to the case of currency options. In other financial centres, these are traded on futures and options exchanges open to all. In Switzerland, the big banks have prevented the local futures and options market, SOFFEX, from taking on currency options, prefering to keep that business for themselves. * Wettbewerb als Chance (Competition as Opportunity), by Hans-Dieter Vontobel and Lukas Morscher, Verlag Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Zurich, pp287.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: MAN expects to raise payout Germany's MAN engineering group expects to increase its dividend for the 1994-95 financial year as restructuring measures pay off and profits improve sharply. Mr Klaus Gotte, chairman, said the payout for the year to the end of June 1995 would win 'more applause' than last time's cut from DM8.50 to DM7 following a drop in net profits from DM230m (Dollars 154m) to DM160m. Earnings would recover this year to between DM200m and DM300m, he said, while next year's profits might match the record DM418m in the year to the end of June, 1992. The chairman forecast a clear profit from commercial vehicles this year, and said last time's DM250m loss at MAN Roland printing press subsidiary would be at least halved. Reviewing business in the first quarter, Mr Gotte said sales rose 2 per cent to DM3.32bn. Domestic turnover was down 6 per cent, while foreign sales were up 8 per cent. However, incoming orders for buses, trucks, presses, plant and engineering products had risen 25 per cent in the review period to DM4.7bn. Domestic orders were 21 per cent higher and foreign demand was up 28 per cent; as a result, the total value of orders on hand rose 9 per cent to DM16.5bn.</p>

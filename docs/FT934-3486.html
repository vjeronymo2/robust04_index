			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shrugs off hint of tight monetary policy Wall Street US stocks nudged into record territory yesterday, shrugging off comments by the Federal Reserve vice-chairman which were interpreted as a signal of an early tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 8.67 firmer at 3,718.88, surpassing the previous all-time closing high of 3,710.77 set on November 16. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 improved 0.33 to 466.76, while the American SE composite put on 1.58 at 467.40 but the Nasdaq composite shed 1.74 to 769.35. NYSE volume came to 285.7m shares. Equities opened broadly higher, building on a week of steady, if unimpressive, gains which reflected a stream of good economic news last week. The market briefly stumbled during mid-morning after Mr David Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman, said 'vigilance' was required in view of the economy's strong growth in the fourth quarter. He added that the Fed could not afford to wait until clear signs of inflation emerged before moving to raise short-term interest rates. His remarks were interpreted by analysts as a signal that the Fed may act sooner, rather than later, possibly as early as the first quarter of next year. The negative impact on the US Treasury market was discernible but not devastating. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was 3/16 off at 101 1/32 , with the yield shading higher to 6.162 per cent. A firming trend in crude oil futures, which tumbled to five-year lows late on Monday, failed to lift most of the petroleum-related issues. Texaco gained Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 62 7/8 , but Mobil was down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 75 1/4 . Exxon was unchanged at Dollars 62 5/8 . Transportation issues, which often decline on higher crude oil prices, were mixed. Investors took in their stride an announcement by American Airlines that the recent strike by flight attendants would reduce after-tax earnings by Dollars 160m. The stock rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 67 1/2 . Boeing advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 41 after Salomon Brothers lifted its rating on the shares to 'buy' from 'hold'. Wall Street was well pleased with RJR Nabisco's announcement of a big restructuring programme, pushing the stock up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 5/8 . Retailing issues were mostly easier after the Johnson Redbook Service said sales had dipped last week from the previous seven days. Sears bucked the trend, rising Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Pairgain Technologies surged Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/8 on the heels of an upgrading by Olde Discount. Canada Toronto finished higher in active trading, boosted by strong gains among mining and transportation stocks. The TSE 300 index rose 29.5 to 4,265.5 and advances led declines by 434 to 384 after volume of 75.1m shares. The mining and transportation group indices climbed 4.11 and 2.33 per cent respectively.</p>

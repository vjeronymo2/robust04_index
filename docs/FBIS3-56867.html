			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 19 TASS -- A month after the adoption  of the new constitution in December 1993 Russia is facing a new  crisis.    The resignation of First Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar  and  the protracted formation of a new government signify not only a  new crisis of power but an entirely new balance of political  forces around President Boris Yeltsin who remains the only  guarantor of the continuation of reform in Russia. Other  "guarantors" have slackened their support for the president.    Immediately after his resignation earlier this week Gaydar  distanced himself from the loss-making policy of Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, which, he believes, "is leading the country  to a sharp financial destabilisation."    Georgiy Satarov, a senior adviser to President Yeltsin, said  that Gaydar's Russia's Choice bloc "is assuming, in the eyes of  the electorate, a role of the defender of the interests of  citizens from galloping inflation." Experts and businessmen are  unanimous in their predictions of further growth of inflation in  the country. Their predictions seem to be coming true as the  rouble plunged sharply against the dollar in the last two days,  entering a free fall for the first time in months.    If Gaydar were concerned about the financial situation in  the  country, he would do everything possible to preserve the  reformist wing of the government, of which, according to a  high-ranking source in the Kremlin, he was repeatedly but  obviously unsuccessfully persuaded. Therefore one cannot rule  out the possibility that by distancing himself from the  government Gaydar is starting his own election campaign for the  post of Russian president. Numerous interviews by Gennadiy  Burbulis in the last few days in which he for the first time  criticised some presidential decisions may serve as indirect  proof of this version.    But so far none of Yeltsin's supporters has offered an  alternative reform programme of the continuation of which the  president said at his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton  in Moscow last week. This only goes to prove that what is  involved is some secret goals which the Russian leaders prefer  to keep to themselves for the time being, rather than key  disagreements over basic approaches towards reform.    Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin is gaining more political weight in  Russian politics. In August 1993, Chernomyrdin stunned the  world by his statements concerning the disputed four Kuril  islands claimed by Japan. The statements strongly disagreed  with the president's position. Now, too, the premier is trying  to steer his own course in forming a new government. He is  likely to give one of the two posts of first vice-prime  ministers in the new cabinet to Oleg Soskovets backed by major  industrialists. The other post is likely to go to Aleksandr  Zaveryukha, a member of the Agrarian Party of Russia.    Additionally, the president of the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkadiy Volskiy, has denied in  his interview with ITAR-TASS reports that he had been offered a  post in the new government but had rejected the offer.    The list of candidates to the key posts in the new cabinet  give grounds to speak about Chernomyrdin's orientation to people  seeking to support the highly-ineffective state sector in the  Russian economy. Considering the premier's reluctance to swap  Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Central Bank Chairman  Viktor Gerashchenko, his attitude towards continuing a tough  monetary policy becomes more than obvious.    The premier's intentions will be welcomed by the agrarians,  the communists and centrists in the Federal Assembly. With this  in mind, one can easily foresee Chernomyrdin's intention to win  support of the parliamentary majority and prepare for the 1996  presidential elections.    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's spectacular ultimatums declared from  television screens in which he outlines the conditions of his  participation in the new government make one question if he  (Yavlinskiy) himself believes in the realisability of his  demands. They also show that he is unwilling to take risks and  will try to remain an independent "prophet" until the new  presidential elections.    The disagreements between Sergey Shakhray, leader of the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and Russia's Choice and even  the president also reflect the prime minister's ambitious  aspirations in his bid to win over regional elites to ensure his  success at the future elections.    The activity of the four aforementioned political groupings  show that President Yeltsin is losing his allies who seem to  have admitted his "fatigue" and started working for their own  political future.    Considering the approaching presidential elections, their  behaviour could look natural if it were not for the danger of a  new vacuum of power from which no one is secured even by vast  constitutional powers of the president. As Yeltsin's Spokesman  Vycheslav Kostimov has rightfully said, the constitution is only  a "big promise," which may or may not be fulfilled.    In this situation the danger comes not so much from the  threat of reform curtailment as from a new spiral of struggle  for power which may seriously shake up Russia.</p>

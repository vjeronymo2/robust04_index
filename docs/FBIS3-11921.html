			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JWI: "Surinamese Government Rejects </F> Ultimatum of Occupiers"; as released by The Hague ANP Database]    [Text] Paramaribo/The Hague, 23 Mar (ANP) -- The Surinamese  Government does not plan to make any concessions to the  occupiers of the Afobaka hydroelectric power station. President  Venetiaan said Wednesday evening in a speech to the National  Assembly (Parliament) that "the government and the Surinamese  people cannot allow themselves to be blackmailed."    On Wednesday afternoon, the occupiers of the hydroelectric  power station issued a fresh ultimatum to the government in  Paramaribo, with a final deadline that will run out at 0300 GMT  on Thursday morning (midnight in Suriname). An anonymous  commander in chief of the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF)  declared that President Venetiaan must send his ministers back  home. If Venetiaan does not do so, then "Paramaribo will  experience further problems," the spokesman for the occupiers  said. "We cannot tolerate such useless discussions while the  population is fighting its way through the problems of the  economic crisis," he said.    However, Venetiaan let it be known that he would not accede  to any of the demands made by the occupiers. The president  opted for a dialogue with those responsible for the action and  said he wanted to resolve the matter "quickly without a great  show." However, he did not rule out the use of force.    "The Netherlands would take any Surinamese request for  assistance seriously," Netherlands Foreign Minister Kooijmans  said while speaking in Prague in reaction to the events in  Suriname.    Paramaribo is still struggling with a limited power supply.  On Wednesday, the SLF shut down three of the six turbines at  the Afobaka hydroelectric power station, causing the 200,000  inhabitants of the Surinamese capital to lose three-fourths of  their electricity.</p>

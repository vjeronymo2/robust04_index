			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Trimoco says ignore Hartwell offers Mr Roger Smith, chairman of Trimoco, the Dunstable-based motor dealer, has written to shareholders advising them 'to ignore any documents or announcements which may be issued by Hartwell or its advisers and to take no action in regard to the offers.' Trimoco said that the terms of the offers, which are 17.5p a share for the outstanding equity and Pounds 175 for each Pounds 100 nominal of the 11 1/2 per cent guaranteed convertible unsecured loan stock, significantly undervalued the company. Hartwell, a fellow motor dealer, is ultimately owned by a discretionary trust set up by Mr Adbul Jameel.</p>

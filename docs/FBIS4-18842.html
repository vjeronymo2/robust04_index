			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 11 (AFP) -- NATO warplanes will  shortly carry out new air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions  around the besieged Moslem town of Gorazde, a UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) headquarters staffer said here Monday [11  April].    The air strikes had been ordered after the Serbs resumed  shelling of the town, hitting the hospital and a building where  UN military observers were housed, the UN staffer in the  operations room said, asking not to be named.    UN Protection Force spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon  dismissed  the report as untrue, but sources close to NATO said planes had  taken off and were flying low over Gorazde.</p>

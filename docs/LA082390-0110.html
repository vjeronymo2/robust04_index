			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER PERMIT FOR QUARRY IN AZUSA  </P> <P> The fate of the Azusa Rock Co. was shuffled back to the Planning Commission by  the City Council for further review.  </P> <P> The order for reconsideration came after a hearing in which some residents  called the quarry a nuisance that creates dust in the air and has scarred the  mountainside.  </P> <P> In May, the council directed the commission to review the operations of the  rock quarry on Fish Canyon Road to determine if its special-use permit, granted  in 1956, should be revoked. The commission decided Azusa Rock was complying  with the conditions set for its operation.  </P> <P> But on Monday night, the council voted 3 to 2 to have the commission  re-evaluate the quarry, looking particularly at new vegetation for the  mountain, one of the conditions added to the original permit in 1988.  </P> <P> "I see no change whatsoever," said Councilman Harry Stemrich.  </P> <P> Tom Davis, environmental manager for Azusa Rock, blamed the drought for the  lack of landscaping on the mountain.  </P> <P> Councilmen Tony Naranjo and John Dangleis, who voted against the  reconsideration, said they saw no need for further review. "We're playing  political football," Naranjo said. "The facts are in front of us and I'm  satisfied."  </P> <P> No deadline was set for the second Planning Commission review.  </P></p>

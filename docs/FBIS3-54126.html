At present, both these tasks are performed by IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] troops. No one thinks the United States  should send divisions to defend us on the Golan, because that  would be against the whole Zionist ethos which speaks of  national Jewish revival and of a Jewish rather than an alien  force defending the Jewish state.    Second, the idea that U.S. soldiers should be deployed in  intelligence positions on the Golan is also inapplicable,  because the Golan case differs from the Sinai. By handing the  forewarning function over to the Americans, we would be creating  unnecessary tension and severely trying the U.S.-Israeli  relationship needlessly.    [Golan] You do not entirely trust the Americans in this  matter?    [Netanyahu] On the contrary, I have great regard for the  United States' amity, and I appreciate its willingness to assist  Israel, but I do not want to put the United States to tough  tests such as that which faced its troops in Beirut, where they  were attacked by terrorists, or what is happening to the U.S.  troops in Somalia. I see no need or reason for U.S. soldiers to  defend Israel.</p>

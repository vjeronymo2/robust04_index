			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Care that does not meet standards for non-Government facilities similar to the Army facility providing the care; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An incident that could give rise to a claim against the United States under this part; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Competent authority so directs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Investigation by a claims officer is required when the situation or consequences described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4), and (a)(9) of this section arise from activities of the ARNG or its personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims arising out of situations that may be expected to generate a substantial number of claims in a short period of time and are properly cognizable for settlement under this regulation (such as maneuvers or other special operations, emergencies, civil disturbances, aircraft and missile accidents, or disasters) will be investigated in accordance with procedures set forth herein by the claims office responsible for the area in which the incident occurred. No claim arising out of such an emergency situation will be paid until the concurrence of the Commander, USARCS has been obtained. (See &sect;536.8(c)(4)(iii)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Where an accident occurs that could only result in a claim against the United States that is not payable because of the incident to service rule, for example, barred by the Feres Doctrine, or the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), or the Longshoremen's and Harborworkers Compensation Act (LHWCA), the investigation may be limited to that necessary to make such a determination. However, claims officials will ensure that the appropriate commander or organization safety office is aware of the incident so that measures to avoid a recurrence can be pursued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Unit claims officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Commanders' responsibility. Commanders and heads of DA and DOD components whose personnel, equipment or operations are involved in an incident giving rise to a potential or actual claim for or against the government (see &sect;536.15(a)), will appoint a commissioned officer, a warrant officer or a qualified civilian employee to conduct an initial factual investigation of the incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Installation commanders, brigade commanders, commanders of separate battalions, state ARNG Adjutant Generals and other commanders whose operations may generate a significant number of claims should consider appointing a claims officer on standing orders to facilitate training and coordination with the claims JA/attorney supporting the unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Senior noncommissioned officers (E6 thru E9) may be appointed as assistant claims officers to perform duties under the supervision of a claims officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Claims officer appointment orders should designate the claims JA/attorney who supports the unit as the claims officer's legal advisor. The orders will direct the claims officer to seek guidance from the claims JA/attorney at the outset of the investigation and before completion of the investigation whenever the potential value of the claim is in excess of $15,000 or an actual claim in excess of that amount has been filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The scope and duration of the investigation will depend on the severity and complexity of the incident and may range from merely obtaining investigation reports already prepared by police and other investigators to a formal investigation by a board of officers under the provisions of chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, claims officers will follow the guidance in Chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 and the advice of the claims JA/attorney listed as their advisor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Unit claims officers, in addition to making a report of investigation as specified in &sect;536.16(b), will account for and preserve all available evidence for use in future litigation. Evidence will be retained until released by the claims JA/attorney. Therefore, the claims officer will consult with the claims JA/attorney before disposal, destruction or repair of damaged property or other evidence. The claims officer will also act as the claims JA/attorney's point of contact for support and assistance from the unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Claims officers must coordinate their work with concurrent criminal and safety investigations, which have priority within DA for access to accident sites and witnesses (see paragraph 1&hyph;4d, AR 15&hyph;6 and paragraphs 4&hyph;8a(2), 5&hyph;1a(1) and 5&hyph;4 AR 385&hyph;40). To the greatest extent possible claims officers should take advantage of the work already done on these other investigations (see &sect;536.19 of this part). Although there are limits on the information safety personnel can release to claims officers, some of the information in safety reports can be released (see paragraphs 1&hyph;10 and 5&hyph;6, AR 385&hyph;40). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Report of claims officer. (1) Format. The claims officer will prepare a written report of investigation on DA Form 1208 (Report of Claims Officer), except that no recommendation on disposition of prospective claims will be entered in block 11. Where a formal investigation is conducted in accordance with the procedures in chapter 5, AR 15&hyph;6, the report may be submitted on DA Form 1574 (Report of Proceedings by Investigating Officer/Board of Officers). If the claims officer does not feel either form is appropriate, the claims JA/attorney advising the claims officer will be consulted for guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Processing. The report should normally be completed and submitted to the appointing authority within 60 days of the accident/incident. If a final report will not be completed within that time one or more interim reports may be required by the commander or claims JA/attorney. The appointing authority will either return the report for further investigation or, if satisfied that it is as complete as possible given the information available, forward one copy of the report to the appropriate claims office with or without comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Content. The report will contain findings of fact concerning the incident, to include the circumstances leading to the incident ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> training and experience of Army personnel involved) and the resulting property damage and/or injuries. These findings should be based on the evidence reasonably available within the time available for completion of the report. See chapter 5, DA PAM 27&hyph;162 for guidance on the information needed in the most common types of claims incidents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Limits on findings. The unit claims officers will not make findings concerning questions of liability or attempt to assess a dollar value on personal injuries. The findings should merely state the facts (who, what, where, when, and how). While a clear and complete statement of the facts will often make it clear who is responsible for the damage or injury, the determination of legal liability and the appropriate amount of compensation is the responsibility of the claims JA/attorney or the courts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Use and release of information. The report of this initial investigation may be used in conjunction with any administrative or legal action within DOD, such as line of duty investigations, reports of surveys, disciplinary actions under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or civilian personnel regulations, contract actions, or the collateral investigation of an Army accident required by paragraph 1&hyph;7c, AR 385&hyph;40. It may also be used by the commander or the unit's safety officers as the basis for their safety report (DA Forms 285 and 285&hyph;1) when a centralized accident investigation or separate safety investigation is not conducted. It may be released to the public, to law enforcement personnel, state and federal regulatory agencies and other non-DOD entities subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Disposition of reports. The claims processing office or area claims office having jurisdiction over the type of claim involved will retain the claims officer's report until a claim is received or until six months after the time for filing a claim is past. If no claim is filed within the statutory limit, the report will be disposed of as an organizational record in accordance with AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If an incident occurs, or a claim is filed, in a foreign country where no appropriate commander is located, investigative assistance may be sought from the Defense Attache or the Military Assistance and Advisory Group (MAAG). Incidents involving Attache or MAAG personnel, and claims arising from their activities, will be investigated in accordance with DIAM 100&hyph;1B, volume 1, section T, chapter 1, or AR 175, chapter 6, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Under the provisions of DODD 5515.9 the Commander, USARCS, or designee, may request assistance from DOD components whose personnel are involved in incidents generating claims in the investigation of such claims, and may appoint DOD personnel as claims officers for the purpose of conducting such investigations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

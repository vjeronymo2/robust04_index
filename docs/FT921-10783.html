			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Exchange rates push Kelt sharply into red In spite of a 54 per cent rise in operating profits, Kelt Energy, the restructured independent UK and US oil and gas company, fell steeply into the red in the six months to September 30 after an even more sharp turnround in exchange rate differences. Pre-tax losses emerged at Pounds 4.13m (profits Pounds 6.9m) and were struck on increased turnover of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16.8m). Operating profits of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.33m) were turned into losses at the pre-tax level by a deficit of Pounds 4.28m (credit of Pounds 12.3m) from exchange rate differences, although net interest payable was reduced to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 6.75m). In the year to March 31 1991, taxable losses amounted to Pounds 154.3m after a Pounds 150.8m exceptional charge. Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman, said that during the six months Kelt had completed the repayment of is debt via the disposal of its 7.5 per cent interest in Wytch Farm, the Dorset oilfield, and its non-US international assets. These resulted in an extraordinary profit of Pounds 120.1m.</p>

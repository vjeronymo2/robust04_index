			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Lords protect employees' perks: Inland Revenue loses case centred on reduced school fees TENS OF THOUSANDS of employees have been saved from losing their perks at work by a landmark ruling against the Inland Revenue from the House of Lords yesterday. The decision will allow many companies to structure their benefits without fear of incurring additional costs. Many have delayed tax planning while awaiting the judgment. The case, Pepper v Hart, concerned the reduced school fees paid in 1983 for their own children by 10 teachers at Malvern School, including Mr John Hart, a senior master. But, it had enormous implications for many employers offering benefits to their staff. Those affected would have included those with subsidised canteens, sports facilities or travel, and those able to buy goods at a discount. British Airways confirmed last night that it was one of several companies and professional firms which contributed to a Pounds 100,000 'fighting fund' to help in the appeal. If the case had been lost, its employees might no longer have been able to buy airline tickets at 10 per cent of the retail price. The teachers at Malvern argued they should only be taxed on any difference between the reduced fees they paid for their own children and the marginal cost of providing this education - such as meals, laundry and books. The Inland Revenue claimed that the teachers should be assessed for tax on any difference existing between the fees they paid and the average cost of the fees. The Revenue said yesterday that it would be issuing a statement shortly on the implications of the judgment. 'We are analysing the fine print,' it said. 'This is a very important case. We felt we would win.' It still has the option of seeking new legislation which could push for average cost on employee benefits to apply in the future. Mr Hart said: 'It's an absolute rout. There was tremendous interest from the boys, wishing us good luck. I was bullish at every point. I'm going to buy a new car next week.' The 35-page statement by seven law lords was described last night as a landmark decision by Ms Leslie Ferrar, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, because it said ministers' speeches in parliament can be taken into account when interpreting the law. The ruling means that lawyers and judges may now have to consult Hansard to understand ministers' intentions when they were originally debating legislation, even though their ideas may not have been reflected clearly in the letter of the law.

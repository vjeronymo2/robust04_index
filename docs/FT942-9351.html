			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Riva finds new steel bid target Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, has joined forces with German and Italian steelmakers to bid for the special steels division of Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel company, only days after dropping its offer for Eko Stahl, the east German manufacturer. Fried Krupp of Germany and the Italian companies Riva, Falck and Tadfin, lodged a bid last week for Acciai Speciali Terni, one of two main Ilva divisions to be privatised. News of Riva's decision to abandon its offer for Eko Stahl emerged late on Friday and the Italian company has refused all comment on why it broke off negotiations with Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency. In a statement issued yesterday by Lazard and Morgan Grenfell Italia, which are advising the Italo-German bid for AST, the members of the consortium promised 'a long-term commitment' to the state-owned company. Iri, the Italian state holding company, is also reported to be considering offers from Steno Marcegaglia of Italy and the French-owned Ugine, and two separate bids for the flat steel division of Ilva. The German privatisation agency, Treuhand, is now looking for a new buyer for Eko Stahl. However, even with steelmaking retained on the site, the government-backed modernisation plan - which would save 3,000 jobs until the end of the year and guarantee 1,700 until 2004 - is viewed with scepticism by the industry.</p>

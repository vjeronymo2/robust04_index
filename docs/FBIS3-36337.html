			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Kovalev, Russian Federation Human </F> Rights Commissioner, by Andrey Sharapov; place and date not  given, under the rubric "At the State Duma": "Vocation --  Defender of the People"]    [Text] The office of the people's representative or, as it  is now known throughout the world, the "ombudsman," was  introduced in Scandinavia at the end of the last century and in  other countries after that. The ombudsman is empowered to  examine complaints by citizens and formulate recommendations for  the resolution of disputes. In the context of Russia's law  reform the State Duma has appointed Sergey Kovalev, the well  known defender of rights, to be the Russian Federation  commissioner for human rights.    From our files. Sergey Adamovich Kovalev was born in 1930.  He graduated from Moscow State University's Biology Department  in 1954, is a specialist in cell membranes, and has published  around 70 scientific works. He began his public activity with  the defense of genetics and articles against Lysenko's  doctrines. He was an active participant in the dissident  movement in the sixties and seventies. In 1974 he was sentenced  to seven years for political activity and after serving that  sentence he was exiled to Kolyma for three years and spent the  following three years under surveillance in Kalinin. In 1990 he  became a Russian Federation people's deputy and chairman of the  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee. He is  now chairman of the Russian President's Human Rights Commission  on a voluntary basis.    [Kovalev] It is very important that the ombudsman or the  commissioner for human rights, as it says in the new Russian  Federation Constitution, has no executive powers [vlastnyye  polnomochiya]. However, state organs are obliged to examine his  recommendations on complaints of human rights violations. The  prestige of this service derives from the thoroughness of its  investigation and the well balanced nature of its conclusions.  Perhaps the only element which needs to be introduced into the  law to enhance the effectiveness of our work is a norm on the  right to publish our recommendations and the obligation of state  institutions to give a public explanation of their response if  they disagree with our conclusions. This guarantee of publicity  will help society to understand the most complex conflicts  between people and the state.    The new service is designed to protect human rights  primarily  against the state in the form of a specific official or a whole  department. It is not a rival to the court or the prosecutor's  office. The philosophy of this institution is to seek peaceful  solutions in disputes between the citizen and the state, the  gradual development of relations of trust between them, and  accordingly the enhancement of the prestige of the agency  [vlast] which has been created to guarantee the rights of the  individual. I believe that for Russia the introduction of the  service of the people's defender is especially timely.    [Sharapov] Might it not be that there will be an endless  stream of complainants coming to you as they used to go and see  "Kalinin, the sage of all the people"?    [Kovalev] That is inevitable although there are various  devices to filter such streams. One, which I admit I do not  like very much, is that of exhausting the other means first, in  other words, this service is the court of last resort when all  the others have been tried. I believe that given our  bureaucracy this is not the best way. The urgency and social  significance of the dispute may be important criteria although  such parameters are difficult to formalize.    In some countries there are "specialist ombudsmen" on  ecology, army matters, and so forth. Perhaps such a system will  one day take root in Russia, too. However, it is important to  understand that human rights are a federal prerogative and the  commissioner for human rights must operate at federal level.  You will agree that it would be absurd if there were different  norms in this sphere in the different oblasts of Russia with  each demanding its own ombudsman. However, this does not mean  that in the Russian regions there will be no representatives of  the service of the commissioner for human rights.    [Sharapov] Is it really the case that anyone who has a  grievance against the authorities, including people in detention  centers, can appeal to you?    [Kovalev] Prisoners traditionally form a considerable  proportion of those who appeal for justice. It goes without  saying that all statements will be examined. I believe that if  the essence of a case is set out clearly and concisely all the  necessary papers will be demanded when our service examines the  case.    There are extensive areas of human rights which still seem  to  be in the shadows as far as social consciousness is concerned.  For example, the rights of Russian citizens outside its  borders. Our Human Rights Commission together with the Foreign  Ministry is now drafting proposals to resolve this problem.  There are sometimes the most unexpected clashes in the human  rights sphere. For example, one Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet budget virtually empowered local organs of power to levy  a payment for education on citizens leaving Russia. The Russian  Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee had simply  overlooked this little gem which is contrary to all  international norms. I think that the Russian Federation human  rights cpmmissioner's service will consider the whole range of  problems of the protection of rights in Russia.    [Sharapov] But for work to begin it seems that the State  Duma must adopt a law on the service of the Russian Federation  commissioner for human rights?    [Kovalev] Yes, and this would be a constitutional law  needing the vote of two-thirds of the deputies for adoption.  The ratification of the office of the human rights commissioner  by the country's representative organ emphasizes the origin of  this office which, I repeat, is independent of the authorities.  The president can and must have consultants in the human rights  sphere although our service is designed primarily to protect  people from abuses by state officials or structures. Of course  the office of the human rights commissioner presupposes the  cessation of party and other political activity, especially  activity as a deputy.    The situation in the Duma today is complex and it will not  be  easy to get the law through. However, the factional structure  of the Duma may make it possible and already is making it  possible to reach agreement on the most diverse questions. I  hope that this factor, together with the ombudsman's lack of  executive powers, will reconcile deputies. Especially since  they are the people's representatives and our service is  designed to protect the rights of the people.</p>

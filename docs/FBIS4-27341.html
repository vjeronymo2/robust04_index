			<p>CSO     [Text] Major electrical machinery firms have begun one  after the other to open resident offices in Vietnam. Not only  will Matsushita Electric Industrial and Hitachi, Ltd. soon build  resident offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Mitsubishi Electric will  also open an office with this fall as the goal. That is because  Vietnam has a large population, said to be about 70 million  people; and, not only is a large demand for home electronics  products such as televisions anticipated, an expansion of  infrastructure demand is expected, such as communications and  electric power facilities due to the social capital provision  program of the government. Vietnam has been promoting the "doi  moi [renovation] policy," an open economy policy, since 1986,  but in particular, a big incentive for the various electrical  machinery firms to expand has been the U.S. Government's lifting  of economic sanctions against Vietnam in February 1994.    The resident office that Matsushita is opening has the  objectives of a survey of the Vietnamese home electronics market  and preparation of distribution and sales systems. Now that it  has received permission by the Vietnamese Government to open, it  is studying the lineup and will dispatch a resident  representative from Japan. Since televisions and refrigerators  are flowing into Vietnam via local distributors from the  company's plants in neighboring Thailand and Malaysia, the plan  is to first establish an after-service system and build an  independent sales network for the future.    In addition to sales of home electronics products, Hitachi  is  aiming at the infrastructure demand for power plants and  communications facilities. Moreover, Hitachi Sales, the home  electronics sales subsidiary, will open an office in Ho Chi Minh  City with July 1994 as the goal.    In expansion aimed at orders for public works projects, NEC  newly established a resident office in Hanoi in July 1993;  Fujitsu also established an office in Hanoi in March 1994.  Mitsubishi Electric is also proceeding with preparations to open  a resident office in Ho Chi Minh City with this fall as a goal,  and Toshiba also is studying it. Behind the promising view of  Vietnam, the point cannot be avoided that the people have more  purchasing power than appearances due to money sent from  Vietnamese in the United States. According to Victor Co. of  Japan, which has been producing color televisions since 1985 by  providing technology to a local state-operated plant, the 1994  television market is about 400,000 televisions. The outlook is  for it to expand to 3 million sets within 10 years.</p>

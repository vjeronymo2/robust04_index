			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank However hard it tries, Lloyds Bank seems to find it difficult to shake off the image of producing high returns but limited prospect of organic growth. The bank says it is starting to see faint signs of higher volume, but its first half presented a familiar picture. Though operating income before provisions rose, this largely reflected continuing tight control over costs and the reinvestment of retained earnings, which boosted interest income. The loan book was slightly lower than a year ago. Lloyds must ask itself how this poor underlying picture squares with its net return on shareholders' funds of 22 per cent. The bank's answer for the time being is that it would be wrong to sacrifice return unless it was sure higher business volume would compensate for loss of margin. In other words Sir Brian Pitman, its chief executive, is not about to start the price war many observers of UK banking fear. Whether his competitors will let him go on reaping such high returns is another matter. The most dangerous time will be when loan demand picks up, making competition for market share more worthwhile. It would be better for Lloyds if Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were in the bag before this happened. C&amp;G's low-cost operation will provide a sure defence against the price-cutters. Lloyds had nothing new to say on C&amp;G yesterday. But if the bid process falters, its shares would surely fall much further than the 3 per cent witnessed after its mildly disappointing dividend rise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] At present the Japanese economy continues along an  adjustment phase and while there were indications in early  spring of a partial recovery, after that the economy continued  to remain flat. Although the business diffusion index  (coincident index) stayed above the ``boom or bust'' threshold  of 50&percnt; for the three months from February to April, in  May the  index fell considerable below this level. In terms of production  and employment trends, there is a strong possibility that the  figures for June and July will also fall below this level. While  production in June increased when compared to the previous  month, the level was low and even the inventory cycle shows  signs of a mild recession. Employment conditions continue to  deteriorate and individual consumption is sluggish, for the most  part. Moreover, machinery orders (private demand), a leading  indicator of capital spending, are as weak as ever. On the other  hand, housing investments continue to recover and investment in  public utilities is also firm.  <H5>  Industrial Activity </H5>   The index of industrial production for June (preliminary  reports) increased 1.3&percnt; compared with the previous month.  On an  industry specific basis, all industries except plastic goods and  mining had increases. The index of producers' shipments  increased 2.1&percnt; compared with the previous month. Although  iron  and steel, plastic goods and mining were down, all other  industries had increases. Because inventories of iron and steel,  general machinery and transport machinery increased, the index  of producers' inventories rose 0.4&percnt; compared with the  previous  month. However, because the increase in shipments exceeded this,  the index of the producers' inventory ratio fell 1.2&percnt;  during  the same period. The forecast index of industrial activity  (seasonally adjusted) has forecast that production will increase  0.1&percnt; in July compared to the previous month and fall  0.9&percnt; in  August for the same period.  <H5>  Capital Spending </H5>   Looking at concurrent indicators, the June index of capital  goods shipments (excluding transportation machinery) increased  3.0&percnt; over the previous month, mainly for general-use steam  turbines and compressors. According to leading indicators, in  June machinery orders (private demand excluding that for ships  and electric power) only had a mild increase of 0.8&percnt;  overall  compared with the previous month because even though the  manufacturing industry (up 12.0&percnt; compared with the  previous  month) had increases (mainly for electronic and communications  equipment), the non-manufacturing sector (down 6.6&percnt;  during the  same period) declined. Construction orders (private sector) in  June were down for both the manufacturing industry (down  50.0&percnt;  compared with the previous year) and the non-manufacturing  industry (down 17.8&percnt; during the same period) and as a  result  there was an overall decline of 24.7&percnt; compared to the  previous  year. This was the 15th consecutive month of decline.  <H5>  Housing Investment </H5>   Comparing the number of housing starts in June to those of  the previous year we find that while rental units declined for  the second consecutive month, owner-occupied units had their  first upward shift in three months while subdivided units also  had large increases for the second consecutive month. This  resulted in an overall increase of 4.1&percnt; compared with the  previous year, for a total of 134,000 starts (seasonally  adjusted annualized rate of 1,447 thousand units). (A breakdown  of the raw (unadjusted) figures shows: 49,000 owner-occupied  homes, up 3.8&percnt; from the previous year; 60,000 rental  units,  down 1.2&percnt; during the same period; 3,000 subsidized housing  units, down 16.0&percnt; during the same period; and 22,000  subdivided  units, up 26.6&percnt; during the same period.)  <H5>  Consumption </H5>   According to household surveys, in May nominal consumption  expenditures by all households fell 1.1&percnt; compared to the  same  period the previous year (real expenditures decreased 1.8&percnt;  during the same period), the first decline in three months  compared with the previous year. A breakdown of these results  shows that the only three items of expenditure which had  increases were light and heat, water and insured medical  treatment and that, with the exception of cultural  entertainment, which remained flat, all other items had  declines. In particular, sundry and housing expenditures  declined dramatically. By household category, worker households'  consumption expenditures decreased by 0.5&percnt; compared to the  previous year while general households' consumption also had a  decrease of 2.3&percnt; for the same period.    In June total sales by large retail outlets declined  3.5&percnt;  over the previous year (down 4.8&percnt; after adjusting for the  number of branches). This was the eleventh consecutive month of  decline. Reflecting the unseasonable weather, sales of summer  gifts had a slow start and the slump in sales of summer clothing  continues, particularly for men's clothing. On a sector specific  basis, department store sales fell 7.6&percnt; during this period  (clothing down 7.7&percnt;, food and beverages down 5.1&percnt;,  others down  9.3&percnt;) and supermarket sales increased 1.2&percnt; during  the same  period (clothing up 0.7&percnt;, food and beverages up  2.0&percnt;, others  up 0.6&percnt;). Still, supermarkets are down 1.2&percnt;  compared with last  year after adjusting for the number of stores.  <H5>  Employment </H5>   Looking at the employment situation for June (preliminary  reports), the index of regular employment for all industries  remains unchanged when compared with that of the previous month.  The demand for labor continues to show signs of easing and the  effective openings-to-applications ratio fell 0.07 points  compared to the previous month to 0.74. In addition, at  2.50&percnt;  the total unemployment rate was 0.02 percentage points lower  than that of the previous month. Overtime hours for the  manufacturing industry decreased 2.1&percnt; compared to the  previous  month (12.0 hours/month).</p>

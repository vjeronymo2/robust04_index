			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS OK A SUPER-PRESIDENCY;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV BULLDOZES BILL THROUGH  </P> <P> A determined Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pushed through the legislature his  proposal for a Western-style super-presidency despite vigorous objections that  the new post would concentrate too much power in one man's hands.  </P> <P> Amid shouts of protest from lawmakers who warned of the dangers of  dictatorship, Gorbachev called the vote for his proposal "a great political  event in the history of our state."  </P> <P> The vote in the Supreme Soviet was 347 to 24, with 43 abstentions, in favor of  the bill that approves creation of the presidency in principle. The bill now  goes to committees that will consider numerous amendments proposed during a day  of heated debate.  </P> <P> Then, the Congress of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet's parent body, will  meet March 12-13 to elect a president.  </P> <P> The bill would give the president sweeping powers to declare war, veto  legislation, impose a state of emergency and call referendums on legislative  decisions he doesn't approve of.  </P> <P> During the debate today, liberals said the creation of a presidency is  premature, and they accused the leadership of trying to rush the issue through.  </P> <P> But Gorbachev angrily rejected critics, saying they had engaged in "cheap  demagoguery." Legislators shouted in protest from the floor.  </P> <P> "Everything I believe necessary to say I'll say," the 58-year-old Kremlin chief  shouted back.  </P> <P> One legislator, a taxi driver from the Ukraine who last year compared Gorbachev  to Napoleon on national television, said he saw a bad omen in the voting.  </P> <P> "The way the voting went from the floor today is the same way presidential  power will be," shouted Leonid Sukhov in an obvious reference to Gorbachev's  pressure.  </P> <P> Pro-democracy demonstrators in several Soviet cities over the weekend said the  president would become a dictator, and one sign at a Leningrad rally warned  that the new post could lead to fascism.  </P> <P> The Supreme Soviet refused on Feb. 14 to be stampeded into setting a timetable  for approving a presidency modeled after the American and French systems.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has said a strong president is needed as part of his blueprint for  transferring power from the Communist Party to the government. It is a radical  departure from Soviet political practice stretching to the days of Josef  Stalin, when the party leader was supreme ruler.  </P> <P> Before the vote, liberals led by Sergei Stankevich, a student of American  politics and spokesman for the Inter-Regional Deputies Group, and Anatoly  Sobchak, a Leningrad legislator, said the presidency as proposed would be  subject to abuse.  </P> <P> "All our decisions can be crossed out by the president," Sobchak told the  542-member legislature.  </P> <P> He and Stankevich said the proposed presidency would tilt the balance of power  toward the chief executive and away from the legislature.  </P> <P> Many Soviets see the need for an iron hand to solve the country's problems.  </P> <P> "We're tired from social tension. When are you going to put the country in  order?" legislator Rano Ubaidullaeva said her constituents are saying. "We need  a person who can have real power . . . the quicker the better."  </P></p>

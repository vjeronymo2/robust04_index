			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "China To Study Ways To Handle </F> Naturalization of Foreign Residents in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 24 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Shao Tianren, the  leader of the Chinese side of the Preliminary Working Committee  [PWC] Legal Group, said today that the naturalization of foreign  residents of Hong Kong is a new issue which must be studied. At  present, there is no Chinese public security organ in Hong Kong  to handle such issues.    Before attending today's meeting of the PWC Legal Group,  Shao  Tianren was asked whether foreign residents of Hong Kong can  apply for Chinese citizenship in order to meet requirements to  be senior officials in the special administrative region [SAR]  government. He said: Hong Kong is Chinese territory, but the  territory has not been governed by China for the past 100 years  or more. Therefore, applications for Chinese citizenship by  foreign residents and people without nationality in Hong Kong  has become a new issue. In addition to the fact that no public  security organ can handle such matters there now, this is an  issue China should consider how to deal with. He said that  China may have to formulate certain policies and regulations for  handling the nationality issue of such people after careful  consideration and it was hard to comment for the time being.    He said: After the establishment of the SAR, Hong Kong will  be a territory under China's jurisdiction, and this issue will  become the same as in other parts of China. At present,  foreigners in Beijing may submit applications to public security  organs if they want to attain Chinese citizenship, but no  Chinese public security organ now exists in Hong Kong.</p>

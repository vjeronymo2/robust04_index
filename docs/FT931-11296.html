			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Woolsey spies new targets for the CIA THE CIA faces greater challenges in the future than it did during the cold war, according to Mr James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton's choice to run the US intelligence agency. In Senate confirmation hearings yesterday. Mr Woolsey said he would try to find ways of cutting his agency's budget - still a classified figure but thought to be about dollars 28.5bn a year - but not to the point of weakening US intelligence gathering capabilities. In his prepared statement he said, 'yes, we have slain a large dragon' in the former Soviet Union. 'But we now live in a jungle filled with a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes, and in many ways the dragon was easier to keep track of.' He thought the CIA's own structure, which he said was prone to 'excessive compartmentalisation', did not always help in dissemination of necessary intelligence. Several senators, all predisposed to confirming him in office, agreed with this analysis. They drew particular attention to the question of the CIA's involvement in economic and commercial intelligence. On Monday, Mr George Stephanopoulos, chief White House spokesman, said Mr Clinton wanted the agency 'to focus more on economic intelligence, which is where the real competition is now'. Senator John Warner, the Virginia Republican, conceded 'the growing number of views' advocating that the US follow the European lead in this respect. But, he added, 'these proposals raise serious doubt about the proper role of the US intelligence community, as well as questions concerning the companies which would receive such information, and their status as US or foreign-owned companies'. But Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat, while agreeing that the question was 'troublesome,' urged Mr Woolsey to 'grapple with it' and come up with some 'definite policy'. While diplomatically neutral in his response to these comments, Mr Woolsey is known to be interested in the area of economic intelligence.</p>

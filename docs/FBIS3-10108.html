			<p>Language: <F P=105> Creole </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have learned from a generally well-informed  source that there will be fuel aplenty in Port-au-Prince. A ship  carrying several thousand gallons of gasoline and oil -- not  limited to humanitarian purposes this time --will arrive in  Port-au-Prince on 2 March to supply the local market. This  tanker, carrying more fuel than the two humanitarian fuel ships  that were unloaded in the capital, left The Netherlands bound  for Haiti and has put in at Aruba, according to the source, who  adds that a gallon of gasoline will cost $5 in the gas stations  in Port-au-Prince.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rising house sales behind 83% surge to Pounds 12.6m at Berkeley Berkeley Group, one of Britain's most successful housebuilders during the recession, yesterday announced an 83 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.6m during the six months to October 31. The company's shares improved 20p to 480p on the announcement. Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 103.9m as the number of homes sold increased from 468 to 656. Earnings per share improved 50 per cent to 11p and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.65p to 1.9p. The company said it had cash in hand of Pounds 41.7m at the end of October following its successful Pounds 44.1m rights issue in the spring. That compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 187.4m. Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, said there had been a modest recovery in the housing market since Britain left the ERM in September last year. 'House prices have recovered by 6 or 7 per cent, the 10 per cent they lost when we left the ERM,' said Mr Pidgley. 'Demand from purchasers also has increased. Gross margins as a result have risen to about 20 per cent. The prospects for housing are the best they have been for five years.' The rights issue cash is to be used to purchase land for housebuilding. At the end of October the company owned 4,000 plots with planning permission with a further 1,000 plots which it expected to buy. Many of these sites were acquired at the bottom of the recession, two years ago, when land prices were cheaper. Mr Pidgley estimated that land prices had risen on average by 30 to 40 per cent during the past 12 months. He said: 'Some of the prices that have been paid have been too high in my estimation. We are pleased that we bought early and therefore are under no pressure to pay these prices.' He expected house prices to rise by no more than in line with general inflation during the next two years - 'maybe no more than two or three per cent a year'. The company was also pleased with the timing of its Pounds 130m commercial property joint venture, formed in March 1991 with Saad Investments. This was sitting on a useful profit following property price rises this year. COMMENT Berkeley richly deserves its reputation as one of the best managed companies in the sector. If the art of housebuilding is the timing of land purchases, Berkeley has got it right in spades. Having sold its land holdings at the top of the market in 1989 it started buying before prices began to rise sharply. The timing of its commercial property joint venture looks equally impressive. Profits, if the portfolio was sold now, could approach 30 per cent. Group profits, assuming the portfolio is held, could still reach Pounds 28m this year and rise to more than Pounds 35m in 1994-95. The shares based on yield may look a little expensive but are worth it based on the quality of its management performance to date.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft plays down Sega video game role The widely-reported collaboration between Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, and Sega, the Japanese video game manufacturer, now appears unlikely to create a significant role for Microsoft in video game software. A senior Sega USA official said that Microsoft, contrary to earlier reports, was not developing an operating system for Saturn, the next-generation Sega video game machine. Such reports led many industry observers to conclude that Microsoft aimed to establish worldwide software standards in the video game arena, just as it has in personal computer software. However, Mr Steven Payne, director of marketing for Sega USA, the US subsidiary of Sega responsible for the project, said that the software being developed with Microsoft for Saturn, a high-performance video game system under development by Sega, is not expected to include a 'fully-fledged operating system'. Microsoft officials said that they were precluded from discussing the company's relationship with Sega by a non- disclosure agreement. However, they played down the strategic significance of the relationship, noting that Microsoft has focused and will continue to focus primarily on PC software. 'Our relationship with Microsoft is evolving and it would be premature to say exactly what it will involve,' said Mr Payne. However, he noted that current generation video game machines do not have an operating system; instead, video game software developers write code that directly addresses the microprocessor in a video game machine. Saturn, an advanced video game machine under development by Sega, is expected to incorporate a CD-ROM drive as well as the familiar game cartridges. Microsoft's involvement is understood to involve a software interface to the CD-ROM drive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>   [Excerpts] The Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's  bureau disagree on the priorities to be pursued in the  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. While the former favors what  the Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement term  intensification [preceding word in English], the latter prefers  to wait until the Gaza-Jericho autonomy has established itself.    The nature and timetable of the next stage will be decided  at  Rabin and Peres' upcoming summit meeting with 'Arafat in Paris  next week, when the three men will be awarded a special UNESCO  prize. The occasion will be used for political talks.    The Foreign Ministry top echelons held a discussion  yesterday  on the next stage of negotiations. Their approach can be summed  up by saying that they support accelerating the negotiations and  expanding them beyond the five areas Israel is to transfer to  the Palestinians. The five areas are direct taxation, health,  education, tourism, and labor. The Foreign Ministry believes  the Palestinians should receive additional powers in economic  spheres.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday reiterated his  position that the residents of major cities in the territories  should be allowed to run their lives by themselves. [passage  omitted]    The prime minister's bureau has a different opinion. In  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's view, the first thing to do is to  ascertain that progress is being made in Gaza and Jericho and  that civilian spheres are being attended to, in addition to the  already operational police force. He believes that only at that  point should the next stage of negotiations be contemplated.</p>

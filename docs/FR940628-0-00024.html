			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The regulations have been revised to reflect the limitation on loan forgiveness for public service. The Secretary notes that regulations reflecting this loan forgiveness demonstration program are being published separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.200&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Co-Maker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A commenter noted that there is an understanding throughout the FFEL industry that the Department is considering deleting references to ``co-maker'' and replacing that term with the term ``endorser.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The terms ``endorser'' and ``co-maker'' are not synonymous and reflect different legal obligations. The Secretary will not be deleting the reference to co-maker, since it is a term used in the Consolidation Loan Program. ``Endorser'' is the term used in the Federal PLUS Program for borrowers with adverse credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Disposable Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters suggested that in the definition of ``disposable income'' the reference to ``any amounts required by law to be withheld'' was unclear and recommended further clarification. The commenters noted, for example, that child support payments would qualify under this definition if the payments were made under a divorce settlement rather than a court order. The commenters believed that the Department should not treat borrowers who are subject to garnishment for private debts more favorably than borrowers who are making payments without the need for court intervention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary clarifies that the definition of ``disposable income'' is that part of a borrower's compensation from an employer and other income from any source that remains after the deduction of amounts required by law to be withheld or any child support or alimony payments that are made under a court order or in accordance with a legally enforceable written agreement. The Secretary has also revised the definition to exclude payments made under a wage garnishment order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The definition of ``disposable income'' has been revised to clarify those payments that may be deducted from the borrower's compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Estimated Financial Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters expressed the same opinion raised during the negotiations that requiring aid officers to certify the student's estimated eligibility for the Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-Study program regardless of whether the student applies for the aid is not reasonable. Some commenters believed that it is unjust to penalize a student who declines campus-based awards and that it is inappropriate to have the financial aid administrator determine what is an ``acceptable reason'' for declining aid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : After further consideration of the commenter's views, the Secretary agrees that financial aid officers should not be required to certify estimated eligibility for other aid that the student does not apply for or consider as estimated financial assistance aid offered but declined by the student. The Secretary believes that students and their families should have discretion in those areas not prescribed by law and that aid administrators should not be placed in the position of evaluating the merits of a student's reason for declining an award. The Secretary notes that this position is consistent with Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The regulations have been revised to delete reference to ``whether or not the student applied'' under paragraph (1)(vii) and paragraph (2) has been added to delete the reference to the declining aid for an acceptable reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Nonsubsidized Stafford Loan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A commenter recommended that the definition be revised to reflect that those loans are not eligible for special allowance under &sect;682.302. The commenter suggested that confusion exists between the terms ``unsubsidized Stafford Loan'' and ``nonsubsidized Stafford Loan'' and the revision would clarify the difference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary agrees with the commenter's concern that the regulations need to reflect a clear distinction between the two programs and has revised the regulations to clarify that a nonsubsidized loan does not qualify for special allowance payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The regulations have been revised to reflect the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

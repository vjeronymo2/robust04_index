			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'SMELL' OF SUCCESS  </P> <P> A sequel to the very silly 1988 Paramount hit, "The Naked Gun: From the Files  of 'Police Squad'!" is in the works, according to co-exec producer David Zucker  -- with Leslie Nielsen already confirmed to reprise his wacky role as a police  lieutenant on the trail of a sinister murder conspiracy. The working title is  "The Smell Of Fear: From the Files of 'The Naked Gun.' "  </P> <P> "I would love to have it ready for release in the summer of 1990, but . . . the  scripts always take longer than we think they will," said Zucker.  </P> <P> Zucker said there's no real plot yet, but he's currently "assembling jokes" for  the picture with writer Pat Proft. "We've been watching a lot of old movies.  That's how we do it," Zucker explained.  </P> <P> Zucker's assessment so far: "The Dirty Harry movies have tons of jokes.  'Brubaker' (Robert Redford as a reform prison warden) was funny too. 'I Am a  Fugitive From a Chain Gang' had a lot of jokes. And all the prison movies like  'White Heat' -- those are hysterical."

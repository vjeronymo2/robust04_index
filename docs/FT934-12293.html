			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: SKF sinks deeper into the red SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, yesterday announced a deeper loss for the first nine months but it signalled that a turnround was imminent. Losses after financial items widened to SKr709m (Dollars 88.6m) from SKr361m as weak demand continued to restrain sales growth. For the second quarter running the group's underlying performance improved. Excluding a SKr110m charge for future staff cuts, the group's deficit was SKr130m in the latest three months compared with SKr167m in the same 1992 period. The company hopes to be back in the black at the operating level in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter of next year. It said Germany was its only market where demand was still falling. The UK, Italy and Sweden were picking up and other European markets stabilising. Conditions in the US and other markets were improving, it noted. The more optimistic picture has prompted the group to raise its production rate. Sales expanded to SKr21.5bn from SKr20.0bn in the first nine months. However, after allowing for currency factors and disposal of a unit, they were down 7 per cent. Operating losses fell to SKr99m from SKr114m, but the weaker krona helped push up net financial expenses to SKr610m from SKr247m. At the group's main bearings and seals unit, sales rose to SKr20bn from SKr17bn, but the division recorded a loss after financial income of SKr422m, compared with a SKr119m profit.</p>

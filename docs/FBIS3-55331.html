			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences A.G. Kvasov, </F> deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's North America  Department: "Russian-American Economic Relations Geared toward  Era of Open Markets"]    [Text] Russian-American relations occupy a special place  in the multipolar geometry of the world that has taken shape  since the end of the Cold War. Looming larger and embracing  more and more new spheres, economic collaboration between Russia  and the United States has become a direct or indirect subject of  discussion in our country. Discarding all the accretions, the  main question here is: Why do we need economic relations with  the United States? What is their role in Russian foreign  economic policy?    Objective analysis of the world economy and the trends in  technical progress indicates that for the commercial development  of the most advanced achievements -- "the technologies of  tomorrow" -- which Russian science and in part the defense  industry possess we cannot do without the American market. In  the 20th Century no country, not even Japan, has been able to  establish a major technical innovation of any description  without passing the test of the American market. That market,  by virtue of its readiness to accept any innovation and its  unsurpassed size, can also serve as a springboard for Russian  enterprises. Our economic collaboration will require more  favorable conditions if this plan is to be realized.    Russian-U.S. trade and economic ties have for many decades  been subordinated to a considerable extent to considerations of  a political nature. From this standpoint the meeting between  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in Vancouver in April 1993, which  initiated the development of partnership relations between our  countries, was a landmark. Even outwardly it was unusual in  that for the first time discussion of economic problems took up  a large part of the presidents' time. It was there that mutual  understanding was achieved for the first time that the most  effective way to help the Russian reforms is to give us the  chance to earn the requisite foreign currency ourselves.    The creation of an intergovernmental commission under the  leadership of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and  U.S. Vice President Al Gore was an important decision made at  the Vancouver summit. The commission was essentially charged  with the task of "depoliticizing" trade and economic relations  between our countries and rendering them such that they promote  the development of Russian-American partnership. The  commission's mandate is to remove all possible obstacles as  quickly as possible and to launch specific bilateral cooperation  projects, first and foremost in promising areas like power  generation, including nuclear power generation, outer space, and  other hi-tech sectors of the economy.    The first session of the Russian-American Commission for  Economic and Technical Cooperation was held in Washington at the  start of September 1993. During the meeting a broader remit for  the commission was agreed and an appropriate structure of  working bodies, including committees for the development of  business cooperation, energy policy, the conversion of the  defense industry, outer space, the environment, and science and  technology, was set up. The opening up of the American and  world markets to Russian space equipment, technology, and  services was the chief result of the committee's first session.  Thus, under an agreement on commercial launches, Russia was  granted a quota of 12 launches of spacecraft into orbit in the  period 1996-2000, which could provide our aerospace enterprises  with contracts worth up to $700 million.    There was no issue, no problem, which Bill did not rush to  tackle. Against the backdrop of his obsession with detail --  which prompted many political pundits to compare the President  to a "head clerk" but not a leader -- Hillary, embarking on  working out a strategy to reform medical insurance and the  health care system in general, looked like someone who was  really busy.    An abrupt change came almost immediately after he went on  vacation in August and spent an uninterrupted three weeks not  only relaxing and taking it easy, but thinking about whether he  was organizing his presidential life properly. As the  well-informed UPI noted at the time, "the President has clearly  taken a big step forward in ditching his devotion to detail and  getting a clearer idea of where he wants to take the country."    The switch to strategic goals does not mean, however, that  smaller-scale problems have been totally removed from the  President's attention, or that even when decrees and  proclamations carry a computer-printed signature rather than  that of Clinton himself, these decrees and proclamations are  almost automatic candidates for revision, review, and repeal. I  do not recall a single instance either in the Clinton presidency  or during the Bush and Reagan era when a document in the name of  the White House incumbent was repealed, altered, or simply  ignored the next day. Indisputably, the President's staff  deserves a great deal of credit in organizing this stability.  And the fact that Clinton's guys -- whose average age is nearly  30, who are mostly provincial products of Arkansas, and whose  experience in government is virtually zero -- have managed to  avoid situations that are ever-present here in Russia is, of  course, the result of the Americans' different political and  administrative traditions.    Starting with the Gorbachev era, high-ranking Kremlin groups  -- led as a rule by the heads of presidential administrations or  secretariats -- have been regularly sent to Washington for  "proficiency enhancement" courses. Sergey Filatov recently  visited their White House. The results of these trips are  almost invisible. If the American experience had indeed been  productive, the Kremlin would not have made frankly  controversial and politically explosive decisions such as the  decision not to allow the new Russian parliament into Moscow's  White House. Even a 30-year-old rookie staffer from Arkansas  would realize on joining the presidential staff that this kind  of decision had to be avoided at all costs. It is an axiom of  American political life and the basis of political stability  that Congress must not be offended or humiliated. You can  argue, shout till you're blue in the face, bang your fist, or  even -- like Khrushchev -- your shoe, but in no circumstances  must you wound, even by allusion, its comfortable sense of its  own dignity and prestige.    Alongside the meetings which Clinton will hold in Moscow  with  Boris Yeltsin and which will be interspersed only infrequently  with relaxation (such as a nice tour of a chocolate factory or a  kind of TV discussion between the U.S. President and Russian  citizens invited to "Ostankino") I would include on the Moscow  visit agenda -- apart from the mandatory and longstanding  disarmament, economic, and trade issues -- the question of what  should be done and in what way to parliament when it becomes  recalcitrant or simply unattractive because of its actions. I  think that Clinton could tell us a lot, both from his  gubernatorial practice in Arkansas and from his presidential  experience. By hook or by crook he has achieved and is  achieving ratification of bills in which his administration has  an interest and which Congress initially met without raucous  acclaim or even mere condescending approbation.    But, in general, if I were drawing up the program for  Clinton's Moscow visit, I would expand the informal side of it  as much as possible -- the U.S. President is a passed master at  glad-handing, and has appeared far more often on the streets of  Washington and other American towns and cities than many of his  predecessors (or, to be blunt, more often than the Russian  president has appeared on Russian streets of late).    Bill Clinton first visited this country almost 25 years ago.  He came to Moscow as a tourist from Oxford, where he was then  studying. That trip played a lot on his nerves during the  election campaign -- Republican opponents charged that in that  far-off era it was impossible for ordinary people to visit  Moscow, and that if they did, it was only with the knowledge,  approval, and, consequently, complete control of the secret  police.    Now that Bill Clinton is coming again, the secret police as  such no longer officially exists -- it is in the process of a  prolonged reorganization. Have no worries about coming, Mr.  President.</p>

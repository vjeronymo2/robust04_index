			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate cut fails to inspire Paris FRANCE cut interest rates but Germany did not, while the likelihood that war in the Balkans may involve other European countries kept sentiment depressed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS shrugged off the cut in domestic interest rates, the fifth in a month, either because they were not enough or because, having been signalled in advance, they had already been discounted. The CAC-40 index closed 5.85 lower at 1,920.49. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.1bn. Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron of Kleinwort Benson in London noted that further rate cuts were necessary in the short-term in order to counterbalance the usual seasonal torpor of the market. However, with three month money rates only marginally ahead of German rates the next move had to come from the direction of the Bundesbank, he said. Michelin was among the day's risers, up FFr6.20 or 4 per cent at FFr149.00. Having fallen 25 per cent since mid-January some bargain hunting is evident although the stock is also interest rate sensitive. FRANKFURT was marginally higher as earlier gains were eroded by weak corporate earnings announcements. Disappointment over the Bundesbank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged also set in, the DAX index closing up 0.1 at 1,623.26. Turnover fell to DM5.3bn from DM6.2bn. An announcement by Hochtief, down DM28 to DM1,102, that full year earnings would probably remain flat, contrary to expectations of higher earnings, depressed confidence. Mannesmann was among the bright spots of the day, rising DM2.30 to DM251.50, after announcing a cut in its 1992 dividend to DM6 per share from DM9. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities said investors had expected the dividend to fall as low as DM2, and were encouraged by the group's firm profit outlook in its cellular telephone division. MILAN marked time, ignoring Moody's decision to cut Italy's foreign debt rating, and concentrating instead on Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's speech to parliament, outlining his economic programme. The Comit index eased 0.79 to 540.76, with investors also awaiting the first of the parliamentary confidence votes, scheduled for this evening. Mr Nicolo Braendli of Akros Sim in Milan said that Mr Ciampi's programme was well received by the market, although he noted that the government faced no easy task in achieving its economic goals and introducing electoral reform. Sme rose L93 to L6,438 in reaction to plans announced on Wednesday for the sale of its retail unit. Credito Italiano added L41 to L2,977 while Gemina, the financial holding company, rose L30 to L1,340, before easing to L1,335 after hours, on rumours that it had put together a group of investors to buy a large stake in Credito. Generali, down L105 at the settlement L37,790, picked up to L38,300 on the kerb on rumours that the board might be about to propose a bonus issue. Montedison dipped L23 to L1,177 as the local press reported a recent market rumour that it might be incorporated into Ferruzzi, which traded L16 lower to L1,141. ZURICH made a positive start in reaction to the continuing strength of the franc against the D-Mark and on speculation of cuts in Swiss and German interest rates. But in the absence of any move on rates the SMI index finished 1.3 easier at 2,165.4. SMH the watchmaker spent a volatile day, adding SFr55 in early trading before slipping back to finish a net SFr10 lower at SFr1,830 in response to Wednesday's plans to split its shares and convert certificates into bearers and registered shares. STOCKHOLM continued to rally with prices rising to a new year's high in active trading led by further strength in S-E Banken. The Affarsvarlden index rose 6.9 to 1,059 in turnover of SKr1.8bn. S-E Banken's C shares advanced SKr5 to SKr27. The index has risen 16 per cent from the start of the year and traders said that some investors have started to become cautious over the rapid rise. Companies are expected to announce interim profits over the next few weeks, and Mr Henrik Breum, analyst at Unibors Securities, said that weaker than expected earnings could prompt profit-taking, taking the index to the 1,000 level in the near term.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 6                                               THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1156.25    1156.26    1156.43    1156.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1211.59    1211.45    1211.13    1210.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1155.46    1154.70    1152.49    1152.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1208.01    1206.20    1206.06    1205.10  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 5     May 4     Apr 30    Apr 29    Apr 28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1153.13   1148.16   1144.33   1143.23   1154.98 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1206.61   1207.82   1206.79   1199.62   1212.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1157.19 ; 200 -  1212.34 Low/day: 100 -  1151.78  200 -  1204.56 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

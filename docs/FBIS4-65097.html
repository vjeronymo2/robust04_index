			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- Germany has promised Hungary  support on its path toward NATO. Now that the Partnership for  Peace initiative has shown the way, the individual problems must  be tackled. This was stated at a news conference today in  Budapest by Bundestag Defense Committee Chairman Fritz Wittmann.  The main issues are compatibility, communication, education,  and leadership.    Wittmann stressed that of all the eastern bloc states,  Hungary is the closest to Germany. He did not rule out joint  German-Hungarian military exercises. However, language problems  would certainly arise, as shown by the example of the  Franco-German brigade.    The military preparedness of the Hungarian Armed Forces is  at  a very high level, the politician continued. This shows that  they have survived the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the  process of adaptation very well. This is important insofar as  Hungary plays a special role in the region, geographically and  politically.    Hungary's Defense Minister Lajos Fur expressed gratitude for  the gratis supply of materiel from stocks of the former GDR  National People's Army. This help has strengthened the  excellent relations between the two states.</p>

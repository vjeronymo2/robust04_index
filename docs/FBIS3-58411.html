			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan 12 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur held talks on bilateral cooperation Wednesday  [12 January] with Prince Mohammad Bin-Fahd, son of Saudi  Arabia's King Fahd, French officials said.    The 40-minute meeting with the man touted as the Saudi  regime's "businessman" covered political, economic, energy, and  defence issues, the officials said.    It took place three days after Balladur returned from a trip  to Saudi Arabia, during which the two countries agreed to create  a bilateral commission of experts on financing maintenance of  French military equipment sold to the Arab state.    But the French premier failed to seal hoped-for business  deals during his stay.    A spokesman for Balladur said the meeting had "given a major  boost" to bilateral relations.    The prince, who is the governor of Saudi Arabia's Eastern  Province, had talks with France's defence and interior ministers  Tuesday.    He was also due to meet President Francois Mitterand later  Wednesday.</p>

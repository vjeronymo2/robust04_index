			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (18): Agents can lead to travel savings - Jim Kelly finds that companies are starting to take a more professional attitude to costs BUSINESS TRAVEL, after buildings and salaries, now ranks as the third largest cost facing most companies. In continental Europe it accounts for 4.8 per cent of costs, while in the UK it takes a solid 6 per cent. The need to cut those costs in a recession, combined with the necessity of competing in an increasingly global economy, has led many com- panies to seek the services of a professional business travel agent. The business travel and expense management industry, or T&amp;E as it has become known, has responded through the concept of 'partnership' with its clients. Annual European expenditure for the industry is now estimated at Dollars 141bn. The shape of the T&amp;E market in Europe illustrates the pressures which have made most large companies decide that they need some form of outside help in cutting travel management costs. American Express, one of the principal players, recently published a survey of T&amp;E in Europe based on phone interviews with 15,000 companies and 3,500 personal interviews. Companies were chosen from a range of sectors and had to have 10 employees who regularly travelled on business. The results illustrate a volatile and competitive marketplace. The survey concluded: 'Europe now ranks as the foremost business travel market in the world.' In Europe companies spend an average Dollars 1,500 per employee on travel. Nearly two-thirds of all companies have a written travel policy. One in five companies has recently switched travel agent, prompted by better prices elsewhere or poor service. Though 38 per cent did have a 'travel manager', the job was largely left to office secretaries. Nearly three-quarters had an appointed travel agent. In France, Germany and the UK the level of satisfaction with T&amp;E was seen to be dropping. While most companies expressed the traditional needs from T&amp;E, of securing a comfortable reliable service, there was a growing interest in maximising travel rebates and reducing expenditure - especially in France and the UK. 'In general, the 1993 report reveals an increasingly professional attitude to the management of business travel and related expenses within European companies, together with a more intensive pursuit of value for money in the whole area of T&amp;E,' says American Express. Within the UK nearly 70 per cent of companies have recently taken initiatives to control T&amp;E spending: one in 10 had an 'inplant' desk of the travel agent on the premises. Three-quarters have at least one appointed travel agent. However, the report notes that: 'It is still normal for individual travellers or their secretaries to make the travel arrangements.' The T&amp;E business appears to be growing again, at least in the UK. A recent survey by the University of Surrey and Thomas Cook Travel Management showed that overall spend was set to increase, while downgrading continues, resulting in more travellers in the air. Many medium to large companies now believe business travel agents can deliver savings, cut bureaucracy, and help mould an efficient travel policy from within the company. But how to choose one? If you have a large business it is best to invite bids after deciding exactly what you want them to deliver. Today in T&amp;E the agent can offer services ranging from getting your aircraft tickets to pledging to cut your costs from inside the business. Where to start? The Guild of Business Travel Agents provides a 'good-housekeeping' seal of approval and has 37 members with a combined turnover of Pounds 3.86bn - about 60 per cent of which is in T&amp;E and the rest in leisure. The Guild of European Business Travel Agents is expanding and members have a combined turnover of Dollars 10.6bn. Both guilds produce profile booklets. Membership in the UK ranges from the big multiple travel agents with specialist skills in T&amp;E, such as Thomas Cook and Hogg Robinson, to the major independents, including Ayscough Travel and Gray Dawes Travel. The guild's members account for 75 per cent of business house air traffic booked through agents. Mr David Reynolds, secretary of the GBTA, says that many more smaller companies are now realising the benefits of T&amp;E: 'They don't want to get stuck in a queue behind someone who can't make up his or her mind about a holiday in Majorca.' He also sees an emphasis on professional qualifications: guild members now have 800 staff with City and Guild qualifications and 50 managers. Next year an MBA in T&amp;E will be offered at Brighton University. An example from the independent sector and one of the big multiples shows how far T&amp;E has come in edging closer to the decision-making core of many companies. Mr David Whittaker, joint chairman and managing director of The Travel Company, a T&amp;E specialist, and a director of Talking Point, a subsidiary specialising in conference and incentive events, is proud of the corporate 'partnership' which has been struck with SmithKline Beecham. For three months after the T&amp;E deal was signed, there were daily meetings with the clients. The Travel Company has 30 dedicated staff with SmithKline Beecham. The present spend on T&amp;E through The Travel Company is Pounds 15m a year. The company boasts state-of-the-art technology and offers software which can allocate rebates and basic money savings to individual management groups within the company - a powerful tool for driving incentive-based efficiency. 'It works like a dream,' says Mr Whittaker. Thomas Cook, one of the leading multiples with specialist skills in travel management, claims it was the first agency to take the partnership principle seriously. It has over 40 travel management centres in the UK and more than 80 implanted locations in companies. Rank Xerox is one company served by Thomas Cook Travel Management. It records a total air fares saving since employing TCTM of Pounds 4m for UK-based staff. Booking errors fell by 2 per cent. Thomas Cook says that partnership cuts both internal and external costs, improves quality, improves strategic advantage and generates growth for both parties. Services are also tailored for smaller companies. Mr Bill Kirkwood, director of sales and marketing, says: 'Thomas Cook Travel Management has signed Pounds 30m worth of new business from the smaller market over the last year. 'Our price guarantee, Fair Fares, was one of the key factors in gaining this level of interest.'</p>

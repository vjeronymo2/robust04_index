			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PESTICIDE POLITICS  </P> <P> For the most part, President Bush's plan to tighten controls over pesticides  that are used on or around food crops would be an improvement. But the plan  also would give ground on two important aspects of existing law, changes that  probably would be unwise and certainly are unnecessary.  </P> <P> In last week's briefings on the bill, which is still being drafted, the  President and officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency said  that they want to cut the time it takes to get a dangerous pesticide off the  market and out of fields and orchards by about half. The legislation also would  improve procedures for registering chemicals and assessing the risk of using  them, and stiffen penalties for violating pesticide regulations.  </P> <P> One of two questionable features of the plan would change the formula by which  EPA decides whether exposure to pesticide residue on food is so small that  there is "negligible risk" of its causing cancer in a consumer. At present, the  risk is considered negligible if there is a 1-in-a-million chance that the  chemical will cause cancer.  </P> <P> The President's plan would allow the EPA to set the "negligible risk" level as  high as 1 in 100,000. EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said in briefings  last week that the 1-in-a-million standard would continue to apply in most  cases and it was not clear what factors the EPA would use in settling for the  higher risk. Assessing risk is a subjective art rather than an objective  science, so common sense says the low risk assessment is the right one when  there is doubt about the data.  </P> <P> The other proposal under attack would repeal the right of states to apply  tougher pesticide controls to food products and turn standard-setting over to  the federal environmental agency. The risk-assessment problem probably can be  negotiated. Cutting the states, particularly California, out of writing  pesticide law cannot be, particularly with the history of state laws as  inspiration for tougher federal laws and regulations.  </P> <P> The EPA's argument for uniformity stresses the difficulty of growing crops  under a lower standard in one state and trying to sell the food in a state  where higher standards prevail.  </P> <P> At the same time, though, the agency says uniformity of law already is about as  high as it can get; even California goes along with federal standards virtually  all of the time. One agency official said that "we actually didn't have a lot  of problems with the way the law is now." The strongest case for uniform  pesticide regulation is made by food distributors and processors. One industry  spokesman downplayed the importance of the proposal by saying that only a  couple of dozen of the 300 pesticides used on food would be affected.  </P> <P> That is not a compelling argument against California's right to decide what  protections its citizens need. The state should not budge.  </P></p>

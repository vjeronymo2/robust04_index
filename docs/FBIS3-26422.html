			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA) -- Taipei chief negotiator  Chiao Jen-ho said Tuesday [8 February] that both Taiwan and  Mainland China were winners at the recently completed  cross-strait talks in Beijing because they both, to some extent,  attained their objectives.    At the beginning of the talks, the highest level  cross-strait  negotiations since the Koo-Wang talks in Singapore in April,  both sides made clear their bottom lines: Taipei wanted Beijing  to accept the reality of its sovereignty, while Beijing insisted  Taiwan recognize the "one-China" principle and agree that  Taiwan's ability to exercise jurisdiction was a political issue  and therefore not one to be touched on during the talks.    The talks deadlocked over the sovereignty problem, leading  to  a cancellation of discussions on the issues at hand -- the  repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants and  the resolution of cross-strait fishing disputes -- during the  third of five days of talks.    But after an hour-and-a-half meeting between Chiao and Wang  Zaoguo, the head of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office,  the talks were given an unexpected impetus, enabling negotiators  to clear away some long-standing obstacles and arrive at a "high  degree of consensus" at the end of the talks, although no  concrete agreements were reached.    "Having the consensus is a win-win result," Chiao, the  secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said.    "We already have Taiwan's sovereignty properly respected by  the other side," Chiao said, citing Beijing's preliminary  agreement with Taiwan over the issue of mainland hijackers.  Beijing has promised that any hijackers repatriated to the  mainland would have their time served in Taiwan deducted from  any sentence given by a mainland court.    Chiao also pointed to Beijing's approval of the enforcement  power of arbitration agencies to be set up on both sides to  handle fishing disputes as another example of Beijing's  acquiescence to Taiwan's sovereignty.    But Zhou Zhekai, secretary-general of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the No. 2 mainland  negotiator, said that the mainland didn't give in to Taiwan on  the sovereignty issue. "We didn't mention the sovereignty; we  just dealt with the reality itself," he said.    Chiao's counterpart, ARATS Standing Vice President and chief  mainland negotiator Tang Shubei, reiterated that the sovereignty  issue is a part of politics and should be avoided. "Avoidance  of the jurisdiction problem means that we will not mention it in  the wordings of future agreements," he added.    If Tang and Zhou are correct, then Taipei might not have  gotten what it wanted. On the contrary, Beijing took more from  the talks.    First, it received Taipei's promise to list cross-strait  trade, economic, cultural and technical cooperation on the  agenda of the next round of cross-strait talks scheduled for  March in Beijing. Taipei originally insisted that it would not  touch those issues until its request that its jurisdiction  regarding the issues of hijackers, illegal immigrants and  fishing disputes be recognized.    Secondly, Chiao's meeting with Wang created an image that  high- level contacts are more efficient in solving the  complicated issues, so Beijing can now justify its longstanding  call that cross-strait high-level political talks take place  sooner rather than later.</p>

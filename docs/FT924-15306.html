			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Crossing frontiers - Sponsorship The arts are certainly not afraid of Maastricht and an integrated Europe. The first major pan-European arts sponsorship honeypot has just been announced, with the money coming from Canadian owned Northern Telecom. For the first year there will be three tranches of Pounds 50,000 available for arts events in the UK, France and Germany which involve co-operation across frontiers. For example, if a British dance group commissions a work by a German choreographer with a French composer providing the score, it could apply for a grant towards the project, ranging from Pounds 5,000 up to Pounds 50,000, with some confidence. Each year Northern Telecom will add a new European country to its patronage so that in three years time it should be distributing Pounds 250,000. It also hopes that its sister companies on the continent will join the scheme, boosting the jackpot. The sponsorship was devised by Cerec, the European Committee for Business, Arts and Culture. The applications will be shifted by local committees of worthies and then there will be an annual award ceremony. The chosen arts events will promote innovation as well as international collaboration and further information can be obtained from Spero Communications on 071 538 9946.                         *      *      * It is definitely getting hard out there. Companies are cutting back all their peripheral expenses. And it is companies that were previously big supporters of the arts - the banks, the insurance companies, the oil multinationals - that are among the main sufferers in the recession. The consensus is to freeze sponsorship budgets where possible. But if the government cuts the arts budget for 1993-94 business will feel it is let off the hook. This is an argument being put to the Treasury to maintain current spending subsidy levels. Few companies have so far risked the opprobrium of withdrawing from existing sponsorships, but they are loathe to enter new commitments and are cutting back in such areas as corporate membership, which can cost over Pounds 20,000 a year to guarantee seats at prestigious venues like Covent Garden. The pressure is on to justify arts expenditure and to avoid links which look like perks for the directors. Sadler's Wells has adopted a flexible response to the crisis. It has come up with a scheme to suit the times. For Pounds 1,000 you can become a member of the Business Circle. As well as perks like free tickets and programmes the participants are invited to bimonthly Business to Business meetings at the theatre. The programme is aimed to appeal to local accountants, estate agents, etc, who relish the chance to make business contacts in an arty environment.                         *      *      * One major sponsor which has rationalised its programme is BP. Out goes its support of the Arts Journalism of the Year Awards, which for six years were held in co-operation with the Arts Council. The Council is now looking for a new backer prepared to put up around Pounds 50,000 to promote the highest possible standards in arts media coverage. After a shaky start sponsors have come to the aid of the Council's 'Odd Couple' conference at Brighton on October 27-29. The conference aims to bring together workers in the arts and broadcasting to discuss areas of conflict and co-operation, but the cost of over Pounds 300 a delegate deterred many potential participants. Philip Hedley of the Theatre Royal Stratford East expressed his horror at the expense by offering to put up the money for a young artist to attend. Harvey Goldsmith added his bursary. Now Carlton Communications is funding 70 full and half fee bursaries and Granada, Central and Sony are also helping. The English National Opera is allowing itself a pat on the back for finding sponsors for all seven of its new opera productions in the 1992-93 season while its rival at Covent Garden has no commercial sponsors lined up. Not that all is hunky dory at the Coliseum. It might have found sponsors for 14 of the operas on the programme but the revenue from this source is five per cent down on a year ago. Sponsors are cutting back on the size of their pledges. ENO set itself an ambitious sponsorship target of Pounds 1.865m for 1992-93, an 18 per cent increase on the previous year. To date it has raised Pounds 1.4m and is now finding the going tough. Two corporate prospects withdrew their interest in Ken Russell's forthcoming production of Princess Ida, although an American couple, Christine and Irvine Laidlaw, are making good much of the gap. Four operas this season are down to private sponsors and a fifth is backed by thousands of individuals. To pay for a new production of Janacek's The Adventures of Mr Broucek Pounds 50,000 has been raised in the past month from the ENO's audience, who are encouraged after every performance to contribute to its cost. A further encouragement is that BB Supply, UK distributors of Gambrinus Pilsen Czech Beer, is testing arts sponsorship by supplying several thousand bottles of beer to oil the Sponsor an Opera campaign. By the end of October the ENO hopes that Pounds 100,000 will have been accumulated this way.                         *      *      * Sculpture is an art form that has failed to attract the sponsors its history and importance merits. Now the Royal Society of British Sculptors is sharpening up its act and has attracted a major backer. Nat West Life, the newly formed life assurance subsidiary of the Bank, is supporting the Natwest Life Commission, which is aimed at young sculptors at art schools. The winning entry will stand outside the company's new Bristol headquarters. There will be Pounds 5,000 cash prize for the successful sculptor, Pounds 2,000 for their college, and advice from a professional sculptor in the erection of the work.                         *      *      * Alternative comedy is currently the popular sponsorship fix. Rowntree is the latest company to join in, with its Polo Mint comedy award. Twenty-one nominees are appearing at London venues over the next two months. One will then be chosen as the winner and will carry off no money, just prestige. Polo has to pay their modest appearance fees, which includes spots on Kiss FM.</p>

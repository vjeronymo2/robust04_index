			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Leading Article: Chilly spring in Washington FLOWERING cherry trees and the faint stirring of a US recovery make Washington a welcome destination for the recession-weary. But the finance ministers of the world's leading industrialised countries will not find any soothing remedies at the coming week's jamboree. The world's economic problems are largely home grown; they require domestic action, not co-operative inaction. The exchange rate co-ordinating role of G7 summits has all but died. Managed world exchange rates have been replaced by domestically oriented monetary policies. And a good thing it is too. The US authorities' attempts to manage the rise and fall of the dollar effectively by manipulating Japanese interest rates were in large part responsible for its subsequent boom-bust cycle. Some of the old rhetoric remains. The US will call for other countries to follow its lead and cut interest rates aggressively. Japan will cautiously agree, while fretting about the value of the yen. But Germany, the new bugbear of the US growth lobby, will rightly point to its domestic inflationary problem as a reason for keeping its interest rates high, regardless of the wishes of the US administration. The rest of Europe will sit in glum silence. Fiscal consolidation Benign G7 summits may avoid monetary policy errors; but they may also act as an excuse for necessary action elsewhere. The need for fiscal consolidation is unlikely to figure strongly in the forthcoming discussions. Instead, a communique will stress the desirability of sustainable non-inflationary growth and low world real interest rates. The IMF will produce yet another report forecasting a world recovery next year. Everyone will feel a little better; no one will be any the wiser; and the chances of a strong world recovery will remain remote. Yet the fiscal irrectitude of certain G7 governments is now an even greater problem for world economic growth than in the late 1980s. The US, UK and Japan have no choice but to deflate away their heavy private sector debt burdens, having rightly, if bravely, eschewed the inflation route. But the pain, for these countries, and indeed for debtors everywhere, is made more severe by the current high level of world real interest rates that developed country budget deficits have brought. The US is the most experienced fiscal profligate. Because it failed to close the budget gap in the late 1980s, despite rapid economic growth, fiscal policy has not been available to kick-start the current sluggish recovery. Even if Congress had agreed to the president's proposed fiscal package, the result would have been higher long-term interest rates. Ostensible culprit Little wonder that the US administration has looked elsewhere to source its pre-election recovery. But the European economy is unlikely to oblige. The ostensible culprit is the European exchange rate mechanism, which is keeping interest rates painfully high. But it is irresponsible fiscal policy, this time in Germany, that is once more to blame. The German government has failed to build a consensus around the need to pay for the reconstruction of east Germany. Instead of tax increases and west German spending cuts, they have paid the bills by large-scale borrowing, increasingly through off-budget financing vehicles. The Bundesbank has had no option but to push up interest rates to offset the resulting inflationary pressures. The ERM has exported these high rates, and the unemployment they bring, across Europe. The world economy remains on a knife-edge. It needs lower interest rates to fuel economic growth, and soon. Slow or no growth makes it politically difficult for the G7 to tackle the other issues they face: aid for the former Soviet republics, trade liberalisation, relief for debt-burdened Africa. Yet European interest rates, and US long rates, are unlikely to fall until the structural component of the US and German deficits are brought back into balance. Japan can and should cut interest rates further. The UK has room for a half-point cut. But Europe looks set to face high real interest rates throughout 1993 until either Germany shows signs of bringing its fiscal deficit under control, or the ERM crumbles under the strain. The former would be preferable; the latter looks increasingly possible.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Book Review: No upwardly mobile freeway to the future COLLISION By Maryann Keller Doubleday/Currency Dollars 25, 285pp At General Motors, the stumbling giant of the world car industry, it took an unprecedented two-stage coup last year by the company's outside directors to oust the old management in a last-ditch effort to drive the company out of the biggest losses recorded in US corporate history. Volkswagen, the leader of the European car industry, is racked by losses. The high-cost producer of the world car industry, it is enduring a corporate and cultural revolution. A large part of its senior management has been discarded in less than a year; its chief executive looks more isolated each day and is fighting a lonely battle, with his closest colleague under investigation by the German public prosectutor for alleged industrial espionage. Toyota, the leader of the Japanese industry, is much less obviously in trouble, but its previous air of invincibility is being undermined. The stubborness of the domestic Japanese recession, the surging yen and sales problems in foreign markets have combined to all but wipe out its operating profits. It too faces a leadership crisis, as the company struggles to move beyond the era of the Toyoda family dynasty. Must Toyota face a crisis as severe as those of GM and VW in order to change? The question is posed by Maryann Keller, a leading US financial analyst of the world auto industry, whose latest book, Collision, is a compelling account both of the storms buffeting the world's carmakers and of the executives struggling to stay at the helm. 'Toyota is clearly losing momentum and is bogged down by its responsibilities as Japan's number one corporate citizen. Whether the company slips into mediocrity or retains its leadership role depends upon Tatsuro Toyoda (Toyota president since September 1992), a man not known for decisive action at a time when the company needs vision and leadership,' argues Keller. She has set out to chart the fluctuating fortunes of GM, Toyota and Volkswagen, the leaders of the auto industries of North America, Japan and west Europe, as they career along a collision course not so much with each other but with the unfamiliar challenges of the 21st century. Misleadingly, Keller has chosen to coin the phrase the 'global big three' to describe her target companies. The industry is dominated by at least a global big five. Ford, the number two US carmaker, is bigger than both Toyota and Volkswagen. Nissan, the number two Japanese carmaker, vies with Volkswagen in size. Keller is not interested in such niceties, however. Her subjects were not chosen in deference to the industry's pecking order, but to use the companies as a way of exploring the national cultures in which they are embedded. At such an elevated level the book falls short. In particular, as Keller travels away from North America it often becomes little more a travelogue and a beginner's guide to the cultural histories of Germany and Japan. Within the more narrow focus of the world motor industry, however, Collision provides a riveting look at some of the forces that have shaped the fortunes of the three carmakers during recent decades, and provides intriguing insights into the personalities at the top of the world's dominant manufacturing industry, as well as those who have fallen by the wayside. Best-documented by Keller is the upheaval that has riven GM, the company where her inside knowledge is greatest. She gives a damning portrait of GM during the era of Roger Smith's 'wild destructive reign' in the 1980s, and during the unhappy and short-lived tenure of his successor Mr Robert Stempel. By the beginning of the the 1990s, 'GM reflected more the crumbling decay of Detroit's inner city than the durability of its granite and marble headquarters building . . . A visit to the 14th floor (the executive office suite) was like entering a time warp from GM's glory days. General Motors was a perfect example of the contemporary corporate malaise, where income and privileges bore no relation to performance.' While many of the GM leaders suffer from the acid of Keller's pen, she is equally telling in her description of the leading personalities at Volkswagen, Mr Carl Hahn, chief executive until the end of last year, and Mr Ferdinand Piech, the man who has spent 1993 struggling with his predecessor's doubtful legacy. 'Piech was cut from a different cloth than Hahn. While Hahn was smooth as silk, a consummate charmer who enjoyed the public stage, Piech was balding, slope-shouldered and haggard - always uneasy in the spotlight.' At Toyota Keller leaves no doubt that she believes that the company is heading for a leadership crisis, and that in one of its most difficult periods the family has chosen a weak leader in the shape of Tatsuro Toyoda, not groomed like his brother and predecessor Shoichiro, to lead the corporation. 'At Toyota, regardless of how high the rank might be, everyone bowed to Shoichiro. But at Toyota Motor Sales, Tatsuro bowed to others.' The case arguing the relative weakness of Toyota only partially succeeds, but nonetheless she is ready by the end of Collision to pick her winner. VW is dismissed for having 'spun in its own narrow orbit' for most if its history. 'Of the three companies it may be the least adaptable to change.' Toyota is the most complex because it is standing where GM was 30 years ago. 'It knows how to be successful. The question is: does it know how to function in a less secure environment?' Which is the best car company in the world? 'I am compelled to answer, 'The one that has most recently overcome great problems.' Right now that company is General Motors.'</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: German tool orders up sharply German machine tool orders climbed by 14 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 and continued to experience double-digit growth in April, the VDW industry association said yesterday. Domestic orders rose 14 per cent and foreign ones 15 per cent. Without announcing an overall increase for April, the VDW noted that domestic orders exceeded levels of a year ago by 20 per cent. Foreign demand in the first quarter was particularly strong from the US, the former Soviet Union, China, Switzerland, Italy and France. The industry, which is slowly emerging from its worst post-war recession, saw its order backlog at the end of the quarter rise to 4.9 months from an average of 4.7 months for all of 1993. Capacity utilisation climbed to 76 per cent in March from a 1993 average of 71 per cent. AP-DJ, Frankfurt.

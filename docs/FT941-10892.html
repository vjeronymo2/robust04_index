At a price of FFr385 per share - compared with Friday's closing price of FFr431.2, up FFr5.2 - most industry observers predict that the public tranche will be oversubscribed, as in the previous two privatisation issues - Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group. The price for institutional investors is being set through a process of book-building. The result will be announced on February 14, with most analysts expecting a price of between FFr400 and FFr410 per share.</p>

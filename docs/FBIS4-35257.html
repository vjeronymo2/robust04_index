			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Although three weeks have passed since the Yemeni  crisis began, no solutions have been found to end the conflicts  in that country. In the most recent effort to resolve this  crisis, the five members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council  and Egypt have proposed in a letter to the UN Security Council  president that the council examine the situation in Yemen.  Within this framework, a resolution has been proposed to be  discussed by the Security Council. In this proposed resolution  an immediate cease-fire between the two conflicting sides and a  ban on the dispatch of any type of war materiel and arms to  Yemen have been requested. The UN secretary general also has  been requested to send a fact-finding mission to Yemen and to  pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two  conflicting factions. The UN Security Council is expected to  begin examining the Yemeni crisis on Tuesday.    The proposal by the six Arab countries to the UN Security  Council shows that their attempts to end the conflicts in Yemen  are at an impasse. Despite their efforts, the Arab  countries--both individually and within the framework of the  Arab League--have been unable to prevent the political  differences in Yemen from turning into a civil war. This  inability has been attributed to the differences of opinion  among the Arab countries on the Yemeni crisis.    Having the Yemeni problem discussed by the Security Council  automatically grants an international dimension to this crisis.  While it is a very welcome development for the leaders of south  Yemen, it causes concern among the leaders in the north. Since  the outset of the crisis in Yemen, the leaders in the south have  constantly sought ways to internationalize the problem in a bid  to inflict pressures on the north. The north has referred to  the crisis as a domestic issue and has urged foreign countries  and international organizations to not become involved.    When the southerners declared their separation from the  north  and the formation of an independent country, the  internationalization of the problem granted them the opportunity  to strengthen their bases. Since this weakens Yemen's unity, it  is a source of great concern for the northerners who want unity  to be preserved.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Peru pledge clears aid hurdle THE US administration intends to back a financial support programme for Peru, having been satisfied during talks with Peruvian ministers that the Lima government intends to address US concerns about human rights. The concerns, relating chiefly to the treatment of political prisoners and the harassment of human rights groups, had led the administration to delay a financial package designed to help Peru clear its arrears with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Assurances were given to the US this week in Washington by Mr Jorge Camet, Peru's finance minister, and Mr Fernando Vega Santo Gadea, justice minister. A State Department official said the commitments were sufficient to restart moves towards the completion of the package, which includes a short-term bridge loan of nearly Dollars 2bn to allow Peru to clear arrears with the IMF and World Bank. However, the commitments would be monitored as the multinational support package, which is being arranged under the leadership of the US and Japan, moves towards fruition. The arrangement to clear Peru's arrears with the IMF was to have come before the IMF board this week, but was postponed because of US concerns. It could now come up as early as next week. Clearing arrears with the IMF and the World Bank will allow them to resume lending. The delay was seen as an indication that the US intends to link foreign aid with human rights and democracy in recipient countries.</p>

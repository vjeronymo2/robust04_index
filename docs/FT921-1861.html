			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Kenya bans political rallies THE KENYAN government yesterday banned political rallies in an effort to curb tribal fighting, which has killed more than 70 people this year. The ban, a serious setback to Kenya's transition to a multi-party democracy, will alarm aid donors who last November linked future assistance to economic reform and civil rights. The opposition said clashes between President Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin clan, and Luo and Luhya tribes, had been encouraged by the government, as pretext to delaying an election.</p>

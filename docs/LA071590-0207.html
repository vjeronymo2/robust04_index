			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: PATTI FRUSTACI'S BIG SURPRISE: SHE'S PREGNANT WITH TWINS  </P> <P> Patti Frustaci, mother of four, is pregnant again -- with twins.  </P> <P> New life, new hope. A voice inside tells us that we should be pleased. But the  voice, in my mind, betrays some doubt.  </P> <P> Parenthood has not come easily to Patti and Sam Frustaci. They could not  conceive naturally and later, when conception finally occurred, it carried a  high price.  </P> <P> First an infertility specialist helped by administering a common fertility  drug, Pergonal. The Frustacis said they knew the risks, among them possible  multiple births.  </P> <P> The drug worked well with the couple's firstborn, Joseph, who's now 6 years  old, but problems developed with a pregnancy a little more than a year after  that.  </P> <P> Patti Frustaci delivered septuplets -- the nation's first -- at St. Joseph  Hospital in Orange on May 21, 1985. The infants were 12 weeks premature.  </P> <P> One of them, Christina Elizabeth, was dead at birth. Three others, David  Anthony, James Martin and Bonnie Marie, died within 19 days.  </P> <P> The survivors, Patricia Ann, Richard Charles and Stephen Earl, are 5 years old.  They are physically and mentally impaired.  </P> <P> The Frustacis sued the doctor who helped them conceive, alleging that he should  have done more tests before she was artificially inseminated. Last week they  settled with his insurance carrier for as much as $6 million.  </P> <P> But Dr. Jaroslav Marik had objected so strenuously to not having his day in  court that he was dropped as a defendant by the time the settlement was  announced.  </P> <P> From the start, the doctor said that he had done nothing wrong. He recommended  additional tests, he says; it was Patti Frustaci who didn't want to take the  time or pay the costs. He says his patient defied other medical instructions as  well.  </P> <P> She says that none of it is true.  </P> <P> I don't know if we'll ever know who was at fault here, or if, indeed, there was  any fault at all. Medicine has its risks, as does giving birth. Without a  trial, not even a jury can voice a vote.  </P> <P> Patti Frustaci, a Mormon, ignored the recommendation of her obstetrician that  she have an abortion after the presence of seven fetuses was diagnosed. The  doctor cited slim odds of survival; the patient clung to her own moral resolve.  Both were listening to an internal voice and both certainly have that right.  </P> <P> Yet now Patti Frustaci's latest pregnancy seems to open another door in many  people's minds. Browne Greene, her attorney, recognizes this too. He says he  was shocked when he heard the news.  </P> <P> "The pregnancy was a factor in the settlement," he says. "It could have gone  either way with a jury. I had planned to use it as an example of the exact kind  of care that she should have received before. So that would have been a plus.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, a minus, quite honestly, would have been that we had argued  about the traumatic emotional experience that she went through with the  multiple births. The question is, 'Why would she go and do this again?' "  </P> <P> Patti Frustaci says that she wants "another normal child." She took Pergonal  once again and, this time, it apparently worked according to her plan. Medical  tests show healthy twins, with an expected due date just before the end of the  year.  </P> <P> But what if something else goes awry? Will the Frustacis sue again? And who is  to say that they shouldn't have that right, should they so decide?  </P> <P> There was a time, although I haven't lived through it myself, when the  relationship between doctor and patient was based primarily on trust. Each side  assumed the other was doing their best, and that was usually good enough.  </P> <P> Since then, however, there have been abuses on both sides. Attorneys and  insurance companies have become heavily involved. Medical care, we are  reminded, is a business.  </P> <P> Malpractice insurance, and such lawsuits as that brought by the Frustacis, have  frightened many doctors. They say they must protect themselves to survive.  Especially in the field of obstetrics, many are simply getting out.  </P> <P> "There is a big difference betwen maloccurrence and malpractice," says Dr.  Roger Schlesinger, a North Orange County obstetrician. "Many people do not  understand that. Malpractice means you have not acted up to the standards of  care in your locale. Maloccurrence might mean you are the best doctor in the  world -- and none of us are gods -- but that things do go wrong."  </P> <P> Physicians and their insurance companies argue that arbitration agreements,  signed by doctor and patient before treatment begins, can go a long way toward  straightening all this out. The signing of such forms is now becoming routine.  </P> <P> If there is a dispute, the agreements state, they will be decided by a  three-member panel -- usually a doctor, a lawyer and a business person. The  panels work faster and more cheaply than do the courts. Monetary awards are  usually less extreme.  </P> <P> Still, patients have their doubts. Many believe -- erroneously, doctors contend  -- that they are signing away their constitutional rights. Both doctor and  patient, however, say the agreements can set a more wary tone.  </P> <P> "It certainly throws a cloud over the heads of both parties," says Dr. Philip  Chiu, president of the Orange County OB/GYN Society. "That's why I like to talk  to the patient first. . . . If it is put in the right light and circumstances,  there isn't a problem."  </P> <P> Greene says that although Patti Frustaci did not sign an arbitration agreement  with Marik, he would not necessarily have advised her against it. He says her  case could have been decided in one week and the costs, of course, would have  been considerably less.  </P> <P> And as far as he knows, Greene says, the Frustacis have not signed such an  agreement with her new physician at Loma Linda Hospital, the one who prescribed  the Pergonal that facilitated her pregnancy with twins.  </P> <P> Still, many physicians are amazed that Patti Frustaci could find anyone to  treat her after her initial suit. She's made waves. And usually people who do  so pay a heavy price.  </P> <P> Or maybe in the aftermath of the Frustaci experience, all of us will be paying  a portion of that price.  </P> <P> Who do we trust, many will ask. And how would we know?  </P></p>

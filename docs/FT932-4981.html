			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / EC to step up E Europe loans THE European Community plans to increase its lending to support economic recovery in central and eastern Europe to Ecu1.7bn (Pounds 1.34bn) by the end of the year from Ecu925m (Pounds 731m) at present. The lending, by the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term financing institution, forms part of Community efforts to speed-up the integration of eastern and western Europe. The lending details will be announced at the EIB's annual meeting in Luxembourg today. EC foreign ministers gather in Luxembourg tomorrow for a two-day meeting to discuss European Commission plans to accelerate trade liberalisation with eastern Europe. Only Ecu180m of the Ecu925m in loans assigned for Bulgaria, the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia have so far been disbursed, underlining the EIB's caution in the region. Nonetheless, the EIB's disbursement rate seems slightly higher than that achieved by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the east-west financial organisation. The EBRD last year disbursed Ecu126m out of Ecu1.2bn in approved loans and equity injections for projects in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The two sets of figures are not directly comparable, however, since the EBRD is still starting its operations and also dispensing funds across a far wider area of the former Soviet empire than the EIB. Of the latter's Ecu925m in signed loans, Ecu305m is destined for Hungary, with Ecu290m earmarked for Poland, Ecu120m for Romania, Ecu115m for Bulgaria, Ecu57m for the Czech republic and Ecu38m for Slovakia. Additionally, the EIB plans to lend Ecu200m over three years to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The EIB, which last year lent the record total of Ecu17bn inside and outside the Community, raises funds on international capital markets. These are lent on with a small interest rate margin, resulting in the current lending rate for 10-year D-Mark loans of a highly competitive 6.9 per cent. At today's annual meeting, attended by EC finance ministers, the EIB will announce it is well on the way to implementing the Ecu5bn lending plan to spur EC growth decided at last December's Edinburgh summit. The EIB board has approved Ecu2.2bn for 30 transport, infrastructure and environment projects, with another Ecu440m worth of deals to be discussed today. The EIB has also concluded preparations for an investment fund to guarantee loans for transport and infrastructure ventures and for small and medium-sized EC companies. Groaning table, Page 13</p>

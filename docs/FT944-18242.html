			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (16): New man Smith administers a tonic - Profile: General Motors General Motors, the world's largest vehicle manufacturer, is in the throes of a painful transformation aimed at restoring its troubled North American operations to health. The group is battling to overcome decades of complacency, bureaucratic encrustation and manufacturing inefficiency which culminated in combined North American losses of over Dollars 12bn in the recession years of 1991 and 1992. It was those losses, and the gradualist pace of change being pursued by Robert Stempel, GM's then chairman and chief executive, which prompted a boardroom coup in October 1992 and the installation of a new chief executive, Jack Smith. The 56-year-old Mr Smith who, in the 1980s, played a key role in turning GM's European operations into the most profitable in that region, has moved with equal vigour in the US over the past two years. Jobs have been sharply cut in GM's plant and white collar bureaucracy. The headcount of hourly paid workers had fallen from 329,000 at the end of 1990 to around 250,000, and analysts think it may be down to around 200,000 by the end of 1996. He has been selling off non-core businesses and shifting the supply of parts for GM vehicles from its huge, in-house components operation to outside suppliers, many of whom pay much lower wages and benefits to their workers. He has also cracked down on outside parts suppliers, demanding from them cuts of up to 20 per cent in the prices written into their contracts. He has also swept away much of GM's in-bred 'old guard' top management, bringing in a younger generation of leaders, such as Rick Wagoner, 41, the recently appointed head of North American automotive operations. All this, coupled with a cyclical recovery in the US vehicle market, has had a strong impact on GM's earnings. In the second quarter, the group reported best quarterly profits ever, of Dollars 1.92bn, more than double the Dollars 889m of a year earlier. North America contributed Dollars 723m to the bottom line, compared with a Dollars 33m loss in the second quarter of 1993. International operations, which for years have helped offset disaster in North America, reported a Dollars 543m profit in the second quarter, up from a Dollars 306m profit a year ago. However, GM's North American vehicle profit margin, at 2.7 per cent of revenues, still badly lagged behind its international automobile operations, which posted a 7.5 per cent margin. GM's internal goal is 5 per cent. GM earned an average of Dollars 557 for each vehicle it sold worldwide, up from just Dollars 130 a vehicle a year ago, but well behind Ford, which earned Pounds 653 a vehicle, and Chrysler, which made more than Pounds 1,300. Mr Smith says: 'We recognise that we can't get complacent. We still have a lot of work ahead to improve our earnings power and achieve target earnings margins.' It could face several stumbling blocks along the way. First, GM's crack-down on suppliers prices, lead initially by the abrasive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who then left GM for Volkswagen, has left relations between the company and parts manufacturers extremely sore. GM says the Lopez campaign saved it Dollars 4bn in cumulative purchasing costs by the end of 1993, and that it has softened its abrasive edge. But some suppliers complain it is still pressing them too hard, and showing their engineering drawings to competitors, in the hope of getting lower contract bids. GM, in short, has the worst relations with suppliers in Detroit and over the long term that could hurt the company. It also faces an extremely delicate relationship with the United Auto Workers' union, which is anxious to retain industry jobs. The company has suffered a rash of strikes at local plants, including a stoppage of 3,000 workers at an Indiana parts plant last summer. However, behind the scenes, the UAW has been relatively co-operative with GM's rationalisation, for example by not forcing the company to honour an agreement that it will hire one new worker for every two who retire. The biggest challenge facing the group is to start producing exciting new vehicles that customers want to buy, rather than the tired, look-alike models it churned out for much of the 1980s, and which cut its US market share from around 46 per cent at the start of the decade to one third today. There are some encouraging signs. For example, the new Aurora, a sporty luxury sedan, should restore some shine to the badly tarnished Oldsmobile badge. So too should the fact that the Aurora is being sold by dealers with the same 'no haggle' techniques which helped make GM's compact, experimental Saturn car a hit with buyers. However, many of GM's other new vehicles have received a mildly appreciative, rather than enthusiastic, critical reception. To win back market share the group needs cutting edge appeal, and it does not seem there yet.</p>

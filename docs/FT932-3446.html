			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Microsoft in talks on cable TV venture MICROSOFT, the US computer software group, is in talks with Time Warner, the entertainment group, and Tele-Communications Inc, the big cable television company, to set up a joint venture to develop interactive software for television, according to news reports. Although the three companies have not commented on the reports, their negotiations are expected to lead to the establishment of a new company producing software for cable television boxes. The software would provide cable subscribers with access to a wide array of interactive information and services. It would allow them to shop by television, view individually-selected news and statistics, or select films and video games from a vast electronic library. The link-up between Microsoft, Time Warner and TCI would represent the latest in a series of moves by large computer, entertainment and communications companies joining forces to develop interactive media technology for cable television users. In April, Microsoft announced it was getting together with the micro-chip manufacturer Intel and cable hardware company General Instrument to develop a cable TV box with a built-in interactive personal computer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington blocked a deal under which Jordan would  have sold old aircraft to a Muslim Asian nation just before the  transaction was to have been closed. The justification cited by  Washington was that nation's human rights record and its  connections and relations, according to well-informed sources.    The nation in question had agreed to purchase the aircraft  following contacts made by Jordan. There is no word about the  size of the unconsummated deal, but the sources said it would  have been quite substantial.</p>

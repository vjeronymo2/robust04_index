			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Teachers seek rise that exceeds RPI Teachers are on a collision course with the government over a pay submission that would mean rises of more than 20 per cent for some over two years. And they have warned they may take steps to cut their workload. The National Union of Teachers yesterday called for a salary increase next year above the rate of inflation, possibly up to 4 per cent. The biggest teaching union's submission to the School Teachers' Review Body, which advises the government on setting teachers' pay, is calling for a 10-point salary scale by 1996. This would range from Pounds 14,750 for a graduate-entry teacher - up 13.5 per cent from the present equivalent starting salary of Pounds 12,999. The NUT is arguing for a 'significant increase' next year, beating the rate of inflation and combining a lump sum and percentage. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said the government had breached its ban on 'catch-up' pay rises when MPs awarded themselves 4.7 per cent. He warned that his members could take steps to cut a mounting workload. 'There comes a point where you say it just can't go on. If no one is going to listen to us, we will have to look very carefully and decide which aspects of our work we could discontinue.' This year the government imposed the School Teachers' Review Body's recommended 2.9 per cent pay rise. The submission to the review body from the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers called for a 35-hour-week and a pay increase in line with other non-manual staff. The Secondary Heads Association has called for a pay increase for all teachers 'in recognition of their improved productivity, measured by published examination results'.</p>

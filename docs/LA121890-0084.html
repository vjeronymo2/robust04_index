			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALCIDO GETS DEATH SENTENCE IN 7 MURDERS;  </P> <P> CRIME: HIS FATHER-IN-LAW CALLS HIM A COWARD IN THE SLAYINGS OF 6 FAMILY MEMBERS  AND A CO-WORKER IN A 1989 WINE-COUNTRY RAMPAGE.  </P> <P> A former winery worker was sentenced to death Monday for killing his wife, two  daughters, mother-in-law, his wife's two young sisters and a co-worker in a  wine-country rampage.  </P> <P> Ramon Salcido's father-in-law, Robert Richards, called him a coward and  tearfully asked for swift justice.  </P> <P> Salcido, 29, was convicted on Oct. 30 of the April, 1989, murders.  </P> <P> Richards, taking advantage of a California law that permits victims or their  relatives to address the judge before sentencing, urged Sierra County Superior  Court Judge Reginald Littrell to follow the jury's recommendation for the death  penalty.  </P> <P> "Why drag this thing out for years?" Richards said. "He admitted he did it.  He's showed no remorse."  </P> <P> The Mexican-born Salcido, speaking through an interpreter, did express remorse  Monday.  </P> <P> "I want to express that I repent for the things that have happened to the  family that I loved the most, and for all the grief and pain I have caused," he  said.  </P> <P> The judge said Salcido will be transferred to San Quentin prison within 10  days. Since he was sentenced to death, California law requires that his case be  automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> California has not executed anyone since 1967. About 280 prisoners are on Death  Row.  </P> <P> Salcido's attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, asked that sentencing be  delayed until Jan. 17 to allow time for Mexican officials to prepare a request  that Salcido's life be spared under a no-death clause in Mexico's extradition  treaty with the United States.  </P> <P> The judge delayed sentencing for an hour Monday before rejecting the motion  because Miller had not received the request.  </P> <P> Killed in the spree were Salcido's wife, Angela; their two daughters, Sophia  and Teresa; Salcido's mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards; his  sisters-in-law, Ruth Richards, 12, and Marie Richards, 8; and winery supervisor  Tracy Toovey.  </P> <P> Only his daughter, Carmina, now 4, survived the rampage.  </P></p>

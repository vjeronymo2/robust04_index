			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Strategy of expansion through profitable niches - Andrew Bolger looks at acquisitive MY Holdings A flurry of recent deals by MY Holdings marks the determination of this small company to become a significant force in the UK's highly fragmented specialist packaging sector. The Surrey-based group this year more than doubled its size, and returned to the main market from the USM, by paying up to Pounds 21m for Insight, a Kent company which makes illustrated food cartons. The Insight deal also marked a significant dilution of the controlling stake in MY held by Malbak, the South African industrial conglomerate which was recently unbundled from the Gencor mining group. MY lost its listing on the main market in 1988 after Malbak took control of the group, which at that time was still involved in making consumer goods such as bicycles and dartboards. Just as the South Africans took control, MY was hit by recession and higher than expected factory relocation costs, which caused the company to lose more than Pounds 2m in 1990. New management was brought in that year in the shape of Mr John Grainger, chairman, and Mr John Monks, chief executive. They had both held senior management positions with Norton Opax, the specialist print and packaging group which was bought by Bowater Industries in 1989 for Pounds 382m. The new team completed a process of divesting MY's non-print and packaging activities, and concentrated on cutting costs by improved financial and management controls. Debt was cut and in the half-year to February, MY made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m on sales of Pounds 19.1m. The Insight deal in February involved a Pounds 23m share placing which cut Malbak's stake from 86 to 65 per cent. The South African group is willing to see its stake diluted below the 50 per cent mark, as and when further acquisitions are funded by the issue of more shares. Mr Monks has tried to focus MY on higher-margin business in specific niches. He said: 'We are a bespoke business - we make to order.' The chief executive said Insight was the culmination of a two-year search for the right strategic acquisition. Founded in 1981 by Mr Terry Neill, the Gillingham-based business makes high-quality printed folding cartons, used mainly by the food industry. Insight claims to be market leader in those sectors where a rapid turnround of orders and 'just-in-time' delivery of orders is required. The Gillingham plant has the latest colour printing technology, computer-aided design and a fully automated warehouse. Mr Monks said the acquisition of Insight would both improve MY's profitability and enhance its reputation as a niche player. Insight's pre-tax profits nearly doubled, from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 2.04m, between 1990 and 1992, a period which saw sales rise from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 12.09m. The enlarged group is forecast this year to make pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 4m on sales in excess of Pounds 60m. Healthcare is another area which MY has identified as offering high-margin opportunities and last year it paid Pounds 1.3m for Kohler, a Portsmouth company which makes pharmaceutical cartons. In May this year the group paid Pounds 1.6m for two more businesses - Cleanprint, a Cambridgeshire company which prints patient information leaflets, and Jensa, a Bedford-based company licensed to pack pharmaceutical products. Mr Monks said: 'We are experiencing strong growth in the healthcare packaging market and these acquisitions will enable us to offer customers a wider range of products and services . . . We are continuing to seek further opportunities to offer other specialist products in this important sector.' The enlarged MY now has more than 800 employees, working from 12 sites. Although his group is dwarfed by companies such as Bowater, Mr Monks says the UK packaging industry is very fragmented - with about 3,000 companies operating in a market estimated to be worth Pounds 8.5bn annually. In common with other packaging groups, MY has been suffering from margin pressures - not least in its corrugated board packaging businesses, which remain the largest in turnover terms. But the enthusiastic Mr Monks and his team remain confident that their strategy of focusing on profitable niches will pay off. He said: 'We hope to have sales of about Pounds 200m in four years from now. It would only take one more Pounds 25m deal, with a couple of small infill acquisitions, to take us to the Pounds 100m level.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits associated with the federal proposals are described qualitatively for most ecosystem benefits. Some fish population increases were estimated and a portion of the commercial and recreational fishery benefits were monetized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The benefits of the federal proposals are an increase in biological productivity and ecosystem health for the Bay/Delta ecosystem. This increase includes protecting unique species from extinction. Bay/Delta species that currently might qualify for listing under the ESA include the longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills Roach, in addition to the already listed winter-run Chinook salmon and Delta smelt. A potential benefit of the federal proposals is that the ecosystem health might improve to the point where unlisted species need not be listed, or presently listed species could be delisted under the ESA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Well-established relationships between estuarine conditions and populations exist for many estuarine species. The extent of the low salinity habitat in the estuary is closely associated with the abundance and distribution of estuarine species at all trophic levels. Increased populations were estimated for salmon (increasing by approximately 90,000 salmon), striped bass (increasing by approximately 10 percent), and starry flounder. In addition, populations of other game species of green and white sturgeon, bay shrimp, American shad and white catfish are expected to increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A portion of these population increases will accrue to the recreational or commercial fisheries. Not less than $9&hyph;11 million annually were estimated, again with many benefits not estimated in dollar value. The majority of these gains are in the commercial salmon fishery. Employment gains in the salmon fishery were estimated to increase by 300&hyph;360 jobs annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Many other recreation activities, including hunting, boating, and nature appreciation are expected to be enhanced by the proposed regulations; however, the estimated change in participation in these activities could not be quantified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enhancing the natural environment of the Bay/Delta would have nonuse social benefits. Although these benefits could not be quantified, it is believed that they constitute the largest portion of the total value to society of implementing the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enhancing water quality in the Bay/Delta could result in other benefits associated with the avoidance of listing additional species and associated increased flexibility in water management and the avoided costs of further collapse of the ecosystem and its associated fisheries and dependent communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Costs and Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Monetized social costs and benefits of the federal proposals are not directly comparable in this analysis because some use benefits to fisheries and non-use benefits of ecological improvement and species diversity cannot be estimated. However, two conclusions can be drawn:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The implementation plan for the federal proposals has not yet been developed, thereby making it difficult to project actual levels of economic impacts. However, it is reasonable to assume that cost-effective solutions will be pursued that include a flexible approach to meeting Delta requirements. Thus, economic costs in the agricultural sector are estimated to be $20 million on average and $25 million for the urban sector. However, the overall costs may be lower than the total, given that at least some of the increases in urban costs will be payments to agriculture for water transferred. The benefits are estimated to be $10 million from improved commercial fisheries, and unquantified but important ecological, scientific, educational and existence values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Costs and benefits are difficult to compare directly in this case because of the non-marginal nature of ecosystem protection and species protection. These benefits, including preventing the extinction of several candidate or listed species and preventing the collapse of the Bay/Delta ecosystem, account for the majority of benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Given both the monetary estimates of benefits and the qualitative information on benefits not expressed in dollar value, EPA believes that the proposal can be implemented in a cost-effective manner where a healthy estuary and fisheries can co-exist with a strong agricultural and urban sector. Given all the available information, the benefits are commensurate with the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Comprehensive analyses of the incremental response of costs and benefits to marginal changes in EPA's proposed rule have not been prepared. However, EPA has developed in the draft RIA a method for roughly estimating incremental changes in economic costs based on changes in the number of days of compliance with the proposed salinity criteria at particular locations in the estuary. These estimates are based on the estimates of the flows necessary to maintain the criteria at the target locations. For example, the difference in water supply impacts between a day of protection at Chipps Island and a day of protection at the Confluence is 12,276 AF/year. These estimates of the difference in water supply impact can be compared to the dollar value of that water, which the draft RIA estimates as being $90 per AF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

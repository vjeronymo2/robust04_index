			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by the political editor: "The Road to Jerusalem is </F> Known"]    [Text] Saudi Arabia has said that it will go ahead with its  commitment to renovate and restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome  of the Rock through its existing contacts, continuous  consultations, and strong cooperation with the UNESCO.    This was announced by an official Saudi source yesterday.  These Saudi words, which are covered in the guise of Islam,  smacks of an exposed and naive political game. One would ask:  Why is there this sudden concern for Jerusalem and al-Aqsa  after forgetting them for such a long time? Are the ones who  allowed the invaders to encroach on Karbala' and al-Najaf from  their land really concerned about al-Aqsa?    The file of al-Aqsa was overlooked by the Saudi brothers for  many years, Jerusalem fell between their barrels of oil,  forgotten at the bottom of a list of Saudi Arabia's priorities.  What has changed?    The Saudi statement on the expansion work makes us wonder  about the legitimacy of such a measure. The value of al-Aqsa  lies in preserving it as it is through renovation and  restoration, not through changing its features under the pretext  of restoration and renovation.    Al-Aqsa must not be exploited for political oneupmanship,  not  through cooperation with UNESCO or coordination with OPEC. Out  of our concern for the Saudi brothers, we call on them to review  their ability in running the affairs of al-Ka'bah and the two  holy mosques.    Jerusalem has its God and men; and the Hashemites are the  ones who sacrifice their souls and money for al-Aqsa and its  restoration. The address of the bodies in charge of restoring  the holy places is well known -- they are the Jordanian Awqaf  Ministry and the Committee in charge of restoring al-Aqsa Mosque  and the Dome of the Rock.</p>

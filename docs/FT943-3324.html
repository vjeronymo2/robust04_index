			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US data provide support to late closing bourses Markets took a waiting brief during the morning ahead of the release of the US CPI data, which encouraged their performance in the afternoon. FRANKFURT reacted to the US data with a modest gain in the post-bourse after falling back nearly 1 per cent during the session. However, brokers commented that investors remained nervous, illustrated by the low trading volume. The Dax index retreated 18.52 to 2,136.09. In the post-bourse, the Ibis indicated index moved to 2,144.56. Turnover totalled DM5.4bn. Aside from the economic news there was little else to stimulate activity. Bayerische Hypo Bank, which announced the price for its one-for-10 capital increase at DM350, lost DM6.30 at DM403.20. Bayer was down a further DM3.20 at DM365.30 following news on Monday of its purchase of Sterling Drug's North American over-the-counter pharmaceuticals business. AMSTERDAM moved slightly higher, the AEX index finishing at 412.69, a gain on the session of 0.88. Gist-Brocades, the consumer goods group, which had been downgraded to hold by James Capel on Monday, added 90 cents at Fl 45.10, in line with the market trend. Capel explained that after three years of strong profits growth - 23 per cent on average - the 9.9 per cent first-half figures disappointed investors. Capel lowered its net profits growth forecast from 15 per cent to 10 per cent annually which, due to stock option dividends, would translate as an annual increase in earnings per share of 6.5 per cent. PARIS was another market to turn from a weak morning to strength in the afternoon. The CAC-40 index finished 2.57 up at 1,969.36, having been off nearly 1.5 per cent during the early part of the day. Turnover was some FFr3bn. Legrand was one of the most popular stocks, gaining FFr240 at FFr6,670 after forecasting a 30 per cent rise in profits for the full year. MILAN picked up late in the day, helped by the US data and the outcome of talks between Mr Silvio Berlusconi and union representatives on reform of the pension system. The Comit index was flat, finishing 0.64 lower at 648.19, while the real time Mibtel index picked up from a day's low of 10,312 to finish 28 ahead at 10,429. Olivetti reversed recent falls with a L36, or 1.8 per cent, advance to L1,986 and Credito Italiano picked up L95, or 4.6 per cent, to L2,140, although dealers said there was no news to explain the rise. Ferruzzi fell L50, or 3.1 per cent, to L1,565 in the wake of moves by the Ferruzzi family to contest decisions made at the August 1993 shareholders' meeting on the accounts, and speculation about a capital increase. In the telecommunications sector, Telecom Italia rose L40 to L4,330, but the holding company Stet eased L15 to L4,625 after Mr Michele Tedeschi, chairman of state industrial holding company IRI, said that a first tranche of the state-owned telecommunications sector should be sold by the end of the year. ZURICH rebounded after early weakness, the SMI index picking up from a low of 2,624.3 to finish 15.8 higher at 2,658.8, with the strengthening dollar providing additional support. Banks led the market higher. CS Holding rose SFr12 to SFr567, still benefiting from its decision to withdraw its offer for Austria's Creditanstalt-Bankverein. UBS bearers rose SFr15 to SFr1,220, and among the insurers, Zurich added SFr16 at SFr1,279. Nestle rose SFr19 to SFr1,236 ahead of tomorrow's results: analysts are expecting a modest increase in first-half profits but forecast that second-half earnings should surge due to the capital gain from selling its L'Oreal distributorships to L'Oreal. The pharmaceuticals sector was mixed, Roche certificates rising SFr40 to SFr6,225 but Sandoz losing SFr6 at SFr700. STOCKHOLM was supported by a stronger crown, a more stable debt market and the US CPI figures. The Affarsvarlden index put on 3.9 at 1,454.2. The banking and insurance sector climbed almost 3 per cent. S-E-Banken's 'A' shares advanced SKr1.70 to SKr46.20, while Handelsbanken 'A' rose SKr2 to SKr101. NCC 'B' was up SKr3.50 at SKr63 after the construction group said it had sold its entire stake of 25.7m shares in the British-Swedish stainless steelmaker Avesta Sheffield to BZW, giving it a capital gain of about SKr1.2bn. MADRID reacted wildly first to higher than expected inflation figures in Spain which triggered early losses, and then to the US's CPI data which caused a rebound. At the end of the day, the general index was ahead 3.10, or 1 per cent, at 301.82 on a turnover of Pta31.16bn. Dealers said stocks with ADRs performed well in the afternoon session and there was also strong buying in the banks. Among the banks, Santander added Pta60 at Pta5,180 and Argentaria put on Pta240 at Pta5,450.

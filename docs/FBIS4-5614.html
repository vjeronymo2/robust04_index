			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Be Afraid of Dialogue on Japan-U.S. </F> Security"]    [Text] A supposedly nightmarish scenario is being talked  about by Diet members and government officials. The scenario is  that trade frictions between Japan and the United States go from  bad to worse and that the two countries square off not only on  trade but also in other fields as well. The opinion gains  ground in the United States that Japan has been getting a free  ride on defense from the United States and that there is no need  to protect such a country. Animosity becomes mutual.  Nationalistic sentiment gains the upper hand in Japan as well.  The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is discussed simply on an  emotional plane, resulting in dire consequences, the scenario  goes.    The Japanese Government thinks that strains between the two  countries should by all means be confined to trade alone. It is  so worried as to be very jittery about their spreading to  security issues.    Inasmuch as the cold war has ended and the U.S. security  strategy toward Japan based on the perceived threat from the  Soviet Union has changed, however, a fresh study should be  conducted as to whether the security arrangements between Japan  and the United States ought to remain as they are, regardless of  the direction that trade problems take.    In a recent book, George Kennan, a former U.S. diplomat who  has closely watched the world for the 50 years since World War  II, writes about Japan-U.S. relations that, with the end of the  cold war, the initial raison d'etre for the present defense  agreements has been lost. (It should not be forgotten, though,  that some remain as long as the problem of North Korea's effort  to develop nuclear weapons is not solved.) Kennan says that,  being a layman, he does not know whether the Japanese Government  wants to retain these military agreements unchanged. If it does  not, there is no clear reason for keeping them in the present  form, he says. The United States should willingly accept their  abrogation or revision, Kennan says.    The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and its ancillary agreements  are products of a bipolar world centered on the United States  and the former Soviet Union. Consequently, although problems  may remain on the Korean peninsula, the end of the cold war made  the original reasons for their existence irrelevant, as Kennan  says. In discussing the security arrangements, both the  proponents and the opponents of the maintenance of those  arrangements should start by facing up to that fact.    When the reason for the existence of something disappears or  changes, normally a fresh look is taken at its continuation.    That ought to be true of our security treaty as well.  Because the biggest country targeted militarily by that treaty  has collapsed, the first question that must be asked is what is  the target of the treaty. The question is whether the target is  still the former Soviet Union or new threats from some other  countries, and how far Japan and the United States should go in  taking joint action against that threat.    As far as is known from the United States' new international  strategy, U.S. military interest has shifted from the former  Soviet Union to various regional conflicts. In particular, the  new focal points are the Middle East (especially Iraq) and Asia  (notably North Korea).    The role played by the U.S. troops in Japan has also  changed.  Greater importance is being attached to their role of military  logistical support for dealing with regional conflicts, rather  than as the forward base closest to the Soviet Union and the  defense of Japan in case of possible contingencies in this  country. In fact, the U.S. Forces in Japan played a major part  in the Persian Gulf war.    The center of gravity of our security treaty has shifted. It  seems that security in the countries of Asia and the Middle East  has assumed greater importance, taking up the slack in the  security needs of Japan. Also, the regions that have newly  assumed importance include some areas to which the security  treaty did not give any consideration at all when it was signed.    The Japanese and U.S. Governments should grope for a new  framework for security in Asia after making clear how the  picture has changed. Otherwise, the theory of "Japan getting a  free ride" that is now held by some Americans will gain momentum  and could lead to a depth of irreparable misunderstanding before  we are aware of it.</p>

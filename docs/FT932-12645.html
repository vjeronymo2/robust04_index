			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report SEVERAL BASE metals tested overhead resistance levels yesterday and although the barriers were not breached further assaults were likely in the immediate future, London Metal Exchange traders said. The three months COPPER contract was twice driven up towards its Dollars 1,920-a-tonne target and held at that level at the second attempt to register a gain at the kerb close of Dollars 28 from Friday. Dealers noted narrowing forward premiums had aided the bounce from recent lows, and some were beginning to talk about possible supply disruption associated with forthcoming labour contract negotiations in Chile and the US. Three months ZINC moved up with copper to end at Dollars 1,028 a tonne, up Dollars 2. NICKEL's rally was halted, however, after the three months price had added nearly Dollars 70 to last week's Dollars 235 upsurge. Having failed to break through strong resistance the price subsided to finish little changed at Dollars 6,170 a tonne. London robusta COFFEE prices regained last week's losses as the New York arabica market gave the lead. But sterling's strength kept COCOA under pressure. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program] </F>   [Text] Voting at various polling stations has not gone as  smoothly as intended. The latest on the conducting of special  voting in the Northern Transvaal is that voting materials are  being delivered to polling stations in drips and drabs.  District voting officials have complained that voting material,  such as ballot papers and marking ink, are being delivered at  random and at the wrong points.    Meanwhile, the situation at several polling stations in  Natal  is reported to be chaotic. A short while ago officials at  Newcastle appeared to have no idea where their ballot papers and  equipment were. And in Durban's Wentworth hospital no votes  were cast a few hours after the official starting time. The IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] ascribed part of the delay to  a sit-in in its offices last night by members of a voter  education organization. The IEC says it will try to iron out all  of the problems today to ensure a smooth run tomorrow.</p>

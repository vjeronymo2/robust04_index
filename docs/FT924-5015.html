			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home loans under fire - Centralised lenders fail to keep up with base rate cuts WHILE most home-owners are pleased that interest rates are coming down, those who have mortgages with centralised lenders are less happy. They are paying up to two percentage points more than other mortgage-holders. Existing borrowers with National Home Loans, for example, are paying 12.15 per cent compared with between 9.95-9.99 per cent for their counterparts at most banks and building societies. Some borrowers at First Mortgage Securities are paying 11.65 per cent, while those with Household Mortgage Corporation and Mortgages plc (formerly CIBC) are paying 11.45. Rates at the Mortgage Corporation are 10.99, while UCB's existing borrowers, who are also paying 10.99 will see a reduction to 9.79 per cent next week. Most of these rates will be coming down soon - in many cases, by well over 1.5 points. First Mortgage Securities, for instance, is cutting the rate for existing borrowers to 9.65 per cent on January 1, and to 8.65 from February 1. The Mortgage Corporation will bring down its rate to 9.5 fron January 1. Despite the projected cuts, many borrowers with the centralised lenders will still be paying higher rates than those with most banks and building societies. The latter, in most cases, will pay about 8.5 per cent between mid-December to the beginning of January. One reason for the higher rates charged by centralised lenders is the way their loans are funded. Unlike banks and societies, which take in money from savers and lend to home-owners, they get their funds by borrowing on the wholesale money markets. Most use the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) to determine what they charge mortgage-holders and argue that, unlike banks and building societies, they cannot react quickly to sudden base rate cuts since they buy money forward. 'We don't have 8m savers whom we can immediately penalise in order to cut mortgage rates,' said Barry Meeks, commercial director of The Mortgage Corporation. 'If the base rate is cut today, it does not filter through to our cost of funds for three months.' The centralised lenders emerged in the mid-1980s when property prices were moving up rapidly and demand for mortgages from prospective house-buyers was insatiable. They were able to undercut the banks and building societies because the Libor then was lower than base rates. To gain market share they brought in new products, such as deferred payment loans, and were happy to take on borrowers who could not prove their income. Within a few years, their market share rose to 20 per cent - but this form of market-driven, imprudent lending has resulted in tears. The fall in house prices and the recession have blackened the books of some of the centralised lenders, and a fall in credit-worthiness means that they cannot borrow on terms as favourable as the top grade banks and societies. The property slump and a rise in repossessions also mean some of the centralised lenders cannot afford to take on new business, although others are operating profitably and are marketing fixed and capped rate mortgages to attract custom. Adrian Coles, of the Building Societies Association, advises those who are paying above market rates for their mortgage to examine the costs of shifting to another lender. Re-mortgaging is an expensive business, particularly for those tied into a fixed rate loan, but it might be the best option in the long term. Chase de Vere, the London-based mortgage broker, will work out the costs and savings of switching to a lower rate scheme without charge.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report in the "Georgia" column] </F>   [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze has signed a special edict  whereby within the next few days a reorganization in the  Georgian head of state's apparatus is to begin. On 8 June,  Chief of Staff Vazha Lordkipanidze told a news conference that  the number of apparatus staff will be cut by one-third, with all  the subdivisions moving over to a contract system. At present  approximately 130 people work in the apparatus. Cadre selection  is done in accordance with two main criteria: high  professionalism and moral integrity, regardless of affiliation  with any political party or public movement. Lordkipanidze  denied allegations by a number of parliamentarians that the  apparatus' hard currency spending for foreign trips is double  that of analogous parliament bills. "In accordance with a  memorandum by the Georgian Finance Ministry," he said, "in 1994  the apparatus spent $11,000 for these purposes, while parliament  spent $12,600." The Georgian head of state's chief of staff  also stated that contrary to some perceptions, the apparatus has  never been bloated but corresponded to international standards  and proportions. Moreover, Lordkipanidze said the presidential  apparatuses in countries the same size as Georgia number on  average up to 500 officers.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods Attwoods' white knight entered from stage right, strutted on the scene for less than five hours and promptly exited stage left. Yesterday's intervention by Ikotek, an unknown subsidiary of an obscure Canadian company, proved irrelevant: shareholders controlling substantially less than 1 per cent of Attwoods' equity withdrew from initial acceptance of Browning-Ferris Industries' offer. Once BFI had raised its offer last month, Attwoods was left defending the indefensible. From the start, Attwoods' management admitted the powerful industrial logic behind combining the two businesses. Its only strategy was to complain about the price. Attwoods insisted shareholders would receive more if the company were broken up. However, it gave no figure for the break-up value or names of companies interested in buying a piece. Worse, there was no guarantee that the scheme would actually be implemented. Given the choice between a promised break-up in six months and cash today, the decision by the majority of shareholders to accept BFI's finely priced offer was not a surprise. The task before Attwoods' advisers was not easy and they may console themselves that at least BFI was forced to raise its offer. However, the combination of SG Warburg and Robert Fleming is clearly an unlucky one. It is the same that advised Enterprise on its disastrous bid for Lasmo.</p>

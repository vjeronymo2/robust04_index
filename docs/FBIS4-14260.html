			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombo, April 28 (AFP) -- Sri Lankan authorities  released an Egypt-bound cargo of chemicals detained at the main  port here on suspicion that it could be used to make nerve gas,  officials said Thursday [28 April].    The three containers of phosporous pentasulphide arrived  here  four weeks ago from the Indian port of Bombay for transshipment  to a consignee in Egypt, port officials said.    The Defence Ministry ordered the containers to be released  this week following investigations regarding the end use of the  cargo. The chemical is used to make pesticides and is also an  ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas.    The Egyptian embassy in Colombo had informed the authorities  that the cargo was intended for the legitimate use of one of its  chemical plants, the Dyestuffs and Chemicals of Kafar Dawar.</p>

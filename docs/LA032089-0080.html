			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Venture in Vietnam: Summa Bank of Indonesia is about to become the first  foreign bank to set up operations in Vietnam since 1975, when the Hanoi-based  Communist regime took over South Vietnam and foreign businesses withdrew.  </P> <P> Summa will form a joint venture with the Ho Chi Minh City-based Bank for  Industry and Trade, which was founded in 1987 as Vietnam's first commercial  bank operating without direct government control.  </P> <P> These developments follow banking reforms introduced by the Communist  government as part of radical plans launched in 1986 to open up the economy and  encourage the private sector. New banking regulations are being considered to  liberalize the internal banking system, and regulations for foreign joint  ventures have been finalized.  </P> <P> Various foreign banks are discussing different types of operation, although  there is no sign yet of any of them opening a full branch. Several are just  sending executives into the country on visits until they see how fast the  economy can open up.  </P> <P> Summa is expected to put up 90% of the initial capital of $10 million. The  remainder will come from BIT. There are to be two Vietnamese representatives on  the board, including the chairman, plus three from Indonesia. Summa will  provide the director general.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- "Russia and Germany are  currently going through the process of renewal, which, despite  many differences, have much in common. In particular, this  concerns Eastern Germany, which offers broad opportunities for  cooperation and interaction," said visiting Chairman of the  Russian State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, addressing representatives of  the Berlin parliamentary assembly in the "Charlottenburg" Castle  in Berlin on Sunday.    Rybkin expressed his gratitude for the warm and friendly  welcome given to the Russian delegation, saying that "during the  period of uneasy economic transformations in Russia cooperation  with Germany is of great importance."    Deputy chairman of the Berlin assembly of lawmakers,  Reinhard  Fuerer, said that Germany regards the visit by the Russian  delegation as a contribution to the development of existing  contacts and the beginning of new contacts between the two  countries at a parliamentary level. "Tremendous changes are  taking place both in Russia and in Germany. The Russian  Federation has achieved considerable progress on the way to  democracy. This is worthy of praise even more, taking into  account a complex process of reforms in the country's economy  which, at times, poses serious problems to the population.  However, these problems and additional hardships should not be  used as a pretext for going back on the process of  democratisation," the deputy chairman of the Berlin assembly  said.    He pointed out that Russia should take a firm place in free  europe. "Russia is doing so by taking an active part in U.N.  peace- keeping actions. Such efforts arouse respect all over  the world, the German lawmaker said.    The chairman of the Russia State Duma made an entry in  Berlin's "gold book".</p>

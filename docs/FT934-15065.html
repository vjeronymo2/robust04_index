			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (5): A lacklustre performance - Measures to cool down China's economy and avoid a deficit are dampening exports AFTER more than a decade of spectacular results on the trade front, China is coming down to earth as it faces the threat of a trade deficit for 1993 caused by an import binge fuelling its overheating economy. Chinese officials say they will bring trade into balance by the end of the year, averting the first deficit since 1989. Figures for the eight months to August suggest they will have their work cut out. China's trade deficit grew 27 per cent to Dollars 5.73bn by the end of August, with imports soaring Dollars 58.14bn and exports climbing only 4 per cent to Dollars 52.41bn. This compares with a trade surplus of more than Dollars 4bn in 1992. But the Chinese leadership, which introduced a stabilisation programme in mid-year to cool the economy, can take comfort from the fact that since 1979, when it launched its reform programme, exports have increased ninefold and imports eightfold. In 1980, exports were about Dollars 18bn - less than 1 per cent of world trade and just 4 per cent of gross domestic product. This year China wants to be among the 'Top 10' trading nations, with more than 2 per cent of world trade and exports representing about 20 per cent of GDP, although earlier predictions that exports would exceed Dollars 100bn are unlikely to be fulfilled. Among the reasons for China's lacklustre export performance this year is the fact that a booming domestic market has proved more appealing for many potential exporters. The diversion of investment funds away from export-generating activities to the 'hot money' areas of real estate and currency speculation is another factor. Further, inflation of more than 20 per cent in urban centres has pushed up costs, making certain categories of exports less competitive. The World Bank, in its annual study of the Chinese economy, found massive growth in fixed investment pushed up prices of raw materials at a rate of nearly 40 per cent in the early part of this year. Excess demand had created bottlenecks in transport and energy supplies - factors which hindered China's export performance. One of the main targets of China's recent reforms, spearheaded by tough economic czar Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy, has been to rein in speculative activities and give more weight to infrastructure development and export-generating industries. The other burning issue for China - and for the west, which has an acute interest in liberalisation of Chinese trade - is Beijing's step towards re-joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Progress is slow, not only because China has a long way to go before it can be deemed 'Gatt-consistent', but also because the west wants to ensure that a new trade juggernaut in its midst has to play by the rules. The World Bank study exposes the task confronting China in its efforts to conform with the minimum standards required by Gatt signatories as far as tariff and non-tariff barriers are concerned. For example, in 1992 more than 50 per cent of China's imports were subject to some form of non-tariff administrative control. China's tariffs, according to the World Bank, remain higher, more numerous and more dispersed than most other large developing countries, with 69 rates and a standard deviation of 30 per cent, compared with 34 rates and 17 per cent for Brazil at an identical average tariff rate. Other hold-ups to China's Gatt entry include its managed multi-tiered exchange rate regime. Beijing has taken several important steps towards making the renminbi more freely convertible, but its quota system of foreign exchange allocation through Foreign Exchange Adjustment Centres is subject to manipulation by the authorities to the detriment of a freer trading environment. China's anxiety over its entry to Gatt and its annual securing of Most Favoured Nation trading status underscore its growing dependence on the world economy. China has much to gain from a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round which, the World Bank says, could reduce protection levels in the European Commission, the US and Japan by up to 50 per cent. In that case, the study says, China's exports would increase by an estimated 38 per cent or Dollars 11.4bn in 1988 prices, partly due to the relatively high share of textiles and clothing products in its total exports. Conversely, China stands to lose much by removal of MFN and is likely to try to satisfy requirements for renewal next year on the human rights front and by continuing to improve market access and render its trade regulations less opaque. Loss of MFN after June 1994, the bank says, would mean China's annual export losses to the US would range from 42 to 96 per cent (Dollars 7bn to Dollars 15.2bn). 'On the whole, it appears that the dislocation of trade flows likely to result from the withdrawal of China's MFN status by the US would range from the dramatic to the disastrous,' the World Bank says. The US market, where China enjoys a huge surplus, is critical to its plans to raise exports. Its surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 18bn last year and hit Dollars 9.49bn in the first half of this year.</p>

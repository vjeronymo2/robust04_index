			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURERS CUT BACK ON MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: HMOS AND OTHER PLANS ARE DECIDING WHO REALLY NEEDS THERAPY AND FOR HOW  LONG.  </P> <P> Marilyn came in from the rain but sat at home in her coat for three hours. She  was paralyzed with anguish over a sick child who had been hospitalized.  </P> <P> Often overwhelmed by the problems of parenthood, she had seen a psychologist  last fall and winter and believed that he could help her cope with this latest  crisis. But Marilyn's health maintenance organization won't pay for her to  visits to that psychologist any more, and she can't afford to pay the whole  bill.  </P> <P> In fact, she is stuck with several hundred dollars' worth of bills for previous  visits that may not be paid either, despite many frustrating calls to the HMO.  </P> <P> "It's like beating your head against a wall," said Marilyn, who did not want  her real name used. "It's the most horrible thing."  </P> <P> Many users of mental health services are quickly learning that insurance  companies and HMOs, under pressure from employers trying to cut costs, more and  more are calling the shots. They are trying to reduce spending on therapy for  people such as Marilyn, as well as for those seeking help for alcoholism and  other drug abuse problems.  </P> <P> For many years, insurers have tried to limit hospital stays, which typically  cost between $350 and $700 a day. Now the focus is also on the cost of office  visits to psychiatrists, who charge $100 an hour and up, and psychologists,  whose fees run to $95 an hour.  </P> <P> Some patients tell of their insurers curtailing benefits, delaying payments for  months and leaving them in a stressful limbo, not knowing if coverage will  continue.  </P> <P> And doctors and psychologists say that patients are often not getting the type  or duration of treatment they need because of HMO rules. Some people, deterred  by HMO screening procedures, are not seeking help at all, they say.  </P> <P> "It's a disaster," said Dr. James Bozzuto, a Hartford psychiatrist and  assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut.  </P> <P> "HMOs are involved in the rape of the mentally ill in a way that hasn't been  done since the turn of the century," said Bozzuto, who is under contract with  Cigna Healthplan of Connecticut Inc., an HMO.  </P> <P> Michael Kahn, a professor of psychology at University of Hartford who has a  private practice, said: "These organizations set up machinery to discourage  both the provider and the consumer from getting the quality of service that's  needed. Many patients deny (that they have a) problem. If machinery is set up  to discourage people, they'll happily fold their tents and go away."  </P> <P> The HMOs and other insurers that offer coverage for prepaid fees say they are  cutting out needless spending in the fastest growing segment of employers'  health-care costs. They say they are improving the quality of mental care by  channeling people into appropriate treatment. They say they are protecting them  from overkill and dependency on therapists.  </P> <P> The companies have hired mental health professionals to decide whether people  seeking such treatment really need it, who will provide the treatment and for  how long. Some have changed their rules on payment to discourage what they  regard as unneeded treatment.  </P> <P> Cigna Healthplan this year further restricted the way its members can get such  help by narrowing the choice of therapists and tightening control over duration  of therapy. Scores of patients had to switch therapists or face paying the  whole bill themselves.  </P> <P> Travelers Corp. has introduced in five cities an employer plan that will  require employees seeking therapy to be evaluated in person by a representative  of the insurer.  </P> <P> Under the Psychiatric Systems Initiative program, Travelers refers people to  therapists who are members of its own network. The company avoids using  therapists it believes provide treatment when it is not needed, and expects the  program to cut employers' costs for mental health care and substance abuse  treatment between 5% and 35%.  </P> <P> Aetna Life Insurance Co., one of the first insurers to limit psychiatric  hospital stays, last year bought Human Affairs International Inc. to improve  its ability to review all types of mental claims.  </P> <P> Constitution Health Network, an HMO, stopped giving members their first 10  mental health sessions free, hoping to discourage unneeded therapy. The HMO  wanted to avoid paying for counseling for stress that might be alleviated  through changing jobs, exercising or a "change of perspective on the  situation," spokeswoman Leslie Wright said.  </P> <P> The HMO now requires members to pay 50% of all mental health visits, up to $40  a visit.  </P> <P> The efforts to curb these costs are being spurred by employers who see group  medical coverage costs skyrocketing and decide what benefits they want to  offer, said Dr. Richard Kunnes, a psychiatrist and medical director for product  management and development at Travelers Corp.  </P> <P> "The whole area of psychiatric care and substance abuse is an explosive area"  of group insurance, Kunnes said. "I think most companies are scared to death by  the whole problem."  </P> <P> Insurers say that U.S. employers spend up to 30% of their health-care dollars  on mental health and substance abuse treatment for employees, compared to 6%  five years ago. The industry, however, doesn't keep data on how much insurers  are paying out.  </P> <P> While the overall cost of medical claims rose 18.6% for U.S. employers in 1987  and 1988, the cost of substance abuse treatment and other mental care climbed  27%, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> Many insurers believe that these claims are rising because therapy has become  socially acceptable. "Yesterday's stigma is today's red badge of courage,"  Aetna's public relations material reads. "Now, a generation of baby-boomers  willingly seeks professional help for a variety of life's problems."  </P> <P> To curb these costs, most HMOs now offer only the minimum mental health  coverage required by state law. Conventional insurance plans may provide more  coverage if the employer so desires.  </P> <P> Yet decisions about what treatment is necessary are often subjective, and the  penny-pinching by insurers and HMOs may backfire, critics say.  </P> <P> An HMO or insurer should pay at least $5,000 a year for outpatient mental  health care to avoid more serious and costly problems later, advises Lafe H.  Myers, medical director of mental health services at Aetna Life, which has  interests in HMOs nationwide.  </P> <P> In controlling the expenses of general medical claims, insurers and HMOs in the  past have applied objective medical criteria, but the definition of mental  health is largely subjective, Bozzuto said. "HMOs have learned the game of  making believe mental illness doesn't exist."  </P> <P> Cigna, Aetna and others, however, said they use American Psychiatric Assn.  criteria in assessing diagnoses to determine how much treatment they will pay  for. The companies said that their own mental health professionals often  negotiate treatment with the patients' therapists.  </P> <P> Yet many people complain about the way an HMO will authorize a certain number  of therapy sessions, and no more, according to the diagnosis.  </P> <P> People build up patterns of behavior and emotions over a lifetime, said one  Cigna Healthplan member who was in therapy. "I think it's ridiculous to assume  you're going to handle this in two sessions, or nine, or whatever," she said.  </P> <P> Cigna Healthplan has been the most aggressive HMO in efforts to reduce mental  health claims. Previously, Cigna had informal arrangements with dozens of  psychologists whom it paid to treat members referred by their medical doctors.  The HMO dropped that system this year and now has formal contracts with  psychological clinics and independent psychologists. Cigna kept its contracts  with psychiatrists.  </P> <P> For people whose therapists were dropped, Cigna Healthplan paid for transition  sessions so patients could see them a few more times before switching to  HMO-sanctioned therapists.  </P> <P> Now, members who feel they need counseling must be screened and referred.  </P></p>

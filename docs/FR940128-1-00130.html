Pasteurization is a process applied to a fish or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery product after that fish or fishery product has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed in a final, hermetically sealed package. The process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves the application of sufficient heat (or other processes)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a sufficient time to cause the reduction of microorganisms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health concern to levels that, under normal conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage, are unlikely to cause disease.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  type E is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a pathogenic microorganism that may be found in fish and fishery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the growth of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum. C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  type E can grow and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (38  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F), and must,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, be eliminated from the hermetically sealed container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the pasteurization process. Pasteurized products that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stored, distributed, and displayed in the frozen state, and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so labeled, are not similarly at risk, and need not be subjected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the constraints of these control measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For there to be assurance that the pasteurization step  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively eliminates the microorganisms of public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> C. botulinum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  type E), a minimum acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process should be scientifically established. This requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expert knowledge of thermal process calculations. Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in establishing the minimum thermal process should be those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are generally recognized and accepted. Sometimes, thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death time, heat penetration, and inoculated pack studies will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to establish the minimum process. In other instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing literature is sufficient to provide the processor with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In either case, characteristics of the process and/or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product will necessarily affect the ability of the cook step to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively eliminate the microorganisms of public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance. Such factors should be considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment of the process. Where control of those factors is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to consistently achieve that goal, the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority should specify these to the processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is necessary that the pasteurizing equipment be designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and operated so that every unit of product receives the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established minimum process. This will require that a competent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process authority, who is thoroughly familiar with the dynamics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of heat transfer in processing equipment, evaluate the design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the type of equipment used by the processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sometimes temperature distribution studies will be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing literature will be sufficient to establish the adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Control Point: Pasteurization Control Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Make sure that the pasteurization process that is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used was designed to ensure an appropriate reduction in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of viable microorganisms of public health concern. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of the pasteurization process should be established by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process authority. The pasteurization process that is being used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should meet any factors of the process or of the product that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified by the process authority as critical to achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogen destruction. At a minimum, these critical factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should include pasteurizing times and temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Make sure that the pasteurization equipment being used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is properly designed and operated to deliver the process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the process authority. The engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications of the equipment being used (e.g., pipe sizes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow rates, loading pattern) should meet or exceed that of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment evaluated by a process authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Deliver the pasteurization process in a way that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no deviation from the minimum established pasteurization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Monitor the pasteurization temperature with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature recording device (i.e., temperature recorder). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature recorder should be installed where it can be easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> read and the sensor for the device should be installed to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it accurately measures the coldest temperature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurizing equipment. The temperature recorder must show a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous record of the process. Computerized storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature data may be used for a temperature recorder chart if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be equivalent to the use of a temperature recorder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Check the accuracy of each temperature recorder at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning and end of each production day and adjust it as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to agree as nearly as possible with a temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating device (mercury-in-glass thermometer or equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device). The thermometer should be installed where it can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily read and placed to ensure that it accurately measures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coldest temperature of the pasteurizing equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Calibrate the thermometer at the pasteurizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature against an accurate standard thermometer. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be done when the thermometer is installed and at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once a year after that, or more frequently, if necessary, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure its accuracy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Monitor the length of the pasteurization cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Monitor other critical factors (e.g., initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, container size, product formulation) at the start of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each shift or when the product changes during a shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BYRDS TURN ON THE OLD MEMORY MACHINE  </P> <P> Byrds watchers certainly got their memories' worth Wednesday night at the Coach  House in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The brief, three-city Byrds mini-reunion tour -- which concludes tonight at the  sold-out Ventura Theatre in Ventura -- was prompted more by legal reasons than  sentimental ones.  </P> <P> Three of the original members -- Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman  -- are doing the shows to establish their legal right to the group name, thus  preventing anyone else (including other original members, Gene Clark and  Michael Clarke) from calling themselves the Byrds.  </P> <P> Once they took the stage, however, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman were  enthusiastic musicians, not legal strategists, and it was hard to imagine  anyone who was ever touched by the Byrds' music not being moved.  </P> <P> In their first formal concert appearance together in 15 years, the threesome  (backed by drummer Steve Duncan and guitarist John Jorgenson from Hillman's  Desert Rose Band) played with a spirit and desire that kept the evening from  turning into merely a casual exercise in nostalgia.  </P> <P> The material ranged from endearing versions of some of the Byrds' most famous  numbers -- from Bob Dylan songs such as "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "My Back  Pages" to such originals as "Mr. Spaceman" and "Eight Miles High."  </P> <P> In between, McGuinn and Crosby -- especially -- reminisced good-naturedly about  the old days, including how they happened to write or record some of the key  numbers, Crosby admitting he hated "Mr. Tambourine Man" the first time he heard  it.  </P> <P> Though the Byrds have often been saluted for their musical innovations (the  wonderfully appealing, guitar-accented blend of country, folk and rock  strains), the musicians also played a major role in the '60s in making rock 'n'  roll safe for serious themes.  </P> <P> For the most part, they leaned toward material that deserved to be called  artful -- though no one at the time took rock seriously enough to even think of  applying that term to anything that appeared on a 45-rpm single.  </P> <P> Nearly three decades later, the songs -- which reflect on personal and social  concerns -- take on an even more poignant and graceful ring for longtime Byrds  fans, because they can be viewed in the wider context of changes in both the  fans' lives and in the lives of the musicians themselves.  </P> <P> Consider "Mr. Tambourine Man," the group's first (1965) hit:  </P> <P> Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me  </P> <P>  I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to  </P> <P>  Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me  </P> <P>  In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.  </P> <P>  It's easy to see now that the Byrds were pop tambourine men themselves. The  guitars had a jingle-jangle flavor, and there was a sense of adventure in the  songs and in the disarming harmonies that made the Byrds seem to be leading you  on a journey as magical at times as the one offered by the Beatles.  </P> <P> But it was equally affecting Wednesday to hear the trio sing "Chimes of  Freedom," another Dylan song from the Byrds' first album:  </P> <P>  Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  </P> <P>  For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  </P> <P>  An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  </P> <P>  ... we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  </P> <P>  Unlike the youthful optimism of "Tambourine Man," this song is a salute to  survival -- a tune that seemed a fitting tribute to the way McGuinn, Crosby and  Hillman have survived with their musical integrity and determination intact.  </P> <P> McGuinn was the primary force behind the Byrds, and he led the band with  distinction until 1973, bringing in worthy new musicians (including Clarence  White and Gram Parsons) to replace those who had left. After the Byrds, Hillman  went on to be a valuable figure in several other teamings, including the Flying  Burrito Brothers and, now, Desert Rose.  </P> <P> Crosby has probably enjoyed the most success (as part of Crosby, Stills, Nash  and Young) and notoriety (the much publicized drug-related personal problems  that landed him in a Texas prison a few years ago). He has rebounded in recent  months with a new CSNY album, an acclaimed autobiography and a solo album that  is due to be released at the end of the month.  </P> <P> For Gary Bagnall, 31, seeing them together again was a dream come true.  </P> <P> "The Byrds were just a generation ahead of me," said the Costa Mesa animal  importer before the concert. "I've always loved their music, but I never saw  them live and I didn't think they'd ever get together again. So, I couldn't  believe it when I saw the ad. I went straight to the phone to make  reservations."  </P> <P> Mark Cobb, 34, San Clemente, was especially eager to see Crosby, whom he sees  as an inspiring survivor.  </P> <P> "I like the Byrds music, but Crosby is special. . . . It's an inspiration to  see how he has pulled himself out of all that."  </P> <P> After the concert, the musicians seemed equally excited.  </P> <P> "It felt great," said McGuinn, standing in the club's upstairs dressing room.  "We only had one day's rehearsal and you never know how it's going to be. You  can't assume it's going to sound good just because it did years ago. But it  felt right almost immediately."  </P> <P> Added Crosby, "We came off the stage laughing and hugging each other. When we  got together (for a 15-minute set last summer) at the Wiltern Theatre, it made  me realize how much fun it is to sing with these guys."  </P> <P> They haven't thought about more than this week's three shows, but Crosby and  McGuinn seemed so enthused by the concert that they weren't ruling out doing  additional dates.  </P> <P> One additional appearance is certain.  </P> <P> Because the debut album was released 25 years ago, the Byrds are eligible to be  inducted next year in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- and their election is a  cinch.  </P> <P> "That's another reason to get this name settled," Hillman said. "I'd hate to  see 29 guys stand up (when they call the Byrds name)."  </P></p>

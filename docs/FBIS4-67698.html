			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Health Programs Approved"; first paragraph is </F> editorial introduction]    [Text] Guayaquil -- Dengue fever has been reported in the  Ayacucho, Ximena, Tarqui, and Febres Cordero areas of Guayaquil.  Heavy rains are falling on the city and the neighboring  countryside, although the Office of Civil Defense of the  Province of Guayas has not reported serious damage from the  downpour of 9 February.    Health authorities in the City of Guayaquil are combining  their efforts to prevent and fight against endemic diseases such  as hemorrhagic dengue fever, malaria, and cholera, among other  illnesses.    Furthermore, efforts are being made to avoid the duplication  of effort, the waste of materials, and squandering of human and  financial resources.    On 9 February technically qualified persons, including Liria  Mendoza, subsecretary of health, and officials of the municipal  health service, reviewed the situation at a meeting held at the  Municipal Offices of Guayaquil. The meeting was presided over by  Luis Chiriboga, vice president of the Municipal Council of  Guayaquil.    The meeting became necessary due to an outbreak of classic  dengue fever and an increase in malaria in several outlying  areas of the city.    Cases of dengue fever have been reported in the densely  populated areas of Ayacucho, Ximena, Tarqui, and Febres Cordero,  with 94, 343, 133, and 249 persons affected, respectively.    Regarding malaria, more than 500 persons have been reported  as suffering from the disease in the Flor de Bastion area, a  heavily populated section North of Guayaquil.    The persons affected by malaria are receiving specialized  medical care, and no deaths have been reported so far, nor has  any case of hemorrhagic dengue fever been recorded.    At the same time heavy rains are falling on Guayaquil and  the  surrounding province, although, according to the Office of Civil  Defense of the Province of Guayas, no substantial damage has  been reported, following the downpour of rain on 9 February.    The regions most affected by the diseases are the outlying,  residential areas of Guayaquil, because they do not have paved  streets, safe drinking water, sewage systems, and other modern  city services.    Large lakes of water and mud have been left by the rains,  and  food is being sold in town squares and other places under  unsanitary conditions.    The City of Guayaquil will work with personnel from other  services in the area of environmental health to reduce or  eliminate pools of water, where disease-carrying mosquitoes  breed.    Subsecretary Liria Mendoza participated in the technical  assessment of the situation, as she has greater experience in  spraying insecticides, through the National Service for the  Eradication of Malaria. She will also provide insecticides,  mosquito netting, and other materials.    Antonio Martinez, director of health services of the City of  Guayaquil, said that if we do not act in an aggressive way, we  will run the risk of having cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever  and an increase in other diseases. He explained that, in  addition to spraying ponds and pools of water, his service will  provide free medical service in outlying residential areas,  thanks to which possible outbreaks of epidemics can be detected.    The municipal Departments of Sewage and Public Works will  also take part in efforts to prevent disease through cleaning  drains and draining ponds, canals, and other areas where  rainwater has accumulated.    A serious case has occurred in the Bastion residential area,  where stagnant water has caused a major outbreak of malaria  affecting 85 percent of the people living there. For this reason  work to drain pools of water is being undertaken on an emergency  basis.    According to technically qualified sources, the increase of  malaria is in the pernicious form of the virus which causes the  disease.    In the outlying, Bastion area ponds of rain water have  formed  which the authorities should drain immediately to prevent an  increase in the disease.    The people have an important role to play in resolving the  problem. They should cooperate in cleaning up back yards and  gardens, draining ponds and puddles of water, and disposing of  objects where water can collect.</p>

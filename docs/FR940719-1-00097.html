The record shall be made by the person making the examination. The record shall be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. Within 2 scheduled production days thereafter, the record shall also be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The record shall be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Retention period.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Records shall be retained for at least 1 year at a surface location at the mine and made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and representative of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33.

A map showing the main escapeways shall be posted at a surface location of the mine where miners congregate, such as at the mine bulletin board, bathhouse, or waiting room. All maps shall be kept up to date, and any changes in route of travel, locations of doors, or directions of airflow shall be shown on the maps by the end of the shift on which the changes are made, and affected miners shall be informed of the changes before entering the underground areas of the mine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) At least once every 90 days, each miner, including miners with working stations located between working sections and main escapeways, shall participate in a practice escapeway drill. During this drill, each miner shall travel the primary or alternate escapeway from the miner's working section or area where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, to the area where the split of air ventilating the working section intersects a main air course, or 2,000 feet outby the section loading point, whichever distance is greater. Other miners shall participate in the escapeway drill by traveling in the primary or alternate escapeway for a distance of 2,000 feet from their working station toward the nearest escape facility or drift opening. An escapeway drill shall not be conducted in the same escapeway as the immediately preceding drill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 34.

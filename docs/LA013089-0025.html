			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ABORTION AND THE COURT'  </P> <P> When The Times reported the President's telephone hookup with those gathered  for the 16th annual March for Life ("Bush Calls for Reversal of '73 Abortion  Ruling," Part I, Jan. 24), the real bombshell of the story was accorded a scant  line's attention, buried in the 11th paragraph of a story which was buried on  Page 19: " 'America needs a human life amendment,' the President said."  </P> <P> A human life amendment?! This is news! To my knowledge, not once in his  campaign for the presidency did Bush call for such an amendment. Yet on his  first business day as President, Bush blithely proposes this startling  legislation.  </P> <P> I want to hear more. What exactly is Bush proposing? And why didn't he inform  the American people of this striking point of his agenda during the campaign?  </P> <P> Avowing such a reactionary plan so early in his presidency -- without even a  hint of his intention to do so during the campaign -- smacks of dishonesty.  </P> <P> JOHN HEANER  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

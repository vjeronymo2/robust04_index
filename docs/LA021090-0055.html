			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BENNETT SCORES CAPITAL OFFICIALS' ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS AS LACKLUSTER  </P> <P> William J. Bennett, director of national drug control policy, on Friday accused  District of Columbia officials of lackluster efforts in the war on drugs, and a  Bennett aide said the city let $2.4 million in federal funds slip away.  </P> <P> "I don't know why it's heresy when I say it," Bennett told the Senate Budget  Committee. "Everybody in this town knows that this government is not fulfilling  its responsibilities to its citizens."  </P> <P> The testimony came at a hearing in which Democrats on the Senate Budget  Committee questioned Bennett about efforts to combat drugs in the District of  Columbia.  </P> <P> Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) sought to spotlight the rampant problem in this  city, whose mayor, Marion Barry, is in a Florida alcohol and drug clinic after  his arrest on a cocaine possession charge. An aide has said that Barry is being  treated primarily for alcoholism.  </P> <P> Sasser reminded Bennett that when he became drug policy director a year ago, he  promised to make Washington a test case in the fight against drugs that still  can be bought on street corners "only blocks from this Capitol."  </P> <P> Bennett said that action by federal officials "cannot take the place of local  government, federal initiatives cannot replace local initiatives."  </P> <P> District police estimate that more than 60% of the 438 murders recorded in the  nation's capital last year were drug related.  </P> <P> Sasser said District of Columbia officials have complained that they have not  received the assistance from the federal government that was promised in the  early days of the drug war.  </P> <P> Bruce L. Carnes, director of planning, budget and administration under Bennett,  told the panel that the federal government has made a commitment to provide  more than $90 million of the $102 million that the district sought.  </P> <P> But he said that despite repeated warnings, district officials allowed $2.4  million in Defense Department funds for bolstering the National Guard as a  drug-fighting tool to lapse through inaction.  </P> <P> "Almost every penny of that lapsed because the district did not draw down that  money," Carnes told lawmakers. "I kept telling them, the clock is ticking. . .  . You've got to draw down that money, or it's going to lapse. It lapsed."  </P></p>

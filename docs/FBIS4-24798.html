			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The first batch of  foreign academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),  the country's top scientific body, is expected to be selected  within a week, official sources said here today.    This was revealed at a news conference on the imminent  seventh academicians' conference of the Chinese Academy of  Sciences (CAS) and the inaugural meeting of a new Chinese  Academy of Engineering (CAE).    A CAS spokesman said that the foreign academicians will be  selected from some 25 foreign scientists recommended to the  academy.    The two meetings are due to be held here from June 3 to June  8.    This will be a grand gathering for the country's scientific,  technological and engineering communities, the spokesman said.    "The opening of the two meetings of academicians will  certainly arouse the attention and interest of all social  sections, particularly the scientific and technological  communities both at home and abroad," the spokesman said, adding  that the two meetings will have a far-reaching impact on the  country's development of science and technology.    He said that a change of rules on CAS academicians is  expected to be passed during the meeting, adding that currently  China has 535 CAS academicians.    He said that leading officials from the Central Committee of  the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council will  speak at the meeting.    He said that thanks to the concern of the Central Committee  of the CPC and the State Council, the preparations for the  founding of the CAE have been accomplished, and the inaugural  ceremony, namely the first meeting of the academicians, will be  held during the CAS meeting.    Ninety-six people have been appointed as the first  academicians of the CAE. The list will be made public on June  3, the spokesman said.    He attributed the relatively small number of initial CAE  academicians to the fact that the official preparations for the  establishment of the academy were not started until January.    But a second batch of CAE academicians will be chosen from a  nationwide selection after the meeting, the spokesman said.    He added that the president and deputy president of the CAE  will be selected from its academicians at this session.</p>

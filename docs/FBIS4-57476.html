			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] Workers Party [PT] presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva on 17 May announced that the PT has decided  to promote a social pact, which would be called "social accord,"  to fight inflation. Lula made the disclosure to 52 executives  from large foreign groups during a luncheon in Sao Paulo. He  said: "Inflation in Brazil is not fueled by demand; rather, it  is a political problem. The way to reduce it gradually,  effectively, and lastingly is through a social pact among  workers, business people, and the government. Our government  will be based on such an agreement because inflation will  decline only when this agreement is achieved." The idea of a  pact is not new. It was tried under the government of Jose  Sarney by then-Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto, but it was not  endorsed by either the PT or the Sole Workers Center, the trade  union closest to the PT.    As an example of the type of agreement he wants, Lula cited  the pact concluded two years ago by business people, workers,  and government in the car industry that resulted in tax cuts for  the industry and job security for workers. After noting that the  eight administrations that have ruled the country since 1985  have not succeeded in curbing inflation, but rather provoked  losses to workers, Lula said: "We have to start by bringing  inflation under social control." He added that it also will  become necessary "to introduce changes" to oligopolies and the  financial system, to guarantee investment in productive  activities, and to fight corruption in state-owned banks so they  will no longer be used as "backup coffers" and that "domestic  debt can be rescheduled so the state can count on funds for  investments."    Lula went as far as responding to questions by business  people about how a socialist party plans to attract foreign  capital. He said: "Capital has neither fatherland nor ideology.  No businessman who has invested in China has questioned the  Chinese Government about the Tiananmen Square massacre." Lula  stated that investors would respond positively if his government  assured them that they would obtain profits. He added that, to  this end, it will suffice to "slightly increase" the purchasing  power of all Brazilians. He said: "If we achieve this, the  consumer market will be such that you will be interested in  investing here."    The business people also expressed concern about the closed  nature of the Brazilian economy and about the fact that the PT  opposes the privatization of state-owned companies. Making it  clear that he is not in favor of opening up the economy, Lula  said: "Open borders sound good in speeches, but in practice  every country has mechanisms to defend its market and products."  He announced that the PT will maintain a state monopoly over  petroleum and telecommunications but will promote concessions to  the private sector in other areas. Showing that he is against  privatization, Lula said: "But instead of trying to buy the  existing state-owned companies, why do you not try to build  railroad tracks and roads and many other much-needed projects in  Brazil"?    The business people come from various countries, the United  States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Korea, and  Australia, among others, and represent large groups such as IBM,  Mitsubishi Bank, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, AT&amp;T, and  Eastman Kodak, among others. They are attending a master's  degree program of the Massachuset Institute of Technology, which  promoted similar visits to Chile and Argentina, where they met  President Carlos Menem, and Mexico. In Brazil, they also are  scheduled to meet economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende  to learn about the economic proposal of Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party's presidential  candidate.</p>

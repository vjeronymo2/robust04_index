			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY WATCH;  </P> <P> THERE THEY GO AGAIN  </P> <P> Drawing an analogy between prostitutes in Tokyo and blacks in America is  ridiculous. Yet a Japanese cabinet official did that recently, in a most  insulting manner.  </P> <P> After a police roundup of foreign prostitutes over the weekend, Justice  Minister Seiroku Kajiyama likened their presence in the Shinjuku district to  black Americans who move into white neighborhoods and "ruin the atmosphere." He  said: "It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move  in, and whites are forced out." The Justice Ministry later issued a clarifying  statement but did not apologize.  </P> <P> Kajiyama's slur reflects an insular view of the world despite a program of  "internationalization" and Japan's business interests overseas. He is the  latest official -- others included former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and  Liberal Democratic Party official Michio Watanabe -- to make disparaging  remarks about blacks.  </P> <P> Sadly, Japan's embrace of Western ways apparently is superficial -- designer  goods and hamburgers. Tokyo may have difficulty understanding the tapestry of  America's diversity, but it should know better given the many Japanese tourists  and businessmen who visit America.  </P> <P> Instead, we see the distressing popularity of best-selling books with  anti-Semitic themes and continuing discrimination against Koreans in Japan.  </P> <P> The Japanese have long extolled their homogeneous culture, but it's also an  excuse. Tokyo needs some lessons in sensitivity before "internationalization"  is genuine.  </P></p>

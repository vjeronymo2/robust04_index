			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Central TV beats City forecasts with Pounds 24.4m WITH THE announcement yesterday of a near 28 per cent growth in pre-tax profits at Central Independent Television, Mr Leslie Hill, the chairman, revealed he had written to Mr David Mellor, the new secretary for National Heritage, calling for a two-year extension to the moratorium on ITV takeovers. Under broadcasting legislation takeovers will become possible at the beginning of 1994. Mr Hill believes the moratorium should be extended until the end of 1995 because only then are the television takeover rules throughout the EC likely to be fair. Central has been campaigning against the fact that EC companies will be able to take over ITV companies, whereas in most other Community countries there are barriers to overseas takeover. 'I believe that UK companies should be allowed to grow at home, free from the threat of takeover by EC media giants, at least until broadcasting ownership rules in every country in the Community - instead of, uniquely, in Britain - provide fair competition and fair opportunities for all,' Mr Hill wrote to the National Heritage secretary. The profit for 1991 rose 27.5 per cent and was ahead of market expectations at Pounds 24.4m, compared with Pounds 19.2m. The shares moved up 40p to Pounds 13.75. Profit before the special exchequer levy was Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 36.6m), the highest in Central's 10-year history and the best recorded by an ITV company last year. Turnover was 2.7 per cent lower at Pounds 306.6m, with advertising revenue 1.4 per cent down to Pounds 229.7m - although the share of ITV revenue was maintained at 14.4 per cent. Operating costs were cut by nearly 29 per cent to Pounds 62.8m. Earnings per share increased to 56.1p. (44.2p). The final dividend is 23p to make a total of 30.5p (28.5p). Mr Mark Beilby, media analyst at Warburg Securities expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 38m from the group this year with Pounds 45m in 1993. Further signs of how costs might be cut came yesterday with the announcement that Mr Nigel Walmsley, the chief executive of Carlton Television, is to join his chairman Mr Michael Green on the Central board; Carlton has a 20 per cent stake in Central. At the same time Mr Andy Allan, managing director of Central Broadcasting, will join the Carlton Television board. The Bottom Line Page XI</p>

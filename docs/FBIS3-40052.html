			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Claire </F> Trean; place and date not given: "Mr. Juppe Revives Idea of  `Overall Peace Plan' for Bosnia"]    [Text] On 23 February, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  suggested to his American and French counterparts, the French  prime minister, and the German chancellor that they hold a  summit to sign a "historic" document settling the Bosnian  conflict.    In an interview granted to us by the French foreign  minister,  he said that he was in favor of a "contract" between these  powers that would allow them to revive efforts to accomplish an  "overall peace plan" for Bosnia, before any international  conference was held with all the sides involved. An incident  near Tuzla on Tuesday [22 February] nearly led to NATO air  intervention.    [Trean] Why did we wait so long before issuing an ultimatum  to the Bosnian Serbs?    [Juppe] Quite simply because in diplomacy, as in life,  decisions are made once the desire and a proper time have been  established. We have long had the desire, as have some of our  partners, but not everyone. There was a great deal of  hesitation about the use of force by the Europeans, UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], and the United Nations, as well as by  certain countries outside the European Union. Others were  prepared to use any pressure, including force, and I believe  that France was one of those.    As for the timing, it was a result of the shock caused by  the  attack on the Sarajevo marketplace on 5 February -- although we  might feel that that is emotional diplomacy and deplore the  excessive influence of television and the images it shows. It  was from that point that the desire, expressed more or less  explicitly during the NATO summit in January, found the right  time to crystallize. The arguments that we highlighted, and  which had not been heard beforehand, were then heard as a result  of that tragedy.    [Trean] Could the same schema apply in other cases, in other  words, could we loosen the siege of certain Muslim enclaves with  the help of military pressure?    [Juppe] I hope that we do not have to see the same tragedies  repeated to do so. In my analysis, we do not currently need new  ultimatums for the other safe areas. The system is perfectly  operational and France is determined to ask for it to be used if  necessary.    For Tuzla, it has been decided to base the airplanes used in  the airlift at the airport. If the Serb batteries hinder this,  then there is no need for an ultimatum. NATO's air response can  be instantaneous because we would be acting within the framework  of adopted resolutions. The same holds true for Srebrenica,  Gorazde, and the other safe areas. The problem could arise,  however, in the other areas not covered by Resolution 836.  Here, I am thinking of Mostar and Vitez.    [Trean] So why has the Tuzla airport not been opened yet?    [Juppe] Because the general line taken until the NATO  ultimatum -- and that was where there was a turning point -- was  to achieve the objective without using force. What UNPROFOR  tried to do in Srebrenica and Tuzla was to apply the UN  decisions by mutual consent, i.e., to gain the agreement of the  Serbs. It was on the way to achieving this, since in Srebrenica  things are getting under way and in Tuzla the date of 7 March  was chosen on friendly terms.    [Trean] Is there really a difference between "air support"  and "air strikes?"    [Juppe] Yes. The terms of the Sarajevo ultimatum were: You  withdraw or we will strike. In the other safe areas, the terms  are: If you attack us, we will respond. That is not the logic  of an ultimatum. For the time being, we must try and use the  momentum gained by Sarajevo to unblock the situation. Later on  we will see whether we need other ultimatums.    [Trean] A lot of UNPROFOR resources are converging on  Sarajevo. Is that not a risk for the other areas?    [Juppe] It is indeed a risk. It is true that we gave  priority to Sarajevo. In the next few days we are going to run  up against the question of UNPROFOR's total resources. That  means two things: money and troops. France is prepared to  redeploy its resources within Yugoslavia, but we are not in a  position to increase the total number of troops. The British  have taken more or less the same position. There is going to be  a problem there. The American position is clear: No troops as  long as an agreement has not been signed. However, in my  opinion, if the United Nations genuinely wants to we can quite  quickly find the needed reinforcements.  <H5>  }Sarajevo Under UN Administration </H5>   [Trean] France asked a meeting of the Security Council to  decree that Sarajevo be placed under UN administration. What  does that mean in concrete terms?    [Juppe] A Security Council meeting would be helpful at this  point: First, to take stock of what has happened and to remark  that progress has been made; and second, to recall the demand  made by the United Nations and NATO, namely the lifting of the  siege against Sarajevo. That particular element has not been  obtained: The lifting of the siege does not mean simply  stopping the shelling, but free movement and the unhindered flow  of supplies to the city. There is also the matter of putting the  idea of UN administration of Sarajevo into concrete terms via an  official decision. This is part of the European peace plan,  which was accepted by the parties involved, and which was  accepted in principle by the Americans and the Russians. In  concrete terms, this means defining a perimeter: the nine  districts of Greater Sarajevo, for example. It also means  appointing a UN authority that would exercise the power of  administration or coordination for the entire area, whereas at  present there are numerous players on the ground, both civilian  and military. Lastly, the purpose of this resolution could be  to ask this coordinator to quickly suggest the resources needed  to effectively implement this administration -- here I am  thinking of the running of essential public services, such as  water, gas, etc.) so that the Security Council could deliberate  on things apart from more or less subjective or theoretical  assessments.    [Trean] Administration evokes memories of the colonial  mandates. That sounds like the relinquishment of sovereignty.    [Juppe] There is currently a plan whose principles have been  agreed, but which has not been signed. This plan, which  includes the agreement concluded on board the Invincible in  September 1993, notes that, for the Sarajevo region, we are not  yet capable of reaching an agreement on the allocation of the  territory between the Serbs and Muslims.    [Trean] You mean on a division?    [Juppe] In the absence of an agreement, we have decided that  in Sarajevo power will be wielded by the United Nations for a  period of two years, so that in the meantime the parties can  reach an agreement on a definitive status. It is therefore a  temporary administration so that this problem will not prevent  the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement. That is the  underlying thinking. This is not supervision forever.    [Trean] What exactly will this UN authority cover?    [Juppe] The city will be run by the United Nations. To do  that it must be demilitarized, which presupposed controlling  heavy weapons and infantry.    [Trean] Did you talk about this with Mr. Izetbegovic last  week?    [Juppe] Mr. Izetbegovic agreed to the principle last  November, but I did not talk to him about it in detail last  week. We had other topics on our minds, particularly the  ultimatum.    [Trean] It seems pretty difficult to have it accepted by the  Bosnians.    [Juppe] The same is true for the Serbs. They are present in  Sarajevo: There are Serb areas and Serb troops. It is valid  for everyone.    [Trean] But it is the capital of the Bosnian state.    [Juppe] It is the capital of a state which currently does  not  exert its authority over all of Bosnia. We are therefore  completely justified in obtaining this mandate on a provisional  basis, just as in Mostar.  <H5>  Russian Game </H5>   [Trean] The French approach contains the idea of a kind of  role-sharing between the powers, with each one supposed to exert  pressure on such and such a party in the conflict. Do you think  that the Russians are going to play the game and really obtain  concessions from the Serbs? Would they not rather play the old  Russian-Serb alliance, as they have been doing virtually openly  so far?    [Juppe] The Russians have already obtained concessions from  the Serbs.    [Trean] Because there was an ultimatum that caused them  considerable bother...    [Juppe] First of all, this ultimatum remains binding. Next,  everyone understands now that we had an interest in finding a  solution. It is actually a bet on the attitude of both Russia  and the United States: Has each party now really been persuaded  that a rapid peace settlement must be found? That is what Mr.  Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton say.  <H5>  Peace Plan in Two Weeks </H5>   [Trean] Mr. Yeltsin says it in the same sense as the Serbs,  who are the first to want an agreement based on the current  foundations.    [Juppe] That has been true for a long time, for two reasons:  Because they got what they wanted and because they have a real  interest in obtaining a gradual lifting of the sanctions, but  the Serbs finally gave up in Sarajevo. There were victory cries  in Pale, but we have to make allowances for the intoxication:  They yielded because they were in a situation of political and  military inferiority and because the Russians told them to  yield. So the game of wielding power over the parties has  begun. The question now is to know whether the Russians are  prepared to say to the Serbs: As regards the control of the  territories, here are the few essential conditions needed to  conclude an agreement. That is the only bet we are making --  just as we are betting on the American attitude. The Americans  have already told the Bosnians: No provocation, respect the  cease-fire, and put your weapons under UN control. That is what  they got. Now, with our consent, they are exploring the idea  with the Muslims and Croats of a Croat-Muslim confederation  within the framework of the broad principles of the European  plan, i.e., covering 51 percent of the territory. The whole  question is knowing whether this game of Russian pressure on the  Serbs and American pressure on the Muslims and Croats is going  to be able to comprise a peace plan in the next two or four  weeks that will be accepted by the Europeans and agreed by all  parties.  <H5>  Croat-Muslim Confederation </H5>   [Trean] Is France neutral in this game of pressure?    [Juppe] No, France is not neutral, much less is it inactive.  First of all, it is France that called on the Russians and  Americans to enter the field. We now have two roles to play:  The first is remembering that Europe is involved and that it is  one of the parties involved; and the second is making sure that  the various players involved, especially the Americans, are  aware that the solution currently being worked out must not be a  solution that pushes one of the parties aside. We must try and  reconcile the viewpoints of the various parties.    [Trean] So far the Croats have rejected the idea of a  confederation...    [Juppe] They have already suggested it. It is my  understanding that the Croats and Muslims have already given  their agreement in principle to this idea of a confederation.  This raises many questions: Are we definitely sure that it is  confined to the 51-percent limit on the territory (17.5 percent  plus 33.3 percent)? I have been told yes. Will it comprise two  confederal entities or will it be a confederation divided up  into districts? This is not yet clear. One of the  possibilities will be to have a single state with five  districts: three Muslim districts, and two Croat districts.  Third, will this entity -- whatever form it takes -- have links  with the Serb entity? Will it be part of a Bosnia-Herzegovina  that is theoretically independent and a member of the United  Nations, with a Serb part and a Croat-Muslim part? Or, on the  contrary, would it be a solution that would encourage the Serb  part to take back its freedom and move closer to Belgrade?  <H5>  Owen And Stoltenberg `In Retreat' </H5>   [Trean] Is the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer  defended  by anyone?    [Juppe] In the current situation, it is a fiction. The  Croat-Muslim confederation has at least one advantage: It makes  it possible to solve the problem of access to the sea, which is  one of the sticky points in the negotiations. The part of the  territory that goes up to the port of Neum would belong to the  confederation and, in the event of a secession, it would return  -- under full sovereignty -- to that party of the confederation  not responsible for the secession. However, it remains to be  seen whether this solution is acceptable to the Serbs.    [Trean] Would that involve a few concessions by them?    [Juppe] It would assume that the Serbs and Muslims agree to  discuss enclaves in the east and possible arrangements in  central Bosnia.    [Trean] Do you think that all this will be feasible?    [Juppe] That is the question we are asking ourselves today,  especially bearing in mind the breakdown in the discussion  process.    [Trean] Are the negotiators, Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg,  losing their grip on the negotiations?    [Juppe] Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg agreed to step back a  little to see what the current talks yield. So when and how are  we going to get everyone to sit down around the table and see if  we reach a feasible solution? We must get there as fast as  possible.  <H5>  `Our Essential Interests' </H5>   [Trean] Are you thinking of a new international conference?    [Juppe] No, first of all, I am thinking of contacts between  the various players involved. That could then lead to something  that will resemble an international conference. The Russians  suggested it, and so did the Germans, but the Americans are a  bit hesitant and I share their hesitance: Before committing  ourselves to this kind of exercise, there must be an agreement  between the Americans, Russians, and us on the basis of an  overall settlement.    [Trean] What, for you, is a "feasible" plan?    [Juppe] The best peace plan is a plan that can be accepted  by  everyone.    [Trean] Does this exercise between great powers also involve  Croatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia?    [Juppe] It will have to, but what we are currently  discussing  is a settlement in Bosnia. The rest will be the topic of a  large conference. The situation is actually more stable in  Krajina and there are Croat-Serb talks which, according to  President Tudjman, are tending to make progress. As for Kosovo  and Macedonia, things will be more difficult. The international  community recognizes the sovereignty of Serbia in Kosovo. We  will have to obtain the guarantee that the rights of minorities  in Kosovo will be guaranteed and respected. This will have to  be obtained within the framework of, say, another exercise, such  as the large conference on the Balkans.    [Trean] Can we tackle the problem of Macedonia, while Greece  is president of the European Union?    [Juppe] That has not stopped practically every country of  the  European Union from expressing a certain amount of displeasure  at the recent Greek initiatives. All this is unreasonable. The  Greeks must be encouraged to resume the negotiation process. Of  course, Macedonia too must make some gestures. But such  gestures will not be obtained by a blockade.    [Trean] In your opinion does France have a particular  responsibility in this region?    [Juppe] As the president of the Republic said: "It regards  us." Indeed, it concerns us for many reasons: Because it is in  the middle of Europe; because there are enormous risks of it  spreading; because the conference on stability in Europe  advocated by the prime minister would have much more weight if  we managed to unblock this matter; and because it calls into  question the entire policy of enlarging the European Union to  include the countries of central and eastern Europe. The two  big problems in European integration by the year 2000 will be  enlargement and security. We cannot suppose that there will be  a sort of enclave in the Balkans that does not concern us. I  truly think that our interests -- perhaps not our vital  interests, but certainly our essential interests -- are at stake  in this affair, and that justifies us devoting time and energy  to it.</p>

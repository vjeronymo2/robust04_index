			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A burning debate that fizzled out in Maastricht - The Issues: Europe MR Paddy Ashdown's weekend trip to Boulogne was a rather desperate attempt to remind voters that Europe is an election issue: one on which he believes his party, with its unashamedly federalist programme, has an advantage. That voters should need reminding of the European issue would have seemed extraordinary six, or even four, months ago, when it was widely expected to be central - possibly decisive. The desire to avoid that may have been one reason for the prime minister deciding not to call the election last autumn. Certainly Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, made no secret of his preference for delaying the election until after December's Maastricht summit. He felt that having the election still to come strengthened his negotiating hand - because, he believed, 'none of the people round that table (Britain's European partners) seriously want to see a Kinnock government'. Had the election been held in the run-up to Maastricht, Britain's negotiating stance would almost inevitably have become an election issue, with opposition parties claiming that the government was isolating Britain and wrecking the EC by its opposition to monetary and political union and to the 'social chapter'. The battle lines would have been similarly drawn now, and the argument probably even fiercer, had Maastricht ended in failure. The Conservatives would have been obliged to fight the election as, in effect, the anti-European party. But an agreement at Maastricht could also have posed problems if, for example, Mrs Margaret Thatcher had led a significant backbench revolt. In the event, by excising the word 'federal' from the treaty's preamble, by persuading his partners to adopt the social chapter as a separate protocol to which Britain is not a party, and by inserting an 'opt-out' clause for monetary union, Mr Major kicked the European football into touch. Only seven Tory MPs, led by former party chairman Mr Norman Tebbit, voted against the Maastricht agreement on December 19, while Mrs Thatcher and 23 others abstained or did not vote. Both Mr Tebbit and Mrs Thatcher have now retired from the Commons, but both are actively supporting the Tory campaign. The constituencies in which they appear tend, not surprisingly, to be those where the Conservative candidates share their views on Europe, but that issue is not emphasised in their speeches. Still less does it seem to be uppermost in the minds of the voters. Last Thursday, when Mr Tebbit was in Grays, Essex, questions focused almost exclusively on the health service, more especially on the closure of wards at the local Orsett Hospital. Only a question from the Financial Times obliged Mr Tebbit to mention Europe. He said: 'I felt, at the end of the day that I couldn't support the government on the outcome of the Maastricht negotiations, but I have made it plain that I think it was a very good rearguard action.' Mr Tebbit expressed anxiety, however, that 'in the event of a Labour government or a Lib-Lab pact', Britain would accept 'a whole range of measures to give trade unions greater power', which parliament would not be able to repeal because they would be part of EC law. Mr Tim Janman, the candidate Mr Tebbit was supporting, passes this test without difficulty. His campaign newspaper carries an endorsement from Mr Enoch Powell: 'With all the big parties poised to give away parliament's power to manage Britain, the electorate has still one weapon left. Vote for the candidate whose record, like Tim Janman's, proves he will defend your rights.' Mr Janman abstained in the December vote ('John Major did get a good result at Maastricht: I felt it would have been unkind to vote against John'), but says he would 'probably' vote against ratification of the treaty if he is re-elected. It is a considerable 'if'. He is defending a majority of only 690 in Thurrock which used to be a Labour seat, and his views are not precisely calculated to win over middle-of-the-road voters. The only point in his campaign literature which could perhaps be construed as a favourable reference to Europe is the statement that he 'believes in chemical castration for premeditated rapists and sex offenders (as in the USA and Europe)'. He does not specify in which European countries this enlightened practice has been adopted. His Labour opponent, Mr Andrew Mackinlay, is a self-styled European 'zealot' who last year staged a mass signing of the social charter as a tongue-in-cheek contribution to the 'Euro Week' organised by Essex's Tory-controlled county council. Mr Janman attracted attention last year when he described Mr Jacques Delors as 'the devil incarnate of European politics' and warned immigration officials to 'be on the lookout for a short, bespectacled, horrid little French socialist coming to Britain for subversive and treasonable motives'. But even he seems mildly embarrassed by the views of his agent, Mr Ted Attewell, who says that if the pound is sacrificed there should be 'a revolution, and people's courts to try those responsible and execute them for high treason'. Those may be considered authentic views of 'Essex man'. But the issue is not a burning one for most voters in Essex. Or, probably, anywhere else.</p>

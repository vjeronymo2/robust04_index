			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Computer rivals unveil new ranges - Louise Kehoe examines US advances in microprocessor technology DIGITAL Equipment (DEC), the troubled US minicomputer manufacturer, today opens a critical campaign to regain sales momentum and profitability with the launch of a range of computers based on the controversial 'Alpha' technology. It hopes to leapfrog its principal competitors, including Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, with a range of seven computers from a Dollars 15,000 workstation to a multi-processor mainframe-class system. The new Alpha chip - which processes information 64 bits at a time similar to a supercomputer - is likely to make Digital the front runner. But SUN and Hewlett-Packard are jostling to upstage DEC and one another as they also today unveil powerful computers based upon the new generation of high-performance reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessor chips of which Alpha is currently the most powerful example. The price of the products the three companies are launching today range from under Dollars 5,000 to well over Dollars 150,000 and span desktop PCs through to data-centre mainframes. Risc chips made their commercial debut in the mid-1980s. Unlike earlier 'complex instruction set' micro-processors, they process a limited number of simple instructions very rapidly. These devices have become the critical componentin an industry-wide computer-power battle, challenging the role of conventional microprocessors in the PC market and traditional computer architectures in mini-computers and mainframes. Computer workstations will be centre stage in today's product launches as Sun, H-P and Digital battle for a larger share of the Dollars 10bn workstation market, one of the fastest growing sectors of the computer market. Originally used primarily for engineering and technical applications, workstations are invading the office where they become powerful desktop computers. H-P, which pioneered the use of Risc microprocessors in mid-range computers, will unveil a new range of workstations that double the speed of its current models. Digital has to build a base of software applications to take full advantage of the new Alpha design. Initially, Alpha workstations will be aimed primarily at software developers. By next March, the company predicts there will be 'several hundred' applications designed to run on the Alpha computers. Some 900 software companies are working on over 1,600 applications programs for Alpha, Digital claims. Sun will today unveil what it claims is 'the world's least expensive colour Risc workstation', a desktop computer that will sell in the US for Dollars 4,295 and outperform similarly priced personal computers. Sun's new Sparc Classic also sets a target for Apple Computer's next generation of personal computers based upon IBM's PC Power Risc microprocessor. Sun will launch its most powerful computer to date - a mainframe-class system for data centre applications that will eventually incorporate up to 20 processor modules working together, and beginning next April, Sun will ship systems with up to eight modules. H-P aims to maintain its performance advantage over competitors with a range of systems based on a new version of its Risc technology that set processing speed records while maintaining software compatibility with existing models.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / BBC staff vote against 1.5% imposed rise SEVERAL thousand journalists and technical staff at the BBC have voted to reject a 1.5 per cent pay offer, the National Union of Journalists and Bectu, the technicians' union, announced yesterday. Staff voted by 4,867 to 648 - 87.7 per cent - against the deal in a postal ballot in which 41 per cent of those eligible voted. The BBC imposed the settlement at the beginning of this month by announcing that the rise would be in August pay cheques. At the time Ms Margaret Salmon, director of personnel, pointed out that the government had ruled that public-sector settlements should be restricted to 1.5 per cent of the wage bill. Mr Roger Bolton, Bectu's national industrial officer, said yesterday he was writing to Ms Salmon asking for an urgent meeting to re-open negotiations. A further ballot on industrial action has not been ruled out. BBC unions intend to challenge the pay rise of 1.5 per cent. Mr Bolton yesterday said the BBC was trying to have it both ways - claiming to be a public-sector organisation when it suited. Mr Bolton said that at a recent industrial tribunal the BBC claimed not to be a public-sector organisation under European Community law. The unions will also try to negotiate on a number of non-pay issues such as rights to a meal break after six hours' work, a limit to the number of hours worked in any one day and better terms for short-term contract workers. The BBC said it had made clear there was no scope to increase the overall amount but offered further talks on others aspects of the claim. Reuters Television, the television arm of the news and information group, yesterday announced the loss of 77 posts, 40 of them through redundancies. The job losses at what was Visnews are mainly in areas such as technical facilities, cassette syndication and duplication.</p>

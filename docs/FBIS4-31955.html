			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] New York, June 16 (TANJUG) -- The United Nations has  no information about any "ethnic cleansing" being practiced in  the Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka, a U.N. spokesman said on  Thursday [16 June]. The statement was prompted by a NEW YORK  TIMES report from Sarajevo alleging that an "ethnic cleansing"  campaign in Banja Luka in western Bosnia-Herzegovina has  intensified and that more than 3,000 Moslems and Croats have  fled the town under Serb pressure in the past two months. The  U.N. secretary-general's spokesman Joe Sills said that a Moslem  offensive had abated after having raged for weeks and that the  truce signed by Bosnia's belligerents at Geneva on June 8 was  holding in the main, except for fierce fighting around Bihac in  the west between rival Moslem factions loyal to hardliner Alija  Izetbegovic and his moderate opponent Fikret Abdic.    Abdic and his supporters rebelled against Izetbegovic's  war-mongering policy and last autumn proclaimed their autonomous  province of western Bosnia and signed peace accords with Bosnian  Serbs and Croats. Sills said that Bosnian Serb forces had been  holding a Nordic medical convoy near Rogatica, southeast of  Sarajevo, for the past three days in violation of an agreement  on free passage throughout Bosnian territory. Asked if it was  true that the convoy had refused to submit to a routine check,  Sills replied that, according to his information, the Serbs were  asking for more than a routine check, which he said was giving  rise to concern.</p>

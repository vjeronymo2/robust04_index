			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / The New Economic Order: Mexican legal system puts progress in fetters There is at least one point of agreement in Mexico for the governing party and opposition, business organisations, foreign investors, and lawyers: the country's competitiveness and economic progress is hindered by its slow, outdated and often corrupt legal system. The broad alliance in favour of legal reform reflects the dissatisfaction with a judicial system that has hardly been touched by the economic and social reforms of the past decade. Mexico's judges are still largely subservient to the executive branch; corruption is common; litigation is extraordinarily slow; and many important commercial laws, dating back to the 1930s, are inadequate for today's businesses. In a recent report, the World Bank said the weakness of Mexico's legal system was an 'important constraint to private-sector development'. The unclear legal environment, added to the cost of capital, created uncertainty and discriminated against small businesses, which are more vulnerable to arbitrary legal decisions than large companies. The system's poor reputation is believed to have reduced foreign investment, especially in the agricultural sector, where commercial law is least developed. 'There is a great deal of fear in many US businessmen's minds about coming to Mexico,' says Mr Vincent Russo, deputy director of the National Law Center for Inter-American Free Trade, which is looking at ways of harmonising trade and investment laws in the Americas. 'Mexico's legal system generates mistrust and scares people away.' But any reform of the legal system is made more difficult by the fact that the creation of an independent judiciary would reduce the power of the ruling party. 'The basic problem is impunity and arbitrariness, which is a result of a lack of democracy,' says Mr Santiago Creel, a prominent Mexico City lawyer. 'Modernisation of the legal system depends on changing the political system.' Although Mexico's constitution upholds the judiciary's independence, in practice judges are often answerable to the government. Given the Institutional Revolutionary party's domination of Congress, the president and governors can pick and dismiss federal and state judges almost as they wish. 'It can be dangerous to fight in the courts against powerful political interests,' says Mr Ernesto Ayala, a litigant with Bufete, Noriega and Escobedo, a top law firm in Mexico City. Partly thanks to the efforts of Mr Jorge Carpizo, the former attorney-general who is now interior minister, several corruption cases involving judges have come to light. Last year, Mr Carpizo's office ordered the arrest of Mr Ernesto Diaz Infante, former Supreme Court Justice, for allegedly taking a Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 329,000) bribe while in office for arranging the release of a man convicted of raping and murdering a young girl. Mr Diaz disappeared soon after his arrest was ordered. While corruption is said to affect only a small minority of cases, the resolution of disputes in Mexican courts is generally 'lengthy, costly and unpredictable', according to the World Bank. Under Mexico's legal system, almost every case in state courts can be appealed against in federal courts, enabling parties to delay cases for years. The World Bank reports: 'Deficiencies in the system of legal education and training and a dearth in appropriate standards of professional ethics, have left legal practitioners complacent and unprepared to meet the challenge of their business clients competing in a global economy.' The effect of unpredictability is that businesses often avoid signing contracts with companies they do not know, to minimise the chance of landing in court, according to a US lawyer who is studying the impact of Mexico's legal system on the economy. This discriminates against new companies. Commercial laws further discriminate against small businesses by making it difficult to secure credit by pledging the lender movable property - such as machinery - as a guarantee. In the US secured credit by some estimates accounts for as much as 40 per cent of business loans. In Mexico companies either have to mortgage land or houses when borrowing money, or pay high rates of interest charged for unsecured credit. 'Mexico's small and medium-sized businesses are going to get killed as US businesses come down with 10 per cent credit,' says Mr Russo. 'If the government does not move on secured credit, Mexican businesses will be in trouble.' This article is the fifth in a series on the recovery in Latin America.

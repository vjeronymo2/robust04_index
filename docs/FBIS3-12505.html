			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 2 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper TISHRIN  discusses the fragility of the Oslo agreement and the ensuing  frail and capitulatory Cairo agreement. It says this fragility  has clearly manifested itself soon after the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in Hebron.    Commenting on this subject today, the paper says the desired  peace is never an Israeli peace that comes at the expense of  Arab rights and Arab existence. Peace does not mean the  continuation of occupation and the existence of military and  security positions and settlements. Peace is not partial  agreements or separate deals.    TISHRIN says that peace is that which puts a final and total  end to occupation and provides real circumstances and  appropriate climates to regain the Palestinian people's  political and national rights, including their right to  self-determination. The paper adds that since the Oslo and  Cairo agreements have not guaranteed these rights as much as  they guaranteed the continuation of Israeli occupation and  control of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and since they  have given the occupation forces and settlers the green light to  commit savage crimes and fascist massacres, it is only natural  to clearly state that the partial agreements concluded between  Israel and a Palestinian party have collapsed because the  massacre was a natural outcome of these capitulatory agreements.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israeli terrorism is always ready  to commit more crimes and massacres unless the international  community, represented by the UN Security Council, shoulders its  responsibilities and rescues our people from the Israeli killing.    Within the same context, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: What  makes the tragedy of the Hebron massacre more bitter is the  farce currently taking place at the UN Security Council. The  Council has for over five days after the massacre and despite  vehement global condemnation of it, failed to issue a resolution  condemning Israel and its ugly crimes on the one hand, and  providing protection and security to the Palestinian people on  the other.    AL-BA'TH adds: This proves not only the different standards  employed by the big powers in dealing with the world issues,  problems, and crises, but emphasizes that the protection these  states are providing for the Zionist entity and its terrorism in  the occupied territories, southern Lebanon, or in what is  related to the peace process, is keeping the region under the  yoke of Israel's aggression. It is Israel's crimes which  threaten regional and world peace and security.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Government is  making all kinds of legal efforts to reverse a ruling of  "treason to the fatherland" that a Peruvian military court  handed down against three Chilean citizens, who were sentenced  to life imprisonment for being involved in terrorist activities.    Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa reported today that the  Chilean Government has asked the attorneys defending the three  Chileans in Peru to file an appeal for annulment of the case,  and transfer it to civil courts.    The Chilean Government is making efforts to have the  Chileans  tried for terrorist crimes and not for the crime of "treason to  the fatherland," as determined by a Peruvian military court, a  crime that involves life imprisonment sentences.    The Chilean Foreign Ministry has repeatedly expressed that  it  is not appropriate to apply to foreign citizens the crime of  "treason to the fatherland," a legal classification that the  Peruvian law includes to punish terrorism crimes.    Chileans Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, Maria Concepcion  Pincheira,  Lautaro Mellado, and Alejandro Astorga 10 days ago received  final confirmation of their sentences to life imprisonment, with  one year of incommunicado status.    Explaining the Chilean stance on this issue a few days ago,  the foreign minister noted that the claim filed with the  Peruvian authorities does not in any way represent a weakness  toward terrorism.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Russia hopes to rein in inflation Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russia's finance minister, yesterday predicted that the inflation rate would be brought down to between 5 and 7 per cent a month by the end of the year. His comment follows Wednesday's parliamentary approval of a budget which goes some way to meeting the government commitment to the International Monetary Fund that it would rein in spending and curb inflation. Inflation has already come down to between 8 and 9 per cent a month from a high last year of nearly 30 per cent. The Russian parliament has now approved the main budget indicators - including a deficit of Rbs70,000bn (Pounds 25.2bn), which, Mr Dubinin said, was within the target agreed with the IMF of 10 per cent of gross national product. Mr Dubinin saw this as 'a vote of confidence in the economic policies of the government'. The finance minister predicted that the fall in the value of the rouble would be significantly less than forecast when the budget was drawn up, coming at an average of Rbs2,600 to the dollar for the year against the forecast of Rbs3,000. The rouble stood yesterday at Rbs1,869 to the dollar. Russia should press for inclusion of China in the group of leading industrialised countries, expanding it from a G7 to a G9 to include Russia and China, according to Mr Anatoly Adamishin, first deputy foreign minister. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, will pay an official visit to China later this month.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: BAA reaches for the sky BAA has the defensive qualities of a utility but the growth prospects of the civil aviation industry. So it is hardly surprising that chief executive Sir John Egan is piling investment into the business. Planned capital expenditure in airports of Pounds 1.4bn over the next three years is more than double investment over the past three years. Part of this is to accommodate future growth in passenger volumes. But the stepped-up spending is also designed to expand airport retailing, improve the quality of terminals and build more office space. A further Pounds 200m is earmarked for investment outside airports, mostly building factory outlets. Given that BAA's strategy of controlling costs and boosting retailing revenue is delivering handsome returns, investors will probably be pleased to have more of the same. Sales per passenger at the group's first redesigned shopping mall, Heathrow's Terminal Four, have increased 30 per cent. Meanwhile, BAA's construction costs have dropped by a third over the past three years and the company now boasts world standard building costs. There are two main worries. First, that BAA's airport retailing investment could hit diminishing returns as passengers presumably have finite budgets. Second, that the group's move into factory outlets could prove misguided, given its poor record of diversification outside airports. Still, Sir John is determined to proceed on a suck-it-and-see basis and would be prepared to pull projects if rates of return failed to meet expectations. The expansion programme seems to be in safe hands.</p>

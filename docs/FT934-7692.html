			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (37): A feeble springboard - China's inadequate infrastructure has emerged as a serious constraint on its future non-inflationary development / Urgent need to upgrade road, rail and port facilities CHINA has embarked on the world's largest expansion in railways, roads, ports, electric power capacity and telecommunications. By the end of the century, however, the nation will still be unable to meet demand for these key services, thereby capping the China's ability both to grow rapidly and maintain a semblance of price stability. Financing the country's upgrading of infrastructure resources has also emerged as a pressing problem for the authorities. Central government revenues - the mainstay of investment a decade ago - have been eroded by the growing fiscal power of the provinces. Beijing's loss of financial control - which may be reversed once planned tax reforms and revenue sharing agreements are in place - has also hampered coordination of infrastructure development. Local interests have sometimes taken precedence over national requirements. In addition to this, the inefficiency of China's banking system in marshalling domestic savings for investment has also retarded development. Again, this may be addressed by planned reforms of the banking system. Foreign investment has become an important source of finance for the development of infrastructure. Such are the needs for increased capacity that China has been forced to allow direct foreign ownership of roads, local railways and power stations. According to one estimate, compiled by Crosby Securities, a Hong Kong stock brokerage, the share of foreign investment in China's expenditure on infrastructure development rose to 13 per cent in 1990 from 2 per cent in 1982. This trend is expected to continue. What follows is a selective look at the current infrastructure bottle-necks besetting the Chinese economy, the government's plans for future development and the difficulties it is encountering in realising its plans. RAILWAYS. About 70 per cent of China's freight is carried on its 53,000km railway system. In the 8th five-year plan (1991-95), the Ministry of Railways hopes to increase the network by 16,300km, or 30 per cent, and rolling stock by 20 per cent. According to the World Bank China's railway network is sufficient to meet only 60 per cent of industry's demand for rail services. Mr Tu Yourui, vice-minister of railways, says network can satisfy 70 per cent of demand, but that 'in some areas, especially the main line to south China, bottlenecks mean that we can meet only 40 to 50 per cent of demand.' The ministry plans to upgrade the Beijing to Kowloon line to a double track railway by the end of 1995. It recently mobilised a workforce of 200,000 to accelerate the building of the line, which has encountered difficulties on the Guangdong-Guangxi border in the south where 300km of line has to pass through mountains and cross rivers. Inflation has affected the ministry's ability to meet the 8th five year plan for rail construction. Its original Yn100bn budget for capital construction is up to 40 per cent less than it now needs. This has prompted calls for a review of its very low tariff structure. It costs just 5.3 fen (about six US cents) to transport one tonne of freight one kilometre. Mr Tu estimates that a one fen increase in the tariff would earn the ministry an extra Yn11bn a year in revenue. But the coal industry is the main impediment to increasing tariffs. Half of the freight shipped by rail is coal for the electric power industry. Coal industry losses grew to Yn11.9bn in 1990 (from Yn1.25bn in 1985) and it is doubtful if the industry could shoulder its share of the price rise. Foreign investment in railway lines has become one way of addressing the financing problem, but so far only for city and intra-regional lines. In Zhejiang and Fujian provinces as well as Chongqing city in Sichuan, foreign investors are developing rail systems. In Zhejiang and Fujian they own equity in the lines and are able to develop land adjacent to the railways. PORTS. China's big 8 ports - from Dalian in the north east to Guangzhou in the south - handle 80 per cent of China's seaborne trade. According to the ministry of communications, the volume of trade currently being handled is 20 per cent in excess of their design capacity. Over the 1991-95 period China hopes to build an additional 180 berths (100 of which are deepwater berths) and increase capacity by 170m tonnes. The ministry has set a target of doubling China's ports capacity. Today, 50 per cent of ships calling at China's ports have to wait days before they can be unloaded. Beijing has decentralised decision making on ports development to the provincial and city level. In Shanghai and Shenzhen, city authorities have brought in Hong Kong investors to upgrade container port facilities, with these investors owning between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of these facilities. ROADS. China's road network is one of the most under-developed in the developing world. Density of highways is a fifth of that in India. At the end of 1992 China had 1m kilometres of roads, only 6,000 of which were class 1 or class 2 highways - properly paved and consisting of more than one lane each way. China's 30,000km national truck road network is operating in excess of its design capacity. A further 250,000km of roads have reached or exceed 60 per cent of their design life. The ministry of communications estimates that upkeep for these roads alone is costing Yn1bn a year. The ministry has ambitious plans for the future development of China's road network. Over the next 30 years it wants to see 30,000km of highways linking China's main urban centres. It is unable to estimate the cost of this roads programme, due to price variations throughout the country for land and materials acquisition. Providing the needed infrastructure for shipping goods throughout China is a daunting enough task. Addressing the social infrastructure needs of the cities is just as challenging. According to Mr Wang Guangtao, a senior official at the ministry of construction, China's cities produce 85m tonnes of sewage and waste water a day, of which only 17 per cent can be treated. The hope is that by 2000, 25 per cent can be treated - 'this is a big task for us,' he adds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INFRASTRUCTURE: HOW CHINA COMPARES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country/territory         Power          Phone     Kilometres                     consumption      lines per       of roads                  Kw hr per head     100 people     per sq. km.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong                 4,089           38.0           1.36 Singapore                 4,822           35.0           4.50 Malaysia                  1,141            7.3           0.07 Thailand                    711            1.8           0.09 Indonesia                   211            0.5           0.03 Philippines                 418            1.0           0.53 CHINA                       550            1.1           0.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Crosby Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle slips to 'satisfactory' Pounds 92m POOR WEATHER conditions and pressure on cereal sweetener margins were mainly to blame for a slight fall in interim profits at Tate &amp; Lyle, from Pounds 94.7m to Pounds 92m pre-tax. The shares fell 9p to 401p. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, predicted a 'satisfactory year in the prevailing conditions'. He said the six month period, to March 28, had been a good one in terms of enlarging the group's foundations. Mr Shaw said that the acquisition last year of Bundaberg in Australia gave the group a way into the south-east Asian market, and the company had more than covered its financing costs. In the half-year Tate invested more than Pounds 30m in central Europe which Mr Shaw said was an important market. The group has high hopes for two products - Splenda and Stellar  - which are low calorie alternatives to sugar and fat. Splenda is being sold in Canada and is awaiting approval from the US authorities, which Mr Shaw hoped would come this year. A number of competitors had appeared to Stellar and the build-up in production would be slower than earlier hoped. Group sales were almost 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.63bn and operating profits were up 2.5 per cent to Pounds 115.6m. Associates chipped in Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.3m) but higher net interest charges of Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 19.4m) cut the pre-tax figure. The tax rate was lower at 26 per cent (30 per cent) and Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said he expected that rate to apply for the year. Minority interests took Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Earnings per share were slightly higher at 13.2p (13.1p) on a fully diluted basis. The interim dividend is increased by 8.1 per cent to 4p (3.7p). Trading profits fell in two important divisions, both in the US, with the impact softened by exchange gains. The US sugar division saw a fall from Pounds 23.7m to Pounds 17.6m, caused by poor weather affecting sugar beet which was awaiting processing at Western Sugar. Profits at Western fell 80 per cent, but were somewhat offset by a good result from Domino Sugar, based in the eastern US. Also in the US the cereal sweeteners and starches business saw profits down from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 29.9m, with margins cut from 11.9 to 9.5 per cent, as cool weather and overcapacity affected volumes. Pre-interest profits from the Canadian sugar business rose 15 per cent to Pounds 4.7m; in the UK sugar profits were up 6.4 per cent to Pounds 25.1m; Bundaberg made Pounds 5.3m before financing costs and sugar profits from elsewhere, such as Europe and Africa, were up 39 per cent at Pounds 8.5m. The European starch business increased profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 26.2m. Profits from sugar by-products, such as molasses, rose to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 9.1m). Commodity trading made Pounds 100,000 (loss Pounds 300,000) and other activities, which includes Splenda, lost Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.7m). COMMENT After five years of double-digit earnings growth Tate can be forgiven a period of consolidation. There is plenty to look forward to in the longer term if the promise of Splenda and Stellar is realised and Tate wins its share of the annual growth in the world sugar market. But meanwhile, this year's profits depend heavily on the weather, and are likely to be a few million pounds one side or the other of last year's Pounds 234.6m. If they were unchanged, the lower tax rate would lift earnings a touch, giving a p/e of about 11.8. The shares are unlikely to do well until there are signs of a return to growth.</p>

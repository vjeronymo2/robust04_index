			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL GROUP TO MEET WITH NHL FRANCHISE COMMITTEE TODAY  </P> <P> Harry Cooper, the man behind the drive to bring a major league hockey franchise  to San Diego, should know more about the city's chances of landing an NHL  expansion team after today's meeting with a league subcommittee in New York.  </P> <P> Cooper, attorney Scott Wolfe and an undisclosed number of San Diego  representatives will meet in an informal question-and-answer session with the  league's Franchise and Market Analysis Committee at NHL headquarters to present  their plans to bring an expansion team to San Diego, preferably no sooner than  1996-97, according to Cooper.  </P> <P> "We'll tell them what we have to offer and what the business community can  offer," Cooper said. "We can't guarantee that (the awarding of a franchise)  will happen (this year), but we're trying."  </P> <P> The San Diego Sports Arena is too small for a major league hockey team and part  of Cooper's pitch will be a new 18,000-seat arena that could be operable as  early as 1994, but 1996 is a more realistic target date.  </P> <P> "We couldn't do it by 1992-93," Cooper said. "We wouldn't get investors to take  that kind of risk."  </P> <P> Wolfe, the La Jolla attorney who put together the Padre ownership group, said  building the arena and bringing a hockey team to San Diego is a joint venture.  </P> <P> "They go hand in hand," Wolfe said. "The focus is that we need a new major  league team to justify the new arena. Then, when plans for the arena are more  definitive, we can have a team to move into it."  </P> <P> NHL spokesman Gerry Helper said the 12-man committee, co-chaired by Chicago  Blackhawk owner Bill Wirtz and NHL President John Ziegler, will report details  of the session to the league's governing board, but it won't make suggestions.  </P> <P> Cooper said he expects today's 35-40 minute session to be one of several  meetings before the board's Dec. 4-8 meetings in Palm Beach, Fla., where two to  six expansion franchises are expected to be awarded.  </P> <P> "Two is a speculative guess," Helper said, "but there's always the chance that  they could add more."  </P> <P> The 21-team NHL, which has not expanded since 1979, has set its sights on a  28-team league by 2000. San Jose has already been awarded a franchise and will  compete in the 1991-92 season.  </P> <P> Of the original 11 groups that paid a $100,000 application fee -- up to $65,000  of it is refundable at the board's discretion -- nine from eight cities remain.  </P> <P> Southern California is considered to have two bids. In addition to the group  led by Cooper, Jerry Buss, owner of the Lakers and the former owner of the NHL  Kings, has applied for a franchise in an undisclosed Southern California  location. Groups representing Houston, Seattle, Miami, St. Petersburg and  Tampa, Fla., Ottawa, and Hamilton, Canada, have also applied.  </P> <P> Two International Hockey League cities, Phoenix and Milwaukee, have withdrawn  their applications. Phoenix withdrew its bid a week after it filed and  Milwaukee, considered to have had a lock on an expansion franchise partly  because of its state-of-the-art arena, pulled out last week.  </P> <P> Lloyd Pettit, owner of Milwaukee's IHL team, and the Bradley Center -- where  the Bucks play -- said the $50 million franchise fee was unrealistic.  </P> <P> "Put yourself into the position of trying to run a major league hockey club on  a loss basis for five to 10 years, even if you come up with five or six players  who might be considered major league," Pettit said in announcing his decision.  </P> <P> But the $50 million is only a start. There's a $5 million line of credit, up to  $10 million in start-up costs and the recommended 10,000 season-ticket  requirement that applicants must produce.  </P> <P> "We do exceed the $100 million required by the NHL," said Cooper, who hopes  Pettit's withdrawal would give the remaining applicants some leverage in trying  to persuade the NHL to cut its fees for an expansion franchise. "Now's the time  to tell them. Milwaukee saying those things makes it easier for us to say maybe  they're trying to get too much."  </P> <P> With Seattle's proximity to Vancouver, San Diego's to Los Angeles and San Jose  in between them all, the West Coast may have the inside track for a new  franchise. But Seattle is having trouble finding an ownership group, and has  hired the First National Bank of Chicago to find one.  </P> <P> "We want to expand on the West Coast," one league source said. "I think San  Diego has a better chance than a lot of people think."  </P> <P> As long as it can find the capital. Cooper said a core ownership group of 10 to  12 investors, representing the business, real estate development, banking and  political communities of the city, has been identified from an interested group  of 20 to 30 businessmen.  </P> <P> "We've been working with a cross section of business people," said Cooper, who  will present financial portfolios to the committee. "But no one wants to put  their name up for disclosure."  </P> <P> Cooper has said he would be interested in a negotiable 10% ownership, but he is  still looking for a general managing partner. Of the two he has in mind, one  has been identified as Howard Baldwin, a sports consultant and movie producer  in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Baldwin, an alternate on the NHL Board of Governors for Minnesota, is in the  process of selling his 24.5% interest in the North Stars.  </P></p>

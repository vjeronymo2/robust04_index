			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Opec members targeted in futures drive International banks and commodity exchanges have launched a concerted effort to persuade big petroleum producing countries to use futures contracts and forward sales of oil to hedge against sharp falls in oil revenues. A number of separate approaches are being made to producers, with members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at the top of the target list. The International Petroleum Exchange in London says it has been encouraged by recent contacts with Opec members. Mr Peter Wildblood, chief executive, says 'producing countries want to understand better how the market can be used.' Although no Opec member has so far committed itself to a hedging programme, Mr Wildblood believes it will only be a matter of time before one does. The IPE is stressing to producers that use of the futures' markets can give them better control over their national budgets in a period of oil price volatility. It cites the example of Mexico, a non-Opec exporter which initiated a hedging programme in 1990-91. It cost about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) to implement but saved the country about Dollars 800m when world oil prices fell. Many Opec members have had to make sharp budget cuts over the past 18 months, as prices fell from around Dollars 20 a barrel at the start of 1993 to a low of about Dollars 13 last February. They have since rallied to around Dollars 18 a barrel, but cumulative Opec revenues in May, for example, were still more than Dollars 10.5bn, or 19 per cent lower than cumulative reviews a year earlier, according to the International Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. Mr Wildblood concedes that officials in some Opec states still view futures markets as centres of speculation and 'the work of the devil'. But he counters that 80 per cent of the IPE volume is accounted for by oil companies and other industry-related institutions. 'There is very little speculative interest.' Another scheme which is being promoted in Opec capitals is based on the present sale for cash of oil for future delivery. Mr Ibrahim Kamel, an Egyptian banker and politician who heads the Jersey-based Petroleum Securities Corporation, said forward sales would be packaged as a negotiable security known as a petroleum delivery certificate that would carry a fixed return. He said the cash raised by such sales, in the range of Dollars 500m to Dollars 2bn, would fund energy infrastructure projects in the selling country. Another national petroleum company would act as a delivery guarantor. Investment bank Morgan Grenfell and Nomura, the Japanese securities house, are understood to be considering participating in the programme. Those advocating Opec's use of futures markets or forward sales claim they would have little impact on long-term prices. Officials at Opec's headquarters in Vienna confirm that they are making a detailed study of the oil futures' markets. But they say the exercise is to evaluate the impact of the futures markets on real prices, and not to prepare Opec producers for using them.</p>

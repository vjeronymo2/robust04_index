As compared with last year, the number  of those ill with syphilis increased ten-fold, and with  gonorrhea, by twenty per cent.    According to the data of the dermatovenerologic dispensary,  the majority of the patients are nonworking individuals and  students up to thirty years of age. With regard to the primary  sources of infection, these were, in the opinion of physicians,  emigrants from China and the Transcaucasian republics who enter  Russia without the appropriate medical records.    Director of the City Health Department, Margarita Khaltaeva,  sees the legalization of prostitution, the opening up of  anonymous treatment of venereal diseases, and the creation of a  morals police as a possible avenue to the correction of the  situation. She spoke at a meeting of the Minor Council of  PeopleUs Deputies of Ulan Ude regarding the idea of opening a  brothel in the capital of Buratiya.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Swan takeover talks make slow progress Mr Iskandar Safa, the sole prospective bidder for Swan Hunter as a going concern, yesterday arrived for talks aimed at saving the Tyneside shipbuilder from closure. Although the talks in London were described as constructive they ended inconclusively after more than four hours, Chris Tighe writes. The meeting between Price Waterhouse, the receiver, and Mr Safa, principal shareholder of Soffia, the parent company of patrol boat builder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, was organised by shipyard unions. This was after Price Waterhouse said CMN's offer - in which Pounds 3.5m is guaranteed - was well below Swans' Pounds 7.5m break-up value. The two sides indicated it would be two to three weeks before it would be clear whether agreement could be reached. This would make it impossible to achieve the deadline of noon tomorrow, set by the Ministry of Defence, for placing the Pounds 6m, three-month refit of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Olwen with Swan Hunter. An industrial tribunal in Newcastle upon Tyne today begins a test case hearing at which unions representing former Swans employees will contest the Department of Employment's handling of payments made following an award by a tribunal last year. The award was to compensate 430 workers, made redundant just after the receivers' arrival in May last year, for the lack of a 90-day consultative period. However many of the workers received little or no payout. The unions are challenging the employment department's decision to base its calculations on eight weeks rather than 12, and to deduct money paid in lieu of notice and wage arrears payments.</p>

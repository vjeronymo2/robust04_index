			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Myong-ku from Berlin] </F>   [Text] North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said  that North Korea will not accept nuclear inspection and will  resolutely deal with outside sanctions including those by the  United Nations. Kim Yong-nam who arrived in Berlin on 9 June  without giving any explanation claimed that since North Korea  withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it has no  duty to implement the nuclear inspection.    Kim Yong-nam said that North Korea will receive nuclear  inspection only when a package settlement is reached regarding  the nuclear issue through DPRK-U.S. talks and when North Korea's  special status is dissolved.    During the news conference held at the second North Korean  mission in Berlin, Kim Yong-nam emphasized that since the United  States is the ringleader and offender who introduced the nuclear  issue to the Korean peninsula and since North Korea is the  victim, the nuclear issue can be resolved only through talks  with the United States.</p>

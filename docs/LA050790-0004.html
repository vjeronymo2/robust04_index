			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S REPORT CARD TIME FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The first statewide attempt to make schools more accountable to parents will  turn up beginning today in the mailboxes of almost 120,000 residents with  children in San Diego city schools.  </P> <P> The San Diego district -- the state's second-largest -- is sending out its  version of the "accountability report card," a performance snapshot of each of  the district's 152 schools that is mandated under Proposition 98, approved by  California voters in November, 1988.  </P> <P> In return for guaranteeing California public schools a fixed percentage of  state revenues each year, Proposition 98 promised parents they would receive  annual reports of how well the schools are carrying out their educational  mission with the almost $17 billion allotted them.  </P> <P> Already, smaller districts throughout the county have disseminated their report  cards, which must include comments in 13 educational areas at any given school,  including student test achievement, dropout rates, class sizes, teacher  evaluations and use of special money.  </P> <P> So far, the reactions of teachers, principals and parents have been mixed, with  a consensus that while the documents provide useful information, overall they  do not represent real "report cards" in the sense that schools admit specific  weaknesses as well as touting their strengths.  </P> <P> "I think they're informative, especially if parents haven't gone to school  meetings and aren't really involved with the schools," said Mary Lou Renckly,  whose child attends San Pasqual High School in Escondido, which has already  issued its four-page document. "We are involved but I think we learned some  things about test scores, for example.  </P> <P> "But it's not really a report card in that they are not grading teachers or  discussing the actual curriculum," added Renckly, who also substitutes at the  elementary level in Escondido. "I think that might be real touchy and might not  go over well at all."  </P> <P> A San Diego middle school principal admitted that some parents probably will  see the district's standardized six-page cards as "a whitewash" because in many  areas schools avoid being specific, especially regarding declining test scores  or teacher evaluations.  </P> <P> "I think we would have improved our credibility if we had made these 'warts and  all' ", said the principal, who asked not to be identified. "Let's be up front  about both our problems and our successes."  </P> <P> State School Supt. Bill Honig, who sponsored Proposition 98 and pointedly  included the report card provision, said that districts still have "some work  to do" on the best way to carry out the requirement.  </P> <P> "Generally, I think people believe it is a good idea to be held accountable in  exchange for a guarantee of funds," Honig said. "Accountability is a great  management tool because over time, it requires you to examine what is not  working if, for example, writing test scores do not go up.  </P> <P> "But I think we are still in the developmental stages" in finding out how  schools should be rewarded if they do a good job and what hard questions to  raise if they do not, Honig said. He said the difficulty in sending out a true  picture of school performance reflects the larger debate going on in many  districts -- including San Diego -- over how to better hold principals and  teachers accountable for achievements and failures.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of spirited debate within many districts when the state sent  out its suggested guidelines," said Doug Langdon, a trustee of the South Bay  school district and public information officer for the San Diego County Office  of Education.  </P> <P> "Compare them to corporate annual reports, when those with poor earnings try to  put the best face on the situation . . . . It stands to reason that those  schools with poor 'earnings' will try to put forward the best possible face."  </P> <P> A sample of report cards countywide show that some districts -- and some  schools within districts -- are being more candid than others.  </P> <P> In San Diego Unified, scores on Carver Elementary's statewide achievement  tests, known as CAP, have declined over the past several years, and the trend  lines on testing charts required on all city schools' cards show Carver is  below districtwide levels.  </P> <P> But in its text, the school says nothing about any decline, stating only that  Carver "strives toward academic excellence . . . test scores are only one  reflection of student progress towards becoming a literate and thinking person  . . . many teachers are exploring core literature and reviewing learning  styles. As a result, we hope to see improvement in all academic areas."  </P> <P> In contrast, Adams Elementary admits in its text that its scores have dropped  during the past two years, and tells parents that its loss in 1988 of special  federal money to hire extra teachers and materials may be one factor.  </P> <P> "That year -- 1987 -- scores reached an all-time high, the school was  designated a Distinguished School by the state, and then the federal money was  withdrawn. Hopefully, we are anticipating renewal of that program in the fall  of 1990."  </P> <P> The cards in the Oceanside Unified School District were handled differently,  with the district rephrasing the state reporting indicators into questions that  parents often ask.  </P> <P> At San Rafael Elementary, the report offers detailed information on test scores  for the past three years, not only comparing the school's trends but also  comparing the school against all state schools. The report also offers details  about teacher training, about student reward plans, about the school's  discipline plan and drug education program, and about sixth graders with poor  attendance who are using a new plan to improve achievement.  </P> <P> "We wanted more than just boiler-plate," said Bruce Cunningham, Oceanside's  coordinator of instruction. "You don't want them too long," Cunningham said,  noting that the district's cards run 14 pages, among the bulkier in the state.  "But we do want parents to understand what we are doing and understand that we  are supposed to be improving, and our focus should be on what our next steps  are going to be.  </P> <P> "Some of our schools were uncomfortable about reporting test trends since they  do not score high, but our task force (which drew up the format) felt that it  is helpful nevertheless to see comparisons."  </P> <P> Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego Teachers Assn., which represents San  Diego Unified, said the cards "now look like public-relations gloss" but  cautioned that they are only a first attempt.  </P> <P> "They do need to get better and to say more things, such as breaking down class  size numbers more precisely so that a parent can tell if the smallest classes  are for gifted students, for example, or for English classes, or whatever,"  Boyle said.  </P> <P> But Boyle expressed concern with any move to specify how many teachers at a  school receive "needs improvement" evaluations, although parents who advised  the district in drawing up their cards suggested that data.  </P> <P> "Sure, we have some bad teachers, but I don't think the district has a good  evaluation system existing today" that fairly indicates who is good or bad, and  therefore would not want such information on the cards, Boyle said.  </P> <P> San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant hopes that parents will read the cards  and attend special meetings that each school will be holding later this month.  </P> <P> "Sure, the question of honesty has come up because the prose is upbeat and  positive," Payzant said. "But in several categories, the quantifiable data  speaks for itself, good or bad, and can't really be masked.  </P> <P> "So if parents come out to meetings and ask questions, they can be a real  catalyst to push schools to do better and the cards will have real value, and  not something that everyone will see as simply an annual ritual to be  resented."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae said Monday that the government recognizes the need  for U.S. forces in South Korea to deploy Patriot missiles, but  said Seoul presently has no plans to purchase them.    Deployment of Patriot missiles in Korea as part of weapons  modernization by U.S. forces here would greatly deter the threat  of war on the peninsula by strengthening their defense  capability, according to Yi's script of prepared answers for  Monday's National Assembly interpellation.    Although in favor of having Patriot missiles in Korea, Yi  denied reports that Seoul would purchase Patriots as well as  Apache helicopters, saying the Defense Ministry has no such  plans at present. He said the ministry will conduct a  comparative study of similar equipment from around the world to  decide on the best possible defense system if modernization is  deemed necessary.    Yi said the Seoul-Washington annual military exercise "Team  Spirit" was the most powerful counterbalance against North  Korea's nuclear development program. Therefore, it is  undesirable for Seoul to first propose suspension of Team  Spirit, he added. He admitted that the ministry has drawn up a  readiness plan as the South is always under threat of a North  Korean attack. South Korean and U.S. intelligence officers meet  twice every year to study and appraise North Korea's military  power, he said.</p>

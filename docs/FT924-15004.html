			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Manx economic unit to be set up A CENTRAL economic strat-egic unit will be set up to advise the Isle of Man government, according to the island government's 1992 policy report published yesterday. Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said the unit would comprise government officers and should be able to co-opt expertise from out-side. He said that this year's report was compiled against a very different economic environment from last year's, although the island - which is a Crown dependency - had not suffered the same degree of recession as the UK. Against the background of economic turbulence in the UK, he said, 'we cannot rely on an expanding revenue with which to fund simultaneously reductions in taxation, expansion of services and substantial transfers to reserves'. The island sets its own rate of income tax - currently 10 per cent - and manages its own internal economic and political affairs. It is not part of the European Community but is linked to it via protocols through the UK. The report said Manx government policy would be to promote the island as 'offshore Europe'. The formation of the European Economic Area would increase the number of countries with which the Isle of Man may trade freely. Manx gross national product rose 4 per cent last year to Pounds 509m, but has slowed and is expected to rise by about 1 per cent this year. The finance sector remains the highest income producer, with 34 per cent of GNP, but the report affirms the government's commitment to diversify the economy. However, the government feels 'it would be unrealistic and ultimately detrimental to the island to artificially limit expansion of successful businesses in the finance industry because other industries are more seriously affected by external recessionary pressures'. A heavy legislative load is predicted for the next three years, with at least 70 bills scheduled to go before the island's parliament on issues including financial and fiscal matters, health, environment, individual rights and law and order. A bill mirroring Westminster's Police and Criminal Evidence Act is on the agenda for the coming year. Plans are also under way for a statutory committee of lay people to advise on policing matters and an independent commissioner to be appointed to investigate complaints against the police. One item expected to go through before the end of this year is the restoration to Manx residents of the right of petition to the European Commission on Human Rights.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Letter: ITV survival Sir, Your welcome leader supporting a change to the ITV ownership rules ('British TV thinks big', June 17) did not include what I believe is the strongest argument for change. In a more commercial world, faced with significant and growing commercial opposition, an ITV run by 15 separate companies has virtually no chance of survival. In the new world ITV will need to develop policy and make decisions at a speed that 15 companies simply cannot move at. Greg Dyke, managing director, London Weekend Television, London SE1 9LT</p>

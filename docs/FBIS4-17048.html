			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 21, BNS -- During its extraordinary  plenary meeting Wednesday [20 April] night, the Latvian Saeima  (parliament) did not authorize the Latvian president, Guntis  Ulmanis, to sign Latvian-Russian initialed interstate agreements  because the Latvian National Independence Movement and the  Homeland and Freedom factions left the plenary meeting's hall  before the voting for the draft resolution had started.    After a long debate, when voting for separate items, the  Saeima accepted the Latvia's Way drafted resolution providing  for the the president to be authorized to sign the draft  agreements, initialed March 15, on complete withdrawal of Russia  army from Latvia, the withdrawal conditions, terms, order and  army's legal status during the withdrawal; on Skrunda radar  station's legal status during its temporary functioning on  Latvia's soil; on Russian militaries' and their family members'  protection till the complete army withdrawal.    The Saeima also supported the draft resolution's 2nd part  providing for the Cabinet to form an experts' group to revise  the draft agreement on Russian retired militaries' and their  family members' social protection. According to the  international legal norms, this document must promote the  elimination of the occupation consequences in Latvia. Becuse  the two above mentioned Saeima factions left the plenary meeting  before the voting, the final decision could not be accepted  because of lack of quorum.    After the plenary meeting, President Guntis Ulmanis refused  to comment the situation.</p>

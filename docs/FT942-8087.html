			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Brussels to name single-market laggards The European Commission is to publish a rogues gallery of member states with the worst records on adopting EU legislation, amid concerns that offending nations are holding up completion of the single market. A senior single market official said: 'We are going to name names, and publish tables that show, in declining order, the performance by the different states in different areas. It is time people realised who has done what they were supposed to do, and who hasn't' The use of public humiliation tactics to highlight performance in specific areas, such as banking, comes 18 months after barriers to trade and free movement in the EU were supposed to end. The move is part of an overall effort by Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, internal market commissioner, to maintain momentum behind Europe's grand project. Other measures include the launch of 'internal market weeks' in the 12 member states, during which citizens and enterprises will have access to Commission experts via a telephone hotline. It will also provide feedback for the Commission on how the project is working. Although four-fifths of the necessary legislation has been adopted by member states, the Commission is concerned that in certain areas - particularly banking, other financial services and public procurement - countries have dragged their feet. The exercise is planned as a follow-up to next month's ministerial meeting in Luxembourg to discuss the internal market. Generally, assessments show that Denmark and the UK have been quickest to adopt Commission legislation on the single market, while Greece and Spain have been the laggards. Italy is somewhere in the middle. An analysis of individual sectors shows sharply diverging performances. Germany, for example, has still to adopt nine directives on public procurement. Greece and Germany have also been sent warning letters over their failure to adopt certain banking directives. 'From June onwards we will turn up the spotlight and really try to push people to finish all the unfinished business,' the official said. 'In the past, people have tried to avoid being bottom of the league. Now we are going to move the debate away from who is top and who is bottom to focusing on what is happening in certain key areas.' Another area of particular concern to single market officials is the high number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade. There is also significant grievance over the failure of member states to mutually recognise national product standards. The official added: 'We have a problem with mutual recognition where people are supposed to accept products that have been recognised in one country in another. It is clear that this principle is very foreign to your average local inspector.'</p>

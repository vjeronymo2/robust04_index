			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cullens Declines in rental contributions and profit on sale of franchises, together with increased administration costs, had a severe impact on operating profits at Cullens Holdings in the year to February 28. However, exceptional credits cushioned the fall at the pre-tax level with profits of Pounds 401,000, against Pounds 608,000. The group, which operates in the grocery trade through its own and franchised outlets, increased network turnover to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 20.6m) including VAT, and retailing turnover to Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 2.44m) excluding tax. Earnings per share were 0.8p (1.5p) and the dividend is again 0.5p.</p>

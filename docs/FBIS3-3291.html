Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal  party committee, stressed in his speech: We must uphold the  party's leadership and strengthen party building in the course  of accelerating reform and development. In this year's  organizational work, the task of prime importance is to  continuously exert strenuous efforts to firmly grasp the party's  ideological and theoretical construction and the building of  leading bodies and to guarantee the implementation of the  central authorities' major reform policy decisions and the  capital's stability and unity.    First of all, Chen Xitong fully affirmed the prominent  achievements in Tianjin's organizational work, and at the same  time, he pointed out: This is a crucial year for  comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Making all-out  efforts to safeguard the capital's political and social  stability and guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the  central authorities' major reform policy decisions is a major  matter of prime importance in the work of Beijing Municipality  and in organizational work. The organizational work should  serve this overall situation, and strenuous efforts should be  made to grasp two basic construction. First, we should pay  attention to ideological and theoretical construction,  strengthen study of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, strive to raise the ideological and theoretical  level of party-member cadres, formulate plans, and provide  evaluations. Second, we should pay attention to the building of  leading bodies, and after selecting a number of outstanding  young cadres as the new leading bodies during the district and  county end-of-term elections, be determined to select a number  of outstanding young cadres for the leading bodies of the  municipal party committee and of various departments,  committees, offices, and bureaus of the municipal government,  and install the echelon well. Meanwhile, it is necessary to  strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations, with  an emphasis in consolidating the backward party branches and  strengthening the building of party branches in three types of  foreign-funded enterprises, people-run enterprises, high-tech  enterprises, and various new economic organizations. Chen  Xitong stressed: Strengthening party building is a fundamental  task in consolidating the party's leadership and guaranteeing a  long period of peace and stability in the country and we must  grasp it firmly and successfully.    Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee, delivered a report at the conference. He summarized  last year's work and put forth this year's tasks.    In 1993, in carrying out the municipal organizational work,  we persisted in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts,  conscientiously implementing all tasks set forth by the 14th  party congress and the seventh municipal party congress,  realized the municipal party committee's demand of  comprehensively overpassing the work of last year, and achieved  a series of breakthroughs.    Leading cadres enhanced awareness in the study of the theory  on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and achieved  noticeable results in this aspect; the selection of young cadres  was strengthened and the structure of leading bodies greatly  improved; the contingent of reserve cadres was expanded and  their management strengthened; and the exchange of cadres  increased, the channels rose in number, and the scope expanded.  We summarized a number of typical examples in building the  grass-roots party organizations and consolidated a batch of  backward party branches; selected "10 outstanding" communist  party members and cultivated an image of communist party members  of the new period; and began to conduct organizational reform in  party and government organs, and achieved progress in  experimenting with the public service system.    The ideas for the municipal organizational work in 1994 are  to take Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the  guidance, further emancipate the mind, act in connection with  the party's central task, strengthen and improve party building,  strive to make new breakthroughs in strengthening the building  of leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations and  expanding strength in reform of the cadre personnel system, and  provide an organizational guarantee for acccelerating the  development of the socialist market economy, fulfilling all  reform and construction tasks of this year, and realizing the  objective of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule.

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Merrydown cuts workforce by 15% Merrydown, the specialist Sussex-based cider maker, is to reduce its workforce by 15 per cent at an estimated cost of Pounds 300,000. It has also appointed a new finance director, Mr Stephen Burke, formerly acquisitions manager with Dunhill, the tobacco and luxury goods company. The announcement follows a profits warning in February and the departure of Mr Michael O'Driscoll, finance director, in March. Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said 30 of Merrydown's 195 employees had been made redundant. The sales force has been cut from 25 to 14, with the regional sales network being axed and the remainder concentrating on key accounts such as supermarkets. The company said cost savings from the measures were expected to amount to more than Pounds 1m. In the year to March 1993, pre-tax profits were down to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.9m). Merrydown's shares were unchanged yesterday at 149p, compared with a peak of 405p in October 1990.</p>

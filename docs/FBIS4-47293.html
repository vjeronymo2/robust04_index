			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A.S. Batrakov, candidate of technical sciences, </F> and V.P. Ivanov, candidate of technical sciences, All-Russian  Science Center ``State Institute of Optics imeni S.I.  Vavilov'';UDC 621.397.3:681.3]    [Abstract] Recognition of three-dimensional objects on a  perspective image of a real locale is examined, the process  involving detection and subsequent identification of an a'priori  known object on a real image possibly much larger than that  object. The basic procedure is to construct a reference image of  the sought object and then find the latter on a large image.  Inasmuch as it is not otherwise feasible to store reference  images covering the entire gamut of conditions (aspect, position  of light source, focal length of lens, resolution), automatic  recognition by means of three-dimensional computer graphics is  being resorted to so that both the locale and the shape of an  object can be described mathematically in a form readily  yielding quasi-photographic likenesses under practically any  conditions. Successful computer-aided simulation of reference  images requires storing in the computer memory not the numerous  reference images of the sought object but only its shape and  optical characteristics, a single reference image then being  generated by a synthesizer under predetermined conditions. The  procedure is demonstrated on automatic object detection and  recognition with the aid of video sensors on an aircraft in  flight. For reconstruction of a whole scene, each individual  three-dimensional object or group of objects is fictitiously  enveloped with a convex polyhedral shell. As an example is  considered a hexahedral shell with the base on the ground, the  parallel to it roof in the air, and the lateral four other faces  of equal height h in vertical position. The calculations are  programmed so that the width of the shell will, depending on the  sun's position, automatically increase so as to optimally  envelop not only the three-dimensional object but also its  two-dimensional shadow. For this purpose the computer solves a  system of four equations in space coordinates  X[.sub]i[/],Y[.sub]i[/] of the four base vertices i= 1(1)4  and space coordinates X[.sub]sun[/],  Y[.sub]sun[/],Z[.sub]sun[/] of the sun, with the height h  of  the shell given. The algorithm of image synthesis yields first  an image of the entire locale without objects in it and then  adds zone-by-zone the images of objects, including their shadows  and other graphically describable items, each within its  fictitious enveloping shell. The algorithm includes also  calculation of the image brightness based on information about  the brightness of pixels, unless Nyquist's rule is observed and  the space frequency of readout from the discretized locale image  is accordingly at least twice as high than the spatial  discretization frequency of that image.

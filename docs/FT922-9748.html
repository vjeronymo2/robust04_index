			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong runs into profit-taking WALL STREET'S record close overnight had only a limited effect on the Pacific Rim yesterday, as Tokyo remained shut for the Golden Week holidays. Seoul was closed for Children's Day, while Bombay was closed to enable brokers to complete business done in the last two weeks. Bangkok was also shut for a public holiday. Dealers feared that an anti-government protest, planned to coincide with Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon's policy speech to parliament, could prompt a fall in share prices when the market reopens today. HONG KONG ran into profit-taking after its recent record-breaking run. The Hang Seng index climbed more than 60 points in the first 15 minutes of trading, but was then pushed into negative territory before closing a net 17.43 up at 5,631.21. Turnover was still heavy, at HKDollars 4.3bn, after HKDollars 4.8bn. Among utilities, Hong Kong Electric put on 10 cents to HKDollars 17.10 and Hong Kong Telecom rose 25 cents to HKDollars 9.70. Jardine Matheson slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 52.50, Sun Hung Kai Properties shed 50 cents to HKDollars 31.50, and Hang Seng Bank lost 25 cents to HKDollars 43.75. AUSTRALIA ended firmer but after retreating from the day's high in the wake of comments by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, suggesting that interest rates would only be cut by a half-point rather than the full point the market had been expecting. The All Ordinaries index ended just 1.1 ahead at 1,665.5, after reaching 1,678.4, in turnover of ADollars 228m, against ADollars 166m. BHP slipped 6 cents to ADollars 14.06, but News Corp gained a further 56 cents to end at the day's best of ADollars 20.50. NEW ZEALAND gained ground but slipped from the day's high following light profit-taking in Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt Harvey, which have both advanced strongly in recent weeks. The NZSE-40 index moved forward to 1,478.37 before finishing at 1,470.12, up 2.58 on balance. Turnover expanded to NZDollars 28.4m from NZDollars 20.3m. Fletcher touched NZDollars 3.58 before ending down 2 cents at NZDollars 3.50, while Carter Holt reached NZDollars 2.58 before closing 2 cents off at NZDollars 2.55. Telecom benefited from the rally on Wall Street, recovering 4 cents to NZDollars 1.99. KUALA LUMPUR closed broadly higher as smaller investors joined the recent rally, concentrating on stocks in the second and third tiers. Dealers also attributed the market's buoyancy to the publicity ahead of listing of power company Tenaga Nasional at the end of this month. The composite index rose 5.55 to 603.02 in turnover of MDollars 145m, up from MDollars 103m. Telekom was active, rising 20 cents to MDollars 12.40. TAIWAN finished mixed in light activity, after early gains were eroded. The weighted index opened more than 30 points higher but closed a net 2.94 off at 4,536.53 after buy-ing interest faded. Turnover came to TDollars 16.8bn (TDollars 17.3bn). Cement shares rose on reports that demand for cement would soar because of Taiwan's huge infrastructure building plans. Chia Hsin Cement rose TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 59. MANILA lost early gains on profit-taking. The composite index shed 0.31 to 1,245.52 as turnover rose to 169m pesos from 143m. Philippine Long Distance Telephone bucked the trend, rising 15 pesos to 970 pesos. JAKARTA's index ended 3.08 up at 283.12 in moderate volume of 7.7m shares. Cigarette shares rose on expectations that a monopoly supplying the industry with cloves, an essential ingredient in local cigarettes, would soon collapse.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Roberto G. Burgos] </F>   [Text] Armed Forces chief General Lisandro Abadia  yesterday called on Nur Misuari, chief of the Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF) to get members of the dreaded Abu Sayyaf  group out of Basilan and Jolo to prove their sincerity in  attaining peace in Mindanao.    Abadia aired the call to Misuari in yesterday's breakfast  forum at the Manila Pavilion.    "Nakikiusap kami sa MNLF na kung hindi ninyo makumbinsi,  paalisin ninyo sila (Abu Sayyaf members). Nakakahiya, naguusap  tayo tapos yung mga kriminal nasa paligid natin [We are  appealing to the MNLF that if you can't convince them (Abu  Sayyaf members), then get rid of them. It's a shame to talk  peace while criminals are freely roaming around us]," Abadia  said.    Although Abadia has belittled the capacity of Abu Sayyaf  members -- about 100 to 150 plain criminals -- to launch major  offensives against the government, he nevertheless sought the  help of MNLF in maintaining peace and order in the area.    Police reports said that while peace negotiations between  the  government and the MNLF were going on, suspected members of  Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf were reportedly sighted  roaming around Jolo, Sulu and Basilan.    However, Abadia refused to comment on reports that the Abu  Sayyaf is the "money-making front" of the MNLF but said that the  extremist group has generated enough money from kidnaping and  other criminal activities.    Abadia also said that the recent clashes between government  troops and some members of the MNLF did not in any way affect  the ongoing peace talks.    "Soldiers have to defend the innocent people," Abadia said.    The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the  forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places  and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of  hostilities."    Latest reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo said at least seven  troopers were wounded following a clash with MNLF rebels in  Basilan last Saturday [22 Jan], the most serious breach of the  interim cease fire agreed on by the government and the rebel  group.    Earlier reports of clashes after the truce pact was inked  were all attributed either to the communist New People's Army  (NPA) or the so-called "MNLF Lost Commands."    In the past few weeks, sporadic encounters between  government  troops and suspected MNLF members in Basilan had resulted in the  wounding of dozens of soldiers and policemen and an undetermined  number of casualties to the rebels.    Mindanao Marines commander Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz  and co-chairman of the joint cease fire committee has said that  "minor violations" on both sides had been reported and that  these would be addressed by the committee.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Shortly before 1800 hours, Deputy  Ladislav Pittner [Christian Democratic Movement] submitted the  following proposal in parliament:    [Begin Pittner recording] I am submitting a proposal for a  vote of no confidence in Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister of  the Slovak Republic.    Vladimir Meciar, as prime minister of the Slovak Republic,  has led the Slovak Republic into a political and economic  crisis. By his statements, attitudes, and decisions, he has  diminished the credibility of the Slovak Republic abroad; by the  methods of his political work, on a long-term basis, he was  unable to win over sufficient support within the minority  government and in the Slovak Republic National Council. He was  incapable of maintaining acceptable relations with the other  supreme bodies of the state, in particular with the Slovak  Republic National Council and president.    It is for this reason that, in harmony with the Slovak  Republic Constitution, I submit this proposal, together with the  list of signatures of the necessary number of deputies, to the  Slovak Republic National Council, asking for this proposal to be  discussed. [end recording]    [Announcer] The parliament will vote on Ladislav Pittner's  proposal in a short while.</p>

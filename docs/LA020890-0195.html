			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARBITRATOR RULES IN FAVOR OF ANGELS IN WHITE CASE  </P> <P> In favoring the Angels over center fielder Devon White, arbitrator Howard Block  gave management a 2-1 lead over players in baseball arbitration decisions this  year.  </P> <P> Block, a Tustin attorney, ruled Wednesday that White will receive the $580,000  salary figure submitted by the Angels rather than the $865,000 he requested.  White, an All-Star last season, hit .245. with 12 home runs and 56 runs batted  in. He had a team-high 44 stolen bases. He earned a base salary of $320,000.  </P> <P> White and his agent, Ed Keating, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In previous decisions, Angel first baseman Wally Joyner was awarded a  $1.75-million salary Tuesday over the Angels' $1.225-million offer, and the  Kansas City Royals' offer to Bo Jackson of $1 million was chosen over Jackson's  request for $1,900,001.  </P> <P> Angel General Manager Mike Port said that just as he did not regard the Joyner  decision as a defeat, he does not consider the White verdict a victory.  </P> <P> "It's all procedural, a salary-setting process," Port said. "We feel in Devon  White's regard that the arbitrator having selected the club's figure is not  going to make Devon White any less a player or give any less than before. It's  done. By whatever means, his 1990 salary is set. All that's ever in question is  how much of an increase will it be. Even on the downside (for the player), it's  an increase."  </P> <P> The Angels have arbitration cases still to be heard with Kirk McCaskill and  Jack Howell. McCaskill's hearing is set for Feb. 19 and Howell's is the  following day, both in New York.  </P> <P> Port said the Angels' spring training plans have been "on standby" during  contract negotiations between players and owners but added that Friday's owners  meeting in Chicago could change that status. "Friday is going to be  informationally important to us," Port said. "We will do whatever the PRC  (Player Relations Committee) directs."  </P></p>

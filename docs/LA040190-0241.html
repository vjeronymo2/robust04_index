			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LONGTIME RESIDENTS MORE LIKELY TO BE UPSET BY AREA'S FAST GROWTH;  </P> <P> TIMES POLL: DECLINING QUALITY OF LIFE AND CRIME ARE KEY ISSUES FOR THEM, WHILE  NEWCOMERS ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH HIGH HOUSING COSTS.  </P> <P> Perhaps more than any other factor, perceptions about life in North County --  what's good about it, and what's bad about it -- are colored by how long that  person has lived here.  </P> <P> With some exceptions, a Los Angeles Times Poll has found that those who have  lived in North County for more than 20 years are the ones who are souring on  the area the most.  </P> <P> Old-timers are about half as likely to say that the quality of life in the  county has improved during the past decade as newcomers -- people who have  lived in the area for five years or less. More dramatically, a majority of  old-timers -- by a 4-to-1 margin -- say the quality of life in San Diego County  has worsened, versus improved, over the past 10 years.  </P> <P> By contrast, fewer than 4 newcomers out of 10 see life getting worse in San  Diego County -- probably either because they haven't been around long enough to  notice insidious changes for the worse, or because they're what the old-timers  are complaining about.  </P> <P> One of the newcomers is 23-year-old Shelly Carter, who moved to Solana Beach  from Santa Barbara two years ago so she could attend classes at San Diego State  University -- and who now has no plans on leaving.  </P> <P> "This is the place for me," she proclaims.  </P> <P> She cites the sun, the beach, her new-found friends -- and the fact there are  more business opportunities here than back home in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "You have to be careful about growth because it brings problems -- especially  environmental ones," she says. "But you need growth to flourish. There's more  of a future here."  </P> <P> But old-timers -- the folks who have been around long enough to see the  character of North County change -- are finding that the new character, more  urban and urbane, isn't what they want.  </P> <P> Custom home builder Con Slack lived in Vista for 18 years before moving four  years ago to Fallbrook. He talks about how his values contrast with those who  are just now arriving in North County.  </P> <P> "They're more 'me' oriented," he grouses. "It's 'I this' and 'I that' and they  only speak about their problems, not our problems. They're the ones who call  the sheriff for a small complaint so he can't get to the person who has a real  one.  </P> <P> "And they seem to be producing 'wannabe' kids who want to be able to do this or  that right now, and kids who deal in drugs and booze and all other chemical  stimulants. They're infecting our kids."  </P> <P> Like Slack, other longtime residents are nearly three times more likely than  newcomers to say they chose their community for a rural lifestyle -- a  lifestyle they find diminishing in North County as one-time open space is lost  to housing to accommodate the newcomers. Not surprisingly, then, they are more  than twice as likely as newcomers to say their community no longer holds the  attraction that first drew them.  </P> <P> And because they have watched their rural landscapes shrink and their towns  fill with new apartments and housing tracts, they are three times more likely  than newcomers to complain that growth is what they like least about their  community. Newcomers might feel more sheepish in complaining about growth, of  course; they are the ones who most recently have caused it. Others say that  growth ensures a better, more well-rounded community, and that's good.  </P> <P> "I'm from Sugarland, Tex., and in Texas everyone mainly thinks about one thing:  oil," says John Habegger, a 22-year-old lance corporal in the Marine Corps who  is attending MiraCosta College in Oceanside. He hopes to eventually earn a  degree in business and perhaps settle down here.  </P> <P> "When oil goes down, so does the economy. But San Diego is branching out a lot,  and that's the reason San Diego is doing so well, with growth and new  businesses bringing in still more money to the community. That brings more  people, and the more people you bring, the broader horizons there are for still  more and different businesses and that creates a better situation for  everyone," Habegger said.  </P> <P> On some counts, longtime residents are happier than newcomers with life in  North County.  </P> <P> For instance, 73% of those who have lived in North County longer than 20 years  have some or a lot of confidence in the local schools; by contrast, only 57% of  the newcomers have that same confidence.  </P> <P> And two-thirds of the old-timers believe San Diego's beaches are safe for  swimming; in contrast, only 44% of the newcomers do.  </P> <P> Newcomers and old-timers agree that the biggest problem facing the county  overall is drugs. But newcomers, who most recently were confronted with the  current housing market, say affordable housing is the second biggest problem  facing the county. Old-timers list traffic as the second greatest problem.  </P> <P> Longtime residents -- whether because many of them are older, more frail and  feel more vulnerable, or because they remember the days when fewer strangers  walked their neighborhoods -- see North County as a more dangerous place to  live than do the recent arrivals. Among old-timers, only 64% feel safe to walk  the streets of their neighborhood at night, while 81% of the newcomers feel  safe.  </P> <P> Part of the difference in opinions and lifestyles might stem from demographics  -- including one of the most basic of all: 59% of the old-timers are 40 or  older; 59% of the newcomers are younger than 40.  </P> <P> Newcomers are almost three times as likely to be renters: 44% compared with 15%  for old-timers. But the newcomers to North County nonetheless pay more for  housing: 27% are paying $1,000 or more in monthly rental or mortgage, while 14%  of the old-timers are paying those kinds of prices.  </P> <P> Some people who rent -- like Ardiss Morgan -- say they'll never buy a home  here.  </P> <P> Morgan, a computer data technician for a San Marcos publisher, and her  truck-driver husband, Dennis, transplanted themselves 3 1/2 years ago to Vista  from Clinton, Iowa. They were attracted here by the climate and job  opportunities, but they don't figure on staying here long.  </P> <P> "We're not ever going to own a house out here," she said. "These prices are too  outrageous. We'd like to move to Atlanta, Ga. The houses are priced right  there, and besides, in Atlanta it's green all year round."  </P> <P> But like Morgan and her husband, newcomers to North County are more likely to  be double-income households than old-timers.  </P> <P> Longtime North County residents are less likely to be professional or  white-collar workers than newcomers -- but, on the other hand, they are more  likely than newcomers to be executives, administrators or owners of their own  business.  </P> <P> They also are more likely to be Anglo.  </P> <P> In addition, virtually all old-timers claim U.S. citizenship; among newcomers  to the county, nearly a fifth are not U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> Maybe it is because they've seen the changing ethnicity of North County over  the years; old-timers are more likely than newcomers to say that the Latino  lifestyle has changed San Diego County for the worse.  </P> <P> And, like Escondido resident Dale Robertson, they are twice as likely to say  that the main effect of recent immigration has been increased crime.  </P> <P> "When I was growing up here," said Robertson, who has lived in Escondido for 27  of his 29 years, "I was able to leave the keys in my car and the front door of  my house unlocked. Now you see all the migrant workers everywhere and you're  hesitant, you know? I'm not blaming them, but they might get desperate and you  might be a victim.  </P> <P> "That's especially true on (construction) job sites. I'm working my butt off,  and go back to my truck and something's gone and you know it's not one of your  fellow workers because they've been working as hard as you. It's the illegal  aliens standing around who see you leave your truck and they walk up and grab  something."  </P> <P> Not only are longtime residents more likely than newcomers to bear a grudge  against Latinos, they're less sympathetic toward them in schooling and living  conditions.  </P> <P> A majority of old-timers dislike the notion of teaching some public school  classes in Spanish -- primarily because it would take funds away from other  educational programs. By contrast, one in three newcomers opposes teaching some  classes in Spanish.  </P> <P> About half of the old-timers support the notion of government providing housing  and food for migrant workers -- the alternative being to raze the migrant camps  altogether and drive them elsewhere. But more newcomers -- 60% -- support  government help for the migrant workers.  </P> <P> Why don't immigrants find more friends among longtime North County residents?  </P> <P> Roberto Martinez, who has studied migrant issues for 10 years on behalf of the  American Friends Service Committee, suggests that negative images -- including,  in this case, ones about the impact of migrants -- make stronger and  longer-lasting impressions than do positive images.  </P> <P> Ergo, he says, the longer one has lived here, the more likely one has read and  heard -- and retained -- negative reports about immigrants, while the positive  contributions are more easily forgotten.  </P> <P> "The longer people live here and are exposed to the Latino community and  migrant workers, the more they've formed biased opinions based either on  misinformation or myth," Martinez says. "The newcomers haven't been here long  enough to be affected that way."  </P> <P> TAKING THE LONG VIEW  </P> <P> Oldtimers in North County take a dimmer view of recent changes than do  newcomers. People who have lived in the county more than 20 years are more  likely to have chosen their community for its rural setting; and, as rural  settings have been disappearing, they are far more likely to say that growth is  the worst aspect of their community. Newcomers tend more to feel safe in their  neighborhoods and to feel that the county's quality of life has improved in the  past decade.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:2.77IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3">

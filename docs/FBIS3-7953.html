Klaus Promoted the Czech </F> Republic Among the German Industrialists"]    [Text] Munich--Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus described his  two-day visit to Munich, which he began on Wednesday [23  February] at the invitation of the German insurance company  Allianz and the BMW automobile concern, as a traditional trip  for the purpose of promoting and explaining development in the  Czech Republic.    On Wednesday night, the Czech prime minister met with  representatives of the foremost German firms, banks, and  companies: Commerzbank, Bayer, BASF, Siemens, Hoechst,  Bertelsmann, GRUNDIG, Thyssen, Krupp, and others. Also present  were Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the German Chambers of  Industry and Commerce (DIHT); Otto Wolf von Amerongen, chairman  of the Eastern Committee for the German Economy; and former  Federal President Walter Scheel.    During the discussion with the industrialists, Vaclav Klaus  explained in his own words at what stage of the reform the Czech  economy is and how it differs from the other postcommunist  states and the West European countries. The prime minister said  that his meeting with some 50 representatives of the foremost  German firms also indicates the increased involvement of the  Czech Republic in the European economy. The activity of the  German BMW automobile concern as well as more general economic  and political relations between the Czech Republic and Germany  were the topics of yesterday's debate between Vaclav Klaus and  BMW boss Bernd Pischetsrieder.    "We have various subcontractors in the Czech Republic and  are  very satisfied with them," Pischetsrieder said after the meeting  with Vaclav Klaus. He added that BMW intends to develop this  cooperation further. The Czech prime minister described the  talks with the concern management as very useful.    To the question of Czech-German relations, Vaclav Klaus said  that "the relations must not remain at the level of talks  between prime ministers but must also be developed by expanding  economic contacts."</p>

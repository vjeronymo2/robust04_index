			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL TOOL IN SCHOOLS RIFT CITED;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: PARENTS FIGHTING THE YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PROPOSAL SAY THE DISTRICT  FAILED TO FOLLOW STATE LAW. A SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT DISAGREES.  </P> <P> Some parents fighting the conversion of 109 Los Angeles schools to year-round  schedules say they have found legal grounds to block the proposed changes, a  former school board candidate said Thursday. But a school board attorney  disagreed.  </P> <P> Barbara Romey, who has been working with other parents opposed to year-round  schools, said the Los Angeles Unified School District failed to give proper  notice of the proposed changes, which would begin this summer.  </P> <P> 'There is a good, legal tool to fight this," said Romey, who has run twice for  the West San Fernando Valley seat on the school board.  </P> <P> The California Education Code requires districts intending to convert schools  from traditional to year-round schedules to publish those plans in a newspaper  advertisement before November of the year preceding the changes.  </P> <P> But Richard Mason, special counsel to Los Angeles school Supt. Leonard Britton,  said the code does not apply to the district's proposals.  </P> <P> Mason said the district is exempt from the code requirement because no Los  Angeles students will be required to attend year-round school. Parents who  oppose year-round schools can apply for transfers to schools with traditional  schedules, he said.  </P> <P> Mason also said the district may be exempt from the provision because it  printed notices in 1987, when the board first considered changing schools to  year-round schedules.  </P> <P> Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education,  said he is uncertain whether the code requirement applies to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But in general, Symkowick said, "anyone looking at the case would consider not  just the letter of the law but its intent, which is to allow for parent input."  </P> <P> Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round  Education, a nonprofit group supporting year-round schools, said he agreed with  Mason's argument. "But none of this has ever gone to court," he said.  </P> <P> Britton has recommended that all schools in the district convert to some form  of year-round schedule by summer, 1991.  </P> <P> Parents opposed to year-round schools say the plan will require students to  attend classes in stifling heat and will disrupt vacations and child-care  arrangements.  </P> <P> The school board is expected to make a decision Monday on the controversial  proposal.  </P></p>

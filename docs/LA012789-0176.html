			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> INVESTOR WANTS TO BUY IC RAILROAD  </P> <P> The Prospect Group Inc., a New York investment group with rail interests, said  today it would bid $434 million for Illinois Central Transportation Co.  </P> <P> The announcement put the spotlight on what role another IC shareholder that  uses its rail lines, Archer Daniels Midland Co., would play.  </P> <P> Prospect said it did not plan to merge the IC railroad with its MidSouth Corp.,  a Mississippi railroad bought from IC several years ago, planning instead to  operate it as a separate company.  </P> <P> "It's (IC) a good railroad now and we want to make it even better," Prospect  spokesman Donald Dwight told Reuters.  </P> <P> The bid was good news for IC shareholders. The price of the stock shot up $8 on  the New York Stock Exchange to $22.50 on news of the $20-a-share bid.  </P> <P> Prospect already owns 4.7% of Illinois Central, which, after several years of  restructuring that included selling less profitable short-distance rail lines,  was spun off Jan. 1 from Whitman Corp., now mainly a consumer products company.  Whitman, previously called IC Industries, owns Midas International, a muffler  company, and Pet Inc., a specialty-foods company.  </P></p>

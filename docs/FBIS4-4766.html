			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Kitti Rattanachaya, </F> commander of the Fourth Army Region, by Amonrat Mongkhonchat;  place, date not given]    [Text] [Amonrat] There has been a series of bomb explosions  in the southern region. In your opinion, who is behind the  attacks.    [Kitti] Initial investigations suggest that those who were  behind the 1992 bomb explosion in Hat Yai might have been  involved in the recent incidents. Judging from their tactics,  it is likely that they are from the same group, possibly allies  of the Pulo (Patani United Liberation Organization). I've  discussed the matter with Police chief Prathin (Santipraphop)  and a working group was jointly formed (by the military and  police) to investigate.    [Amonrat] Is it true, then, that the Fourth Army Region has  not coordinated with the Police Department well.    [Kitti] It isn't a matter of good or bad coordination. Bomb  explosions concern public security and that's the direct  responsibility of the police. The military's role is simply to  support the police.    [Amonrat] Does that mean that it was the police's fault in  failing to solve the cases.    [Kitti] Police have failed to complete investigations into  various cases. The military has proposed that they improve their  intelligence network.    [Amonrat] What has disrupted police investigations.    [Kitti] Perhaps they have so much work to do that it's hard  for them to concentrate on particular cases. Often, they fail  to follow up those cases, especially when the public stops  paying attention. So we'd like to propose that police form  special investigation teams to follow up on the cases, no matter  how long they take to complete.    [Amonrat] A few days ago, you put the blame on police and  provincial governors for failing to perform their duties  satisfactorily to curb violence.    [Kitti] I didn't mean that they don't perform  satisfactorily.  What I meant was their roles and duties are not clear enough.  Whenever any violence takes place, we've got to know who -- the  military or police -- should oversee the investigation. In the  South, the military has played a supporting role. If the  Internal Peacekeeping Act had not been abolished, the military  would be authorized to take some action.    [Amonrat] Many people say that the military is trying to  evade responsibility.    [Kitti] That is not true. I've been assigned by the prime  minister to coordinate police and I still do it.    [Amonrat] Do you think the recent violence occurred because  those who have lost power want to disturb the public.    [Kitti] Yes, it's a public disturbance, but not by those who  have lost power. It is the direct responsibility of the  Interior Ministry and the Police Department to avert such  incidents. We in the military are ready to provide full  assistance if they ask for it. We have to comply with the law;  we don't have authority as they do.    [Amonrat] Do you want to see the re-enactment of the  Internal  Peacekeeping Act.    [Kitti] No, not at all. The Criminal Code is enough at  present. The important thing is that the authorities should  work more efficiently. The military is ready to coordinate.    [Amonrat] It seems that the Fourth Army Region would be  blamed in the end if those behind the bomb attacks in the South  were not arrested.    [Kitti] That's right. The military has been seen as so  powerful in the past that it could form governments. However  during the May crisis, the military could hardly find a place to  live. If you were in my position as an army region commander,  you would be upset.    [Amonrat] What is the military's policy to help police  oversee public security.    [Kitti] We've got a clear-cut policy to coordinate with  police. We are assigned to maintain security in the South. In  the past three years, before the schools were torched last  August, we were quite successful in overseeing peace and order.  The situation got out of control because the Fourth Army Region  commander doesn't have enough authority to handle the problems.  After the prime minister empowered the military to coordinate,  we were able to work satisfactorily, up to a certain level,  before the occurrence of the recent bomb attacks.    [Amonrat] Are you upset about the various violent incidents  in the South.    [Kitti] Certainly. All people concerned should seriously try  to solve the problem. If that is the case, we would finally be  able to maintain public security.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in the derivative markets was boosted yesterday by Monday's firm overnight performance on Wall Street, leading to improved turnover in both FT-SE futures and traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,716. Early attempts, particularly from independent traders, to push the contract lower met with stiff resistance and June moved forward, boosted mid session by the improved offer from HSBC, for Midland Bank. However, the afternoon falls in the pharmaceutical sector, which led to a retreat in the underlying cash market, spread into futures and June was forced to relinquish some earlier gains. Profit-taking during the afternoon session was also noticed, but on balance June ended ahead at 2,717, up 8 on its previous close and around 5 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was a healthy 7,716 contracts. Traded options activity improved from Monday's meagre level. Turnover at 33,521 lots was substantially better than Monday's 19,806 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded a total of 6,175 lots. In stock options, Midland Bank, was the most active, trading a total of 4,507 contracts.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y likely to win fresh funding for Canary Wharf OLYMPIA &amp; York's bankers said yesterday they were likely to provide the property developer with new borrowings to continue work on the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands, but would give far less than the Pounds 110m (Dollars 193m) requested by the company. However, by late yesterday bankers had still not made a final decision. They were meeting with their advisers - the accountants Ernst &amp; Young and the property surveyor Hillier Parker - to assess O&amp;Y's financial prospects. They are unlikely to communicate their decision to O&amp;Y until this morning. Mr Steve Miller, in charge of O&amp;Y's negotiations with its banks, said it would be 'only a modest disappointment' if O&amp;Y got less than it wanted. O&amp;Y requested Pounds 110m to cover Canary Wharf's building and fitting-out costs for the next 90 days, during which O&amp;Y hoped to arrange a complete reorganisation of its CDollars 14.3bn (USDollars 12.1bn) debt. However, the 11 lenders to Canary Wharf are expected to provide funds to meet requirements for a much shorter period, pending a thorough assessment of the value of O&amp;Y's properties. O&amp;Y may be granted a facility of less than Pounds 50m. 'There is a wish to keep the lights on (at Canary Wharf),' said a banker. However, he said that the banks - which include Citicorp of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Barclays of the UK and its rival Lloyds - were baulking at a request from O&amp;Y that they commit their existing loans for five or six years. 'At the moment we are in no position to see if there are any black holes (or sources of potential losses) at O&amp;Y,' the banker said. He said that if the banks provided new money, they would not hand it over in one tranche to O&amp;Y. The property developer would have to submit claims for expenses to Ernst &amp; Young, which would then decide whether the expenses should be paid.</p>

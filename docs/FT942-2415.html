			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Soccer swamps Colombia elections Both candidates in the second round of Colombia's presidential elections yesterday launched intensive television publicity campaigns tied to the country's much-revered World Cup soccer team. But in the wake of the team's 3-1 defeat by Romania on Saturday night, such populist efforts to rouse voters appeared to have fallen flat. Outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, who is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election, opened voting early yesterday in central Bogota reminding Colombians of their duty to vote despite the disaster on the football field. 'I think citizens know that voting is not just a right but also an obligation and the decision which is being taken today is too important to be left to one side for lesser reasons,' Mr Gaviria told reporters after casting his ballot. Opinion polls give the governing Liberal party candidate, Mr Ernesto Samper, and the Conservatives' Mr Andres Pastrana identical percentages of the vote. In the first round, Mr Samper and his vice-presidential candidate, Mr Humberto de la Calle, had an advantage of 18,000 votes but did not win the necessary overall majority. However, television news on Saturday barely mentioned the elections, dedicating virtually their whole bulletins to exhaustive coverage of the World Cup. Mr Samper and Mr Pastrana toured more than a dozen cities in a final dash for votes but the 17m registered voters hardly noticed amid the torrent of football news. Most of the 16 other first round candidates have told their followers to choose as they please between the two remaining candidates, though General Miguel Maza, with 55,000 votes, joined the Samper campaign. Despite minor guerrilla incidents - including the kidnapping of some officials - voting started quietly yesterday.</p>

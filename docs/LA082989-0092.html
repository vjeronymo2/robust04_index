			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOX-OFFICE SHORT CIRCUIT FOR 'WIRED'  </P> <P> On Monday morning, in the wake of the weekend death of the movie "Wired" at 680  theaters, the late John Belushi's one-time Blues Brothers partner was still  urging moviegoers to stay away.  </P> <P> "These people are exploiting my dead friend," Dan Aykroyd told CBS' "This  Morning" co-host Harry Smith. "Of course I'm going to take a position."  </P> <P> "Wired," a $13.5-million movie based on Bob Woodward's book about the life and  death of the drug-addicted Belushi, grossed only $681,000 during the weekend  for a disastrous per-screen average of $1,001. It is one of the poorest  openings of any nationally released film this year.  </P> <P> "Nobody wanted to see the movie, it's that simple," said an executive of one  theater chain. "You can't say people didn't know about it."  </P> <P> "Wired" has been the subject of controversy ever since producers Ed Feldman and  Charles Meeker obtained the rights to Woodward's book four years ago. Aykroyd  was just one of many Belushi friends offended by the book and opposed to a  movie version, and pressure had reportedly been applied by Creative Artists  Agency, which handled Belushi and represents Aykroyd, to stop the film from  being made and then distributed.  </P> <P> The movie was turned down for distribution by every major American distribution  company and by most independents. New Visions Pictures had agreed to distribute  it, according to the "Wired" producers, but pulled out (the company is run by  Taylor Hackford, a CAA client). When Atlantic Entertainment ran into financial  problems after agreeing to distribute "Wired," tiny Taurus Entertainment, a  division of United Artists, assumed the task.  </P> <P> Last week, "Wired" got caught up in one last gust of controversy when rumors  began circulating that major theater chains were being pressured to dump  bookings of the picture. Despite the denials of theater chains and the  inability of "Wired" producers to identify specific booking cancellations, the  rumors received widespread media coverage.  </P> <P> KABC-TV film critic Gary Franklin went on the air last Tuesday and reported  that both Pacific Theaters and Cineplex Odeon had dropped bookings of "Wired"  in Los Angeles. The next evening, he corrected himself.  </P> <P> Friday, in a story about murdered video executive Jose Menendez, whose company  has the video rights to "Wired," the Wall Street Journal reported that, "in  what may only be a strange coincidence," full-page ads announcing the opening  of "Wired" appeared in newspapers in L.A. and New York on the day of the  killing of Menendez and his wife. The Journal went on to report that the day  after the Aug. 20 murders, "several theater chains canceled 'Wire.' " "It's  ludicrous for anyone to believe an agency can stop us from opening a movie," an  executive with Cineplex Odeon said Monday. "One year ago today, we opened 'The  Last Temptation of Christ.' We're not afraid of anything."  </P> <P> At least one major chain -- New York-based Loews -- rejected "Wired" from the  beginning, according to the film's producers. Loews is owned by Columbia  Pictures Inc., whose two studios -- Columbia and Tri-Star -- are heavy users of  CAA clients.  </P> <P> Most exhibitors contacted by The Times said "Wired" was not booked widely  because it was not a very good movie and there were too many major films still  doing good business.  </P></p>

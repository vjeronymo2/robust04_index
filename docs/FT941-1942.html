			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland Whatever the niceties about strategic vision and industrial logic, GKN's bid for Westland is settling down to an old-fashioned haggle over price. Unfortunately, from GKN's point of view, there may well be a gap between the price it is prepared to pay and the price which shareholders are prepared to accept. Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, has said repeatedly that he will not 'overpay' for Westland. That implies that any increase in the offer will be modest. There might conceivably be some flexing of terms over the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation settlement. GKN might, for example, keep all of any payment in return for a higher offer. But the total package seems unlikely to take the bid much over the current market price of 326p. That may not be enough to dislodge Westland's heavily concentrated shareholders, particularly since one of the largest is M&amp;G, which has a tradition of supporting existing management. In the absence of a substantially higher bid, institutions may also feel that they can play a waiting game. If the projected orders turn out to be pie, rather than helicopters, in the sky, they may think that they can sell to GKN later. Its 45 per cent holding suggests a continuing interest, and in any event, Westland's tax advantages do not become substantial until 1996. If the orders do materialise, however, Westland would be worth a good deal more than 326p. The unenviable problem facing Sir David is that if he refuses to overpay now, he may risk having to do so later.</p>

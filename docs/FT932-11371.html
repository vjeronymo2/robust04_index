			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Athens joins Belgrade to put pressure on Bosnian Serbs SERBIAN and Greek leaders will go to Pale today to exert pressure on the Bosnian Serb assembly to ratify the international peace plan for Bosnia. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, are expected to warn Bosnian Serbs of the tough consequences of failing to back the plan. Deputies from all Serb areas in Bosnia were yesterday heading to Pale, near Sarajevo, for the meeting, which has been called to decide whether to back the plan signed begrudgingly by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, in Athens at the weekend. Mr Mitsotakis, leader of a country that has been a traditional ally of Orthodox Serbia, will stress the military punishment that awaits the Bosnian Serbs from the international community if they reject the plan. Mr Milosevic will add his muscle to the world's persuasive powers by making clear he is prepared to cut their supply lines from Serbia unless they co-operate. Even so, hardline deputies last night threatened to overrule Mr Karadzic's approval of the peace settlement, amid protests about 'international dictates'. Mr Milosevic put pressure on Mr Karadzic to change his mind and sign the peace plan, drawn up by the international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Mr Karadzic, who has staked his future on today's vote, yesterday appealed for peace and Serbian unity, calling on deputies to approve the plan, which divides Bosnia into ten provinces broadly on ethnic lines. Even Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, a parliamentary deputy in Belgrade, who is better known as Arkan, commander of a fierce paramilitary group, has swung into line behind Mr Milosevic. Mr Raznatovic called for 'peace and for the vote to be taken seriously'. But the show of force from Belgrade has not cowed the Bosnian Serb deputies, described by Mr Karadzic as 'true representatives' of the Serbian people. 'These are people who are coming directly from trenches, each and every one of them has lost somebody,' he said. In a thinly veiled reference to Mr Milosevic, hardline deputies yesterday warned that Bosnian Serbs were fighting for Serbia as well. Serb leaders over the past year have repeatedly claimed they are defending their land against a Moslem threat. 'We are fighting for Serbia more than we are for ourselves, Belgrade should realise this,' said Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, a key hardline deputy from Banja Luka, the Serb stronghold in north-west Bosnia. 'I think we should prepare for defence and unite,' he told Serbian radio in Pale, the Serb mountain stronghold just 14 miles from Sarajevo, the besieged Bosnian capital. Many deputies appeared to believe the peace plan would be approved so as to avert military intervention. But they did not believe that approval would mean that the plan would be carried out. 'The signature is important for world diplomacy,' said Mr Bozidar Vucurevic, a lorry driver who has become a key leader of eastern Hercegovina. 'It is only a temporary solution until the state of Bosnia finally disappears.' The plan envisages the Serbs handing over a large amount of territory which they seized from Moslems since fighting erupted more than a year ago. But Serb leaders seem to believe that even if the plan is approved, the status quo will not change. Mr Dragan Spasojevic, from Zvornik, which under the Vance-Owen plan is designated as Moslem, said: 'Serbian territory not designated as Serbian in the plan remains 'factually' the same for at least 18 months.' Deputies yesterday drove to Pale in luxury cars, some bearing number plates from cities under Moslem or Croat control. They sped past Moslem houses still ablaze around the fallen eastern enclave of Konjevic Polje as Bosnian Serb forces watched. Trenches have been cut there through unploughed fields. Mosques lay in ruins, bearing testimony to the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia. A young Serb carrying a rifle in a tractor said: 'This place will never be Moslem. My brother lies in that grave there.'</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: BBV up 6% to Pta32bn BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's largest retail bank, yesterday reported a 26 per cent rise in first-quarter cash-flow to Pta70.3bn (Dollars 645m). Pre-tax profits advanced 6 per cent to Pta31.8bn, writes Tom Burns in Madrid. BBV's operating profits of Pta83.9bn were nearly 5 per cent below the Pta88.4bn reported in the first quarter of last year. However it was 3.4 per cent up on the Pta83.9bn posted in the final three months of last year. The bank endured a marked narrowing of its margins in 1990 when it launched costly financial products during a fierce battle for market share among Spain's retail banks. In contrast to BBV, Banco Popular, the Spanish bank 43 per cent-owned by foreign investors, reported after-tax profits for the quarter of Pta11.6bn, 14.6 per cent up on the same period last year. A third Spanish bank, Banco Hispano Americano, posted a 0.3 per cent rise in margins, to Pta23.2bn, and pre-tax profits of Pta13.2bn, an 11.3 per cent increase on the first quarter of 1990.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Pay awards move upwards to track inflation Annual pay awards are picking up in line with rising inflation, two reports published yesterday say. Figures from Industrial Relations Services show that the average settlement for the three months to the end of January 1994 edged up to 2.5 per cent, compared with 2 per cent in the three months to the end of December. More than half of the settlements in the three months to January provided increases of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, contributing to the first significant movement in the IRS headline figure since August last year. However, only a quarter of the deals were worth more than a year earlier and, thanks to the relatively sharp rise in inflation, the average rise has failed to clear the rate of inflation for the first time in three years. IRS says that with almost two-thirds of the year's pay reviews to be completed by the end of April, the next few weeks will be of crucial importance to pay planners. 'We may be seeing a return to a familiar pattern  -pay pressures being driven upwards in the wake of rising prices - which would frustrate the government's desire to break the link between pay and inflation,' concludes IRS. This picture is supported by rival pay analysts Incomes Data Services, which says that settlements are mainly between 2 per cent and 3.5 per cent, and slightly up on the end of last year. It says that less than 10 per cent of companies are freezing pay, with a similar proportion settling at 4 per cent or 5 per cent. IDS adds that about a third of January settlements were higher than one year earlier. Pay and Benefits Bulletin 347, Industrial Relations Services, 18-20 Highbury Place, London N5 1QP.

			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SMOG AND THE RISE IN ASTHMA  </P> <P> The incidence of asthma is rising dramatically in the United States and  pollution is a major reason, researchers reported last week in a large  nationwide study.  </P> <P> "There is no question that the number of office visits to physicians for asthma  is increasing tremendously," said Claude Lenfant, director of the National  Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. "We are faced with a tremendous health  problem."  </P> <P> In the study, the largest of its kind, nearly half of the pediatricians  surveyed said they are treating more asthmatic children today than they were  five or 10 years ago. Nearly 30% of these doctors said they are now treating  more than 10 asthma patients per week.  </P> <P> Pollution was cited as the major reason for the increase in asthma, and nearly  half of the parents of asthmatic children felt their children suffered  emotionally from the condition. Many of the parents also viewed their child's  condition as life-threatening.  </P></p>

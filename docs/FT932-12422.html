			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Swiss group attempts to call the tune at Piper - A controversial suitor for the US producer of light aircraft AT 10am tomorrow, a gaggle of lawyers will convene in a Miami bankruptcy courtroom. At stake will be the future of one of the best-known, although sadly-blemished, names in US civil aviation: Piper Aircraft Corporation. For months, bidders have been sniffing around Piper, one of the last manufacturers of 'little planes' in the US. But a firm offer has now arrived from Pilatus, a Swiss aircraft manufacturer and part of the Oerlikon-Buhrle weapons and engineering group. Unfortunately, Pilatus could prove a controversial suitor; its chief executive, Mr Walter Gubler, was sacked last month after Swiss press reports that the company had sold aeroplanes to the Burmese government, knowing they would be equipped with weapons. Pilatus also has a commercially important, but politically-contentious, agreement to deliver SFr250m (Dollars 176m) worth of training aircraft to the South African Ministry of Defence. Shortly after the order was announced last December, the South African committee of the United Nations Security Council complained to the Swiss government that it violated the UN embargo on arms shipments to South Africa. The African National Congress also opposed the sale. Such touchy background issues might prove valuable ammunition should other suitors wish to start a bid battle. An auction is, at least, a possibility. Piper's lawyers are asking the court to set up a bidding procedure, and claim two potential rival suitors will attend tomorrow's hearing. One of these, according to Mr Paul Singerman, Piper's attorney, has said it will raise the South African issue should it proceed with an offer. The rationale for the Swiss interest is fairly straightforward. Pilatus makes small single-engine turbo-prop aircraft. Two models - the PC-6 and the Islander (made by the company's Britten-Norman subsidiary in the UK) - are mainly for civil uses, while the PC-7 and the PC-9 are mainly for training fighter pilots. However, the Islander is sometimes used in a defence role, equipped with radar. The PC-7s and PC-9s have also been 'misused' as bombers; aside from the Burmese affair, there have been reports of Pilatus aircraft figuring in conflicts in other countries, including Iraq and Angola. Today, according to Pilatus, about 60 per cent of revenues comes from training aircraft, the rest from civil aircraft and maintenance work for third parties. The company had sales of more than SFr250m last year and a first-half operating profit of SFr22m against a loss the previous year. However, in the late 1980s, the Swiss company decided it wanted a greater presence in the civil aircraft market. So it developed the PC-12, which aimed to undercut existing models in the small corporate aircraft market, especially in the US. The PC-12 - powered, like the PC-7 and PC-9, by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines made in Montreal - is expected to win certification by the end of the year. That is why the company is suddenly in a hurry to set up a US base. Pilatus says it would carry out final assembly of the PC-12 at Piper in Florida; indeed, its offer claims manufacturing work to be done by Piper for Pilatus would add Dollars 24m to the former's value. In the meantime, it is investigating three other US tie-ups for partial assemblies, some of which would augment work done at Piper, some of which would provide alternative manufacturing capacity. Mr Oskar Brundler, finance director, says the advantages of the Piper acquisition are the obvious ones: getting an existing product line, a worldwide sales and distribution network, and a famous name. Piper, meanwhile, has being looking for a saviour for years, having been shunted between different owners since the Piper family bowed out in the 1970s. Rescue efforts have been derailed by the product liability problem. Aircraft accidents have resulted in millions of dollars of legal claims, and driven insurance liability premiums sky-high. This issue alone explains why most other manufacturers of 'little planes' in the US, including Cessna, have quit the market. Piper held lengthy negotiations with Aerospatiale in 1991 but the French aircraft manufacturer never proceeded with a deal, because of the product liability issue. Shortly afterwards, in July, Piper filed for Chapter 11 protection. Since then, rumoured suitors for Piper have included a couple of investment consortia, which wanted to transfer manufacturing to Canada, and another involving relocation to an Indian reservation in New Mexico. In all cases, the relocations were designed to ameliorate the liability problem. The Pilatus plan takes a different tack - a portion of Piper's assets, including part of the Dollars 20m which Pilatus would pay in cash, would be set aside to meet potential claims. Pilatus would then acquire the other assets 'free and clear' of all product liability claims. In US bankruptcy terms, this is not an entirely novel suggestion. But it could help to make Piper more attractive. The company can also boast an improvement on the operating front: having virtually ceased production at the time of the bankruptcy filing, it delivered 85 aircraft last year. There was a small Dollars 7m operating profit on sales of Dollars 47m. A shadow of its former glory, perhaps, but progress none the less.</p>

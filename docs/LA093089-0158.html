			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EAST MEETS WEST AT CENTER -- AND NOH WONDER;  </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> Champagne and speeches at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa on Wednesday  before a performance of Takigi Noh -- a form of Japan's ancient Noh theater  enacted outdoors, by firelight (takigi means firewood). The program, presented  by UC Irvine and the consulate of Japan, was the second stop on a five-city  American tour for Japan's esteemed Kita Ryu-Noh troupe. The show was staged in  the Isamu Noguchi-designed "California Scenario" sculpture garden -- a short  hike for the 150 VIPs gathered at the Center for an hour of trans-Pacific  networking (an ancient form of the business arts).  </P> <P> The Buzz  </P> <P> Cultural couping. According to the program notes, underwriters were selected  not just on the basis of financial clout, but also for their ability "to  improve Japanese-American communications and understanding." Event chairman  David Eagle elaborated. "The way we did the underwriting side was (designed) to  show respect for this event," he said. "Noh (theater) is the pinnacle of  Japanese cultural perfection. It's like having a little slice of the 14th  Century brought into today. We wanted everything about this program to show  respect for Kita Ryu-Noh and to be equal in stature to this great cultural  tradition." Which just so happens -- great cultural tradition-wise -- to be  making a comeback in Japan.  </P> <P> "Takigi Noh is helping to repopularize this art form (Noh) among the younger  generation in Japan," said Cora Mirikitani, recently appointed director of  performing arts and film for the Japan Society in New York. Mirikitani, who is  leaving her position at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center in  Los Angeles to head East, said renewed interest in the fire-lit Noh dramas  might be due to "something subliminal and alluring about the flames."  </P> <P> The Food  </P> <P> Prawns and crab claws piled under the dripping jaws of an ice sculpture dragon.  Cheeses and vegetables arrayed beneath an Oriental floral arrangement. Buffet  selections of beef tenderloin, breast of chicken filets, lobster in puff pastry  and sui mai (Chinese dumplings).  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> Hiromoto Seki, consul general of Japan. UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason  and his wife, Suzanne. Three generations of the Sakioka family, owners of  Sakioka Farms in Costa Mesa: Roy and Tomio Sakioka; their son John and his  wife, Grace, and grandson George, with his wife, Stephanie. Steve Clemons,  executive director of the Los Angeles-based Japan America Society of Southern  California. Performing Arts Center President Thomas Kendrick and his wife,  Center general manager Judith Morr.

(Chairman Eagle  said that without Yasco Gamo's and Etsuko Price's knowledgeable advice on Noh  traditions, he "wouldn't have dared try to pull this off. We wanted to do it in  the right spirit -- not just do it," Eagle said.) PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

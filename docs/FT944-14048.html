			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / USAir's loss grows to Dollars 180m USAir, the struggling US carrier partly owned by British Airways, suffered a net loss of Dollars 180.1m (Pounds 114m) in the third quarter, as two crashes and increased competition contributed a decline in passenger traffic. The loss compares with a Dollars 177. m deficit in the corresponding three months of 1993. On a per share basis, it works through at Dollars 3.32, against Dollars 3.33. The results surprised most analysts, who thought USAir would narrow its losses to Dollars 2.22 a share. The reported figure included an unexpected one-time charge of Dollars 67.7m, mostly to cover the cost of realigning the airline's west coast route structure. USAir, which is plagued with the highest costs in the industry, is struggling to bring efficiencies to its flight system. Despite the disappointing performance, USAir's share price held fairly steady in early trading. By midday, it was down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 4 1/4 . ADRs in British Airways, which holds a 24.7 per cent stake in USAir, were marked down Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 60 5/8. BA has already threatened to write off all or part of its Dollars 400.7m investment in the US carrier, the country's sixth largest. Revenues for the period were slightly ahead at Dollars 1.8bn, against Dollars 1.7bn, but yields - or revenue per passenger mile - slumped nearly 10 per cent to 14.53 cents. The decline reflected a fresh round of fare-cutting by carriers operating on USAir's east coast routes. USAir's image has been damaged by two accidents during the quarter. Two months after a crash in North Carolina killed 37 people, a flight with 132 people aboard went down near Pittsburgh - the carrier's fifth fatal crash in as many years. For the nine months, USAir's net loss was Dollars 362.9m on revenue of Dollars 5.3bn.</p>

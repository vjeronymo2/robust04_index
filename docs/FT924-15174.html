			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Commercial Union agreement with South Korean insurer COMMERCIAL Union, the UK composite insurer, yesterday announced a co-operation agreement with one of South Korea's leading general insurance companies, Hyundai Marine and Fire Insurance. CU will provide underwriting and servicing facilities to Korean clients introduced by Hyundai. The agreement also provides for exchange of market information and mutual co-operation in areas like training. Hyundai Marine and Fire is a subsidiary of the Hyundai Business Group, one of the largest of the Korean conglomerates. Hyundai's insurance operations outside Korea include underwriting operations in Japan and representative offices in London, New York and Singapore. The agreement is one of a number signed in recent years by UK composite companies with partners in South Korea, Japan and other Far Eastern markets. The composites are keen to develop connections in markets which are gradually liberalising and are seen to have good long-term potential. CU itself was the first UK insurer to establish a liaison office in South Korea in 1989. More recently Sun Alliance has linked up with Lucky Insurance.</p>

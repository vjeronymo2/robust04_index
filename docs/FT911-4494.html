			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Menem moves on corruption PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has gone on the offensive against corruption, an issue over which he has recently come under attack in the media. In a television address on Wednesday evening, Mr Menem announced a crackdown on corruption and drug trafficking. He also dissolved a scandal-ridden provincial government whose own political difficulties were threatening the national government. Government officials and even members of Mr Menem's extended family are alleged to have been involved in corruption and drug trafficking. However, he has done little to investigate the accusations. Mr Menem promised the 'investigation, trial and punishment of organised crime' which he said was involved in 'drug trafficking, money laundering, smuggling, fraud and tax evasion'. The air force is also to co-operate with the US in an aerial survey to locate coca plantations and illegal airstrips. Mr Menem could also win support in September's crucial gubernatorial and congressional elections after replacing the Peronist government of Catamarca, an impoverished northwestern province, with a federal administrator.</p>

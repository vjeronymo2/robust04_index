			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Putting Royal to rights It is at least arguable that George Soros has done more than the Royal Insurance management to pull the company's fat out of the fire. Were sterling still in the ERM and interest rates around 10 per cent, Royal would scarcely be back in the FT-SE 100 or asking shareholders for Pounds 404m at 255p a share. To be fair, the new team has imposed some useful discipline. But it is unclear to what extent the recovery in underwriting is a function of the improving market rather than management action. Bruised shareholders are meanwhile left to reflect on the Pounds 679m of pre-tax losses in the last three years and the Pounds 1.2bn of shareholders' funds which have evaporated from the balance sheet. Some may even think that a management asking for over Pounds 400m on the strength of scraping a quarterly profit of Pounds 2m is being a trifle opportunistic. Patching balance sheet holes and raising the company's solvency margin are clearly strong motives for the issue. Last year, Royal made strenuous efforts to persuade the City to include the value of its life business in calculating solvency margins, to limited effect. Royal has still lost international commercial business to competitors as a result of its weaker capital base. That will be less of a problem now. Direct line personal operations and the Royal Global's commercial business can make some use of the cash. It is that happy moment early in the roller-coaster insurance cycle after the excess capital has been lost and when money can be made from rising premiums before the market gets crowded. But crowded it will get. After 'one-off' issues from CU and Royal, it may only be a matter of time before another composite insurer jumps out of the window of opportunity.</p>

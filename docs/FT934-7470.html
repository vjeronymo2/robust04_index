			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Predators get on their marks: Manoeuvres over ITV ownership The Independent Television Commission has warned that if the UK government liberalises the rules on ITV ownership, deal-making of 'scramble for Africa' proportions could break out in the commercial broadcasting system. The scramble could begin today. All the signs are that the government has accepted the argument that there should be a measure of consolidation among the 14 ITV companies and that the nine so-called 'large' ones should be able to take each other over. By international standards most ITV companies are tiny. For instance, HTV - with a market value of Pounds 58.5m - is defined as a 'large' company under existing broadcasting legislation. Protection for the regional interests of Scotland and Wales will mean that HTV and Scottish are to be excluded from takeover by one of the big nine, although they could be taken over by another EU company. Limits will also be set to prevent too great a concentration of power in any one pair of hands, in particular ensuring that no one company will be able to own both the London weekday and the London weekend licence. This could be done by specifying the licences that could be available for ITV takeover or setting advertising market share limits. At least half the ITV system is waiting nervously for the starting pistol to be fired. Some are predators waiting to pounce, others are already flinching from the expected attack. However, if the new rules are drawn tightly, very little might happen. If, for example, takeovers are banned that push combined advertising market share over 25 per cent of total ITV revenues, neither Carlton Communications nor Granada could acquire Central, and Carlton could probably not take over Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. If it is decided that no company can hold more than two licences, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees would be safe from predators because the merged group already holds two. Under such a restrictive scenario the only certainty would be that Anglia Television would be gobbled up by someone. On the other hand, Mr Leslie Hill, chairman and chief executive of Central, believes it would be 'quite farcical' if after so much debate, the government decided to make little change. To open the way for significant changes of ownership, the rules would have to allow a single company to own two large licences plus one small one. It would also have to set the market share limits at 25 per cent of all conventional television advertising. By including the revenues of Channel 4 and GMTV, the breakfast company, all the large companies would be able to take each other over, apart from the restrictions in London. If, as seems likely, the Government has avoided going for the most restrictive stance, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - which recently issued a profits warning - could be the key to a multi-dimensional puzzle. LWT, which in May bought 14 per cent of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, may decide that its only chance of an independent future lies in carrying out a pre-emptive strike on the Leeds-based company. The aim would be to buy two licences in one swoop, thereby preventing any other ITV company mounting a takeover. The hope would be that enough cost cuts could be made to cope with the Yorkshire group's payments to the Treasury, which run at more than Pounds 1m a week. However Granada, already the owner of 20 per cent of LWT, may also make a pre-emptive move on the London station. Mr Guy Lamming, an analyst at James Capel, foresees 'horrendous situations' where companies launch takeovers financed by shares, while the value of the paper keeps being driven upwards by bidding for the bidders. Ms Katherine Pelly, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believes the whole television sector will rise because even 'ring-fenced' companies such as HTV can be taken over by predators from outside ITV. Granada and Carlton both have the financial muscle to be dominant players. Granada would like either LWT or Central, and would rather have Yorkshire than nothing. However, Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, is understood to be reluctant to pay any more of a premium than has already been injected into share prices by the pre-liberalisation leaks. Carlton would obviously like to own Central, in which it already holds 20 per cent. Second prize would be Anglia. Central itself, which many analysts see as undervalued, is planning acquisitions of its own, while even lowly Anglia is not above a tilt at its big neighbour Central. When the music stops, a form of chaos might reign with most of the major players owning bits of each other and, rather like the game of Monopoly, further swaps and rationalisation may be necessary. ITC chairman Sir George Russell would have preferred a further period of calm before the 'scramble for Africa' began. Given that this calm is now unlikely - barring last minute changes of mind by politicians - Sir George, it is believed, would like to see three or four dominant players emerge, each taking a small ITV company under its wing. One thing will not change, however. The ITC is determined to hold all the owners of ITV licences to their programming obligations, and that will impose limits on the savings that can be achieved through rationalisation.</p>

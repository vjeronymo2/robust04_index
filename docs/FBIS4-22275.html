			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Clouds Appear in Russia's </F> Investment Skies"]    [Text] One of the largest United States companies,  Russel 20x20, yesterday expressed its readiness in principle to  cooperate with Russia, in particular within the framework of  establishment of a fund for the insurance of foreign  investments. The declaration was made during the course of talks  at the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and  Development (RAICD). Quite a number of proposals of this sort  continue to be received by the agency, whose status today,  incidentally, is quite hazy (on 16 March KOMMERSANT-DAILY  reported certain proposals regarding its fate). The West has  apparently taken seriously the statement made by Viktor  Chernomyrdin at the end of last year that 1994 will become "the  year of investments." And it is not easy to explain to investors  that the situation is not in fact shaping up all that smoothly.  They would not understand.    Taking the operational experience of similar agencies into  account (they exist in virtually all the developed countries),  RAICD has proposed its concept of the formation of investment  insurance institutions. At its initiative, we already see the  establishment of the Russian Bank for Reconstruction and  Development and two corporations--the Russian Financial  Corporation and State Investment Corporation. Among plans not  yet realized is the establishment of an independent tender  committee and, finally, the Multilateral Agency for Guaranteeing  Investments in Russia (including guarantees from political  risk). To form the latter, it is proposed to create an  international fund (located abroad) in which Russia could be the  first to make contributions. An invitation would then be  extended to private foreign capital to follow this example.  Interest in this business has also been expressed by the  American firm Russel 20x20, which controls capital in the amount  of $1 billion and has already established a similar fund in  Poland, then in China.    Practice shows that foreign investors prefer right now to  engage in risky business in Russia through Russian state  structures--as being more reliable. But rumors to the effect  that one of these is operating effectively (or the opposite) are  spread extremely rapidly among conservative (at least when it  comes to money) "Westerners." And it may seem strange to them  that following the declaration on priority being given to  investment cooperation in the January presidential edict on  structure of the government, RAICD--in essence a ministry, was  subject to transformation into a state institution under the  roof of MFER [Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations]. While on  7 February the prime minister officially agreed to transfer the  entire investments unit to the competence of the Ministry of  Economics. Insofar as the above-mentioned presidential edict was  not repealed by anyone, however, MFER also continues to consider  itself the "investments boss." In this regard, judging from the  plans of this department (drawn up recently in the form of a  draft governmental decree), the RAICD investments unit may  dissolve within the framework of the relevant governmental  ministry. It remains an open question to what extent this  diminished status will conform to the declared state strategy of  priority being given to investment policy.

The greatest  flow of capital is attributable to 1993. Three hundred  ninety-seven enterprises were registered in January 1994.    --The most intensive activity in Russia is being manifested  by countries of the West, including the "Big Seven," as well as  states of the former CMEA and China.    --Among new trends in the organization of enterprises with  foreign investments we see a growth in the number of structures  having 100-percent foreign capital (this practice is especially  pronounced among Chinese businessmen). In connection with the  falling rate of the ruble, however, the amounts of authorized  capital of such enterprises (in hard currency) are diminishing  on the whole.    --The share of foreign investors in the authorized capital  of  joint enterprises since March 1992 comes to about $870 million.    --With respect to size of charter fund and in terms of  percentage of the total number of joint enterprises, the  predominating share are enterprises engaged in intermediary and  consulting services, and in light industry production output and  trade. Some 21 percent of enterprises are engaged in the  development and introduction of new instrumentation and  technical systems.    --Among the enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital,  the  majority are engaged in intermediary and consulting services,  financial transactions, and export-import operations.

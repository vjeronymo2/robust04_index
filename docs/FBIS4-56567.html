			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA </F> magazine and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE  newspaper -- live]    [Text] [Sexto] The decree-law on confiscation of ill-gotten  goods has just been promulgated. In other words, the crusade  against the hoarders has just begun.    [Rodriguez] I did not like that bit about crusade because  that might give the impression of a campaign, something here  today and perhaps gone tomorrow. I seems to me that this is  precisely an act of national defense, wholly unrelated to a  crusade or campaign.    [Sexto] Then, do you believe the hoarders could reappear? Do  you not believe that when the hoarders are crushed, and  conditions are created so they do not reappear, this might have  been a crusade, something we can file away in history as a gray  period, a file on a social germ which arose before our noses and  we rejected?    [Rodriguez] When a farmer cuts down weeds, he does so hoping  they will never grow again. However, during the next planting  cycle, he has to do it all over again. He has to weed the crops.    [Sexto] I believe that what has happened is that the  hoarders  have been allowed to flourish alone for too long because we  lacked this legal tool made public today.    [Rodriguez] We can all remember that there was a program  against hoarders. However, our legislation only allowed for  crime that was proven and therefore, today's decree-law on  confiscation of ill-gotten goods is a new tool because this is  also a new phenomenon.    [Sexto] I used the term crusade in a semantic manner. The  crusades of history were temporary, provisional processes; there  was an initial boom that later faded away. Crusade has always  been understood as the impetus of a certain campaign, action  against specific phenomena, which later diminishes. What I mean  is that Cuba, with this decree-law conducted as an act of  national defense -- obviously, our society...    [Rodriguez, interrupting] Excuse me, but let us replace  crusade with: we are defending the nation even more.    [Sexto] We are defending the nation even more. In other  words, our country is confronting very powerful, strong, dire  circumstances and hardships. Cuba needs above all to cleanse  itself, to eliminate obstacles and roadblocks. Evidently, the  proliferation, particularly during this time of crisis, of  harmful, immoral, illegal elements was weighing down our people  even further. It is one more element of deterioration and  demobilization.    [Rodriguez] Not only that, they are corrupt and corrupting  elements.    [Sexto] Corruptors and demobilizers. To date, there has been  a certain impunity against [words indistinct] profiteering.    [Rodriguez] In addition, they promote crime.    [Sexto] I am not saying that that impunity was the result of  laziness, carelessness, or indifference. I believe that under  these dire circumstances, the nation has had to fight on many  fronts. Therefore, in these periods of crisis, of shortages,  these periods when self-confidence can be momentarily lost, it  is logical for these manifestations of vice to proliferate and  even increase because then the society is a medium for this to  happen. I believe we are now reacting decisively, firmly, and  physically.    [Rodriguez] Although we have semantic differences, in  general  we fully agree. I believe that the decree-law on confiscation of  ill-gotten goods is today applauded by the great majority of the  people.    Of course, those affected will never be able to applaud it.  It is applauded above all because it responds to the clamor of  the people. Recently, we spoke of the [words indistinct] and  mentioned how far the workers' [words indistinct] reaches. This  demonstrates that the Cuban Government does listen to its  people, its workers; and acts on the basis of what the masses  entrust it with. Therefore, the people do rule here.    [Sexto] That clamor was very natural because despite the  difficulties the Cuban people confront today, despite the  difficulties that relax or stretch morals and values because we  are even under survival conditions -- and morals have a certain  relativity, are not absolute, fixed; they move according to  prevailing material conditions in human societies -- anyhow,  that clamor is logical because despite the fact that our people  have great ethical reserves, our people are sickened by  injustice, reject being exploited. We have not been resisting  exploitation for so many years on a whim. We have been defending  independence and social justice. This is precisely why I feel  this is deep within the Cuban national character.    [Rodriguez] There is also a practical consideration  regarding  the confiscation of ill-gotten goods. The people are concerned  with how we are going to identify the hoarders. I think that we  have to collectively participate in denouncing those who will  quietly try to evade the law.    I believe that in the neighborhoods, it is very hard not to  know who those people are, those people who accumulate goods  illicitly; who live above the means of his neighbors; and in  addition, who sneer at the community around them; corrupt the  community around them; have a group of collaborators; and I have  been told -- although I have yet to see this -- that some even  have bodyguards, in addition to many cars, and a lavish  lifestyle.    [Sexto] I do not think that it will be difficult to identify  them because ostentation and vanity are inherent in this type of  vice. Those who make money easily are given to vanity, luxury,  ostentation; and I believe these are the marks each one of these  hoarders leave on the rest of society. In other words, the  product of their ostentation and vanity.    I want to [words indistinct] it seems to me because one  speaks with people, people call, write. I believe we have to be  careful in identifying the hoarders. In other words, our people  have a high concept of justice, but that justice has at times  deviated toward egalitarian stands which are unfair per se. I  believe it is good to stress that this decree is aimed at those  who have profited illicitly. We cannot put in the same category  workers who having given their intelligence, hard work,  brilliance, and talents, have attained a higher standard of  living because they have had many sources of income, salaries  that are the product of honest work. We have to be careful with  this. Here we are always going to refer to those who have  profited by exploiting the needs of others. This is what we have  to reject, condemn, and repress.    [Rodriguez] I believe this warning you issue is very good  because it has been said many times that hoarders are all those  who have amounts of money and live above the means of the rest  of the people. However, we have to acknowledge that there are  people who have attained that money honestly. This decree-law  very well specifies illicitly gotten goods because those  attained through legitimate means -- for example, inheritances  -- we have to point out that there are still families in Cuba  who inherited money from their relatives from the capitalist era  and are still living among us. Perhaps, they live in a large  house, have a vehicle and a life-style well above that of the  average people, but we cannot condemn them for having inherited  that, or having obtained it through legitimate means.    [Sexto] Of course, no one in Cuba is, nor can be against  people having what their work allows them to attain. In other  words, if I am very intelligent and hard-working, no one can  reproach me for my higher income or lifestyle, over those who  are not equally intelligent of hard-working. I am personalizing  this. I am not that intelligent, nor that hard-working. This is  clear. The listeners understand that. I am giving an example on  a personal level.    We have to be careful. In our society, work is the first  duty  of the citizen. It has to be a means for the citizen to hope for  a better life as an individual. No one can condemn or reject  this, nor harass anyone who is better off as result of his work.    [Rodriguez] We also have to discuss a concern that numerous  listeners and JUVENTUD REBELDE readers have expressed regarding  the emergence of new legitimate hoarders on the basis of  self-employment because self-employment work yields fairly high  dividends in certain highly demanded sectors. I believe this  concern of the people ought to be the focus of that group of  measures begin taken today by the Cuban Government because it is  an issue to everyone, according to their work, but excesses are  not good either. I believe that self- employed workers ought to  pay adjusted taxes according to their income. This will avoid  the appearance of excessive wealth because these people also do  not report practically anything to the people. I am referring to  the hoarders, the ones [words indistinct].    [Sexto] Self-employment today in Cuba is as legitimate as  collective, state, or social work. I also believe it is fair for  these workers to pay an adjusted tax on their income. This is an  effort to balance out the differences. Now, we have to remember  that many of today's high prices are the result of the excess  currency in circulation. In the same measure that the excess  circulation diminishes, the prices will logically drop because  the excess circulation affects every transaction in Cuba.    [Rodriguez] Also, in the same measure that the presence of  products increases, a competitiveness will take place and  self-employed workers who today make perhaps tens of thousands  of pesos in a year, will not make such excessive amounts.    [Sexto] Of course, because all these exorbitant incomes  correspond to economic conditions supporting them. However, this  is temporary. In the measure to wh ich we overcome this  situation, these prices will find their corresponding balance.    [Rodriguez] In addition to this, in the measure that the  offering of products and services improves in the state stores  and facilities, this will increase competition and lower the  prices and participation of self-employed workers in production.</p>

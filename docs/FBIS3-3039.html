			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held at the Information Center of the </F> Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress and the  Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference in Beijing on 14 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified moderator] Today, we have invited Wan  Xueyuan, Zhejiang governor; Xu Yunhong, Zhejiang vice governor  and Ningbo mayor; Wang Yongming, Hangzhou mayor; and Chen  Wenxian, Wenzhou mayor, to answer your questions about  Zhejiang's reform, opening up, and economic development.    [Correspondent] I am a XINHUA correspondent. In his  government work report, Premier Li Peng stated the need to speed  up cultivating and developing a market structure. Governor Wan,  what will Zhejiang, a major province engaging in building a  market structure, do in this regard?    [Wan] Zhejiang already has more than 4,000 commodity markets  of all descriptions. The volume of transactions reached 65.1  billion yuan in 1993. The net amount of money that Zhejiang  recovered from its markets ranked first in eastern China. Some  of these 4,000 or so markets are super-large in size. Of the  nation's 600 markets with transactions exceeding 100 million  yuan per year, Zhejiang has 107. The establishment of these  markets has expedited the province's economic development. This  year, we will continue to improve all kinds of services,  establish all forms of markets of essential goods and services  -- especially the financial, technology, labor, and real estate  markets -- so that our markets will become more efficient. We  will also establish and improve market management, establish  norms governing market behaviors, tighten the supervision over  product quality, and device efficient mechanisms governing  prices. Centering around the several major reform projects to  be launched in the country, we will also improve our  macroeconomic regulation and control, and deepen enterprise  reform. Meanwhile, we will also establish a good social  security system and the necessary supporting measures to make  sure that Zhejiang's market economic development will be even  more successful.    [Correspondent] I learned from the information you released  that, in 1993, Zhejiang's gross domestic product [GDP] increased  25 percent, and your investment in fixed assets increased 66.2  percent. Now, the central government has called for a slower  economic growth, do you have the ability to slow down the high  economic growth? How much do you think the GDP will be this  year?    [Wan] Zhejiang's GDP increased 25 percent and our investment  in fixed assets increased 66 percent in 1993. The growth was  indeed quite high. Such a high growth was achieved when energy  supply and transportation and communications facilities were  very tight; but the high growth also gave rise to price  increases. Therefore, we fully feel the correctness of the call  made by the party Central Committee and the State Council to  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and pay special  attention to the quality of economic growth. This year, we are  ready to earnestly follow the central authorities' call and move  forward to establish a socialist market economic system by  carrying out several major reform projects, such as those of  restructuring the financial, taxation, banking, and investment  systems. The developments over the past decade or so show that  Zhejiang's annual GDP growth increased 13 percent on the  average. The [GDP] growth in the past three year was 20 percent  annually. We plan to control the growth -- especially the  growth of investment in fixed assets -- through intensifying  macroeconomic regulation and control. People in all quarters in  Zhejiang must realize the need not to set up any more  low-standard construction projects [di sui ping de jian she],  but to give priority to improving the quality of economic growth  [ti gao jing ji zeng zhang zi liang] through counting on science  and technology and improving workers' proficiency. We will pay  special attention to market research and to enterprises'  efficiency. This is because the industrial output of Zhejiang's  village and town enterprises accounts for 65 percent of our  province's total industrial output, and market information is  very important for these enterprises. When market prospects are  good, they will expand their production; but when there is a  recession, they will readjust their production or produce other  products. Their adaptability to market changes is quite good.  We do not worry about how fast our growth may be, but in light  of Zhejiang's economic growth in recent years, we think  Zhejiang's economic growth will be about 3 percentage points  [bai fen dian] higher than the national average. We underscore  growth which yields returns.    [Correspondent] I am a RENMIN RIBAO correspondent. I want  to ask the Ningbo mayor a question. Ningbo is a major open  city. What new measures has Ningbo taken to open itself to the  outside world and bring in more foreign capital?    [Xu Yunhong] We should say that Ningbo has achieved  significant successes in opening itself to the outside world.  Ningbo's development has been quite fast over the past couple of  years. Ningbo's total imports and exports reached $1.7 billion  in 1993. That was a growth of 69.4 percent. In 1993 alone,  Ningbo approved 1,015 foreign-funded enterprises, which was an  increase of nearly 60 percent; and the amount of foreign capital  actually invested in Ningbo reached $370 million, a growth of  nearly 150 percent. However, I think we should also realize  that Ningbo still lags behind other coastal cities in opening up  to the outside world. In future, we plan to work hard in the  following respects: First, we will speed up building Ningbo's  infrastructure. I think that only by doing so can Ningbo give  scope to its opening up potential. We must speed up building the  additional railway linking Ningbo and Hangzhou so that ports in  Ningbo can link up with the Hangzhou-Nanchang railway and other  main railways linking north and south China. Our second project  is to build an economic development zone and a bonded zone and  develop (Dashou) Island -- projects approved by the State  Council. The total area of these two zones and the island will  reach 60 square kilometers, an unusually large developmental  project in the country. The third project we will carry out is  to improve the foreign-funded enterprises already in Ningbo.  When we people in Ningbo, 5 million in all, make concerted  efforts in building up Ningbo, we will live up to our  forefathers' expectations.    [Correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO HAIYANG BAO. Zhejiang has  come up with the slogan of revitalizing Zhejiang through  developing its sea. Governor Wan, do you have any specific  plans and measures for this project? Also, what problems does  Zhejiang still face with regard to maritime development and  management?    [Wan] One of Zhejiang's strengths lies in its seacoast.  Zhejiang has a 2,200 km-long coast and 3,050 islands. What we  are particularly proud of is that we have many deep-water ports,  such as Ningbo, Zhoushan, Zapu, Taizhou, and Wenzhou. In terms  of tourism, the well-known Mount Putuo is a popular sightseeing  spot. Moreover, Zhejiang and Shanghai have plans to jointly  develop the Shengxi Islands and turn them into a vacationing  resort on the sea. In recent years, the construction of large  thermopower and nuclear power plants by taking advantage of  Zhejiang's deep-water ports has become very well-known, even in  the world. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been operating  normally over the past year. Along the coast, there are a dozen  or so places suitable for the construction of thermopower plants  with generating capacity greater than 2.4 million kw. We are  confident that, by early next century, eastern Zhejiang will  become the power base of eastern China. With regard to oil  development, you all know that, since 1 January this year, 17  transnational oil companies have been prospecting oil, including  seabed drilling and physical studies of the earth, within a  54,000 square km-zone in the sea 150 km east of Wenzhou. So  people in Zhejiang are very upbeat about their sea. We can say  that while Zhejiang's land size is quite small, we are a major  maritime province. Zhejiang's future lies in the sea.    [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from the China Central  Television. I want to ask Governor Wan a question. Zhejiang is  a province in which village and town enterprises are developing  quite rapidly. What impact financial and taxation reforms  promoted by the state this year will have on Zhejiang's economy,  especially the development of Zhejiang's village and town  enterprises?    [Wan] Village and town enterprises are confronting many new  challenges during the course of reform today. This is because  state enterprises, through replacing operating mechanisms, will  operate with greater vitality. The development of independent  and private businesses, and also the changes in the market, are  also challenges to village and town enterprises. Owing to their  outmoded equipment and inadequate technology, the prospects for  some village and town enterprises are also quite grim. In  recent years, the provincial government has drawn up policies  for cutting the taxes of these enterprises in an effort to  support their development. These policies will be rescinded  after the new tax system has been implemented, and some village  and town enterprises may have to pay more taxes. But we must  also see that village and town enterprises have developed  flexible mechanisms governing their autonomy, profits and  losses, capital accumulation, and development. The motivating  force and pressure caused by the reform and the pressure caused  by market changes will very likely prompt village and town  enterprises to restructure their organization, industrial  production, and product mix. So these enterprises will have  problems as well as opportunities. But we think they will face  more opportunities and hopes than problems.    [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from GUANGMING RIBAO.  My question is addressed to Hangzhou Mayor Wang Youming: A top  priority of the ongoing reform is to transform the operational  mechanism of state-owned enterprises and improve their economic  efficiency. What is the current status in terms of economic  efficiency of Hangzhou's state-owned enterprises? What measures  have you taken to improve their economic efficiency.    [Wang] Hangzhou has 6,000 state-owned enterprises. Their  economic efficiency is quite satisfactory. The 1993 state-owned  enterprises' output value rose 13 percent over 1992; sale volume  rose 16 percent; and tax receipts and profits submitted to the  state rose 23 percent. All 6,000 enterprises are operating  normally.    [Correspondent] I am a correspondent from JINGJI RIBAO.  Zhejiang and Wenzhou have always been models of economic  development in China. In a place like Wenzhou with a relatively  developed market economy, how does the city government  administer its economy and promote the development of  enterprises.    [Chen Wenxian] In the early stages of development, the city  government adopted the policy of greater latitude first and  guidance later, greater freedom first and restrictions later,  circulation ahead of transportation, and prosperity ahead of  (?city appearance). This policy of reform and enlivening the  economy has the characteristics of active noninterference. As  we have completed [word indistinct] accumulation of the initial  stages, we will try to turn Wenzhou's economy from one noted for  its lack of order to one that is standard, well-ordered, and  regulated by law. We will be shifting from growth in volume to  improvement in quality. We will introduce a smooth-functioning  and closely integrated market economic structure in which the  property rights are clearly defined and the mechanisms are  flexible. We will promote changes in two areas: operational  mechanism of enterprises and the functions of government  departments. We will pay close attention to three key points:  the development of a modern enterprise system, the development  of a market system, and macroeconomic administration of the  government. Wenzhou's economy will experience fast economic  growth with high economic efficiency.    [Moderator] That is the end of the news conference.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: NUMBERS IN THE NBA ADD UP, BUT SOMETIMES DON'T FIGURE  </P> <P> The Koncak Syndrome is the talk of the National Basketball Assn.'s off-season.  </P> <P> Shortly after Atlanta signed free agent Jon Koncak to a six-year, $13.2-million  deal, the Hawks gave Dominique Wilkins a five-year, $14.5-million contract.  </P> <P> Jan Hubbard of Newsday quoted Wilkins on Koncak: "Let's put it this way. He's a  very, very good friend right now."  </P> <P> Is Koncak's salary inflated? He averaged 4.7 points and 6.1 rebounds last  season. He will make $2.5 million this season, the same salary as the Lakers'  Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> Greener pastures: From Peter May of The Hartford Courant: "Dino Radja made  approximately $9,200 playing last year for his club team in Split, Yugoslavia.  The Boston Celtics signed him for the startling amount of $425,000 -- which has  to be a record for a second-rounder -- and guaranteed it. No wonder he doesn't  want to go back."  </P> <P> Add May: "The Danny Ferry trade rumors are everywhere. The Clippers apparently  want a shooting guard and at least one No. 1 for the ex-Duke star, who spurned  them for Europe. The Charlotte Hornets (Dell Curry and two No. 1s), San Antonio  Spurs (Willie Anderson and a No. 1) and Philadelphia 76ers (Hersey Hawkins and  a No. 1) all reportedly are interested."  </P> <P> Last add May: "(Bill) Fitch, by the way, hasn't been to New Jersey since he  signed as coach several weeks ago. Maybe he's planning to stay in Texas and  coach the Nets via satellite dish. At least that way he wouldn't have to watch  them in person."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Sept. 25, 1982, Northwestern ended a 34-game losing streak with  a 31-6 victory over Northern Illinois. Who starred for the Wildcats?  </P> <P> Pooh-poohed: Inside Sports on former UCLA guard Pooh Richardson and the  Minnesota Timberwolves: "After an unexpectedly productive haul in the expansion  draft, they caught many off guard with the selection of Jerome (Pooh)  Richardson (10th) in the college draft. Despite a breakthrough year at UCLA,  Richardson was considered to be no better than fourth- or fifth-best point  guard behind Tim Hardaway, Mookie Blaylock, B.J. Armstrong and Sherman  Douglas."  </P> <P> Add Richardson: David Aldridge of the Washington Post reports that Minnesota  Coach Bill Musselman prefers free-agent guard Sidney Lowe to Richardson. David  Rivers, claimed off the Lakers' roster, might be the odd man out.  </P> <P> Age-old question: Inside Sports on the Lakers' Vlade Divac: "He rates among the  world's best young players. Except that some believe he's 30, not 21 as he  claims."  </P> <P> Fitchburg State update: The Falcons lost their 34th consecutive game, 6-0, to  Westfield State Friday night.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Ricky Edwards (177 yards rushing, four touchdowns).  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chicago Cub broadcaster Harry Caray in Sport magazine, on rumors  that he was fired by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1969 because he had had an  affair with the much-younger wife of a brewery executive: "If you were me,  would you go around denying rumors like that?"

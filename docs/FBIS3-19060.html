			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Preliminary approaches have been made to Finland  concerning the transfer of the Finnish peacekeepers in The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to Tuzla in  Bosnia. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto confirms that an  unofficial inquiry has been received from the United Nations and  the matter is currently being studied.    [Begin Haavisto recording] For the time being it is a very  preliminary contact. It seems that the United States will be  sending more peacekeepers than before to the territory of former  Yugoslavia and apparently they would like to station them in  FYROM. The question has been raised whether consideration could  be given to the possibility that the post of the Nordic  battalion there might be changed. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    Finland's current law on peacekeeping prevents Finnish  soldiers from being sent to the warring Bosnia. Now people are  waiting to see whether a debate will resume on amending the  peacekeeping law. At least Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn is in  favor of increasing the peacekeepers' right to self-defense that  would make it possible to send them to Tuzla, for instance.</p>

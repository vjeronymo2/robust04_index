			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: B Elliott calls for Pounds 5.4m and acquires dies maker B ELLIOTT, the electrical and mechanical engineer, is acquiring Deeming Taylor, the specialist dies and tooling products manufacturer, for a maximum Pounds 771,500 in cash. Partly to fund the acquisition the company is calling for Pounds 5.4m net through a 1-for-3 rights issue of 9.1m new ordinary shares at 63p each. Yesterday the shares closed 3p up at 75p. The issue, which is fully underwritten by Beeson Gregory, is also offered on the basis of one ordinary share for every 2.13, 7.5 per cent preference shares. B Elliott has also announced a turnround from restated losses of Pounds 764,000 to pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.26m for the six months to October 31. Turnover amounted to Pounds 40.7m against Pounds 45.8m last time which included Pounds 10.6m from discontinued operations. Operating profits from continuing operations improved to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 1.5m). Earnings per share worked through at 3.42p against losses of 57.44p last time. There is again no dividend. Mr Somerset Gibbs, chairman, said the company had made excellent progress since completing the refinancing at the end of 1992, when 24.6m new shares were issued. As part of its restructuring programme the group's machine tool businesses had either been closed or divested and that process had concluded with the sale of the assets and under taking of Butler Machine Tool in February 1993. The continuing businesses were performing to plan and proceeds from the rights issue would also be used to fund the retention of the Philidas and Newall businesses, Mr Gibbs said. For the year to October 31 1992 Deeming Taylor achieved gross profits of Pounds 353,000 on sales of Pounds 853,000. The net book value of the trading assets, plant and equipment being acquired is expected to be a minimum Pounds 394,000, including some Pounds 90,000 cash.</p>

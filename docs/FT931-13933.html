			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Price rise sought for top ITV serial GRANADA Television is seeking a large increase in the price paid by the ITV network for its main ratings winner, Coronation Street. Granada is believed to be seeking a 25 per cent increase in what the ITV network pays for the 'soap' which regularly attracts audiences ranging from 19.6m to 21.8m. The television company could threaten to take Coronation Street elsewhere, such as the BBC, under new tariff arrangements. While this is unlikely, it highlights the difficulty faced by ITV in deciding what to pay for programmes. Under the old regime there was a fixed tariff for each programme type, irrespective of what individual programmes cost to make. From next autumn the network centre will have an annual budget of Pounds 515m to spend on programmes - approximately last year's total with an increase in line with inflation - and the tariff will be replaced by individual negotiations with programme makers.</p>

Later they visited with the president of the  Supreme Court and asked that the Law on Venue Dispute not be  implemented.    A few hours before the Supreme Court ruled on the Law on  Venue Dispute, opposition congressmen represented by Henry  Peace, Fernando Olivera, Robert Caceres, Manuel Moreira, and  Antero Flores, among others, presented an appeal for the  protection of civil rights so the law is not enforced. The  document was received by Justice Rafael Yager in his office. The  appeal included a precautionary measure so that the law would  not be applied to La Cantuta case. [passage omitted]</p>

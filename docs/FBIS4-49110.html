			<p>BFN     [Text] In the hall of the provincial party committee  building yesterday afternoon [27 April] the provincial party  committee held a mobilization meeting on maintaining stability  and striking severe blows at crime. In attendance were Du  Qinglin; Wang Xueping; (Zhong Chen); Wei Zefang; (Li Mingxian);  (Wu Fengnong); Tian Zhongmu, president of the provincial higher  people's court; Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the provincial  procuratorate; and provincial department and bureau directors;  secretaries of city and county party committees; mayors and  county magistrates; and secretaries of commissions on politics  and law. The meeting was presided over by Vice Governor Wang  Xueping, member of the provincial party committee standing  committee. Governor Du Qinglin [title as heard], deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important  speech at the meeting.    Du Qinglin pointed out: Since the beginning of this year,  party committees and governments at all levels in the province  have achieved very great results in conscientiously implementing  the basic policies set out by the party Central committee for  the work of the whole party and nation, and in upholding the  principle of doing two types of work simultaneously while  attaching importance to both. Nevertheless, while the situation  was fine, there still were factors affecting our province's  political stability and social tranquility, the pubic security  situation remained grim, and the incidence of major and [words  indistinct] cases rose. The existence and spread of these  destabilizing factors will affect and hinder the smooth progress  of reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as  economic construction. Therefore, party committees and  governments at all levels should pay close attention to  safeguarding stability as an important task at present; place it  in an important position; uphold the strategic principle of  doing two types of work simultaneously while attaching  importance to both; and carry out the task of safeguarding  stability and the struggle against various crimes, right down to  the various aspects and strata of society, so as to develop a  situation in which the whole party and society make joint  efforts to manage social order and in which the broad masses of  people take an active role in managing social order. Principal  party and government leaders should take command personally, and  party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen  unified command and concentrate human, material, and financial  resources, as we did in the case of severely cracking down on  criminal activities in 1983; firmly implement the principle of  punishing criminals sternly, promptly, and according to the law  so as to destroy the criminals' overweening arrogance; implement  the various measures for the comprehensive management of social  order; uphold the principle of simultaneously solving and  preventing crimes and taking both radical and stopgap measures,  with the stress on the management of social order; and reduce or  elimminate destabilizing factors and symptoms of law violations  and crime once and for all.</p>

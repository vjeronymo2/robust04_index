The data used in the study were gathered from dozens of  launches. Long-lasting artificial ionospheric disturbances  recorded by vertical sounding were discussed first. A series of  46 ionograms taken from an ionospheric station located in  Karaganda, Kazakhstan, revealed that additional and unusual  tracks appeared on the ionograms after a launch, and the  relative frequency, quantity, and duration of the tracks  depended on the time of year and the time of day. It was  emphasized that, as a rule, the additional reflections only  appeared during daylight hours. An explanation was provided for  the absence of the additional tracks at night, and it was  concluded that no long-lasting positive deviations of the  electron concentration from background levels were detected. The  causes of negative disturbances in the electron concentration  were then addressed. The ionograms recorded in this part of the  study looked very much like those obtained when the ionosphere  is modified by chemical agents. The second part of the paper  discussed the use of short-wave Doppler inclined sounding of  artificial ionospheric disturbances. The short-wave signals were  transmitted in unmodulated carrier mode by broadcast  transmitters. The signal parameters were recorded simultaneously  on up to eight frequencies on a synthesizer-type receiver  located in Tomsk. The signals of the second intermediate  frequency were mixed with a reference signal with the same  frequency plus a base frequency component of several hertz  (e.g., 215 kHz + _D_F). The characteristics of the disturbances  and the dynamics of their development were described,  illustrated, and mathematically modelled. The results of the  ionogram study were fundamentally consistent with the results of  the inclined sounding study. Figures 5, tables 1; references 27:  19 Russian, 8 Western.</p>

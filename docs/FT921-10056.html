			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Letter: A safer method of payment Sir, Your article, 'My cheque is in the post. . .', (February 1) caused me to reflect, not for the first time, on the high-handedness of companies which give their shareholders little option but to pay for rights issues by cheque, sent of course at the shareholder's risk. If the safest method of transferring money is through the inter-bank giro system, why do not companies include on their provisional allotment letters the account number and sorting code of the branch of their bank to which payment is to be made? This would give shareholders the option of a safer method of payment. Cleone Christie, Gateways, Wharfe Lane, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 2LL</p>

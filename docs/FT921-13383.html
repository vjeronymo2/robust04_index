			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Business and the Environment: Pouring salt on wounded roads Snow and ice are only part of the nuisance of a northern winter. Equally annoying are the vast quantities of salt spread on roads, pavements and driveways after every fresh snowfall. Local authorities in the northern US alone apply about 10m tonnes of rock salt to roads each winter. The Canadian province of Ontario uses 1.2m tonnes a year. But keeping the arteries of commerce open comes with a heavy price. The smell and taste of salt hangs in the air for days after it has been applied. It penetrates coats and gloves. Salt even spoils a dog's winter walks by getting into its paw pads. More serious are the enormous financial costs caused by salt corrosion. Ontario's ministry of transportation estimates that environmental damage caused by salt adds up to between 10 and 20 times the cost of the salt itself. A committee of the US Transportation Research Board (a division of the Washington-based National Research Coun-cil) concluded in a report published last week that the motor industry spends Dollars 1.9bn-Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.6bn) a year on corrosion-resistant materials and coatings for trucks and cars. Repairs to rusted bridges and parking garages in the US Northeast and Midwest are estimated at Dollars 200m-Dollars 500m a year. The study notes that over the past 30 years 'road salt has caused more premature bridge deck deterioration than any other factor'. Much of the damage caused by salt is not easily quantifiable. Road maintenance agencies blame salt for stunted growth, falling leaves and needles and sometimes dying limbs in about 5-10 per cent of roadside trees. Local governments in the US spend about Dollars 10m a year to keep salt out of drinking water. Despite the damage, no acceptable alternative to salt has yet been found. Many airports, concerned about the corrosive effects of chloride-based de-icers on aircraft fuselages, use urea to keep their runways clear. But urea costs about 10 times as much as salt, leaves a slippery film and is not effective in very cold temperatures. Many municipalities have tried sand, which is an abrasive rather than a de-icer. According to Max Perchanok, a scientist with the Ontario ministry of transportation: 'Sand is OK - if you're prepared to drive at 50 km per hour over a bumpy surface.' Salt's most recent challenger is calcium magnesium acetate (CMA), a compound produced by a reaction between dolomitic lime and acetic acid. Less corrosive and less damaging than salt to the environment, CMA comes closer than most materials to matching salt's de-icing power. But it costs 20 times more than salt, and needs to be applied in greater quantities to be effective. The National Research Council study concludes that: 'The use of CMA as a more general replacement for sale is unlikely and unwarranted . . . In all likelihood, sodium chloride, or common salt, will continue to be the predominant highway de-icer for many years.' The best hope for those worried about the damage caused by salt may be the current squeeze on local authorities' budgets. Several cities are cutting back on the quantity of salt spread on roads after a snowfall. Toronto's public works department has cut its salt use by more than half so far this winter, even though the city has had 12 cm more snow than last year. Public works commissioner Nick Vardin says that instead of ordering salting trucks to go out when the snow starts, he now makes more use of snow ploughs. Furthermore, the trucks now leave many stretches of road unsalted, concentrating on the parts where salt is most needed, such as highways, busy intersections and the streets outside schools. 'I haven't had any complaints,' Vardin says.</p>

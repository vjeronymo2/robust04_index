			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> RAVEL AND RICHARD STRAUSS BY RIVERSIDE ORCHESTRA  </P> <P> Now in the midst of its 31st season, the Riverside County Philharmonic has had  a recent change of fortune along with its change of name -- until a year ago,  it was called the Riverside Symphony.  </P> <P> Longtime observers of the local musical scene have noted that, with the advent  of Patrick Flynn as music director in 1988-89, the orchestra has taken on a new  perspective.  </P> <P> This with only a handful of personnel changes in an already professional  ensemble that plays together fewer than a dozen times a season and operates on  a modest $230,000.  </P> <P> New or just refurbished, that perspective was on view at the third concert of  the season, Saturday night in historic, acoustically variable Municipal  Auditorium, in downtown Riverside.  </P> <P> Flynn, a native of England who has served as principal conductor for American  Ballet Theatre and in operatic posts in Australia and symphonic directorships  on this continent, is a dynamic podium personality without being a  grandstander.  </P> <P> His lively performances have a conviction and tautness that compel. Saturday,  with his own orchestra, he achieved a high level of communication.  </P> <P> Most impressively, he drew from the 75-member orchestra the kind of polished,  transparent, sweeping and subtle performance of Ravel's Second "Daphnis et  Chloe" Suite.  </P> <P> In "Daphnis," as in Richard Strauss' seldom-heard first tone poem, "Macbeth,"  and Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto, the orchestra responded thoroughly to  Flynn's ministrations in favor of stylistic contrasts, self-listening, pointed  solo lines and the broad musical arch. Certain first-desk and sectional  weaknesses aside -- the lower strings need beefing up, for instance -- this  orchestra deserves its growing reputation.  </P> <P> Soloist in the Prokofiev concerto was a gifted youngster, Aika Nishi, who won  this appearance in the 1989 Joanna Hodges International Competition; Nishi met  all the digital requirements in the piece but not its coloristic ones.

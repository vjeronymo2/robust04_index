			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MEDICINE SOMETIMES THE CAUSE OF RINGING IN THE EARS  </P> <P> Imagine what it would be like to have a bee buzzing around inside your head or  a bunch of crickets permanently perched on your shoulder. That's what Ben  experiences every day.  </P> <P> Tinnitus is sometimes described as "ringing in the ears," but sufferers talk  about hissing or humming noises as well as a high-pitched ringing or an  electronic type of whine.  </P> <P> There are many possible causes of tinnitus, including loud noises, ear  diseases, hypothyroidism or hypertension, among others. In Ben's case, the  tinnitus is brought on by the Naprosyn (naproxen) he takes to relieve arthritis  pain.  </P> <P> Most of the anti-inflammatory drugs Ben might take for arthritis are capable of  provoking tinnitus. But Ben might be less sensitive to one of them if his  doctor is willing to experiment.  </P> <P> Other medications notorious for causing tinnitus include quinine (Legatrin,  Q-vel, Quinamm) for restless legs. Malaria medicines, a variety of antibiotics  used against serious infections and certain diuretics for cardiovascular, liver  or kidney disease can cause both ringing in the ears, which usually disappears  when the drug is discontinued, or hearing loss, which may be permanent.  </P> <P> Among the antibiotics, neomycin has the worst reputation, but streptomycin,  Kanamycin, and several others administered only by injection may also cause  tinnitus and hearing impairment. High doses of erythromycin have been  associated with reversible hearing loss and tinnitus.  </P> <P> The diuretics known to affect hearing are Bumex (bumetanide), Edecrin  (ethacrynic acid) and Lasix (furosemide). Either tinnitus or hearing impairment  is usually reversible if the medication can be discontinued soon enough, but  these are drugs that must not be stopped without a doctor's supervision.  </P> <P> Needless to say, a patient who notices a strange sound that others do not hear,  or who suddenly has trouble hearing, should get in touch with his or her  physician.  </P></p>

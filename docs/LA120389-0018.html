			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BAD VIBRATIONS  </P> <P> ABC is making a TV movie about the Beach Boys, who aren't "stoked."  </P> <P> "It's not authorized and we're not being paid," said the group's manager, Tom  Hulett, adding, "We don't want to help them get any publicity, and we are  refusing to license (to them) any of the music we can control."  </P> <P> Exec producer Len Hill, who didn't return our calls, is in charge of the  adaptation of Steven Gains' 1984 nonfiction book, "Heroes &amp; Villains: The  True Story of the Beach Boys." Targeted for spring airing, it quietly went into  production Nov. 20 with a cast of mostly unknowns -- "St. Elsewhere" co-star  Bruce Greenwood is the most recognizable name, playing Dennis Wilson, the late  member of the famed family rock group.  </P> <P> Screenwriter Charles Rosin told us the project is primarily "a family drama  about the relationship between a father and his children. . . . Murray Wilson  was everyone's nightmare combination, Little League coach and stage mother."  </P> <P> Rosin said that Charles Manson -- "He lived with Dennis Wilson in 1968" -- will  be portrayed, but added, "You shouldn't get the idea that this movie will be  trashy or exploitative. I respect the Beach Boys. I grew up with their music."  </P> <P>  Songs from the Beach Boys' early years, no longer controlled by the group,  will be used in the movie, said a network source.

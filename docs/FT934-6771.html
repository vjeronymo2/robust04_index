			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Further staffing reductions at Enichem Enichem, the chronically loss-making petrochemicals arm of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday said it would cut its service and support staff by 10,000 within at least four years. Mr Marcello Colitti, the chairman, said the cuts were separate from job losses caused by any plant closures involved in the group's future rationalisation. He added that the cuts were part of Enichem's preparations to sell or privatise most of its operations. 'The future of the company depends upon rationalisation. There is no point hiding the truth. Unless these businesses have the potential to make money, nobody is going to invest in them,' said Mr Colitti. Last week, the group announced expected losses this year of around L2,200bn (Dollars 1.3bn). In spite of cost-cutting, the company lost L1,052bn in the first six months, against L721bn in the same 1992 period. 'The cost of producing a kilogram of polyethylene at the moment is about 75 pfennigs, and the sale price is DM1. We just can't afford the overheads we have at the moment. I'm not happy about it, but don't let's fool ourselves. We cannot expect private investors unless we are making money,' said Mr Colitti. Enichem is prepared to sell or put into joint ventures nearly all its businesses, including the polyethylene, polyurethane and polystyrene operations. The group is also looking for partners for its elastomers business. Enichem's fibres and detergents businesses are already quoted. Mr Colitti said Enichem would keep its core ethylene production. But the group was keen to reduce its stake in the downstream operations as far as it could, while still ensuring the subsidiaries would use Enichem's raw materials. 'Enichem will virtually be dissolved. It could become virtually a small holding company with a few petrochemicals activities,' said Mr Colitti. Some subsidiaries, such as detergents, were ready for disposal, while others like the elastomers required more cost-cutting. Many required more complex rationalisation and might require a joint-venture and capacity rationalisation. 'There's far too much petrochemicals capacity in Europe. There are simply too many plants. Consolidation is inevitable and unavoidable and, I believe, a welcome consequence of market globalisation,' said Mr Colitti.</p>

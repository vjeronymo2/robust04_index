			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Labour heads off challenge by SNP in Monklands The Labour party last night clung on to the Monklands East seat that had been held by the late John Smith, the party's former leader, narrowly defeating the Scottish Nationalist party in a parliamentary by-election. Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate, won the seat with a margin of only 1,640 votes over the SNP, well down from the majority of nearly 16,000 enjoyed by Mr Smith at the last election. Labour activists were relieved to have avoided a humiliating defeat in the constituency held by their respected former leader. However, their party's share of the vote fell by 11.5 percentage points after a bitterly fought campaign which centred on allegations of corruption by the Labour-run local council. The Conservative candidate came fourth behind the Scottish Liberal Democrats, losing her deposit. In her victory speech, Mrs Liddell claimed that the SNP had run a 'dirty campaign', which sought to exploit tensions and divisions in the local community. However, SNP activists were delighted to see their share of the vote increase by nearly 27 percentage points from the 1992 general election. Their performance follows a stunning European election result, in which the SNP won a record 32.6 per cent of the vote across Scotland. Throughout the campaign, the Scottish Nationalists have benefited from allegations that Labour-controlled Monklands district council has heavily favoured one section of its community in decisions on capital spending. Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors have alleged that a clique on the council - popularly dubbed 'the Monklands mafia' - has favoured the predominantly Roman Catholic area of Coatbridge over Protestant Airdrie. At the start of the campaign, Mrs Liddell, who is a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, tried to stay aloof from allegations about the council's activities. However, last week, she acknowledged recent spending figures had favoured Coatbridge. Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate, waged an aggressive nationalist campaign. She called for an independent SNP government, which would renationalise Scotland's gas and electricity industries among others.  ---------------------------------- Party                         Votes  ---------------------------------- Labour                       16,960 SNP                          15,320 Lib Dem                         878 Conservative                    799  ---------------------------------- Labour hold Majority:                     1,640  ---------------------------------- General election 1992 Labour majority:             15,712  ---------------------------------- Sectarianism sours contest, Page 9</p>

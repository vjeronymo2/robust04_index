			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 4 Apr (PL) -- Today, Joe Jacob, vice  president of Ireland's lower house, began the second day of his  visit in which he is expressing his solidarity with Cuba and  exploring the possibilities for broadening commercial and  cooperation links.    Cuban parliament sources told PRENSA LATINA that Jacob is  heading a delegation comprising five parliamentarians whose goal  is to encourage good relations between the two countries and to  continue broadening them.    The parliamentarians will meet with Jose Ramon Balaguer,  member of the Council of State of the Communist Party of Cuba;  Isabel Allende, vice minister of foreign relations; and Carlos  Salsamendi, president of the Chamber of Commerce.    Official sources noted that the visitors expressed their  desire to seek ways to strengthen relations between the  legislative bodies of the two nations.    During their stay, which will continue until 10 April, the  visitors are also interested in learning about the tobbaco  industry as they explore areas in which Ireland and Cuba might  broaden trade relations.    The Irish delegation will visit Pinar del Rio Province,  Cuba's westernmost province, as well as public health,  agricultural, and sports centers. Public health, agriculture,  and sports are areas in which they will study prospects for  broadening and diversifying cooperation.</p>

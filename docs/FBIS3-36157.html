			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Feb -- Anatoliy Chubays regards it as  unthinkable to freeze the prices of raw materials and energy  sources, since that would, in his view, lead to huge state  subsidies for the fuel and energy complex. Answering  journalists' questions during a news conference, the vice  premier declared that that proposal, which is contained in a  report drawn up by academicians Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay  Petrakov, and Stanislav Shatalin, was dictated by nothing more  than political expediency. "I don't think there is anything in  the document that merits serious government discussion," he  added.    Anatoliy Chubays also stated that economists (meaning the  leaders of the Russian Central Bank) who seriously propose that  a fixed exchange rate should be set for the ruble "are not  suitable for responsible work in the Russian leadership."    Speaking of the balance of forces within the reformed  Russian  government, Anatoliy Chubays described it as "very difficult."  But the positions of these forces, he continued, "are not set  for all time to come." "The very fact that Fedorov and Gaydar  have moved on has already brought about a situation in which the  arduous and thankless function that they performed will be taken  on by other members of the government. So I would not be in a  hurry to state that the reformers in the government have  suffered a complete reverse and that they have no resources  left," the vice premier stressed.    Anatoliy Chubays announced that he has no plans to leave the  present Russian government. "My plans are to do everything  possible to see that the government conducts the reform policy  for which I have worked within it for the past two years."    He also said that he has "good, working" relations with  Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets.  Anatoliy Chubays added that he can find a common position with  them, even though there are differences of approach.</p>

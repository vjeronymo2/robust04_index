			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY STUDENTS JOIN PARENTS TO PROTEST YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL  </P> <P> More than 1,200 students were kept out of school Wednesday, and several hundred  San Fernando Valley parents and their children carried picket signs and chanted  slogans in the largest demonstration so far by opponents of a proposal to  establish year-round schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> Demonstrators from at least half a dozen Valley schools walked four blocks  along Ventura Boulevard from the Sherman Oaks School to the office of state  Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles) in a noisy but orderly protest  against district proposals to relieve classroom overcrowding by operating  schools year-round.  </P> <P> The demonstrators want Friedman and other Los Angeles-area legislators to push  for increased district funding, which they say would head off the need for  year-round classes.  </P> <P> "We're keeping our children out of school today as a symbolic effort," said  Barry Pollack, a parent who helped organize the event. "One day of lost  education is better than many days of lost quality education if the children  are forced into year-round schools."  </P> <P> The school board on Monday is expected to decide on proposals calling for the  conversion of 109 elementary schools, including 45 in the Valley, to some type  of year-round schedule beginning this summer. School Supt. Leonard Britton is  recommending that the board require all schools in the district to convert to  year-round schedules by summer, 1991.  </P> <P> More than 100 of the district's 618 schools now operate on year-round  schedules.  </P> <P> District officials estimate that they will run out of seats in elementary  school classrooms by summer because of continuing enrollment growth unless more  room is made available through year-round scheduling, double sessions or  increases in classroom size.  </P> <P> Pollack, an emergency room physician who tried unsuccessfully to unseat East  Valley school board member Roberta Weintraub in elections last year, said he  called for parents opposed to the district proposals to keep their children  home Wednesday. About a third of the 300 or so protesters who marched were  school-age children.  </P> <P> Significant drops in student attendance, ranging from 18% to 72% of school  enrollment, were reported at six of the more than 120 elementary schools in the  Valley, district officials said. In all, an estimated 1,260 students more than  normal were reported absent from classes at Topeka Drive and Dearborn Street  School in Northridge, El Oro Way School in Granada Hills, Dixie Canyon Avenue  School in Sherman Oaks, Wilbur Avenue School in Tarzana and Encino School in  Encino. Attendance at schools outside the Valley appeared unaffected by the  protest.  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks Elementary Principal Grace Snipper said about 30 more children  than usual were marked absent at her school of 800 students. After the protest,  16 children came in late, she said.  </P> <P> At Dearborn Street Elementary School in Northridge, however, Principal Richard  Lioy said 430 of his 600 students, 72%, were absent Wednesday. Nearly 60% of  the students at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary were reported absent, and 56% of  the students at Topeka Drive Elementary stayed home Wednesday, school  principals said.  </P> <P> Parents at the demonstration -- many chanting "Save our schools, no year-round"  -- said they are opposed to the district proposal because it will require  children to attend classes during hot Valley summers in rooms without  air-conditioning, and it will create problems with child-care and family  vacations.  </P> <P> In the past month, millions of dollars in incentive funds for year-round  schools and millions more earmarked for air-conditioning year-round schools  have been diverted by the state, with the Los Angeles district likely to emerge  the biggest loser.  </P> <P> Friedman, who aides said was home sick, issued the parents a written statement  promising to "continue to fight for increased funding." He also asked parents  to support statewide bond measures to pay for new school construction money.  </P> <P> Dauna Packer, a Woodland Hills parent with two children in Los Angeles schools,  said she hopes to interest other parents in efforts by state Assemblywoman  Marian LaFollette (R-Northridge) to break up the Los Angeles district, the  nation's second largest.  </P> <P> LaFollette in the fall created a commission that conducted several sparsely  attended public hearings on the possible breakup of the district into eight or  more smaller districts. Earlier this month, she persuaded Gov. George  Deukmejian to set aside $250,000 for the state Board of Education to study the  matter.  </P> <P> After several unsuccessful attempts in past years to have the issue brought  before the Legislature, LaFollette has said she now hopes to put the question  to voters.  </P></p>

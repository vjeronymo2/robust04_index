			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMON COLUMN STRUCK A FAMILIAR NOTE  </P> <P> Roger Simon's Feb. 4 column ("Some Notes for Audiences on the Fine Art of  Criticizing Artists") embodied some unfortunately common feelings of nonartists  observing modern art -- a lack of confidence in knowing what one likes and a  lack of the vocabulary to share what one sees.  </P> <P> The tone of his article reinforced the inferior feelings that untrained  observers are conditioned to feel around art they don't immediately understand.  </P> <P> There is no faux pas in asking a painter, "Why is this part of your piece this  way?" just as in asking a writer, "What did you mean when you wrote . . . ?"  Art is open to countless interpretations by the viewers, and often the viewer  pleasantly surprises the artist in what he or she finds in the work.  </P> <P> ALICE BASINGER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Ottawa awaits Quebec reply on separatist issue CANADIAN politicians are nervously awaiting Quebec's response to a package of far-reaching constitutional proposals designed to prevent the francophone province breaking away from the federation. The proposals were hammered out late on Tuesday by the leaders of the nine English-speaking provinces after almost two years of negotiation and public consultation. The federal government had threatened to force its own package through parliament in time for the national unity referendum which Quebec is due to hold by the end of October. Quebec's attitude is unclear because its premier, Mr Robert Bourassa, has boycotted the talks in protest against the collapse in June 1990 of the Meech Lake constitutional accord. He and his cabinet met yesterday to consider their response. They may not wholeheartedly endorse the latest proposals but are unlikely to reject them outright. Mr Bourassa has said that his preference is to stay in Canada. Also, separatist fervour in Quebec has abated since it was fuelled by the failure of Meech Lake. There remains a risk that the latest agreement could unravel. A final text has yet to be made available for public scrutiny, and the package requires formal ratification by provincial legislatures. Mr Joe Clark, constitutional affairs minister, said that some parts 'are going to be improved' in the weeks ahead. The new package contains many of the provisions of the Meech Lake deal, such as a veto for Quebec over key changes to the constitution and a number of guaranteed seats for the francophone province on the Supreme Court. But it also addresses the concerns of other provinces, aboriginal peoples and various interest groups. A key provision sought by the western and Atlantic provinces is the replacement of the appointed Senate, the upper house of parliament, by an elected body in which all 10 provinces will have equal representation. The Senate would have a limited veto over bills passed by the House of Commons.</p>

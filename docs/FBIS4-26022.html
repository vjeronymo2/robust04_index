			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by staff reporters Xu Shiquan (6079 0013 6898) </F> and He Hongze (0149 3163 3419): "Dialogue Is Better Than  Confrontation"]    [Text] United Nations, 13 Jun (RENMIN RIBAO) -- Recently,  Korea's nuclear issue once again has become a topic of concern  and discussion at the UN Headquarters building.    Owing to the differences between the IAEA and Korea over the  replacing of nuclear fuel rods since March this year, the  situation concerning Korea's nuclear issue, which had been  developing in a positive direction, unexpectedly took a sudden  turn. While the IAEA decided on 10 June to suspend enforcement  of the technological cooperation plan with Korea on uranium  exploration and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Korea  declared that it would withdraw from the agency immediately. On  the other hand, the United States carried out frequent  activities within and without the United Nations, expecting the  Security Council to impose sanctions against Korea.    It remains fresh in our minds that the United States has  lobbied for this on more than one occasions, but its proposal  was not well received by the international community. There was  even objection to the proposal from U.S. political circles and  the media. The Chinese delegation has always been against the  Security Council's involvement in the Korean nuclear issue and a  resolution on this adopted by the Security Council which  includes sanctions. The Chinese representative has pointed out  on numerous occasions that the four parties of the United  States, the IAEA, Korea, and the ROK should iron out their  differences and resolve the problem through dialogue and talks  within the tripartite framework. Neither threats nor pressure  will work; they will only intensify the contradictions and play  a destructive role. Based on this principle, the Chinese  delegation, in light of the given circumstances at that time,  adopted a constructive attitude and comprehensively expounded  the position of the Chinese Government on the question following  the statement issued by the Security Council chairman on the  Korean nuclear crisis in hopes that efforts would be made by the  parties concerned to continue the talks and seek an appropriate  solution.    Facts have proved that with the concerted efforts made by  the  parties concerned, the talks on the Korean nuclear issue at the  previous stage developed in a positive direction despite the  difficulties encountered. The United States reached a  principled agreement with Korea last June, Korea announced a  unilateral decision on suspending its withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], and Korea reached new  agreements with IAEA and the United States, respectively, on 15  and 25 February this year, followed by the IAEA's inspection of  Korea's relevant nuclear facilities and completion of most of  its mission. At present, differences and difficulties have  cropped up concerning Korea's nuclear fuel rods. It should be  noted that these differences and difficulties are temporary, as  they have cropped up in the course of efforts made to resolve  the problem. Meanwhile, there is still room for maneuver and a  possibility of reaching a solution.    On the Korean nuclear issue, China has always regarded the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, as well as peace and  stability on the peninsula, as the two major targets. This  position has become the common understanding of the members of  the Security Council, and has won widespread support from the  international community. As long as the parties concerned have  such sincerity and make unswerving efforts toward this dual  objective, it is possible gradually to iron out the differences  and reach an understanding.    The most important thing at present is that the parties  concerned should keep calm and exercise restraint. There is an  ancient Chinese saying: "Think of reason when you are enraged  and never forget principles at the critical moment." In the  face of the temporary disputes, if one side insists on imposing  sanctions and exerting pressure, and even hastily threaten to  use force, the positive achievements attained at the previous  stage between the four parties and three sides will come to  nothing. Moreover, the contradictions will be intensified  again. The international community will not want to see or  accept the consequences arising from shutting the door to  negotiations. The deterioration and turbulence of the situation  on the Korean peninsula not only will cause devastating damage  to northeast Asia, but also will affect world peace and  stability. As the matter is serious, the parties concerned  should think thrice before taking action, and should define the  reason and principles clearly. Sanctions and threats will be of  no avail. The best option is to calmly and patiently hold  talks. After all, dialogue is better than confrontation.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEER BAN AT COLISEUM  </P> <P> Regarding the article on the one-time beer ban at a Raiders game (Part B,Oct.  12):  </P> <P> I found it interesting that officials at the Coliseum said they were not  engaging the issue of alcoholism, but the fan violence.  </P> <P> Do these people think that fan violence would be at this dangerous level if  there was no alcohol being sold? This is mass and classical denial of alcohol  abuse. Alcohol is a drug that changes your behavior and not for the better.  </P> <P> Let's quit denying what the reality is and face this problem regardless of how  much money is involved.  </P> <P> LORRAINE MAZZA  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

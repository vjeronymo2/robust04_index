			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: South African company removes its veil - Mobil divestment Engen is planning its brave new future Appeals for foreign investment have replaced demands for divestment in the lexicon of most black politicians in South Africa. But some strategic sectors of the South African economy, such as its sprawling defence industry and oil companies, have stayed shrouded in secrecy even as the political process opened up. That veil is now lifting, with international investors being able to assess the long-term viability of some of South Africa's largest companies. Politics, however, still exert a strong influence over the future strategy of many such companies, including Engen, the country's biggest oil company, which was created by the divestment in 1989 of Mobil Oil's South African subsidiary. Unlike other divestments, in which the foreign parent company retained the right to re-acquire its South African assets, the break with Mobil was a 'clean one', according to Mr Rob Angel, chief executive. That, combined with Engen's unbundling last month from Gencor, the industrial and mining group that bought Mobil's assets, has given Mr Angel a free hand. But the absence of international support means the company is subject to domestic constraints, such as a foreign currency shortage, which act as a brake on its ambitions. Engen, which will get the bulk of its Dollars 2.4bn estimated turnover this year from oil refining and marketing in South Africa and neighbouring countries, is keen to use its new-found freedom to add international upstream production to its domestic downstream business. It is also keen to secure a London listing, although such a move will have wait until after next April's election. Greater access to foreign exchange is crucial if Engen is to realise its goal to source 50 per cent of its crude oil needs from its own reserves within 10 years. Mr Chris Sloan, an analyst at Johannesburg stockbrokers Ferguson Brothers, says the lack of foreign exchange is one reason why Engen has 'not been very successful' in its early exploration efforts. 'It means they can't go for the highest quality exploration opportunities.' Mr Angel concedes that Engen has had to pass up acquisition opportunities because of currency restrictions. Its exploration activities are focused on west Africa, where it shares licences with big multi-national oil companies in Angola, Gabon and Namibia. It has a 2.2 per cent share of the Alba field in the North Sea, as well as a small holding in the Britannia gas field and a 10 per cent share in the Bukha gas condensate development off Oman. The company is looking to buy, although it is likely to remain on a small scale until it has greater access to hard currency. Acquisitions are also likely in the downstream side of the business in Africa, says Mr Angel, who wants Engen to have a 'leadership role' in exporting and distributing refined products to the sub-Saharan market. That goal is probably attainable, according to Mr Sloan, who says one legacy of sanctions is the highly efficient refineries which the government encouraged oil companies to build. Engen's main Durban refinery has been subject to a number of upgrades which will boost its capacity to 105,000 barrels a day. That will allow it to capitalise on growing demand in Africa north of the Limpopo river, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, and to which the company's exports have risen from 1.9m barrels in 1991 to 5.7m barrels this year. Deregulation in South Africa's refining and retail market is likely to pose the biggest challenge to Engen's fortunes. 'There is an increasingly public and political debate over the oil industry,' says one Cape Town-based industry analyst, who believes the issue is likely to be left for a new government. Full deregulation of the market is unlikely, but the formula used by the government to set wholesale and retail prices will probably be replaced by a mechanism 'which more accurately reflects world prices', says Mr Sloan. Mr Angel believes deregulation will allow Engen to close some of the low volume units among its 1,500 petrol stations without undermining its 26 per cent market share. But deregulation is also likely to create a new retail competitor. Sasol, the synthetic oil from coal company that provides 45 per cent of the country's petrol, is keen to enter the retail market with its own service stations. At present Sasol is limited to a single pump at the stations of other companies. The government-set floor price for Sasol is Dollars 23 a barrel, compared with current world oil prices of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. A new government will be under financial pressures to reduce the protection that Sasol receives, but it will probably hesitate to remove it altogether because of the drastic effect such a step would have on employment at the vast Sasol plants and the coal mines which supply them. The prospect of much fiercer domestic competition and Engen's heavy exposure to refining and marketing lies behind the drive to secure its own sources of crude oil, according to analysts, as a strong production base would allow it to benefit from any increase in crude oil prices. But Mr Angel concedes that only a return to economic growth in South Africa can underpin the company's longer-term performance.</p>

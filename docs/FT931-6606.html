			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / China boosts trade drive in S Africa CHINA will extend its trade drive to South Africa next month when it opens its first trade fair there, a move that suggests that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Pretoria may not be far off. About 80 Chinese companies will participate in the Trade Expo organised by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and to be held in Johannesburg from April 19 to 25. The CCPIT-organised fair in South Africa is one of 22 planned internationally and coincides with a rapid increase in China's exports, expected to reach Dollars 100bn (Pounds 70.4bn) this year. China's efforts further to accelerate its trade growth - it is expected to leap into the top 10 of the world's trading nations this year - comes as Beijing intensifies its attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China and the US formally resume Gatt talks in Beijing this week after a three-year break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. China and South Africa last year established visa-issuing representative offices known as 'research centres' in each other's capitals as preparation for full normalisation. China, which has been discreetly trading with South Africa for many years, has said that formal relations would follow further constitutional reforms, including agreement on a national unity government pending elections. The foreign ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. South Africa's Mr Pik Botha visited Beijing in 1991 and China's Mr Qian Qichen went to Pretoria last year. Gold-hungry Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of Dollars 4.3bn on gold jewellery last year, according to China's official Business Weekly. Quoting a report of the Geneva-based World Gold Council, the newspaper said that, based on 'conservative estimates', jewellery sales in China exceeded 250 tons. This was equivalent to one quarter of all the gold sales in Asia - a region that is traditionally a big gold consumer. Taiwanese buy about 10 grams of gold on average a year, Hong Kong residents 6 grams and China 1.8 grams. The huge Chinese demand for gold jewellery has been partly spurred by concerns about the depreciating value of the local currency - the renminbi - and also by growing affluence in a country where economic growth last year topped 12 per cent. The World Gold Council, an association of producers, said that it would devote more resources to developing the gold market in China. It planned to target women consumers. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has purchased large quantities of gold in the past year, but the Chinese have not disclosed details. China has not divulged the extent of its gold reserves for more than 10 years.</p>

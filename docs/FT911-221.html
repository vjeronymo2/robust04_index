			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Bank of Japan urges review on foreign workers THE Bank of Japan has called for an immediate review of Japan's virtual ban on the employment of foreign workers, in a rare public comment on a highly-sensitive political problem. In a report on the country's labour shortage published this month, the central bank says that 'the employment of foreign workers is an urgent issue which requires examination from every angle'. The fear that labour shortages increase the risk of inflation has played a central part in the bank's decision to push up interest rates over the past two years. It will remain a key factor in future management of the economy, says the report. 'It is a grave concern that a growing scarcity in labour supply, particularly in the younger age brackets, might cause serious labour shortages in future.' The recent shortages have been caused not only by a cyclical surge in economic growth but also by long-term changes in the economy, including a shift to greater demand for labour-intensive services. At the same time, with the ageing of society, the growth of the workforce has slowed, says the report. The central bank says that in 1996 the working population will start to decline. The decline is being alleviated by increases in the employment of women, investment in labour-saving equipment, growth in the import of labour-intensive manufactured goods and the transfer of factories overseas. 'In order to achieve non-inflationary economic growth under limited supply of labour, these changes in the economy must continue steadily.' Japan also has to carry out measures which will allow for the employment of more women and more older people, says the central bank. It also has to press on with deregulation and rationalisation in the distribution system to release more labour. Companies need to adjust management plans. Meanwhile, as for macro-economic policy, priorities should be 'maintaining price stability and avoiding a vicious spiral of wages and price increases'.</p>

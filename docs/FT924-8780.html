			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Call to double share sales duty THE government's pledge to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares should be postponed and the rate of duty should be doubled from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday . 'Share ownership is a luxury, not a necessity,' the association said. It added that the measure would bring in around Pounds 2bn which could be used to offset a package of measures to stimulate the housing market. It called on Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, in his Autumn Statement on Thursday to reduce interest rates, double mortgage tax relief for first-time buyers and abolish stamp duty on house sales. The association also called for local authorities to be allowed to invest a larger proportion of money from sales of homes in housebuilding, and for housing associations to be given funds to buy repossessed homes.</p>

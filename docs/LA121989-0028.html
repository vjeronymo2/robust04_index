			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WHOLE COMMUNITY FACES A LIFE SENTENCE OF NEGLECT;  </P> <P> WAR ON DRUGS: DRACONIAN PUNISHMENT ONLY INCREASES THE SUFFERING OF AFRICAN  AMERICANS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE CAUSES.  </P> <P> A 22-year-old African American man was sentenced early this month in Los  Angeles to life in prison without the possibility of parole for distributing  crack cocaine. It was California's first implementation of President Bush's  war-on-drugs policy.  </P> <P> The sentencing illustrates misguided policy and, in fact, contributes to the  ravaging of the African American community and our society through poverty,  drugs, crime and a host of related maladies.  </P> <P> Incarcerating drug dealers distracts us from the true causes of drug abuse and  crime. To the extent that we are so distracted, the underlying causes of these  problems remain untreated, and we can expect the continued proliferation of  drugs and related crime.  </P> <P> More important, the war-on-drugs mentality is a metaphor for our approach to  social problems in general: Those who display pathological symptoms are treated  as the cause of those symptoms and then prescribed "appropriate" treatment. We  therefore ignore the socioeconomic realities that produce these pathologies.  </P> <P> Crack cocaine and other drugs of devastation are equal-opportunity toxins: They  permeate every ethnic group and socioeconomic stratum. But drug abuse and other  social poisons hit hardest at the more vulnerable segments of our society: the  racially isolated, unemployed, chronically impoverished and socially  disfranchised.  </P> <P> It is no surprise, then, that drug abuse and related criminal activity are  problems on a larger scale in the poor, ethnic- minority inner cities. This  fact provides a clue to the causes of these problems.  </P> <P> If we can understand the cause of social isolation, of chronic and  intergenerational poverty and of anomie and despair, then we can understand the  causes of drug abuse and related crime. And if this is true, then one thing is  clear: That 22-year-old African American man facing a lifetime in prison is not  the cause of segregation, poverty or social distance. His incarceration is not  the cure.  </P> <P> The causes of poverty include unemployment and underemployment. The causes of  unemployment are tied to the training of the work force and the availability of  jobs. Inner-city schools are marked by overcrowding, underfunding,  less-experienced teachers and academic failure. In some areas, the drop-out  rate for junior high school is nearly 25%. In many areas, the drop-out rate for  high school exceeds 50%. Without the necessary academic skills of reading,  writing and computation, the people living in inner cities are  disproportionately ill-equipped to compete in a highly technological workplace.  Moreover, the presumption of incompetence results in continuing racial  discrimination in employment.  </P> <P> Capital-intensive fiscal priorities, particularly within the military arena,  serve to eliminate jobs in favor of hardware for death and destruction. We  marvel at the technological sophistication of the B-2 Stealth bomber, but how  many jobs can such a weapon produce relative to more humane endeavors? How many  of these jobs can serve the employment needs of African American men?  </P> <P> The welfare system ensures that millions of Americans live in unremitting  poverty. This economic parachute opens only for the desperately poor, and  scarcely softens the fall from catastrophe to subsistance.  </P> <P> Drugs are the narcotic that eases the pain from this hardship. Funding drug  addiction requires illicit activity that preys on other residents of the  already economically impoverished community.  </P> <P> To end the cycle of drug addiction and related crime -- and the victimization  of people in our inner cities -- requires ending the underlying causes. We must  focus on improving access to quality education in the inner cities. We must  guarantee equal attainment of basic academic skills. We must increase access to  jobs and careers. We must eliminate employment discrimination. We must move  beyond mere equal opportunity to equal achievement in health, education and  general well-being. We must eliminate the motive for narcotics.  </P> <P> Instead, current government emphasis is on building jails and prisons; the  current construction program is the biggest in our history. And with a prison  population that is nearly 50% African American, the new cells promise the  continued removal of these men from the community and from positive economic  contributions to their families.  </P> <P> Misguided policy interventions, such as incarceration for life, actually  contribute to the perpetuation of the very problems they seek to ameliorate. A  22-year-old spending life in prison will have little chance to be a productive  member of his family, and no chance at all to be productive in his community.  Both will go on, vulnerable to the unrelenting devastation of drugs and crime,  while society at-large assumes the burden of housing him for the next 50 years  or so.  </P></p>

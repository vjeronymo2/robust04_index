			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Shipbuilder to shed 510 jobs YARROW Shipbuilders, GEC's naval shipyard in Glasgow, is to shed 510 jobs because of a gap in its order book. The jobs are in ship outfitting, one of the final stages in shipbuilding. Yarrow is finishing two ships now and has orders for a further five frigates, and outfitters for these ships will not be needed for 12 to 18 months. The company said yesterday that it will then employ the number of staff losing jobs now. Yarrow, which employs 2,750 people, cut 645 jobs last December, mainly in fabrication, as it finished work on the Type 23 frigates Iron Duke and Monmouth. The fresh wave of redundancies comes in spite of orders for five frigates earlier this year. In January the shipyard won a Pounds 400m order for three more Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy. Yarrow had hoped for earlier orders, but the government procurement process was slowed by the Options For Change defence spending document. Yarrow was also awarded a Pounds 322m contract in January for two frigates for the Malaysian government. That was the first overseas warship order for Yarrow since it was sold by the government in 1985. Work has started on the three Navy frigates and design work is under way on the Malaysian order. Both contracts will maintain work at the yard until 1997. Yarrow said they 'were too late to maintain continuity of employment'. Volunteers will be sought, but there are likely to be compulsorily redundancies. The jobs will be cut by the end of the year. Mr John Carty, Clyde district secretary of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union, said he was 'extremely disappointed'. He would meet management next week to look for ways to cushion the blow. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said the announcement was another nail in Britain's industrial coffin. 'If we throw people in manufacturing jobs out of work we will only end up importing what they used to make, which is a disaster for everyone,' he said. The UK's biggest offshore module yard yesterday warned that it may have to shed 1,500 jobs next spring unless it wins orders it is pursuing against intense competition, Chris Tighe writes. The warning from AMEC Offshore, which operates extensive facilities on the Tyne and employs 3,500 people, underlines the serious job-loss implications of the downturn in the offshore industry. In the past 10 days nearly 400 jobs have been lost in north-east England's offshore sector. Redpath Offshore on Teesside, part of the Trafalgar House group cut 200 jobs while 196 went at AMEC Offshore, including the loss of 76 which will take effect today. AMEC Offshore completed two large contracts this summer and work on the current order book will end next spring. Yesterday the company said the 1,500 job losses would affect both direct employees and subcontractors taken on in the past year. It added that the figure was a 'worst-case scenario' - it hopes its tenders for projects in Norway and the UK sectors of the North Sea will win more orders. ELECTRICIANS employed by Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, yesterday staged a 24-hour unofficial strike to protest at the provision of training in electrical work for boilermakers on the company's payroll, Chris Tighe writes. The action by 550 electricians was condemned by senior union officials. It highlights the problems faced by UK shipyards in maintaining a balanced range of workforce skills while fighting to replenish dwindling order books. Swan Hunter has some orders up to the end of 1994, but its workload now consists almost entirely of outfitting. It needs to retain men in the front-end steel trades in order to bid successfully for new orders. The company, which last Friday announced 1,425 job losses among employees and contract workers, reducing its workforce to 2,200, has identified 100 boilermakers whom it plans to train to work in other trade areas. The first batch of 11 are due to start on-the-job electrical training today. The electricians held a meeting yesterday morning and failed to return to work. The company said yesterday that training for multi-skilled working was within the provisions of its versatility agreement. Mr John Cunningham, chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at Swans, said the action by the electricians had breached that agreement. 'We have agreements with the company; some people have misunderstood them,' he said. Mr Cunningham said a meeting between union leaders and management yesterday afternoon had produced a solution to be put to shop stewards today. The versatility agreement would be honoured and work would continue normally, he pledged.</p>

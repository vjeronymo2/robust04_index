			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unnamed special correspondents] </F>   [Text] Cartagena -- President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated on  13 June that Paraguay would condition Chile's admission to  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The president made this  remark after studying the letter that the Chilean Foreign  Ministry sent to Mercosur's Pro-Tempore Secretariat, in which it  officially requests admission to the group consisting of the  four River Plate nations.    The Paraguayan position is that Chile must adapt itself to  the demands that will arise when it becomes a full-fledged  member of Mercosur. The Chilean document requests an outline of  the obligations it will have to comply with, but also gives to  understand that it is not willing to comply with them.    The document, which is signed by the Chilean foreign  minister, indicates that its admission will be accomplished  through bilateral tariff protocols to be signed with each  Mercosur member. These protocols presumably contain  implementation regulations responding to the conditions and  intents specified in bilateral relations, to be accomplished  within a certain period of time.    It is precisely Chile, though, that will be setting this  period of time, as well as the number of years that cannot be  exceeded.    All of these demands are practically unacceptable to  Paraguay, and therefore, according to official sources, Chile's  possible admission to Mercosur must be very carefully studied.    On 13 June Wasmosy also confirmed that Paraguay will abstain  from voting in the hypothetical case that the economic embargo  against Cuba comes up for discussion.    The president announced this position, but did not explain  why. Wasmosy also indicated that he does not agree with the  military intervention in Haiti being considered by the United  States, indicating that this would be his government's position  if a decision has to be taken on the subject.</p>

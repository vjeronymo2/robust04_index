			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Newarthill Newarthill, the holding company for Sir Robert McAlpine, the civil engineer, reported losses increased from Pounds 3.57m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 4.19m pre-tax for the six months to April 30. However, the outcome masked a marked improvement at the operating level, with losses reduced to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 4.84m) reflecting reduced overheads. Although the group's markets remain difficult and there was 'little real upturn' in the construction sector, the second half was expected to show a return to profit. Losses per share worked through at 33.7p (26.8p).</p>

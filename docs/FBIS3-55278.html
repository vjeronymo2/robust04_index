But What of the New Russian  Parliament?"]    [Text] Four days remain until the Russian Federation  Federal Assembly starts its work. It seems that this uncommon  event in the country's life will be marked by the last-minute  rush which is traditional for projects due for completion. In  the new parliament's press center we were told that the venue  for the first session is still unclear: either the Kremlin or  the building which until the well-known events belonged to  mayor's office. There is also total obscurity in respect of the  standing orders. There is no question of agreed candidacies for  the speaker and his deputies -- which, however, is not a drama  in itself. We have been told by the Central Electoral  Commission that four days before the State Duma begins its work  the lists of deputies from parties and associations are still  being sorted out.    Objectively speaking, the procedure for finishing such an  important "project due for completion" has been messed up by the  holidays, and there is also the effect of the "unraveling  government" -- part of it has gone to apartments at the White  House, and part has resigned in connection with the reform of  government structures. The telephones -- not to mention  continuity -- have been cut off.</p>

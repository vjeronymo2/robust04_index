			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Nato jets authorised to down intruders THE UN Security Council last night gave the go-ahead for Nato warplanes to patrol Bosnian air space and shoot down any military aircraft violating the 'no-fly' ban. A resolution, delayed by Russian doubts, authorised enforcement of the no-fly zone by 14-0, with China abstaining. The vote came as pressure mounted on the Bosnian Serbs to join the Moslems and Croatians in signing the peace settlement drawn up by the international mediators, Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Russia has been concerned to limit the way the no-fly zone is enforced. It is prepared to sanction shooting down any Serb aircraft violating Bosnian air space but not attacks on aircraft on the ground. Mr Yuli Vorontsov, Russia's Security Council representative, stressed the need to co-ordinate combat operations with the UN in New York. He reminded Bosnian Serbs if they accepted the Vance-Owen plan the UN resolution would not have to be implemented. In any event, it will not go into effect for 14 days. China's delegate objected to invoking mandatory enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and also cited reservations voiced by the UN field commander. The Security Council is expected to vote later this week to endorse the Vance-Owen plan and tighten economic sanctions against Serbia. The US and EC appeared to have resolved differences over endorsement of the plan, about which the Clinton administration has had reservations. Earlier, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in a letter 'we are now two-thirds of the way to peace'. He urged Mr Major to support changes in the map of the proposed provinces.</p>

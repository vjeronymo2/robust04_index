			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Convertible bonds Three convertible bond issues in four months hardly constitute a flood, but after a couple of barren years, City advisers might be forgiven for licking their lips. Yesterdays Pounds 91m issue is cheap funding for Northern Foods. A straight bond issue would cost the company more in interest payments, yet on even modest assumptions of dividend growth, equity investors would do better buying the shares. The success of the issue - the 3 per cent fall in the share price yesterday is par for the course - underlines that the market is willing to pay a premium for a secure yield. The dwindling return from cash has squeezed investors looking for income. Recession has made high yield in equities synonymous with corporate distress. Income fund managers could hardly justify holding Northern Foods' shares on a yield less than the market average. The convertible offers a way in. But convertibles are condemned to a limited role in corporate fund-raising. To protect pre-emption rights, UK institutions effectively limit convertible issues to 5 per cent of share capital. Northern Foods has refinanced a handy slice of bank debt - and strengthened its hand in negotiations over the rest. Plenty of companies want to reduce short term debt, but, if big money is needed, it will still have to come from rights issues.</p>

Hasan Wirayuda, the ministry's director of International  Organization Affairs, told a press conference here Wednesday:  "The House of Representatives will have to discuss this matter  before okaying the plan and hopefully the discussion can be  completed by the end of this year."    Wirayuda said that Indonesia had taken part in tough  international negotiations on the phasing out of chemical  weapons since they began in 1980 up to their conclusion in 1992  although Indonesia did not possess chemical weapons.    He added that Indonesia's participation, which manifested  the  country's concern for national and regional security, was  significant because it was the largest country in Southeast Asia  and now chairing the Non-aligned Movement.    Vested with such national, regional, and global  responsibilities Indonesia had no option but become a party to  the convention, a position enabling it along with the  international community to strive after the abolition of  chemical weapons, and supervise the ban on their proliferation  through the convention's system of verification, he said.    He added that Indonesia had formed an inter-departmental  committee assigned to prepare for the ratification. The  committee was made up of representatives of the Ministries of  Industry, Defence and Security, Trade, and Health, the Armed  Forces Headquarters, the Agency for the Assessment and  Application of Technology (BPPT) and the surveyor company  Surveyor Indonesia Co. Ltd.    The visiting executive secretary of the Provisional  Technical  Secretariat, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical  Weapons (PTS-OPCW), Ian Kenyon, meanwhile has welcomed  Indonesia's plan to ratify the convention. At present, only four  of its 154 signatory countries had ratified it.    Signatories to the convention to date were the United  States,  Russia, all Western European countries, all former socialist  counrties in Eastern Europe, and a number of Latin American and  Asian countries, Wirayuda said.</p>

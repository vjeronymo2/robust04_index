			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: US official seeks to reassure companies over dumping rules US companies were assured yesterday that measures negotiated in the Uruguay Round global trade accord are adequate to deal with dumping. Mr Jeffrey Garten, US Commerce Department undersecretary, said yesterday that the multilateral dispute settlement system would uphold 'well founded' US dumping decisions, while ensuring protection for US exporters from unfair dumping regimes abroad. The support of companies is vital if the Uruguay Round pact is to win approval in Congress, so Mr Garten, whose responsibilities encompass both the promotion of US exports abroad and the administration of US anti-dumping trade laws at home, sought to reassure them that he is 'an ardent supporter of vigorous enforcement' of the US anti-dumping regime. In a speech to the US Chamber of Commerce, he said the Clinton administration supported 'the reasonable concerns of our exporters' about the growing number of foreign dumping regimes. These would be disciplined under the new World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'We are drafting implementing language in such a way as to guarantee that our laws are consistent with the letter and spirit of the Gatt Uruguay Round agreement,' he said. 'We will be reviewing other countries' laws for consistency with the agreement.' Controversy has surrounded the US dumping regime as large exporters find themselves increasingly under siege from 'copycat' anti-dumping laws abroad. At the same time, many US companies see the regime as the last defence against cheap imports. There is pressure for more protective language in the Uruguay Round implementing legislation, which must be approved by Congress. The Labour/Industry Coalition for Trade (LICIT) claimed last month in a report that while Gatt panels reviewing national anti-dumping laws 'are instructed to defer to reasonable findings of fact and law of national bodies, it is unclear that there is any way to ensure that they will'. The report said the US failed to achieve a key objective in the Round: strengthening international rules relating to anti-dumping. 'In many cases, dumping margins can be expected to decline under the new rules. However, the anti-dumping laws will remain usable by US industries - provided the implementing legislation strengthens US law to the extent permitted under the new agreement.'</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLOBAL WARMING STORM LINK PROBED;  </P> <P> PREDICTED RISE IN OCEAN TEMPERATURES MAY INCREASE WINDS  </P> <P> Hurricane Hugo is a harbinger of the type of high-intensity storms that can be  expected more often in the future due to the greenhouse effect and the  resulting global warming, researchers said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Warming ocean and air temperatures will feed extra energy into the hurricanes,  increasing their wind speeds by 20% to 25% and their maximum intensity by as  much as 60%, according to computer models.  </P> <P> "We can say with some confidence that the frequency of Category 4 and Category  5 hurricanes (the most severe) will increase, but we can't say by how much,"  said meteorologist Richard Anthes, head of the university consortium that  operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gilbert Sets Record  </P> <P> In fact, the most intense hurricane ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean,  Hurricane Gilbert with wind speeds of more than 200 m.p.h., occurred last  September. But neither Gilbert nor Hugo can be definitely linked to global  warming, researchers noted. "It's impossible to link one event to climatic  change," Anthes said.  </P> <P> Researchers are generally cautious in their predictions about the effects of  global warming.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to take something as complex as a hurricane and attribute  changes to a single cause like warmer temperatures, simply because the  atmosphere is such a complex mixture and there are so many physical processes  going on," said Ohio State University atmospheric scientist Jay Hobgood, one of  the researchers whose models are the basis for projections of hurricane  strengths.  </P> <P> "There's an awful lot of uncertainty and an awful lot that is not understood,"  added meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  another modeler. "But if ocean temperature goes up, the intensity of extreme  hurricanes will go up."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seat-of-the-Pants Feeling'  </P> <P> And, said meteorologist Rainer Bleck of the University of Miami, there is a  growing consensus among researchers that this is what will happen. But "that  conclusion is not based on scientific results yet," he added. "It is more of a  seat-of-the-pants feeling."  </P> <P> The link to global warming occurs because heat is the engine that drives  hurricanes. Strong sunlight heats both air and water near the Equator, causing  a greater evaporation of moisture from the ocean. The warm, moist air expands  and rises, creating a ring of low pressure and storms around the Equator known  as the Intertropical Convergence Zone.  </P> <P> As the moist air rises, it cools, causing its moisture to condense into clouds.  But that condensation releases a tremendous amount of heat stored in the  gaseous water, accelerating the heating and rising of the air.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starts With 'Kicker'  </P> <P> Although scientists do not yet know under precisely what conditions hurricanes  form, this condensation and heat release is the "kicker" that starts vast  amounts of air climbing upward, drawing in ever-larger quantities of moist air  from the ocean surface, Bleck said.  </P> <P> Eventually, the Earth's rotation causes the fast-moving air masses to spin in a  counterclockwise motion in the Northern Hemisphere or clockwise in the  Southern.  </P> <P> Hurricanes typically take five to six days to form, eventually spreading over  an area of thousands of square miles and developing wind speeds that range from  75 m.p.h. (the official minimum for a hurricane) to more than 200 m.p.h. The  storms continue as long as they can draw warm moist air from the ocean.  Hurricanes peter out when they pass over cold water or land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gases Trap Heat  </P> <P> Climatologists predict that global warming -- caused by the accumulation of  carbon dioxide and certain other gases in the atmosphere, which trap the  Earth's heat like the panes of a greenhouse -- will cause both ocean and air  temperatures to increase, perhaps eventually by as much as 10 degrees  Fahrenheit.  </P> <P> A warmer ocean causes more water to evaporate, and warmer air can hold more  water vapor. Both factors would increase the strength of hurricanes.  </P> <P> "That's what you see in reality," Hobgood said. "If you have warmer air, warmer  water, you do get a more intense storm."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Need More Research'  </P> <P> The problem, he added, is that warming will not occur to the same extent  everywhere, and other conditions caused by global warming, such as stronger  winds at high altitudes, might mitigate some of the effects of heating. "We  need to do a lot more research," he said.  </P> <P> The researchers did have one piece of good news. Hurricane Hugo will probably  sap the strength of tropical depression Iris, which is following close behind  it. It will probably also push Iris northward into the Atlantic, keeping it  from striking the United States or islands in the Caribbean.  </P></p>

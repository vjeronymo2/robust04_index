			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: London A quiet week for economic statistics, combined with today's August bank holiday, may allow gilts to hang on to their recent gains. Gilt prices held up last week, in spite of the rather disappointing price information in the Confederation of British Industry's August monthly trends survey, published on Friday. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the spread between 10-year gilts and German bunds has narrowed to less than 150 basis points, compared with 180 points a few weeks ago. This week, the gilt market's only statistical point of interest is likely to be Wednesday's purchasing managers' index, where the prices component will be closely studied. Recent purchasing managers' numbers have shown sharp growth in price pressures, and the prices index reached a record high in July. Towards the end of the week, the focus is likely to shift towards the next monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, on September 7. Speculation will inevitably centre on whether the two will agree to an early base rate rise. However, in the wake of the recent retail price numbers, most analysts feel an interest rate increase will not occur until November.</p>

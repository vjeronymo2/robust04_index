			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / People: Grosso leaves Cookson Roberto Grosso is stepping down as an executive director of Cookson Group, the specialist industrial materials group, and chief executive of the ceramics division. Cookson said in a statement that Grosso 'has decided to leave the group in order to pursue other interests', and will do so after the annual meeting next month. Last month Cookson and Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, announced that they were planning to link some of their ceramic interests in a joint venture to be known as Cookson Matthey Ceramics. Cookson's ceramic supplies and minerals division, part of its ceramics operations, will be folded into the joint venture. Meanwhile, Stephen Howard, currently chief executive in charge of Cookson's group corporate development and chief executive of the engineered products division, will also become president and chief executive of Cookson's Brussels-based Vesuvius advanced refactories group. Gian-Carlo Cozzani, currently vice president of marketing and sales at Vesuvius, will become Vesuvius' chief operating officer.</p>

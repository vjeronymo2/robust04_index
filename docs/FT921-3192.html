			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Gold producer slides 64% BENGUET Corporation, the Philippines' largest gold producer, has reported consolidated net profits for 1991 of 91.1m pesos (Dollars 3.7m), a decline of 64 per cent from the previous year's 251.7m pesos, writes Jose Galang in Manila. However, Mr Dennis Belmonte, president, said non-recurring gains from the sale of real property provided the bulk of 1991 profits. Operating revenues declined by 8.5 per cent to 3.65bn pesos, owing to lower production volumes and metal prices on the world markets. The 1991 performance followed a 26.5 per cent drop in net profits in 1990. Production of gold declined 21.5 per cent to 107,265 oz, while that of copper fell 14 per cent to 31.17m lbs.</p>

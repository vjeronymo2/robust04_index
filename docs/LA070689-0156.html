			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSSCOPE;  </P> <P> MARY LETOURNEAU, COVINA HIGH SOFTBALL PITCHER, HAILED AS 3-A PLAYER OF YEAR  </P> <P> Pitcher Mary Letourneau, who led Covina High to its first CIF Southern Section  girls softball title in June, has been named 3-A Division Player of the Year by  the Southern Section Softball Advisory Committee.  </P> <P> Letourneau, a senior, completed her brilliant prep career with a 2-0 shutout  over Mission Viejo in the championship game.  </P> <P> On the season, Letourneau finished with 19 shutouts, five no-hitters and four  perfect games. She posted a 23-0-1 record and an 0.17 earned-run average with  289 strikeouts in 167 innings.  </P> <P> Letourneau will attend Cal State Long Beach on a softball scholarship.  </P> <P> Covina, which went through a 26-0-1 season, was also honored with the selection  of Rocky Buccola as 3-A Coach of the Year. It was the second title for Buccola,  who guided South Hills to a Southern Section championship in 1982.  </P> <P> Two other Covina players made the CIF squad: freshman catcher Cynthia Escobedo  and junior infielder Rebecca Montes.  </P> <P> Twelve other San Gabriel Valley players were named to All-CIF teams.  </P> <P> The only other valley player named to the 3-A team was junior infielder Tristin  Alfred of Walnut.  </P> <P> Sierra League champion Diamond Bar placed senior pitcher Bonnie Ebenkamp,  senior infielder Elizabeth Sirchia and junior infielder Shannon Stec on the 4-A  team. Junior infielder Kelly Hunt of Charter Oak also made the team.  </P> <P> Temple City infielders Penny Saunders and Jennifer Woolery made the 2-A team  along with senior pitcher Carolyn Hawkins of South Pasadena.  </P> <P> Pasadena Poly has junior outfielder Anne Devereau and senior pitcher Jennifer  Bennett on the 1-A team. Senior infielder Amy Schroeder of Western Christian  and freshman pitcher Chenda Chavez of Azusa also were selected.  </P> <P> Mike Fenison, an assistant coach at Cal Poly Pomona last season, has been named  an assistant coach for men's basketball at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut.  </P> <P> Before coaching at Pomona, Fenison was an assistant at Chaffey College for one  year and junior varsity coach at Azusa Pacific University for three seasons. He  played for Mt. Sac during the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons.  </P> <P> Mt. Sac struggled to an 8-20 record and fifth place in the South Coast  Conference last season. But Fenison, 29, thinks the prospects are better for  next season.  </P> <P> "We have a talented group of guys but we have to work harder and hone our  skills because we're in such a tough conference," he said. "We have to  re-establish ourselves as a winning team. We can't worry about the other teams.  We have to concentrate on what we're doing. Once we do that, we'll go a long  way next season.  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills has signed three San Gabriel Valley baseball players  to letters of intent: pitcher Vince Aguilar and outfielder/pitcher Doug Brown  from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut and pitcher Armando Plascencia from  Nogales High in La Puente.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills Coach George Wing, whose team finished with a 16-29-2 overall  record and was last in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. last season,  thinks Aguilar can help his team next year.  </P> <P> Aguilar, who will be a junior, posted a 6-5 record and 3.13 earned-run average  with 65 strikeouts in 95 innings at Mt. Sac.  </P> <P> Brown, who will be a junior, spent most of his time at Mt. Sac as an  outfielder. He batted .295 as a sophomore and .308 as a freshman. As a pitcher,  he had no record in eight innings as a reliever last season but is considered  to have an excellent fastball.  </P> <P> Plascencia, a three-time All-Sierra League selection at Nogales, completed an  outstanding career with the Nobles by posting a 7-2 record and 2.14 ERA last  season. In the last two seasons, he piled up 137 strikeouts in 140 innings.  </P> <P> The Muir High boys basketball team will compete in the 16-team Slam-N-Jam  Carson Grand Finale tournament today through Saturday at Carson High.  </P> <P> The Mustangs, who reached the final 16 of the 128-team L.A. Games tournament in  June, will compete in pool play at 12:20 p.m. today against Oceanside and at  4:20 Friday against Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Muir is led by front-line players LaDay Smith, Erid Scott and Jermaine Davis --  all 6-6 -- and 6-2 guard Phillip Turner.  </P> <P> Among other top teams in the tournament are Long Beach Poly, Lynwood,  Cleveland, Marina, Lakewood and Ocean View.  </P> <P> The top teams in each pool will advance to the semifinals at 1:10 and 2:30 p.m.  Saturday. The championship game is at 7:30.  </P></p>

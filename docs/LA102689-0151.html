			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CATALINA WANTS OUT OF SMOG DISTRICT;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: AVALON OFFICIALS CAN'T SEE BEING LUMPED WITH LOS ANGELES IN CLEAN  AIR ENFORCEMENT.  </P> <P> Avalon city officials and business owners, arguing that Santa Catalina Island's  air is pristine and does not contribute to pollution in the Los Angeles Basin,  want out of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> In a letter presented to an AQMD official last week, Catalina Chamber of  Commerce President George A. Escofie disputed the logic of having islanders  conform to the district's air quality regulations.  </P> <P> The island's business community, he wrote, "simply fails to understand its  contribution to the air quality problems of the Los Angeles Basin or the  inclusion of Catalina Island in the South Coast Air Quality Management  District."  </P> <P> The letter asks that AQMD boundaries be redrawn to exclude the largely  undeveloped, 76-square-mile island from the district.  </P> <P> City officials say that although the smog district's geographic boundaries are  drawn along county lines, Catalina could become part of another, less-urban  district, or the island's unique location could be considered when permit fees  for smog-emitting equipment are levied. As a third alternative, they suggested  forming a new Channel Islands air quality district outside the 41 existing  districts.  </P> <P> "We've got 22 miles of open water between us and the balance of the district,  and we don't see that we're in the same air basin," City Manager Chuck Prince  said.  </P> <P> The movement was sparked by recent visits to several island businesses by AQMD  officials, who have begun notifying small businesses countywide of new permit  fees and requirements for certain kinds of equipment.  </P> <P> Much of the increased attention on the island results from the district having  redrawn -- in late 1988 -- its list of equipment for which permits are needed.  Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman, said a lot of equipment that previously did  not require permits was added to the list, including restaurant broilers,  bakery ovens and cleaning equipment at dry-cleaning stores.  </P> <P> In Avalon, an AQMD inspector notified owners at more than half a dozen  businesses with such equipment that they would have to get permits and pay  fees. The businesses included the Avalon Hospital, a golf cart rental facility,  the Southern California Edison electrical generating plant and several  restaurants, Keith said.  </P> <P> Avalon merchants argued that the fees are exorbitant and wonder how they will  help clean up the air.  </P> <P> "For our little island it gets to be a pain in the butt, all the rigmarole they  put us through," said a secretary who fills out air quality reports for a waste  disposal business on the island. "They're treating us like a big city."  </P> <P> Islanders cite a number of reasons why Catalina is different from everywhere  else. For example, the number of cars in Avalon is limited by city ordinance to  about 800. The state Department of Motor Vehicles has already excluded Avalon  from smog certificate requirements, and about half the residents walk to work  in the one-square-mile town, officials say.  </P> <P> The tourist-oriented island -- 86% of which is preserved by a nonprofit  conservancy in its natural state -- has virtually no heavy industry.  </P> <P> "We think the air here is beautiful," said Wayne Griffin, executive director of  the Catalina Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

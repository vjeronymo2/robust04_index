			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Abdelhak Benhamouda, secretary general of </F> the General Union of Algerian Workers, by Ahmed Ancer; place and  date not given: "`If the State Does Not Assume Its  Responsibility, the Law of the Strongest Will Prevail'"; first  paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] Speaking at a particularly complex and  difficult juncture, the secretary general of the UGTA [General  Union of Algerian Workers], Abdelhak Benhamouda, does not mince  words in describing the behavior of the political class.    [Ancer] What is your analysis of the current political  situation?    [Benhamouda] To make an analysis, there must be a political  situation--with at least some data--to analyze. I think that we  are going through a bad spell, so we can only speak of an  observation. It may be objective or subjective. But there is a  reality.    For my part, I am one of those very numerous Algerians who  defend the state. It is the state which, by being strong, takes  charge of defending the country and protecting the citizens and  their property. But what we are seeing is the total absence of  the state. We also see that the people who used to talk about  democracy, dialogue, "rahma" [compassion], tolerance, and human  rights are the ones now defending criminals, terrorists,  killers, and assassins.    We see total silence on the part of the public authorities,  the so-called political class, and the human rights associations  while hundreds of Algerians have been murdered just during this  month of Ramadan.    Even more serious, we see, as though by coincidence, that in  a sector of the press known to be the tool of the terrorists and  the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the roles have been  reversed: the real victims are presented as terrorists, while  the real terrorists become the victims. There is something worse  than that. Newspapers that are supposed to defend the republic  and democracy have recently been turned into tools of the former  FIS.    We have the impression, and it is also a profound feeling,  that the only one concerned by this struggle is the citizen: the  unarmed civilian. I often hear it said: "Where is civil society?  We have no people, no citizens." But I ask two questions. The  first is addressed to the public authorities. Why is the state,  which disarmed the citizens, now asking them to stand up to  unscrupulous criminals? Doesn't the state exist to ensure their  safety? Unless it is incapable of doing so! We draw the  following conclusions from such a situation: people are telling  themselves that if the state cannot live up to its obligations,  then the citizens are entitled to defend themselves by their own  means.    For six years, the political class has been abusing and  terrorizing the people. Now, despite that, even the parties that  protect or justify terrorism, thus ensuring it of political  cover, are being threatened because of contradictory interests.    The political class, whether in power or--in quotes--the  "opposition," is asking where civil society is. Judging from the  case of Ait Ahmed, civil society does not even have the right to  defend itself. Unless it is supposed to wait for "Mehdi  al-Montazer" [Hidden Iman] to come from Lausanne and defend it.    The problem at present is that the overwhelming majority of  Algerians are threatened, not just the members of the security  services or the people expressing political stands. The  terrorists are now murdering women, little girls, old men and  women, workers, teachers, peasants, the unemployed, and so on.  They are burning down schools, food units, industrial complexes,  and so on.    In short, they are destroying the entire country. Where is  the concern on the part of the so-called opposition parties over  such a situation? Where is action by the state in the face of  such monstrous crimes? It should be pointed out in this  connection that it is not the state that is hunting down  terrorists. It is the latter who are, for example, assaulting a  Gendarmerie station and organizing attacks in various places.  But if they do not do anything, they are not disturbed.    It is for all those reasons that the public is looking for  the best way to protect itself on its own. Mass action must  achieve two objectives: it must not be co-opted for the benefit  of the mafia still existing within the apparatuses, and at the  same time, it must strengthen the state's action. This is  important because if we step outside the framework of the state,  we become outlaws, and then no one will be governing anyone. We  hope that those limits will not be exceeded, especially now that  dialogue is being resumed.    [Ancer] What exactly is your opinion of the results of that  dialogue?    [Benhamouda] In my opinion, it is more a matter of  concessions. For example, every time there are clemency  measures, the response by the terrorists is hundreds of  Algerians being executed. The last time it happened--when  leaders of the former FIS were released--the terrorists carried  out the spectacular operation at Tazoult Prison. Judging from  the information available so far, it seems unlikely that only  two guards were in on it.    [Ancer] Does this mean you are thinking of high-level  accomplices?    [Benhamouda] Yes! You will notice that no one has accepted  responsibility, just as no one has resigned to at least keep up  appearances. The political situation constitutes a whole. It is  not limited to the management of security or to dialogue, which  we do not believe in, at least not in the way that it is being  conducted.    There is not even any communication. Take the example of the  negotiations with the IMF. All anybody knows is that individuals  are in Washington. But we know nothing about what they are  doing. Public opinion is not being informed. There is not even a  communique, despite the fact that the country's future is bound  up with the results of those negotiations.    [Ancer] What do you think of dialogue "with none excluded"  as  reaffirmed this Friday by Liamine Zeroual?    [Benhamouda] It is a problem. For myself, I understand it  this way: there are people who feel responsible for the blood  that is flowing because it is not compulsory to blame the one  causing it--the one doing the killing. Responsibility is placed  on the politician who pushed the terrorist groups to kill.    Let us accept that no one is to be excluded. Thousands of  Algerians have been victims of the terrorists. They have ties  with hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of relatives and  friends who are demanding justice. So there is a blood problem  to be solved. We can talk about dialogue "with none excluded,"  but only after resolving the matter of the blood that has been  shed, and every terrorist must pay. If that portion of the  public that still believes in the state and in legality does not  obtain justice, it will rebel.    It seems to me that the people who think it is possible to  have dialogue without excluding anyone in order to solve the  problems of terrorism and security do not live in Algeria or in  Algerian society.    So they are greatly mistaken. It seems to me that there is a  lot of manipulation going on, and what is more serious, we  resent the fact that they are trying to present us with a fait  accompli. Whichever group is acting in that manner is moving in  the wrong direction.    [Ancer] It is the women who are reacting now to the  disturbing situation in the country. How can one explain what  could be called hesitation on the part of the UGTA at such a  serious moment?    [Benhamouda] It is not a matter of hesitation, and we have  our positions. It must not be forgotten that our organization  has suffered many attacks aimed at destabilizing and destroying  it on the grounds that the central union and Benhamouda in  particular are engaging in politics and ignoring union activity.  That is certainly false. There is no hesitation. We are  observing the course of events.    [Ancer] We asked that question because at several important  moments in the life of our country, especially when the CNSA  [National Committee for the Safeguard of Algeria] was being  established and when preparations were being made for the march  on 22 March 1993, the UGTA played a leading role. And now  Algeria is experiencing a very dangerous situation.    [Benhamouda] The UGTA has stepped back and is observing. So  far no one has made a move. No one has lifted a finger or  denounced or condemned anything. There are no longer even any  notices of condolences in the newspapers. That just shows how  far cowardice has gone. Some political parties do not express  those condolences even to the families of their own murdered  members. Let us talk about 22 March, when millions of people  took to the streets in response to the call from the UGTA and  other associations. They did not do so to make social demands  despite the very difficult living conditions of the workers and  other groups. They were all chanting slogans about halting  terrorism and halting the assassination of Algeria. They were  all demanding a state of law, a republic with its values,  freedom, pluralism, democracy, and so on.    For my part, I do not know exactly who heads the FFS  [Socialist Forces Front], and it does not concern me. But in any  case I do not understand why somebody named Khellil, speaking  from the rostrum at a general meeting by his party, is targeting  me in particular. Those who target the UGTA say that we are in  the pay of the government. They have accused us of being  responsible for halting the election process, the action that  caused Chadli's downfall. Some people make a living from lies.  If we supported Chadli's government, how did it happen that we  played a part in bringing it down?    On the question of dialogue, the UGTA took clear positions,  regardless of whether it was talking to the HCE [Higher State  Council] or the commission, even to the point of saying that all  the window dressing had to be removed. Because if the window  dressing is not removed, people will not be able to see who is  pulling the strings behind the scenes. We wanted to know where  the real power was. That is the UGTA which, speaking through its  secretary general, denounces the government, the symbols of  corruption, and the mafia.    So where is the hesitation? The UGTA does not want political  power, too. The workers are suffering, but despite that their  first concern is the fate of Algeria. It is not our problems but  the defense of the country that is taking center stage. We could  have adopted a negative attitude, considering the seriousness of  the problems in the world of labor.    We might have been tempted to struggle for power so that  even  if we were unable to take it, we could still break the country  and make everyone equal in misery. But no, our concern has  always been to help make the state of law a reality.    There are certain things that I am not going to talk about  because I do not want to demoralize people. Let us talk instead  about the state. In the government departments and state  enterprises, people are going back to the beard and "kamis"  [shirt]. They stop work and go off supposedly to say their  prayers. In some mosques--I am not talking about the interior of  the country but about Algiers--virulent speeches with invectives  and insults are reappearing. This is true even on television,  where the sermons have been just as virulent as those by the  terrorists during this Ramadan. Despite all that, no one has  eyes and ears for anything except the UGTA.    [Ancer] The negative view is actually not the only one.  People look to the central union because it remains the only  organization with nationwide influence.    [Benhamouda] I was getting to that. Although from the  organizational standpoint, everything is relative. That being  said, our concern is to make people appear as they really are.  Now that we have had the communique from the president, we will  see how the political parties react. As far as we are concerned,  we have done all we could. But there is manipulation.    [Ancer] Are you afraid of attempts at co-optation, as  happened following the marches in March 1993?    [Benhamouda] There is always manipulation. That is why it is  absolutely necessary to establish a genuine and permanent  popular movement. In the second place, there are a lot of  volunteers. If the state wants that to be legal, let it hand out  weapons. Otherwise people will get them some other way. Any  popular political movement that matters must be able to protect  itself. If the state takes charge of the security problem,  people will organize peacefully. If the state does not accept  its responsibilities, the law of the strongest will prevail /tag  aala men tag/. [preceding words published in Arabic]    [Ancer] But in that case there would be civil war--it would  mean something terrible happening to the country!    [Benhamouda] We do not want it. We do not want it. That is  why I say over and over that only the state has the right to use  force. I have always said that. But if the state does not use  its strength to defend the citizens, who is going to do so--who  is going to defend the innocent? We have not reached any  decision.    We are in the process of getting together as union leaders  to  consider how to go about it. Because after all, if you are going  to die, you should certainly take your enemy with you. We need  to keep in mind the kinds of atrocities they are committing. The  terrorists went to the home of a gendarme, and when they could  not find him, they killed his wife and sister-in-law. They kill  women and a 14-year-old girl. They kill people in front of  innocent children. How long are we going to put up with that?    If we get to that point, there will no longer be political  parties or personalities. It will be every man for himself. We  cannot just stand around with our arms crossed. Who are we  waiting for?    Who? The tragedy of this country is that one person uses  history and another uses religion to say: "I am a party." Then a  third person comes along with neither troops nor trumpet and  speaks in the name of the Algerian people on who knows what  authority to exclude civil society at a time when intellectuals  are living in hiding in their own country. So the state must  accept its responsibilities in order to avoid civil war. There  must not be a return to the practices of the HCE, in which there  is dialogue with parties that justify terrorism by insulting  everyone. We have already wasted a year and a half for nothing.  We have already paid. And if we have to pay even more, will we  not be tempted to burn the country down? People have suffered  too much. Some, like Guendouzi, have died with their wages  suspended. It is possible to play with everything except  people's lives. The right to life is sacred.    Concerning the women who have decided to rally in front of  the ONDH [National Human Rights Organization], they could just  as well have done so in front of the office of the president or  some other important institution. In my opinion, they chose the  ONDH because human rights associations exist to defend  terrorists, murderers, and criminals. I do not recall any  communique from an association calling for the enforcement of  court decisions.    But that is a right. The same is true of health at a time  when hundreds of threatened physicians have fled the country,  but we have not heard anything from the human rights  associations on that subject. In my opinion, that is the  symbolism of the women's choice. They are defending the right to  life in order to arouse people's consciences. If there is no  response, it will mean that there is no more conscience.</p>

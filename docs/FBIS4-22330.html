goods quality at industrial and trade  enterprises; 62 percent of them resulted in finding the goods  defective.    Quality of individual categories of goods is characterized  by  the following data:                             Found defective, grade reduced                            quantity            as % of total volume of                                               inspected goods                                                1992             1993   Meat, thousand tonnes    1.1                 4.8              10.7   Whole milk products,     0.6                 5.5              5.7  thousand tonnes   Eggs, million units      12.7                28.4             25.7   Vegetable oil,           0.3                 31.4             17.4  thousand tonnes   Fish and fish            1.8                 8.6              16.6  products, thousand  tonnes   Confectionery items,     0.7                 11.6             12.1  thousand tonnes   Knitwear, thousand       45.5                21.0             25.7  tonnes   Hosiery, thousand        21.1                39.6             31.0  pairs   Sewn items, thousand     103.5               18.8             23.4  items   Leather footwear,        78.2                20.9             18.8  thousand pairs      At the Pestovskiy Meat Combine joint-stock society in  Novgorod Oblast, 67 percent of the inspected quantity of  sausages were found below grade; at Magadanskaya sausage  factory--40 percent; at Astrakhan city milk combine and the  Olovyanniki butter plant in Chita Oblast--53 percent and 90  percent of butter, respectively; at Birsk dry and fat-free milk  combine in the Republic of Bashkortostan--40 percent of milk  products; and at Kirov poultry factory--62 percent of eggs.    During one-time inspections, complete production batches of  footwear were found defective at the TOO [limited liability  partnership] Volzhane in Samara Oblast; TOO Kavkaz in Stavropol  Kray, POO [expansion unidentified] Sportobuv in Sverdlovsk  Oblast; and in one-third of inspected quantities of output at  Astrakhan and Ivanovo footwear factories. Poor-quality garments  were being produced by the Magnitogorsk garment factory in  Chelyabinsk Oblast and the Borisoglebsk garment factory in  Voronezh Oblast, and the PTShO [industrial-technical sewing  association] Kuban in Krasnodar Kray, where the share of  defective output amounted to 20-44 percent.  <H5>  Deliveries of Mineral Fertilizer to Agriculture </H5>   In January 1994, deliveries of mineral fertilizer for the  needs of agriculture are characterized by the following data (in  thousand tonnes).                     Delivered in   January 1994                   January 1994                                    as % of January               as % of                                                                December                                                                1993                                   1991      1992      1993   Mineral  fertilizer   total            67.7           7         10        26        64   including:   nitrogen         42.3           12        13        28        55   phosphate        5.2            2         3         12        58   phosphorite      5.6            12        21        137       121  flour   potassium        14.6           7         8         22        91      The continuing decline in the production of mineral  fertilizer (by 26 percent as compared to January 1993);  increased exports (1.8-fold); and poor solvency of agricultural  consumers resulted in fertilizer shipments to domestic market  consumers falling by a factor of four in January as compared to  January 1993. As a result, farms will get no more than 40  percent of the needed quantities this year. In Russia as a  whole, soil fertilization decreased as compared to 1990 by 57  percent; fertilizer deliveries declined in all regions, but most  of all in the following.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Delivered in January 1994|As 2000070040f January 1993     |  |                         |, thousand tonnes        |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pskov Oblast             |0.1                      |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Oblast          |0.1                      |11                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ryazan Oblast            |0.6                      |4                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kirov Oblast             |2.3                      |25                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kursk Oblast             |0.1                      |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lipetsk Oblast           |0.02                     |0.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rostov Oblast            |0.1                      |3                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stavropol Kray           |0.3                      |9                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic of Mordova [Mor-|0.1                      |2                        |  |dvinia]                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Consumer Services </H5>   Over the elapsed year the volume of consumer services, as  reported by officially registered enterprises, amounted to R0.7  trillion, which in current prices is nine times more than in  1992 and in comparable prices--40 percent less. Services  provided the population in rural areas account for 11 percent of  the total volume (12 percent in 1992).    Distribution of consumer services by form of ownership in  1993 is characterized by the following data (in percents of the  volume of consumer services by category).

However, an increase in  the incidence of these infections has been registered in  practically all 39 cities monitored by the Federal Flu and Acute  Respiratory Disease Centers. In 20 of them, the incidence of  these infections reached epidemic proportions between 14 and 20  February. The greatest spike over the epidemic threshold was  registered in Omsk (2.2-fold), Barnaul and Ufa (1.9-fold),  Kemerovo, Nizhniy Novgorod (1.6-fold), Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan  (1.5-fold), Kirov, Perm, and Chelyabinsk (1.4-fold).    According to the data of the Center for Prevention and  Eradication of AIDS, in January 1994 13 human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV)-infected persons were registered in January 1994.  Overall as of 1 February, the official count of HIV-infected  persons was 730 (including 282 children); of them, 133 persons  had AIDS (90 children). Over the period since 1987, 104  HIV-infected persons (63 children) had died, including 85  persons (54 children) with AIDS.  <H5>  Drug-Related Crimes </H5>   In 1993 MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organs have  uncovered on the territory of Russia 296 underground  laboratories manufacturing various drugs (twice as many as in  1992), including 54 in Perm Oblast, 32 in Smolensk Oblast, 29 in  Orel Oblast, 24 in Magadan Oblast, 15 in Orenburg Oblast, and 25  in Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast [Birobijan]. More than  one-third of all laboratories were manufacturing opium, 14  percent--marijuana, 9 percent--amphetamines, and 8  percent--hashish.    The main types of drug-related crimes are characterized by  the following data (in units):    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1993                     |1993 as 2000070040f 1992        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug and controlled-subs-|53,152                   |178                      |  |tance-related crimes reg-|                         |                         |  |istered                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Illegal manufacture, pur-|42,055                   |182                      |  |chase, possession, trans-|                         |                         |  |portation, and shipping  |                         |                         |  |of drugs not intended fo-|                         |                         |  |r distribution           |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Illegal manufacture, pur-|7,194                    |181                      |  |chase, possession, trans-|                         |                         |  |portation, and shipping  |                         |                         |  |of drugs intended for di-|                         |                         |  |stribution; illegal dist-|                         |                         |  |ribution of drugs        |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Inducing consumption of  |338                      |178                      |  |drugs and controlled sub-|                         |                         |  |stances                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Setting up or running dr-|499                      |154                      |  |ug dens or making facili-|                         |                         |  |ties available for these |                         |                         |  |purposes                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Illegal planting or grow-|343                      |3.8 times                |  |ing of narcotic-containi-|                         |                         |  |ng plants                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Increase in the incidence of drug-related crime was  registered practically everywhere; the greatest was in Tver  Oblast (eightfold), Republic of Karelia (sixfold), Ulyanovsk and  Smolensk Oblasts (5-5.3-fold), Republics of Mari El and Altay,  Murmansk, Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Kursk, Lipetsk, and Tambov  Oblasts (3.2-3.9-fold).    Law enforcement organs confiscated 53.7 tonnes of drugs and  controlled substances (a 2.5-fold increase as compared to 1992),  34.8 tonnes of poppy straw (3.9-fold), 17.2 tonnes of marijuana  (1.5-fold), 330 kg of hashish (by 4 percent), 260 kg of opium  (threefold), and 226 kg of controlled substances (2.5-fold).    Criminal proceedings on drug-related charges were initiated  in 1993 against 24,100 persons (a 27-percent increase),  including 21,300 Russian citizens (a 23-percent increase),  14,700 persons in the 18-30 age group (a 25-percent increase),  and 2,100 women (1.7-fold increase). Juveniles numbered 1,900  (17 percent).    As of 1 January 1994, 71,300 persons using drugs for  nonmedicinal purposes were on record in the MVD organs,  including 39,100 diagnosed as drug addicts. Of the total number  of drug users on record, 40,400 (57 percent of the total on  record) were in the 18-30 age group; 25,500 (36 percent) do not  have a steady source of income; 21,000 (29 percent) had  previously committed crimes; 11,500 (16 percent) are voluntarily  undergoing treatment, and 18,600 (26 percent) avoid treatment.

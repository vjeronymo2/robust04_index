			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gains tax switch on assets THE VALUATION of a gift of business assets for capital gains tax purposes can be deferred until those assets are sold, under a new statement of practice issued by the Inland Revenue, Andrew Jack writes. The guidance, numbered SP8/92, applies to taxpayers with shares in an unquoted, trading company which they or their family control. As from now it says that claims for gift holdover relief will normally be accepted automatically by the Revenue, and that valuations may be deferred until the time when these assets are disposed of. The voluntary arrangement requires the consent of both the donor and the recipient of the assets. Anyone can continue to agree valuations and calculate the gain with the Revenue at the time of the transfer if they wish. In practice, capital gains tax liability may be deferred for many years or may never be incurred because the assets continue to be transferred so there is never a capital gain. Holdover relief applies when the recipient of the gift agrees to assume the full capital gain on the asset which would have accrued to the donor. Until now, valuations have had to be calculated and agreed with the Revenue at the time of the transfer. The Revenue said the new procedures have been introduced in part to reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.</p>

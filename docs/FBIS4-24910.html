			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 3 (XINHUA) -- The United States has  already begun consultations with its allies and the U.N.  Security Council on possible sanctions against the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the State Department  announced here today.    Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci issued a  statement at a news briefing, saying that "We have no basis for  holding a third round of high level talks with North Korea and  we will seek further action in the U.N. Security Council."    Gallucci said International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  Director- General Hans Blix reported to the U.N. Security  Council yesterday that the IAEA has now lost the ability to  accurately measure nuclear fuel discharged from a nuclear  reactor in the DPRK.    The IAEA has said that the loss of this technique means that  its overall ability to verify the amount of plutonium previously  produced by the DPRK has been seriously eroded.    "Since the beginning of our negotiations with the North  Koreans last June," Gallucci claimed, "We said that satisfactory  IAEA safeguards presence during the refueling of the 5-megawatt  reactor was one essential basis for continuing our dialogue with  North Korea."    Gallucci today began consultations on future steps including  possible sanctions with a South Korean special envoy in  Washington.    He said he will have trilateral meetings with Japanese  representatives and the South Korean special envoy tomorrow.    The White House also issued a statement today, saying U.S.  President Bill Clinton, in Rome, telephoned Russian President  Boris Yeltsin and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is in  Moscow for a visit, about the situation in the DPRK.    Yeltsin has proposed an international conference on the DPRK  issue.    The White House said Clinton told Yeltsin "Such a meeting  might be appropriate at some poe need first to return the North  Korean nuclear issue to the U.N. Security Council." [sentence  as received]    Clinton and Kim "agreed that the next step is to pursue the  issue of sanctions" against the DPRK, the White House said.</p>

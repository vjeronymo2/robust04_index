			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt draftready on eco-issues Trade negotiators yesterday agreed the broad outlines of a work programme on trade and the environment to be carried out by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. The draft document, to be approved by ministers when they meet next month in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords, establishes a committee on trade and environment with an initial two-year life-span. Further extension of the committee's mandate will be discussed at the first WTO ministerial conference in 1996. The draft strikes a compromise between industrialised countries, notably the US, which wanted a permanent committee, and some developing nations which wanted to give it a fixed term. The committee, to be set up shortly after the Marrakesh meeting, will have broad terms of reference which stress the need to make trade and environment policies mutually supportive. The document outlines seven categories of issues the committee may explore. These include the impact on market access of environmental measures and whether fair trade rules need to be modified to accommodate multilateral environmental agreements with trade provisions. Trade officials said yesterday the document was drafted broadly enough to encompass any trade-related environmental issue, including such controversial areas as 'processing and production methods' (discriminating between products according to how they are produced) and 'eco-dumping' (allegedly unfair competition from countries with low environmental standards). However, they expect the committee to start with less emotive issues such as eco-labelling.</p>

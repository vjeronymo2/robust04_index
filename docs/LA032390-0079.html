She said Pryor has been in "very stable condition"  since his admission, and has suffered no complications.  </P> <P> Hospital doctors expect to release Pryor by early next week, Wyatte said. She  said he was visiting Brisbane, 600 miles north of here, on vacation.  </P> <P> Pryor recovered from an earlier heart attack while visiting his grandmother in  Peoria, Ill., in late 1977. In the past, the stand-up comic-actor has suffered  from addictions to drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> In June, 1980, he nearly died after he caught fire while free-basing cocaine.  </P></p>

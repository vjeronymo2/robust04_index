			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS DESCRIBE A YOUNG MAN WHO ALWAYS KNEW WHO HE WAS  </P> <P> As former teachers of Julian Cummings, we read with great pleasure and pride  your account (May 3) of his achievements at UC Berkeley. Even as a junior high  school student, Julian knew who he was and what he wanted in a remarkably  mature sense, so all that he has accomplished in the years after he left us  comes as little surprise.  </P> <P> Ironically, the wording of the article's title, "Honors Graduate Had an Uphill  Fight," revived one of our fondest memories of Julian. As an eighth-grader  participating in a study trip to Yosemite, Julian wanted to have the same  experiences as anyone else visiting the park. To realize this desire, he  selected many activities that would challenge his physical abilities, one of  which was a hike to the top of Yosemite Falls. Although we all admired his  determination, we doubted such an arduous undertaking fell within the range of  his ability.  </P> <P> As usual, however, Julian knew himself better than we did. When he and his  father finally returned from their successful climb -- long after everyone else  had come back to camp and well past the time we had begun to become concerned  -- we were privileged to share a triumph with him and his parents that is  unique in all our years of Yosemite experiences.  </P> <P> As a result, we've known all along that "uphill battles" are challenges that  Julian meets with purpose and effectiveness. We congratulate him on his  outstanding achievements and wish him every happiness and success in the  future. Julian Cummings will always have a special place in our teaching  memories.  </P> <P> JOY DE GRUCCIO  </P> <P> JAY DU VAL  </P> <P> ROY COLLIER  </P> <P> MARY COLLIER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

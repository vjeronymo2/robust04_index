			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ONLY ONE DRUG -- SO FAR -- WILL SPEED YOUR RECOVERY FROM FLU  </P> <P> Question: I've been seeing television ads for new over-the-counter flu  remedies. I remember your writing in past years about a drug for the flu, but I  thought it was prescription only. Have they changed it to non-prescription this  year?  </P> <P> Answer: No. The ads you've seen are for old cold remedies that have been souped  up and given a new marketing spin. These products may offer temporary symptom  relief but they can't help you get over the flu faster.  </P> <P> Only amantadine can do that, so far, and it is available only by prescription.  If you take it within the first two days of coming down with Type A influenza,  it can cut your convalescence time.  </P> <P> Q: Are there any medicines to eliminate dark coarse facial hair? I have to  shave it off, but it is really embarrassing. Even foundation and powder don't  cover it perfectly.  </P> <P> When I asked my family doctor about it, he said that if my periods are regular  there's probably nothing medically wrong. He thinks that I should learn to  accept my appearance and not be self-conscious. I honestly don't find that  advice very helpful and I hope you can tell me where to turn.  </P> <P> A: Check with a dermatologist or endocrinologist. They have more experience in  treating hirsutism.  </P> <P> Facial hair growth is usually associated with an excess of male hormones, or  androgens. (That's why men grow beards.)  </P> <P> It is usually treated with a medicine that counteracts these hormones. One that  has been used is spironolactone, a drug commonly used to treat high blood  pressure, potassium depletion, or certain adrenal gland problems.  Spironolactone is often effective but it causes tumors in rats, so there are  questions about its long-term safety. Side effects include drowsiness,  diarrhea, cramping and menstrual irregularities.  </P> <P> Other medications that may help hirsutism also have potentially serious side  effects. Antifungal Nizoral (ketoconazole) tablets reduce facial hair growth,  but many women experience problems such as menstrual disturbances, scalp hair  loss, nausea, headache or liver conditions.  </P> <P> Anti-androgens developed to treat prostate cancer in men are also being tested  against hirsutism. They too can produce side effects.  </P> <P> The most promising area of research is on anti-androgens that could be applied  directly to the skin, minimizing the risk of adverse reactions throughout the  body.  </P></p>

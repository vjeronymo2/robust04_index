			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Sale of skill centres condemned by union A COMPANY that ceased trading soon after it took over four government training centres was not fit to take over parts of the Civil Service, the NUCPS Civil Service union told a cross-party committee of MPs yesterday. In February 1990 the government paid Pounds 2.1m to TICC Skillcentres, which took over four skill centres in Cumbria, East Lancashire, St Helens and Ipswich. The company ceased trading in August last year. Only three of the skill centres are likely to remain open, all with reduced provision. Mr Tony Gallagher, NUCPS national officer, told the Commons employment committee: 'We were concerned that TICC Skillcentres did not have a background in training or any real knowledge of the sort of training that skill centres deliver. 'We felt that they were characters that really were not worthy or fit people to take over parts of the Civil Service.' The union believes the government's choice of TICC was poor and said other reputable companies had not been informed that the four skill centres were available. Mr Gallagher said TICC was headed by a Mr Lakin, whom he described as a 'Walter Mitty character' who claimed to have a friend at Deloitte Corporate Finance, which handled the sale of the skill centres. Deloitte Corporate Finance was part of Deloitte Haskins and Sells, the accountancy firm that has since merged to become Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. The union said that Mr Lakin went ahead with his bid after visiting the four skill centres for an hour each over a weekend when none was open. Union criticism of the sale surfaced after former civil servants were made redundant when the skill centres went into liquidation last year. It is understood that the government now feels the sale of the skill centres to TICC was a mistake, but that at the time its vetting procedures passed the company as suitable.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Satellite signal adjusts to sea life Watching live satellite TV at sea is normally an expensive affair, requiring a gyrocompass to detect the movement of the ship and adjust the satellite dish to keep it still. For vessel operators, the alternative normally involves supplying video tapes to the vessel every time it berths. Now Norwich-based Applied Satellite Technology has come up with a system which does not require a gyrocompass. The Marine SAT TV 900 uses a patented active antenna to lock on to signals from the Astra satellite, which covers the seas round Europe. The system, which costs Pounds 9,250, works by continuously sensing the signal's strength and instantaneously compensating directionally, so the receiving dish stays still as the vessel moves.

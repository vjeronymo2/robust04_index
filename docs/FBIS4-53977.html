			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Station editorial"] </F>   [Text] On 17 May 1994, his majesty the king once again  called for a roundtable meeting without preconditions to be held  at the Chhanghsu-on Royal Palace in Pyongyang, DPRK. His  Excellency Khieu Samphan and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK] totally support the royal appeal with a view to achieving  national reconciliation and peace, thereby quickly ending the  Vietnamese war of aggression. With this objective, the PDK has  organized a delegation to attend the roundtable meeting without  any preconditions.    Nonetheless, the two-headed government, Princeling  Ranariddh,  and the puppet Hun Sen, while claiming to support the meeting  without preconditions, have created stumbling blocks to sabotage  the parley. For instance, on 20 May 1994 the prince and the  puppet made a blatant statement imposing certain conditions,  especially a cease-fire prior to the meeting. At the behest of  the communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance, the two  puppets have repeated that a cease-fire is a precondition. The  following is our answer:    1. The two heads and their bosses want to fool the national  and international community into believing they really want  peace and national reconciliation. In reality, they are fanning  the flames of war.    2. The goal of the Vietnamese and the Western alliance is to  make the roundtable meeting fail, thus delaying it. This would  allow them to retreat, reorganize their military forces, and  wait for the military aid they are busy seeking for the two  puppets' forces. These forces are on the brink of collapse  because of a lack of combat troops. They are retreating and  regrouping their forces by drafting people to serve as  militiamen and reserve troops they call local self-defense  units. This is a maneuver to force people to serve as soldiers  and fight while at the same time inflaming the war.    3. Princeling Ranariddh and the puppet Hun Sen have  vociferously asked for military aid for the sole purpose of  further fomenting the war and killing their fellow countrymen.  The communist Vietnamese and the Western alliance have ordered  them to do this. They do not want to see national  reconciliation and peace in Cambodia.    This is the true nature and the root cause of the ongoing  war  triggered by the communist Vietnamese and the alliance, who are  the ringleaders. The persistence of the communist Vietnamese  and the alliance in continuing the war clearly shows that the  roundtable will be sabotaged by every means. The communist  Vietnamese and the alliance and their two puppets intend to use  the roundtable while they retreat and reorganize their forces to  further attack the people and Democratic Kampuchea.    The nation, people, and Democratic Kampuchea can see through  the scheme of the two-headed clique and its bosses. They are  determined to join hands more closely and continue their  struggle against these schemes. We want to achieve national  reconciliation and genuine peace, thereby allowing the people to  live peacefully, work on their farm land, and earn a living.</p>

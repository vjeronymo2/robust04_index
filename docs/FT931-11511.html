			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Make-or-break mission for TCE: William Dawkins meets the chairman of French electronics group Mr Alain Prestat, the young French civil service supremo who was launched into the top job at Europe's second-largest consumer electronics company almost exactly a year ago is on a make-or-break mission. As chairman of Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the 41-year-old Mr Prestat faces odds that would frighten many. A year ago, the group was losing so much money, market share and morale that its immediate owner, Thomson, the state-owned flagship of the French electronics industry, wanted to relinquish TCE. Today, TCE has been given a new chance and Mr Prestat believes the group is in the early stages of a turnround. 'Our situation is a bit like that of Renault in the mid 1980s. Some people thought Renault was in a hopeless situation then - and their problems at the time are of the same order as ours are today. They managed a turnround and we can too. We have already hit bottom and now we must rebound,' said Mr Prestat. Operating losses are set to rise from FFr228m (Pounds 28m) in 1991 to an estimated FFr300m last year, but Mr Prestat predicts that TCE will make an operating profit in 1993. Net losses are set to fall from FFr2.47bn to FFr1.7bn in 1992, on turnover stable at around FFr31bn last year, having declined to this level steadily from FFr36bn in 1989. 'In relative terms, that is not nearly as bad as the rest of the electronics industry. I see it as regaining stability,' he argues. As a symbol of its new ambitions, TCE last week hired the designer Mr Philippe Starck in the latest streamlining of the group's design management. Mr Prestat, who has spent his life moving between the higher echelons of state industrial policymaking and the electronics industry, was dispatched from the prime minister's private office into the hot seat at TCE during its worst crisis in recent memory. Only three weeks earlier, many senior executives were horrified to hear that the then prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson, was planning to place TCE under the control of CEA-Industrie, the industrial arm of the atomic energy authority. Others thought, in the end wrongly, that the state had decided to bail out the heavily indebted group. The government presented the plan, since reduced and reshaped nearly beyond recognition, as a bid to create a world-beating energy-to-electronics conglomerate on the lines of Siemens, the German conglomerate. Privately, executives knew the government also had a hidden reason. Mr Alain Gomez, who as chairman of the Thomson group is Mr Prestat's boss, was said to want to hand TCE to another part of the state sector so he could focus better on the group's profitable defence electronics arm, Thomson-CSF. With net losses of FFr5.5bn over the four years to the end of 1991 and debts of FFr10bn at the end of 1991 - now FFr14bn - TCE looked like a dangerous liability in Mr Gomez's strategy of trying to turn Thomson-CSF into a leading-edge defence electronics supplier. To his credit, Mr Gomez immediately executed a U-turn when it became clear that Mrs Cresson's blueprint was politically unfeasible, and returned to his old support for TCE. Mr Prestat was instructed to beat out a recovery strategy on the assumption that TCE had a long-term future in Thomson, but that a bail-out was not, as it had been in the past, guaranteed. Initially, he was greeted with suspicion by TCE executives who saw him as a mere political appointee, to impose the erratic government industrial policy of the time. They were wrong. 'Now they realise I am serious and that I am here to do nothing but run the business for the medium to long term,' he says. His first action, less than two months after arriving, was to change the heads of the US and European marketing divisions and the head of the European television section. 'They were run like baronies, or civil service departments, not like real sales teams,' says Mr Prestat. On both sides of the Atlantic, TCE had been losing market share in televisions, which accounts for 54 per cent of it sales. The 20 per cent US television market share it seized by buying RCA in 1987 had fallen several points and the penetration achieved by TCE's clutch of fine European brands was acceptably low. Now TCE's US market share has climbed back to the old level and it has added a percentage point to its European penetration by keeping volumes stable in a falling market. Mr Prestat, is however, disappointed with sales of TCE's new enhanced definition television set, intended as its foothold in the future market for full high definition television (HDTV) and TCE's main hope for thwarting Japanese competition in Europe. The risks of the HDTV market were highlighted over the weekend when Philips, the Dutch electronics group, suspended plans to make HDTV sets because there were no European programmes for them. TCE is undismayed by this because it does not affect demand for its existing enhanced television sets based on D2-Mac, a halfway standard between normal television and full HDTV. TCE is continuing its HDTV development in collaboration with Philips. It dismisses its partner's move as a production decision. The French group says it still has full faith in HD-Mac, Europe's HDTV standard. The other part of his strategy has been to work on TCE's fragile financial health, cutting stock levels by half to FFr1.3bn over the past year and trimming FFr2bn from annual running costs. He can do little more, however, than chip away at the group's huge debts and admits that the prospects of making a net profit depend on whether the Thomson group decides to pump more equity into TCE. 'I am not going to my shareholders with a begging bowl. I expect them to put in more money only if operating profits show the right trend,' he says. He is similarly non-committal on whether TCE should seek to strengthen itself through a foreign alliance, as did Renault with Volvo. 'That is not on my agenda at the moment. I never negotiate in a difficult situation, so it all depends on how we perform.'</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Welsh find Redwood is not to their taste: A controversial minister's first year is assessed by Roland Adburgham When John Redwood was appointed Welsh secretary a year ago, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, said: 'He will go down like a rat sandwich.' This was a predictable reaction, given that Mr Redwood is an English MP representing Wokingham in Berkshire, and reputed to be a rightwing ideologue. But a year later, as Plaid Cymru prophesied, many Welsh have not found him to their taste. A director of a leading Cardiff company explained why it had not invited Mr Redwood to visit, unlike previous Welsh secretaries. 'We don't want to,' he said bluntly. 'Our staff would not be very pleased to meet him.' Welsh sensitivities will not unduly trouble Mr Redwood who, at 42, is one of the youngest and brightest members of the cabinet. While his office is regarded as a relatively junior post, it does have a distinct advantage: the freedom to roam across departmental boundaries. The Welsh Office, with a staff of 2,300, has responsibility for everything except foreign affairs, defence and Home Office matters. It allows Mr Redwood to make speeches ranging from the 'social problem' of single-parent families to the oversupply of administrative 'grey suits' in the health service. 'I am keen to demolish the idea that the answer to any social ill is more bumf and bureaucracy,' he has said. His views on Europe are assumed to have caused him to be included among Mr John Major's 'bastards'. Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, comments: 'Mr Redwood uses Wales as a platform to advance his national political aspirations. 'He is very much in contrast with his predecessors (Mr Peter Walker, now Lord Walker, and Mr David Hunt, now employment secretary), who sought to get into the broad stream of Welsh life. Mr Redwood has a much more aloof stance, and gives the impression of being determined to integrate Wales more into the UK.' The Conservatives hold only six of the 38 parliamentary seats in Wales. Professor Philip Cooke, director of the Centre for Advanced Studies at the University of Wales, argues that it is the role of Tory Welsh secretaries 'to keep the lid on the pot - culturally and literally it is not their territory. Their task is to keep the union together.' Prof Cooke sees Mr Redwood as setting his own political agenda of national rather than Welsh issues. 'The defining characteristic of the Redwood period is inertia - nothing seems to be happening. In the past, Wales has been something of a test-bed for policies. In the 1980s, an interesting network developed for getting initiatives going and Welsh institutions became more confident. But these are now being reined in by the Welsh Office.' One notable curbing by Mr Redwood is that of the Welsh Development Agency, after it was sharply criticised by the Commons public accounts committee last year. Staffing is being cut and it has been brought under more direct ministerial control. The Welsh secretary, vulnerable to criticism of quango accountability, is reviewing the future of the Development Board for Rural Wales, whose chairman resigned earlier this month after it too was criticised by the Commons public accounts committee. Against expectations, however, Mr Redwood has not savagely cut public spending and abandoned his predecessors' interventionist policies. The expenditure settlement for the current year of Pounds 6.65bn is planned to rise next year to Pounds 6.89bn. 'He has fallen very quickly into the Welsh Office patter of boasting about high levels of public spending - I've been very surprised at that,' said Mr Davies. Mr Redwood, while stressing that he looks for 'improvements in value for money and efficiency in all Welsh Office programmes', has set better education and training and an improved health service as his priorities. He has supported funding for regeneration projects and readily puts his name to announcements of job-creation projects for which regional selective assistance is granted. His year overseeing a UK region has, though, made him no more sympathetic to the concept of regional government. The reform of local government, due to take effect in 1996, has led to renewed calls for an elected all-Wales assembly. Mr Redwood regards this as an unnecessary tier of government. Within the Welsh Office there are complaints that he keeps himself isolated, with policies formed more by his moral certainties than by consultation. Among the public, his remarks on single parents and criticism of Welsh schools with low educational standards, caused antagonism by appearing to show a lack of appreciation of the difficult realities of many people's lives. Mr Redwood's views look less stark when his speeches are read in context. But he has seemed unconcerned to alter the impression that his appointment was less to be a standard bearer for the red dragon than to adjust the political balance of the cabinet. The assumption within Wales is that he sees the principality as no more than a wayside halt en route to higher office.</p>

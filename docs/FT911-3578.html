			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Bonds: C&amp;G steps into sterling floating rate note sector CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society stepped into the sterling floating rate note sector of the international bond market yesterday with a Pounds 125m deal, increased from Pounds 100m, lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The deal follows the reopening of the sector by the Woolwich Building Society last week, after six months during which floating rate funding could not be sold. The four-year maturity of yesterday's issue was a year longer than the Woolwich deal and tested the readiness of investors to lock into this relatively illiquid market. Lead managers responded to demands for higher fees from several firms and offered eight basis points for underwriting, against four basis points last week. However, several leading houses again declined to participate, arguing that fees of around 10 basis points would be commensurate with underwriting risk. This did not appear to inhibit the progress of the deal however, with the issuer regarded as one of the few improving credits in the sector. The paper pays 15 basis points over the three month London interbank offered rate and was reoffered to investors at the fixed price of 99.69. At this level, the discounted margin is 24.5 basis points, very close to the return on the three-year Woolwich deal. The lead manager reported strong demand from UK institutional investors and some demand from continental European investors. Elsewhere, investors anticipating further appreciation of the dollar were offered two virtually identical Dollars 200m three-year deals from state-backed European financial institutions. Credit Local de France came with an issue lead managed by J. P. Morgan priced to yield 46 basis points over comparable US Treasury securities. Some hours later, LKB Baden-Wuerttenberg offered paper via Nomura International at a yield spread of 47 basis points over treasuries. J Sainsbury, the UK food retailer, is to redeem its outstanding Pounds 150m, 5 per cent convertible capital bond issue on June 24. Investors holding unconverted bonds can either switch into equity at the conversion price of Pounds 2.62 or take a redemption payment. Under the redemption clause, the bonds will be converted into preference shares, which will then be redeemed at par, plus a premium of 3 per cent.</p>

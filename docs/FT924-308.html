			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Firm foundations - Charles Batchelor looks at Britain's corporate old-timers and finds the key to success has been in staying true to the core sector in which they started Business is transitory. One-third of new firms can expect to fail within the first three years and by year seven, two-thirds will have gone down. Only three out of 10 family-owned companies are reckoned to reach the second generation. Early companies' law provided for a company to be set up for a particular purpose and then to be wound up when the task was accomplished. There was no intention that companies would last for ever, finding a new role when their original purpose was fulfilled. Despite the uncertainty of the commercial world some businesses do survive, not just for decades but for centuries. A new guide* to the largest 50,000 companies in the UK compiled on compact disc by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information group, finds no fewer than 258 businesses which are more than 200 years old and more than 3,200 which are at least 100 years old. The guide tracks businesses by date of incorporation or charter and D&amp;B has amplified this with information from the companies' own archives. Where two organisations vie for seniority in the same field of activity, as do the Cambridge and Oxford University Presses, and the early records are missing, the rankings may remain subject to dispute. The inevitable question that arises from this league table of corporate old-timers is what has allowed these businesses to survive when the vast majority have succumbed to recessions, deaths among the founding families, takeovers or the simple snuffing out of the entrepreneurial spark. One common characteristic is that all have stayed true to the core sector in which they started even though many have had to adapt to considerable technological changes. The oldest company on the list, the Aberdeen Harbour Board started out collecting tithes from shipping in 1136 on the authority of King David I of Scotland. It installed its first crane in 1582, adapted to steam trawlers in the late 19th century and now serves the oil and fishing industries. Alldays Peacock began in 1650 manufacturing bellows for blacksmiths' forges and foghorns for the Admiralty. Long before mission statements became fashionable the company appears to have decided that its role in life was to 'move air'. It now makes centrifugal fans for heavy industrial use. Some of the companies listed owe their survival in their early and most vulnerable years to the grant of government monopolies or privileges. Cambridge University Press owes its existence to the granting by Henry VIII to the university in 1534 of the right to print and sell books. Cambridge and the Oxford University Press (1586) were the only two English presses entrusted by the Crown with the printing of the Authorized Version of the Bible. Official backing also played an important part in the survival of organisations such as the Post Office, which dates from 1635, and the Bank of England (1694). The Bank of England was in private ownership until 1946 but owes its pre-eminence to earlier government patronage and its monopoly right, granted in 1844, to issue English bank notes. The privatisation drive of the 1980s may create a wave of new enterprises which will become the long-term survivors in the future. Private sector banks take up no fewer than three of the top 20 places: Barclays, founded in 1690; Coutts, now part of National Westminster Bank; and the Bank of Scotland which, unlike its English counterpart, is not a central bank. In their early years these banks undoubtedly owed their independence to their entrepreneurial drive - Barclays absorbed 19 other private banks in 1896 - though in recent years governments have had a strong interest in maintaining banking stability. Most of these large institutions and public corporations have come too far from their entrepreneurial roots to be recognisable as the same organisation. Family-run businesses, by contrast, do retain that link with their past. Three of the top 21 have been owned and managed by the founding family up to the present day while two more have been under a single family's control for most of their commercial life. R. Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company, has been run by the same family for 12 generations while Constantine John Folkes, present chairman of the Folkes Group, is the seventh generation to head the business. Firmin &amp; Sons, makers of military buttons and badges since 1677, was a family-run business until 15 years ago and a member of the family still works in the accounts department. Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, gold and silver bullion dealers and now part of Hambros Bank, describes itself as a family partnership and was largely run, between its founding in 1671 until 1957, by just six men - four Mocattas, one Goldsmid and a Hay. Family ownership is often a cause for dissension but if the founders can disentangle domestic and business concerns and avoid the dangers posed by disaffected younger generations then it can make for longevity. London is the home of most of the businesses engaged in commerce although its industrial base - now much reduced - is reflected by the presence in the table of companies such as Ede &amp; Ravenscroft, robe makers, and Vandome &amp; Hart, manufacturers of weighing machines. Birmingham and the West Midlands also figure prominently with Alldays Peacock, James Gibbons Format, locksmiths and metal founders, and Firmin &amp; Sons. Kent scores highly with both Durtnell, based in the village of Brasted, near Penshurst, and Shepherd Neame, brewers of Faversham. (This small north Kent town is also home to the Faversham Oyster Company which dates from the 12th century and lays claim to being the oldest company in the world. It is, however, too small for the D&amp;B listings.) Founded in 1698 by the mayor of the town, the Shepherd Neame brewery is still based on its original site over a 200-foot deep artesian well. Improved transport networks have meant that industries are less tied to geographical areas than was the case in the 18th and 19th centuries but, like Shepherd Neame, the Old Bushmills Distillery, in County Antrim, continues to owe its character to clear local water. And, just as the Kent brewer has depended over the centuries on local hops, Bushmills has used locally grown barley in the making of its whiskey. The frenetic mergers and acquisitions activity which characterises the Anglo-American business world may mean that few of today's significant businesses will survive for so long. The power of family dynasties should not be underestimated however. According to one recent study, more than 70 per cent of all UK companies, listed as well as private, are effectively family-run. *Key British Enterprises.

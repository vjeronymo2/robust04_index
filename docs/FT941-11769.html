			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Investment trusts poised to raise Pounds 1bn Two UK investment trusts specialising in European privatisation stocks look likely to set new records for investment trust launches, and could raise more than Pounds 1bn between them. The public offer for the Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust closed yesterday, and is thought to have put the fund at or near its maximum size of Pounds 500m, after Pounds 320m was raised through an institutional placing in January. The placing for the Mercury European Privatisation Trust closed yesterday, having also raised in the region of Pounds 320m. The maximum size for the fund is likely to be set at more than Pounds 500m, to allow for heavy demand expected during the public offer, which opens today and closes March 2. The previous record for an investment trust launch was set last December by another Mercury fund, the World Mining trust, which raised Pounds 425.8m. Low interest rates are driving UK investors into equity investments. Many remember the profits from domestic privatisations in the 1980s, and although European issues are not always as attractively priced, their share performance should benefit from improved efficiency over time. The final result of the Kleinwort public offer was not available yesterday. But Kleinwort said demand had been 'very strong', suggesting the maximum size of the fund had been reached and that applications may be scaled back. The basis of allocations will be announced today. Both trusts plan to take advantage of extensive privatisation programmes in France, Spain and Italy over the next few years. They will also buy shares in recently privatised companies, including in the UK, if there are efficiency gains still to be made. Mr Paul Harwood, manager of the Mercury fund, described it as a specialised European recovery fund. He said that stagging new issues - buying during the initial offer and selling immediately for a profit - was not an important part of the fund's strategy. Most holdings would be longer term.

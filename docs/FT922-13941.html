			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Costain Yesterday saw the culmination of a nightmarish year for Costain: the announcement of net losses for 1991 equivalent to two-thirds of the group's market value, plus failure to pay the dividend promised with last year's Pounds 77m rights issue. At 66p, the shares languish at a third of their level immediately after the cash call. Given such disappointment, the market will not be easily convinced that the worst is over. The company's contention is that a return to group profitability can be driven by sustained earnings growth from the high quality mining assets, particularly in the US. Contracting margins on oil and gas projects are holding up, even if the dominant UK business will suffer. Meanwhile, repair work on the balance sheet - still burdened by unacceptably high gearing - can continue, given a fair wind for disposals. The question is whether operating cash flow really will be neutral this year, and whether the UK residential and commercial property markets will inflict further damage before Costain's exit is complete. Last year's land bank write-down may yet prove insufficiently pessimistic, while the unchanged Spitalfields valuation is based on a large number of very long-term assumptions. Notwithstanding management's fighting talk, there is no rush to buy the shares. But they would certainly be cheap if widely mooted profits of Pounds 15m were actually achieved this year, and an annual dividend were paid equal to last year's interim.</p>

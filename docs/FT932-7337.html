			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Bangemann criticises drugs curbs MR Martin Bangemann, European Commission vice president, yesterday criticised European governments for limiting spending on drugs. He warned that measures to hold down costs would affect drug companies' profitability and their ability to develop new medicines. 'Departments of health are waging an increasingly desperate struggle to control costs and the pharmaceutical industry is their favourite target, even though it accounts for only a small proportion of health care spending,' he said. This year the German, British and Italian governments have introduced or proposed measures to rein in drug spending. Mr Bangemann told the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries' Associations conference in Salzburg that if companies continued to negotiate separate deals with governments, such as agreeing to invest in a country in exchange for high prices, they would not benefit from the single market. This was a vicious circle involving both companies and governments.</p>

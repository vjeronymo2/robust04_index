			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 13 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  admitted today that the issue of the Temelin nuclear power plant  in south Bohemia, some 80 kilometers from the Austrian border,  complicated Czech-Austrian relations. Klaus made his remarks at  a meeting with Austrian Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek. Busek had  stressed the sensitivity of the question for Austrian citizens,  Klaus told journalists.    "On the other hand the vice-chancellor is also aware that  the  Czech power situation is not easy, no easy solutions exist and  that the issue cannot be allowed to complicate and hamper future  Czech-Austrian relations," Klaus said.    He said he discussed with Busek measures aimed at the  revival  of mutual relations, including those on an official level. He  pointed to his planned visit to the Salzburg festival in August  at which he could meet several Austrian politicians. Klaus  stressed that Czech and Austrian views on many European problems  were "very close."</p>

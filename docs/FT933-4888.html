			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / MoD contracts delayed: Defence equipment manufacturers upset by string of overdue orders DELAYS IN the placing of Ministry of Defence equipment contracts are causing increasing discomfort among arms manufacturers. Disappointment about the lack of significant new British purchase announcements was apparent at yesterday's opening of the Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition in Aldershot, organised as a shop window for UK weaponry. Companies are worried that overdue contracts may now have to await the government's autumn review of public expenditure, which could bring further pressure on the British defence budget. Several deals which had been expected before or during the Aldershot exhibition have been held up. They include a deal with Vickers worth up to Pounds 500m, either for a second large batch of Challenger 2 tanks or for updating current Challenger 1 tanks; purchase of between nine and 15 British Aerospace Sea Harrier jets to replace aircraft lost in accidents; follow-on orders for Rapier and Sea Wolf missiles, also from BAe; and five-year contracts for supplies of ammunition, principally from BAe's Royal Ordnance subsidiary. In addition, the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard is waiting for the government to invite tenders for up to seven more Sandown class minehunters, of which it has built five. The invitation was originally promised by the end of July. However Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said at the exhibition yesterday: 'This is not an occasion for announcing orders.' Mr Mike Evans, a director of the Defence Manufacturers' Association, said delays posed the greatest problems for small companies depending on sub-contracts. One deal which did materialise yesterday was a contract for Ferranti International to supply the command control system for the Navy's Pounds 170m new helicopter carrier. The contract, won against strong competition, was awarded by VSEL, which is due to build the carrier with the Scottish commercial shipyard Kvaerner Govan. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, is a breakthrough for Ferranti, which in the late 1980s was ousted from a near-monopoly in command systems for the Navy.</p>

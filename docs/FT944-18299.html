			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Motorola lifts computer presence Motorola, the US electronics and communications manufacturer, is expected today to announce a significant initiative to enter the personal computer, computer workstation and computer server markets. Based on the PowerPC microprocessor chip jointly developed with IBM and Apple Computer, the new Motorola computer products will include desktop workstations, used primarily in scientific and engineering applications, as well as servers which are used to control networks of PCs. Motorola, which has had very limited success in the computer market, will manufacture the computers for resale by other companies. Motorola is also expected to manufacture PowerPC motherboards, the main circuit boards for PCs. The company said it expected to ship between 250,000 and 300,000 computers and circuit boards next year. These markets are led by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment in workstations, and Compaq Computer in the server market. Motorola will compete directly with IBM, its partner in PowerPC technology development. Motorola's revenues this year are expected to be about Dollars 22bn, up about 30 per cent over last year. However, computers are expected to account for only about 2 per cent of this.</p>

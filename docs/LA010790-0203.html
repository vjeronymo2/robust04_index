			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES FOR THE NINETIES;  </P> <P> WHO WILL BE THE FACES TO WATCH IN THE PERFORMING ARTS IN THE 1990S? NOTHING'S  FOR CERTAIN, OF COURSE, BUT BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS WORK, CALENDAR'S CRITICS  AND WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE AREAS OF MUSIC, STAGE AND  DANCE, AND PERFORMANCE:;  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> ESA-PEKKA SALONEN  </P> <P> When Esa-Pekka Salonen arrives on the job in 1992 as director of the Los  Angeles Philharmonic, he should have more than just the usual ex officio  influence on local music-making.  </P> <P> Salonen will lead the orchestra into the Music Center's new Disney Hall.  </P> <P> If the recent experience of the Orange County Performing Arts Center is any  indication, the new building will focus attention on its residents and bring  them new audiences of the trendy and simply curious, at least for the first  season.  </P> <P> The orchestra is counting on the earnest young Finn to provide charismatic  leadership and enticing programs to rejuvenate audiences without alienating the  graying Philharmonic faithful. Salonen comes to the orchestra as a composer as  well as a conductor at a time when premieres are becoming assets again, rather  than liabilities.  </P> <P> Perhaps most important, Salonen may be the music director who survives Ernest  Fleischmann. The demanding and productive executive vice president of the  Philharmonic will be 70 when Salonen's first contract expires, and for obvious  reasons the words retirement and Fleischmann are now being linked in Music  Center speculation. For the first time in almost a generation, the music  director will be the unquestioned apex of Philharmonic leadership, and that  music director will most likely be Salonen. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

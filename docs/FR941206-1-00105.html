			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A variety of more stringent alternatives were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered, including more restrictive limits based on HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content (rather than VOC content), more stringent VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits, and requiring use of pollution control equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These alternatives are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  To evaluate other potential limits, the EPA gathered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing data on HAP content from marine coating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and shipyards. Information compiled from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material safety data sheet (MSDS) was used to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (estimate) the HAP content of each paint. Most of the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> came from MSDSs and product data sheets. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, the percentage of VOC in marine coatings that are HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varies from zero to 100 percent and averaged 30 percent by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight for all paints in the project data base. (The HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content could exceed the VOC content in coatings containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-VOC HAP.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Industry subsequently informed EPA that the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP-specific data on MSDSs is poor. The MSDSs are prepared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily to meet Occupational Health and Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration (OSHA) requirements. Although one section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses hazardous constituents, the industry indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that information and format required for OSHA purposes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not as detailed or accurate as would be desired for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a regulation. Further, the list of hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials that OSHA regulations require must be addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSDSs is different from the HAP list in section 112(b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act. In addition, it is acceptable to give a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration range on the MSDS, rather than a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value. Finally, many entries on the MSDS are generic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum solvents, such as mineral spirits, which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixtures of many organics (some of which may be HAP) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary in composition from lot to lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Because of these drawbacks in MSDS data, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered it not accurate enough to be used in setting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits for VOHAP. The Agency believes, however, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting data base is sufficiently accurate for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimating broad parameters, such as the potential reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with limitations on VOC content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Enforcement of a limit on HAP content would require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA reference test method. Although one is under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development by the Agency, it has not yet been published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the quality of the HAP content data on the MSDSs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the lack of an approved test method for speciating and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantifying HAP, the EPA has determined that VOC will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used as a surrogate to limit HAP emissions. Consequently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule would establish the VOHAP limit at the VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit of the California rules using VOC as a surrogate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP and the Agency's VOC test method, Method 24, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The EPA considered requiring limits more stringent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing California limits. The data base indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that within each category of coatings there are coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with VOC contents below the California limit. (Some may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been developed in response to the technology-forcing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the California regulations that provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent limits to come into effect in September 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for some coating categories.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although coatings with lower VOC contents than the rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires are marketed in each category, they reportedly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not perform for the full range of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications within a coating category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  An important consideration in examining control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for this industry is U.S. Navy military  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications or ``milspecs.'' Because of the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings for specialized applications and the demand for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predictable performance, the Navy oversees exhaustive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance testing procedures. Naval personnel indicate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing program to qualify lower VOC coatings. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California rules were developed with considerable input from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Navy, and according to a Naval representative, reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``state of the art'' for lower-VOC shipbuilding coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volatile organic compound limits more stringent than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed would require that the Navy use paints for which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they have not yet completed long term testing, hence are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milspec approved. Given these considerations, the EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing MACT emission levels based on the 1992 California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that limit the total VOC as-applied paint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Minorco earnings gain 4% to Dollars 253.4m MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 253.4m from Dollars 243.8m for the year to June 30. Sales jumped to Dollars 1.67bn after the consolidation for a full year of Terra Industries and Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting, which were bought from Inspiration. Sales were Dollars 771m last year. The group has also acquired industrial mineral companies in the UK and east Germany. Mr David Fisher, finance director, said the moves underlined the group's strategy of turning an investment company into a natural resources group. Operating earnings increased to Dollars 63.8m from Dollars 57m as the acquired companies more than offset the reduced contributions from the group's gold interests. In spite of its record production levels, the group was hit by weak gold prices. The company has merged its 47 per cent interest in Adobe Resources Corporation with Santa Fe Energy Resources after unsuccessfully trying to sell the stake. Minorco's interest is now 9.75 per cent. Earnings per share climbed to Dollars 1.22 compared with Dollars 1.14 and the dividend was increased by 6 per cent to 54 cents a share from 51 cents last time.</p>

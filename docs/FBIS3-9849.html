Kovac admitted that Slovakia, which is moving towards  democracy and strengthening human rights, has been often  criticized by foreign observers in these fields. "However, we  have confirmed that democratic institutions are working in  Slovakia," said Kovac, hinting at the recent, formally  democratic removal of Vladimir Meciar' cabinet.    "The absence of political ethics" constitutes a large  portion  of the whole problem, Kovac stated. The political parties of  which none has absolute majority in parliament have not able to  arrive at a compromise and to lead the country quietly to the  independent, market economy. As a result, during the 15 months  of independent Slovakia foreign investments have been radically  curbed and privatization has slowed down, Kovac said.    He expressed the conviction that Slovakia had passed the  worst and the results for 1994 would confirm this. "A number of  experts predicted the collapse in Slovakia by one year after  independence, but this has not occurred," he stressed.    Regarding Meciar, whose removal he had initiated in  parliament, Kovac stated that "he was a source of political  instability and confrontation between the individual groups."  Meciar's fall was caused by his inability to cooperate with  other politicians.    Kovac also admitted that the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS), among whose founding fathers he was, can return  to power after the autumn elections. He noted that it would  hardly be possible without the assistance of other parties,  adding that in such a case "the new premier must not be  necessarily just Mr Meciar."    The new government must revive economic reforms and ensure  observation of human rights in order to increase the credibility  of the country in the eyes of the West and ensure the influx of  economic assistance.    Kovac refused demands by some ethnic Hungarian  representatives for a measure of territorial autonomy. He  supported the first steps of the current government to ease the  relations with neighboring Hungary which were kept strained by  Meciar due to the alleged territorial demands by Budapest.    "Both countries must contribute to stability in region,"  Kovac concluded.</p>

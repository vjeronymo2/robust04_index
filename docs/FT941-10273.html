			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / People: Another train ride for Prideaux John Prideaux, the manager credited with turning British Rail's InterCity division into the only profitable long-distance railway in the world, is to join the Docklands Light Railway, a much smaller and currently loss-making operation. Prideaux, 49, is joining DLR, which operates a nine-mile network serving east London and the Canary Wharf office development, as a non-executive director. But he says he expects to devote more time to DLR than is formally laid down in his contract. One project to which he will be devoting his time is the planned Pounds 100m extension of the railway south of the Thames into Lewisham. The DLR is to look for a private consortium to build the 4.5 mile line which on completion would double the DLR's revenues. At present it collects just Pounds 4m in fares against running costs of Pounds 20m. Prideaux says his experience of helping BR negotiate the creation of a joint-venture partnership with BAA to build the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express line between Heathrow and Paddington in west London should be valuable in negotiations with potential bidders for this project. After stepping down as managing director of InterCity, Prideaux became executive chairman at Union Railways, the BR subsidiary set up to manage the development of the fast rail link between London and the Channel Tunnel. But he fell out with BR chairman, Sir Bob Reid, over the proposed privatisation of the company and over the choice of a London terminus for the link. Prideaux favoured St Pancras while Sir Bob wanted Kings Cross. The boardroom row came to a head last August but Prideaux only reached a severance agreement with BR in December. The DLR directorship is the first job he has taken on since leaving Union Railways, since when, he says, he has been brushing up his language skills. Also joining DLR as a non-executive director is Nicolas Lethbridge, managing director in London of Babcock &amp; Brown, an international leasing company. Lethbridge, formerly project finance director with Schroders merchant bank, has a background in the private financing of public services, particularly in the transport field.</p>

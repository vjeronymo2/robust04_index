			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Rates cuts setback prompts switching from bunds GERMANY was again the focus of attention in the European government bond markets as the Bundesbank Council dashed hopes of an interest rate cut at its regular meeting yesterday. The news was compounded by disappointing economic data and technical factors in bund futures. The bund futures contract had risen previously on hopes that the German central bank would cut its key interest rates, even though many economists had pointed out that there was little justification for an easing. The release of a worse-than-expected gross national product figure - GNP fell 3.7 per cent year-on-year - undermined the D-Mark, reducing the chance of an interest rate cut, dealers said. When it was announced that the Lombard and discount rates were unchanged, bund futures rose. One economist said: 'There are buyers lurking at the lower levels.' Although domestic buyers moved in when bond yields hit 6.9 per cent, the buying was offset by heavy selling from non-domestic investors responding to the weaker currency. Much of the activity in the futures market was prompted by investors rolling over their contracts from June, which expires next week, to September, which is expected to become the front month shortly. The September contract saw turnover of more than 54,000 contracts, its heaviest volume so far. It rose three basis points to 94.47, while the June contract fell 0.11 to 94.02. Dealers said there was heavy switching out of German bonds into other European bonds. SPAIN was an active market on the back of a well-received bond auction. The central bank issued Pta627bn of three-year, five-year and 10-year stock at slightly lower yields, and the auction was covered 2.06 times with investors particularly keen on the longer-dated issues. Ten-year bond futures moved ahead 35 basis points to 88.53, and the 10-year cash bond gained half a percentage point. FRENCH government bonds opened stronger, helped by buying at the short end and reassured by the franc's firm tone against the D-Mark. However, there was some pressure from the FFr20.5bn auction of OATS. The June futures contract on the Matif rose 6 basis points to 116.82. UK gilts held steady, still supported at the short end by expectations of an eventual trimming of interest ates. Analysts said there were more people looking for an early base rate cut than last week, but they felt the Bank of England had signalled in its open market operations that it wanted no change in policy. US Treasury prices firmed slightly at both ends of the market as dealers and investors cautiously awaited today's May employment report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 103 11/32 , yielding 6.856 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 4.125 per cent. Trading activity was reported by dealers to be light. Prices received an early lift from the news that claims for state unemployment insurance rose 5,000 to 344,000 last week. The data provided the latest evidence that labour conditions remained relatively weak, and raised hopes that the May employment report, out this morning, will show a similarly sluggish trend in the jobs market. The range of analysts forecasts for the data is quite wide, ranging from a gain in non-farm payrolls of 50,000 to a gain of 125,000. Most analysts expect the national unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 7 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds were firmer in London on continued speculation that the official discount rate was about to be cut. The price rise drove the yield on the benchmark No145 JGB down 4 basis points to 4.585 per cent. Dealers, however, said the Bank of Japan was unlikely to act until the release of its key Tankan quarterly report on June 11.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Indonesian export rise eases fears on debt servicing INDONESIA'S latest trade figures have eased concerns over the country's ability to service its foreign debt, although economists have warned the government not to loosen control over offshore borrowing. Between 1989 and 1991, Indonesia's international debt rose by more than 40 per cent to about Dollars 80bn (Pounds 53bn) and donors warned of a potential debt crisis. At the start of 1992, Indonesia had a debt service ratio of 32 per cent of export proceeds. January to August trade figures, however, showed a 22.6 per cent year-on-year rise in non-oil exports to Dollars 14bn, more than offsetting a 9 per cent decline in the value of oil and gas exports to Dollars 6.9bn in the same period. International debt, a third of which is owed by private companies, has been held steady this year following a government decision in late-1991 to set a ceiling on new borrowing. All offshore loans must now receive the approval of a government committee. The growth in exports will lower the debt service ratio, forecast by economists to fall below 29 per cent by next year. It is also a sign that new plant and machinery, imported on the back of foreign borrowing, is coming on stream. However, Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, a former finance minister and leading businessman, recently warned the government not to relax its control over debt. Mr Djojohadikusumo described the current debt service ratio as critically high and said it should be reduced to 25 per cent by 1997. Bankers in Jakarta believe his warning has been sanctioned by government ministers in an attempt to dissuade some private companies from embarking on large-scale, ill-conceived, projects using offshore finance.</p>

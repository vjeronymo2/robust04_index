			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ACTION STAR VAN DAMME WANTS TO KEEP SHIRT ON  </P> <P> Just when filmmakers and moviegoers seem to be turning away from violent action  pictures, along comes Jean-Claude Van Damme, a tough cookie bent on inheriting  the collective mantle of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Norris.  </P> <P> The handsome, muscular native of Belgium is starring in "Death Warrant," not to  be confused with "Driving Miss Daisy" or "Ghost."  </P> <P> Although Van Damme is steering his career to less-bloody fare, his following is  primarily hard-core martial arts fans and youthful females smitten with his  biceps, trapezius muscles and pectorals.  </P> <P> He looks great with a shirt on. He looks better with it off.  </P> <P> In addition to "Death Warrant," Van Damme's pictures include "Kickboxer,"  "Bloodsport" and "Cyborg," all of which prospered at the box office.  </P> <P> Awaiting release is "Lionheart." He is off soon to star in "Double Impact," in  which he plays twins. Thereafter he will head the cast of "Universal Soldier."  </P> <P> Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, another Eurohunk, Van Damme has set his sights on  becoming a mainstream star in nonviolent films.  </P> <P> Also, like Schwarzenegger, Van Damme plans to become a tycoon. "I have a long  way to go," he said. "To build an empire you need more than muscle. You need  strong mental powers, like Arnold has and I am trying to develop."  </P> <P> Van Damme says violence in his pictures is different from the body counts in  Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone films.  </P> <P> "My violence is more emotional than physical," he said. "I see that lots of  passion is included in the script. I want my character to fight more with his  heart than his hands.  </P> <P> "That way people can accept more violence from me. I think that is why my  pictures do so well in other parts of the world. My characters fight for  principle, not for country or money.  </P> <P> "I am already changing my image in 'Double Impact' by playing twins. One of  them is violent and the other is not, so audiences can see the contrast in my  work.  </P> <P> "This picture has comedy, romance, a love story. So it is not all action and  fighting. I was a dancer for years. When I fight on screen, I blend karate with  dancing. Grace plus power is very nice.  </P> <P> "If I stay in martial arts pictures people will get tired of my films. . . . If  I want a long career in motion pictures, then I have to break away from  physical roles. Wait and see, I will do exactly that."  </P></p>

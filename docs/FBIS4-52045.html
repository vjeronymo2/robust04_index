			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video: from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Justice Minister Nagano has said that the Nanjing  atrocity is a fabrication and South Korea and China are reacting  against his remarks.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu called in  Japanese  Ambassador to Seoul Toshio Goto today to protest against  Nagano's remarks. During his meeting with the Japanese  ambassador, Foreign Minister Han said: We regret Justice  Minister Nagano's remarks which have thrown cold water on new  efforts by the South Korean and Japanese Governments to build a  new relationship. I hope the Japanese Government will take  proper steps to deal with his remarks.    About 50 South Korean bereaved family members of victims of  the Pacific war assembled today in front of the Japanese Embassy  in Seoul to throw eggs into the embassy building and demand the  sacking of Justice Minister Nagano.    Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is believed to be  assessing  to some extent Justice Minister Nagano's retraction of his  remarks that the Nanjing atrocity is a fabrication. So far,  however, some Japanese cabinet ministers have denied Japan's war  of aggression against China and the atrocity perpetrated by  Japanese soldiers in China. Therefore, the Chinese Government is  expected to carefully watch how the Japanese Government will  deal with Nagano's remarks.    South Korean and Chinese Governments are asking the Japanese  Government to take proper steps to deal with the controversial  remarks through Japanese embassies in Seoul and Beijing. In  response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terada has said that the  Japanese Government intends to respond to the South Korean and  Chinese Governments through diplomatic channels about how the  Japanese Government plans to deal with the controversial remarks  after Prime Minister Hata returns home tomorrow.</p>

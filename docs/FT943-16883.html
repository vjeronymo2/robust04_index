			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar touches new low The dollar touched another new low against the yen yesterday, but there was still no indication of central bank intervention to support the currency, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar closed in London at Y98.645, from Y98.675 on Wednesday, but was higher against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.5915 from DM1.5825. New York trading ended with the US currency weaker at Y98.465 and DM1.5872. Analysts said the market was willing to probe the downside against the yen in the absence of co-ordinated intervention and policy change. Although the market is focusing its attention on next week's Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, it seems confident of probing the downside in the meantime. Sterling closed mildly firmer at DM2.4564 from DM2.4482. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5435 from Dollars 1.547. In Europe the Italian lira and French franc weakened against the D-Mark. The Bank of France reduced its intervention rate to 5.1 per cent from 5.2 per cent. The dollar kicked off the day firmer on vague reports of US and German monetary authorities co-operating more closely. Also offering cheer to the market were comments from Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime minister, to a local newspaper, that he would want to see 'as much international co-operation as possible' with regard to the rising yen. In contrast, however, Mr Robert Rubin, an adviser to President Clinton, said there would be no special dollar discussion at G7. Analysts said investors wishing to push the dollar lower were also selling the D-Mark against the yen as a safer route than direct sales of the dollar, against the yen or the D-Mark. The D-Mark ended in London at Y61.97, down from Y62.34 on Wednesday. There was little response to various second line US data released, which matched market expectations. Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist at Citibank in London, said the problem the central banks faced in supporting the dollar was the lack of short dollar positions against the yen. This made it more difficult for intervention to be effective. Aggravating matters is the political situation in Japan. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, said the appointment of Socialist party leader Mr Tomiichi Murayama as prime minister had mixed implications for the yen. On the one hand, the fact that there was no longer a political vacuum in Japan improved the likelihood of progress in the trade talks with the US. On the other, the Socialists' opposition to consumption taxes diminished the likelihood of cuts in personal taxes which the market is hoping for. Mr Lyons predicted that the dollar would continue to weaken until there was evidence of portfolio funds flowing in to buy US assets. The trigger, he said, would be a dampening of US inflation expectations, which would probably arrive with evidence of a slowing in US economic growth, and evidence that the Fed had achieved a neutral monetary policy stance. The outlook for the dollar is also gloomy from a technical perspective. Mr Brian Marber, an independent analyst, said he had 'no doubt that the dollar is still headed much lower'. He said that if the dollar finished below Y100 for a third day, this would show that Y100 had given way. Having been bullish of the dollar, this would leave him 'firmly bearish'. In Europe the Italian lira had another difficult day, closing at L994.7/DM from L990.6. Analysts said the currency suffered from the sell-off in Italian bonds. Markets remain worried about whether the government has the will to deal with Italy's large budget deficit. Concerns were also fanned by evidence of a possible conflict between the president and prime minister over the running of the state broadcaster. The French franc finished unchanged at FFr3.43 to the D-Mark following the cut in interest rates. This was a solid performance, considering that it coincided with figures showing unemployment - a highly sensitive political issue - had risen to 12.7 per cent in May. Mr MacKinnon said monetary policy in France remained too tight - money supply growth is currently negative - for this stage of the cycle. But he added: 'Betting against the French franc has not been a profitable trade.' Traders in the futures market said the mood had been skittish, with the pattern of trade again set at the longer end of the market. The June UK purchasing managers index, which rose to a record 61.4 per cent, and revealed signs of inflation, had a negative impact on short sterling. The December contract closed six basis points lower at 93.71. The Bank of England provided late assistance to the UK money market of Pounds 300m. Earlier it had supplied liquidity of Pounds 197m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight money traded from 4 to 6 3/4 per cent. In Germany, call money again traded at the 6 per cent Lombard level as banks struggled to meet their monthly reserve requirements.</p>

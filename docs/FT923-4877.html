			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Australia angry at US subsidised wheat plans THE Australian government and farmers' organisations reacted angrily yesterday to US plans to increase sales of subsidised wheat, despite US assurances that Australian export markets would not be damaged. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said Australia 'strongly objected' to the announcement by President Bush that the US will subsidise with an additional Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) the export of 29.1m tonnes of wheat to 28 countries in 1992-93. The announcement was 'hard to square' with earlier US assurances that the export enhancement programme (EEP) would be implemented so as to minimise the impact on Australia's unsubsidised wheat exports. The announcement sent 'a negative signal' about US commitment to Gatt's Uruguay Round world trade talks, stalled earlier this year after the US and EC failed to agree reductions in farm support. Officials said the Australian government was especially angry about the extension of the EEP programme to countries such as Pakistan and South Africa, which Canberra regards as an attempt to widen the scope of US sales at the expense of unsubsidised competitors. The Bush plan was defended on Australian radio by Mr Steven Censki, acting director of the US agriculture department's foreign agricultural service, who denied it represented an escalation of US subsidies. 'It's more the method of announcing the EEPs has changed. We bundled all the initiatives we would announce during the new year together into one large announcement,' Mr Censki said. 'It provides more certainty to our export trade; we think it provides more pressure on the EC to reduce its subsidies.' But farmers' organisations said the programme would drive down world prices. Mr Ian MacFarlane, president of the Queensland Grain Growers Association, called it an 'electorally driven bastardisation' of world markets. Mr Bruce Lloyd, deputy leader of the the National Party, said the US was now Australia's 'number one trade enemy'.</p>

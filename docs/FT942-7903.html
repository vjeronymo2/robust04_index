			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Companies warned of risks as late payments reach peak Late payments due to UK companies have reached an all-time high, posing 'a serious threat' to otherwise healthy businesses, Trade Indemnity, Britain's largest credit insurer, said yesterday. Companies were waiting on average for a record Pounds 145,000 in long overdue payments from their customers in the first quarter of this year, up from Pounds 116,000 in the same period of 1993, Trade Indemnity said. Its survey showed that 18 per cent of invoices were 'long overdue' - unpaid 30 days after their due date. The average bill is paid 22 days beyond due date. Smaller companies had to wait on average 28 days beyond due date for payment. The figures will give ammunition to calls for trade creditors to be granted a statutory right to claim interest on overdue debts. At least 34 countries have such measures or have agreed to introduce them. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said in his Budget speech that the government was considering legislation on the issue. Lord Strathclyde, the small business minister, has been considering proposals since a consultative document closed to submissions at the end of March. He may announce the outcome of the government's review on Thursday at an Institute of Directors seminar on cash-flow management. Of 822 companies surveyed by Trade Indemnity, only 2 per cent reported that all payments due to them had been made on time, lending weight to claims by the Forum for Private Businesses, a small business lobby group, that companies are stalling on invoice payments in order to gain free credit. Small companies were worst affected by the delays, with long overdue debts to companies with turnover of less than Pounds 1m running at 3.8 per cent of turnover. Companies with turnover in excess of Pounds 50m reported long overdue debts equal to 0.7 per cent of turnover. Debts also varied by industry, with construction companies reporting the highest average of long overdue debts, at Pounds 291,640, and clothing manufacturers the lowest, at Pounds 39,400. The engineering sector reported an average of 25 per cent of invoices still outstanding 30 days beyond their due date. Other industries badly affected were textile distribution, with 27 per cent more than 30 days late, and the paper and print industries, at 26 per cent. An isolated area of improvement came in payments to exporters, 8 per cent of whom reported that they were paid on time in the first quarter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the  provincial party committee, accompanied by Tian Fengshan, Shan  Rongfan, and Wang Xianmin, paid an official visit to the  provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and met with and extensively  exchanged views with comrades of the provincial CPPCC Committee  and responsible persons of various democratic parties.    Zhou Wenhua, chairman of the provincial CPPCC Committee;  Vice  Governor Zhou Tienong; Huang Feng, Dai Moan, Fu Shiying, Chen  Wenzhi, Tan Fangzhi, Zhao Shijie, Chen Zhanyuan, Wang Zhitian,  Wu Dinghe, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC Committee; and  Zhang Huanchen, secretary general of the provincial CPPCC  Committee, joined the visit.    Yue Qifeng said: The CPPCC system is the basic political  system of our country. In the new situation, it is worthy of  exploring and studying how to give better play to the role of  the CPPCC. All democratic parties should act in line with the  basic line centering on one central task and two basic points,  give play to their own advantages, and promote reform, opening  up, and economic development. He said: The CPPCC organizations  and various democratic parties should also deeply study volume  no. 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, clear  up old ideas and concepts in line with reality, put forward and  study issues with the market economic mode of thinking, and  provide basis and reference for the provincial party committee  and government to make scientific policy decisions.    Yue Qifeng said: Heilongjiang has a fairly great number of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. This is our  great wealth. While grasping this financial resource, we should  also develop new ones, namely the development of nonstate  economic sector, such as township enterprises.    Yue Qifeng pointed out: The waste of trained personnel is  the greatest waste. Large and medium-sized enterprises have a  galaxy of trained personnel, however, their role cannot be given  full play. If we release some trained personnel to run  nongovernmental enterprises, great results will be achieved.  Heilongjiang has a considerable number of colleges,  universities, and scientific research centers and institutes  with the advantage of trained personnel. We should give full  play to this advantage, and use the rich natural resources of  Heilongjiang to develop intensive processing industry as well as  high-and new-technology enterprises. It is hoped that the CPPCC  and various democratic parties will give play to their role in  this aspect.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROEMER WILL NOT SIGN ABORTION BILL BUT MAY LET IT BECOME LAW  </P> <P> Gov. Buddy Roemer said Friday that he will not sign the nation's strictest  state anti-abortion bill but he said that he may allow it to become law without  his signature.  </P> <P> "I've gone from three options to two.  </P> <P> I will either veto the bill or allow it to become law without my signature,"  Roemer said in a statement. He has until July 29 to decide.  </P> <P> Although the bill provides exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and  incest, Roemer said he was not happy with provisions of the legislation and the  way the Legislature passed it during the closing days of its session.  </P> <P> Roemer, who originally requested a 30-day period in which a woman would be  allowed to report a rape and have an abortion later, said he was not happy with  the bill's seven-day provision.  </P> <P> He said also that he believed the bill did not do enough to protect a woman's  mental health.  </P> <P> The bill calls for up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $100,000 for  doctors who perform illegal abortions.  </P> <P> Roemer vetoed a measure that allowed exceptions only to protect the life of a  mother. The Legislature hastily assembled and passed the measure that Roemer  now says he will not sign.  </P> <P> The governor, abortion rights advocates and some lawmakers have expressed  doubts about whether the bill is constitutional.  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / ITV wants Pounds 304m football deal reopened over late offer THE independent television companies are pushing to reopen the Pounds 304m satellite television deal with English football's new Premier League because British Sky Broadcasting was allowed to submit a secret last-minute improved offer to freeze out ITV. At least one football club chairman is calling for an official inquiry because of what he said was the unfair and unethical way the negotiations were concluded. The agreement in principle - heads of agreement are now being drawn up  - is controversial because only viewers with access to satellite or cable television will be able to see live Premier League matches. Chairmen and chief executives of the new league, which starts in August, voted on Monday by the narrowest possible margin in favour of a joint BSkyB-BBC deal worth Pounds 304m over five years. Two of the 22 clubs present abstained and six voted against. The agreement in principle needed two-thirds support. A detailed ITV offer worth Pounds 262m over five years was delivered by hand between 8am and 9am on Monday by Mr Trevor East, executive director of ITV football, to Mr Rick Parry, chief executive of the new league, and Sir John Quinton, its chairman, who is also chairman of Barclays Bank. Mr Parry handed out copies of the ITV offer to the premier league executives as they arrived at London's Royal Lancaster Hotel for the 10am meeting. Mr East says that just before 10am he overheard Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur football club and of Amstrad Consumer Electronics, the principal maker of satellite dishes, making a telephone call from a booth in the hotel. 'He was very excited. He was saying things like: 'Don't you understand. You don't seem to have taken it in. These are the figures. You've got to get something moving quickly.'' According to Mr East, the Amstrad chairman concluded by saying: 'Blow them out of the water.' Asked yesterday if he had called BSkyB with details of the new ITV offer, Mr Sugar said: 'It's none of your business who I was talking to. I might have been talking to my girlfriend.' BSkyB, it is believed, was also tipped off by sources other than Mr Sugar that the ITV bid had narrowed the gap between the two sides. ITV, which wanted 30 live games a season compared with the 60 in the BSkyB deal, believes that if the difference had been less than Pounds 10m a year the clubs would have accepted the greater visibility that ITV would have given the new league. A new BSkyB offer was put together at the last moment and sent to Mr Parry, who did not join the meeting until nearly 10.40am. Mr Parry then relayed the offer orally - there was no accompanying paperwork. According to those present, no clue was given that there had been a last-minute offer and ITV was given no chance to respond with a new offer. Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association and chief executive of London Weekend Television, said yesterday Mr Parry had said on four occasions that everything would be all right for ITV. Requests for a chance to make a presentation to the league chairmen came to nothing. Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, last night declined to confirm or deny a last-minute revised offer.

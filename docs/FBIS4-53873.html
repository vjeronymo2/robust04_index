			<p>CSO     [Text] (Nagoya) Aichi Steel Works signed a consulting  contract concerning the construction of a factory with U.S.  forged steel products maker Louisville Forge and Gear Works of  Kentucky. Aichi Steel Works will advise Louisville Forge on the  layout, equipment specifications, and final manufacturing  processes for a new forging plant which the latter plans to  build. President J. Payton of Louisville Forge visited Japan on  5 April to sign the contract.    Louisville Forge supplies the three major automakers and  Japanese automakers with North American plants with forged  components. Louisville Forge has maintained a technical  assistance agreement with Aichi Steel Works since July 1990 and  in August of last year it had reached a technical assistance  agreement on the manufacture of crankshafts using "nontempered  steel" which does not involve heat processing. Louisville Forge  is formulating plans for relocation and construction of a new  plant, but the timing and location are still undetermined.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Swings, roundabouts and the World Index In the midst of the gloom about the plunging share prices of 1994 it is important to bear in mind one easily overlooked fact: the FT-Actuaries World Index has climbed by some 3 per cent in the first half of the year. Admittedly, that gain is glamorised by being stated in terms of the dollar, a weak currency this year, and the local currency version of the index has indeed fallen - but only by 2 per cent. However you look at it (at worst, a fall of 8 per cent in terms of the yen) it scarcely amounts to a serious bear market. For typical global portfolio managers, however, the picture is considerably worse. In a reversal of the profitable 1993 pattern, the dominant markets this time have been the two big ones, Tokyo and New York. The Japanese market is well up, the American one only slightly down (by 4 per cent according to the FT-Actuaries series, and only by 2 per cent on the basis of the narrowly based Dow Jones Industrial Average). These two big steady markets account respectively for 31 and 35 per cent of the total world index capitalisation. But the other 34 per cent does not look so good, with on average a fall of 13 per cent. Within that, fallen stars such as Hong Kong and Malaysia are off by about a quarter this year and many of the European markets are down by 10-15 per cent in local currencies. For global managers who were successfully chasing the hot markets last year this is all very inconvenient. UK pension funds, for instance, which own non-UK equities worth some Dollars 170bn, were running only half the index weightings in the US and Japan at the end of last year, according to the WM Company, the performance measurement consultants. They had double the index weighting in continental Europe and triple the weighting in the then fashionable, but subsequently dangerous, Pacific basin markets (excluding Japan). The Pacific ex Japan index has fallen by 22 per cent this year, expressed in terms of sterling. In calendar 1993 the average UK pension fund's overseas equity portfolio outperformed the World ex UK index by an extraordinary 14 percentage points. But the strategy was extremely risky and it looks as though 5 points have been given straight back again in underperformance so far this year. The pendulum swings quickly these days. However, fund managers have been scrambling to rebalance their positions. According to end-March data, about 1 per cent of UK pension fund portfolios had been shifted out of the Pacific basin into Japan by that time. But part of that shift can be explained simply by the impact of relative price movements on unchanged portfolios; and the heavy exposure to underperforming Europe apparently remains entirely intact. The turnaround highlights the dangers of a volatile global market in which individual country indices are pushed and pulled by huge portfolio flows. This year's Japanese strength, after all, has been fuelled by foreign buying. All the same, the overall resistance of the global stock market in 1994 so far is quite impressive, given the universal weakness of the bond markets: even in Japan 10-year government bond yields are up by 120 basis points this year, and the rise in other countries has often been more than 200 basis points. In fact, Roger Nightingale, global strategist at W. I. Carr,is currently arguing that the overall stability of equities is an indication that fashionable theories about a global liquidity crunch or capital shortage are misplaced: there is only the unwinding of last year's speculative excesses. However, a time lag between the responses of bonds and equities to cyclical changes is quite normal: in several major countries equities are being supported by expectations of rising corporate earnings, offsetting the impact of the rising level of real interest rates. It remains very possible that the retreat towards safety that has dominated international equity patterns this year will fail to continue to sustain the two big national markets as the global economic cycle continues to swing upwards. Meanwhile, global managers will conclude that their tactical switching must be much more active if they are to retain the transitory gains from their aggressive strategies.</p>

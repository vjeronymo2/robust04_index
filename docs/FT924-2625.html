			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Lonrho - Rowland's Exit: A secretive tycoon heads for the final handshake - Barry Riley examines Tiny Rowland's track record IT IS 31 years since Roland 'Tiny' Rowland was recruited by Mr Angus Ogilvy, then an executive of Harley Drayton's 117 Old Broad Street group, while on a visit to Rhodesia to sort out the troubles of a minor offshoot called London Rhodesian Mining &amp; Land. Soon Mr Rowland, a then-unknown Rhodesian farmer of German extraction, had moved to London as boss of Lonrho. Almost from the beginning he has left a trail of controversy, with controversial takeover bids, eccentric obsessions and repeated insults to the British financial establishment. Mr Rowland's greatest financial achievements came in the early years as he built up the company during the bull markets of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Relative to the UK equity market the Lonrho share price hit a peak in 1974. But it fell out of favour in the late 1970s and traded sideways during the 1980s. As Mr Rowland aged the company appeared to lose strategic direction and during the past two years the share price has slumped because of rising debts, sliding profits and slashed dividends. His first major clash with the authorities came in 1973 when eight directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, resigned over Mr Rowland's cavalier management style, including his presentation of a Pounds 307,471 expenses claim (worth nearly Pounds 2m at 1992 prices). The affairs of Lonrho were famously described by the then prime minister Edward Heath as 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. After a probe by Department of Trade Inspectors Mr Rowland was censured for misuse of company funds and was judged to deserve 'severe criticism' for his conduct. Criticism was also directed against Mr Ogilvy, who resigned as a director. Nevertheless Mr Rowland carried on, seeking shelter from well-connected politicians. Tiny Rowland has repeatedly thumbed his nose at the British establishment, doing deals with the likes of President Gaddafi of Libya. He has adopted an extravagant tycoon lifestyle, with a suitcase permanently packed, and a pilot on standby to fly him in the corporate Gulfstream jet to whichever African capital catches his fancy. He does not take opposition lightly. There have been famous campaigns against the Fayed family from Egypt and their alleged backer, the Sultan of Brunei, and against the Australian Mr Alan Bond, who in 1988 had the effrontery to try to take Lonrho over, but was repulsed by a 93-page Lonrho document which alleged that the Bond Corporation was financially unsound. Indeed, Bond later went bankrupt. Mr Rowland accumulated mines, plantations, hotels, car distributors, the Observer newspaper, the Wankel rotary engine and much, much more besides in his corporate empire. But the greatest prize, Harrods, the famous Knightsbridge department store, slipped through his grasp despite his tireless feud against the Fayeds who snatched control of it from under his nose. A Department of Trade and Industry inquiry eventually proved that the Fayeds had lied in their takeover documents but the department refused to take action in favour of the man who had presented the 'unacceptable face of capitalism' some 15 years earlier. Tiny Rowland generated endless newspaper copy, but in many of his business dealings he was notoriously secretive. While concepts of corporate governance evolved towards openness and participation in boardroom dealings by independent non-executive directors, he continued to stand for the autocratic rule of the old-fashioned company boss. Investment institutions mostly shunned Lonrho, but thousands of small investors were attracted by Mr Rowland's charisma and the high dividends he paid out. Now, however, those dividends have dwindled badly, the company appears to be in a mess, and Mr Rowland's final gesture to his supporters is to negotiate a deal which is specially favourable to himself as he heads for the exit.</p>

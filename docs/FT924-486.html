			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Skiing: Leadville, living on a legend - Arnold Wilson visits an old mining town which is finding new ways to survive Christmas Eve, 1881. Leadville, Colorado. 'WITH HUGE spruce logs crackling in the fire-place, the scene presented on this eve of the gladsome Christmas is far from dispiriting. Carroll, warn out from the day's work, is asleep in his bunk, doubtless dreaming of the yule log and mistletoe, and fat stockings and plum pudding. Summers and Temple are enjoying a game of cards called 'hunky-punky' over there by the fire, and I am not so sure but that their thoughts also are far away, mingling unconsciously with those of loved ones in distant New England homes.' Albert Morrison, a young prospector started this letter to his impoverished mother and fiancee, Charlotte, in New York State. 'As tomorrow will be Christmas Day,' he wrote, 'I will have plenty of time to complete this letter . . .' But the letter never was finished. At one minute after midnight, the shack shared by four prospectors was enveloped by a snow-slide leaving the men frozen as in a tableau of life, with Albert's hand still holding his pen. The scene later described by a rescue party provided an enduring myth for the highest skiing town in the US. Some 101 years later, it is a freezing night in Leadville - sometimes known as the 'city in the clouds'. Ski lift operators from the local resort of Ski Cooper and further afield at Copper Mountain, Breckenridge and Keystone have returned to their homes for the night. The ornate, relic-filled and slightly kitsch Silver Dollar Saloon has emptied on to a street corner. And Attorney Neil V. Reynolds, the local judge, puts his Holmesian pipe down and picks up a microphone. 'Ladies and gentleman,' he announces. 'We have just heard that Santa Claus has arrived in Leadville]' There are cheers from a smallish crowd of children and parents who have assembled on the sidewalk outside the white courthouse - all exhaling dragon's breath as the temperature dives in the town which is perched at 10,150 ft beneath Colorado's highest peaks: Mount Elbert and Mount Massive. Leadville's Christmas tree - a mere 12ft high - is about to be illuminated. There is a NASA-style countdown to the big moment. 'Five-four-three-two-one-ZERO]' It is a small flicker for mankind as a score of tiny - almost pathetic - fairy lights are switched on. The little tree does not exactly light up the sky. But it is symbolic of a special town. A town that has twice been left for dead. And twice refused to die. Leadville - past residents included Jesse James, Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp  -is one of Colorado's oldest mining centres. In 1893, when along with other old mining towns which were later to become famous ski resorts, such as Aspen, Telluride, Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Park City and Alta, Leadville had its heart torn out by a government decision to end the silver standard. The boom years of silver were over. Christmasses in Leadville became bleak: if they were lucky, children received an orange, a stocking full of candy, a brief chat with Santa Claus and a visit to the Dreamland or Empire Theatre to see the latest film. While Breckenridge became an official ghost town, with a population of just seven, and the other mining towns struggled for survival, the mining community at Leadville picked themselves up and started again with a different quarry: molybdenum, used as a strengthening agent in steels. Molybdenum was certainly a strengthening agent for Leadville. The town thrived again, until almost exactly a century after the silver crash, competition from Russia and South Africa, where molybdenum could be produced more cheaply, brought the town's second mining era to a close. Today there are still working mines dotted around Colorado, but unlike the good old bad old days, they are now run by small groups of amateurs, or so highly mechanised that they no longer provide much employment for Leadville's close-knit, hardy populace. What makes Leadville tick and survive today is skiing in winter - and tourism in summer. Ski Cooper is a fairly small, hillbilly ski area seven miles from Leadville. At Chicago Ridge, there is some excellent snowcat skiing on runs such as Leaning Tree Drop-off, Heavenly Traverse, Tree Shots, Middle Earth and Buckeye Trees. Richard 'Rocket' Mathews drives the cat and Stu Schaefer guides (they exchange roles from time to time.) The resort, where troops of Colorado's celebrated 10th Mountain Division trained during the war, is ideal for families with its moderately gentle terrain. Apart from weekends, the trails are empty. So with the once-celebrated mines in California Gulch long since fallen silent, there are few options for those seeking employment. One is working in the resorts of Copper, Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin. There is a housing shortage in those resorts which brings pressure to live out of town. Leadville, where housing is much cheaper since the mining boom went bust, is an obvious choice. So daily, mountain staff have to make the cold and sometimes dangerous journey to and from work. Sometimes the road is blocked by snow. But however hazardous such commuting may be, nothing compares with the regular tragedies experienced down the mines. In one seven-month period during May, 1880, 26 miners were killed and almost 50 seriously injured in accidents. Of these 62 per cent were 'shaft-related', 26 per cent were caused by mishandled or faulty explosives, four per cent by cave-ins and rock-falls, four per cent by fumes, fire and suffocation and a final four per cent by drowning or crushing. But the death of Albert Morrison and his friends was perhaps the saddest. Santa Claus arrives in Leadville this month in a glistening, new fire engine on which is inscribed: 'Leadville and Lake County Fire &amp; Rescue'. Under the red costume and white beard is Jim O'Neil, who is 75 and has been playing the role for decades. Like almost every other elderly man in Leadville, he used to work at a local mine. 'Now give a big welcome to Santa Claus,' says Judge Reynolds. Leadville is still searching for its role in the 21st century. With such resilient folk, Leadville will probably get by for the time being with skiing and tourism. But if you ask Reynolds what the citizens of Leadville will do in the long term, now that the mining era is over, he says: 'We haven't decided yet.'</p>

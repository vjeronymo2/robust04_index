			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Seeboard jumps 17% to Pounds 132m - Cost reductions seen as main engine behind future profits growth A cost cutting drive helped Seeboard, the regional electricity company for the south-east of England, lift pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 by 17 per cent, from Pounds 112.7m to Pounds 131.7m, on turnover steady at Pounds 1.22bn. A proposed final of 8.45p raises the total dividend by 17.5 per cent to 11.75p - the largest increase yet seen in the electricity results season. Earnings per share were 37.8p (31p). This strong showing, combined with a bullish statement from Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, and a share buy-back proposal, helped boost the share price by 11p to 316p. All areas of the business had advanced, said Sir Keith. The electricity distribution business produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 101.1m (Pounds 91.9m); profit from supply activities increased from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 14.5m; gas supply, retailing and contracting all contributed a small profit. The result was helped by the cost-cutting drive launched last year. The company shed more than 900 people and expects to reduce numbers by between 200 and 250 in each of the next three years. Cost reduction is seen as the main engine for profit growth in the near future. The dividend was 'just right for Seeboard' said Sir Keith, and was not a signal that it was in a race with other electricity companies. Despite the dividend increase, cover went up from 3.1 to 3.2. Sir Keith said this could come down, but the company stood by its policy of giving shareholders 'attractive dividend growth'. 'Anyone invested in Seeboard should assume that there are good prospects for the future,' he said. Seeboard will be seeking shareholders' approval to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares. Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, said this represented the best use of shareholders' money. Although Seeboard was looking for expansion opportunities, it intended to take a cautious approach. The review of distribution prices now being undertaken by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, would lead to tougher price controls, said Sir Keith. Seeboard had asked him to take account of the cost savings that electricity companies had already made when setting their price formulas. COMMENT Seeboard is beginning to reap the benefits of the cost cutting exercise it launched last year, and the share buy-back is one of the ideas it has for using the proceeds. But in the longer term, Seeboard will have to find more conventional ways of expanding the business if it does not want to end up bulging with cash. The distribution price review will determine more precisely how much cash Seeboard will have, but the company is strong enough to handle a regulatory tightening. Meanwhile, the chairman's statement that it will not rush into 'madcap ventures' is reassuring. Assuming 16 per cent dividend growth this year, the shares are on a yield of 5.4 per cent, which is one of the strongest in the sector.</p>

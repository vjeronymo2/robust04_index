			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tadashi Ikeda, former director general of the </F> Asian Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs]    [Text] We need to avoid discussing Asia ignoring the  diversity of the region and contrasting it with what is  non-Asia. How should Japanese foreign policy develop in the Asia  Pacific regions, which includes Asian countries, North America,  and Australia?  <H5>  Diversity of Asia </H5>   Recently there have been attempts to reconsider Asia as one  unified area sharing common "traditions" and "values." Strange  terms, such as "identity" of Asia, are often being used. As the  background to this trend, we can point out the recent remarkable  economic development in some nations in eastern Asia, and the  confidence these nations have begun to possess in their ability  to build a nation.    This attempt to positively understand Asia's characteristics  should be welcomed, and we should not get upset about it. If  indeed a common culture and value can be found throughout Asia  and this helps Asia to be unified, there is no argument against  it.    The people who attempt to do this, for example, list as the  characteristics of Asian nations--it seems that they are talking  about Eastern Asia--people's diligence and labor ethics, which  are based on the cultures influenced by Confucianism, decorum  and norms, such as benevolence and justice, frugal spirit, high  rate of savings, and inclination to accept Japanese-style  management. They say that some of these common cultures and  values contribute to the fact that Asia's economy has the  highest growth rate in the world.    These arguments make me think that they are in too much of a  hurry to come to a conclusion and are trying to find Asia as one  united region. I feel that there are two pitfalls which they may  fall into in this approach. One is that they may completely  ignore the Asian region's diversity, and escape to the ideal  land of the simplified "Asia is one." The other pitfall is that  by viewing Asia from the standpoint of "Asia versus non-Asia,"  the relationship between Asia and the other regions tends to be  viewed as a competition.    Thailand, where I had worked until a year and a half ago, is  located on the Indochina peninsula. Their culture, including  their religion (Jozabu Buddhism) and dancing, came from India.  However, the Chinese who immigrated later planted their roots in  Thai society, and they interbred with the Thai. Today, the word  "kakyo (overseas Chinese)" has lost its original meaning. In  today's Thailand, because things that were originally from India  or China have been completely absorbed into Thai society, it is  almost meaningless to search for things Indian or things  Chinese. Though influenced by both India and China, as the word  "Indochina" suggests, this country has succeeded in creating its  own culture and value system which cannot be called anything  other than Thai through their unique language. Therefore,  reasoning such as "the Thai people's work ethic has been  influenced by the Chinese who brought Confucianism, which values  diligence," does not explain Thailand's high economic growth of  today. Instead, in order to explain the recent economic  prosperity of Thailand, we need to look for the causes of  success in the areas of the stable political situation,  high-quality bureaucracy, consistent policy of installing  foreign capital, and quality labor.    In Vietnam, which is also located on the Indochina  peninsula,  the leaders are getting ready to devote themselves to  "nation-building" after the end of the Cambodian conflict.  Vietnam had been completely left behind by the ASEAN countries,  such as Thailand, in economic development. While being strongly  influenced by the Chinese culture historically, Vietnam has  repeatedly experienced militaristic conflicts with China. This  nation has had a love-hate relationship with China. In Vietnam,  which embraces Mahayanist Buddhism and belongs to the "cultural  area of chopsticks," it is possible to find the influence of  Confucianism in their diligence and their work ethics. At any  rate, the prospect is bright concerning their nation-building.    Very few people predicted the position of today's Myanmar  [Burma] located to the west of Thailand. Burma is settling for  being a "developing country." For the people in this country,  who are pious Buddhists, political stability, liberation, and  democratization seem to be the first problems to be dealt with,  before discussing economic development.    The reason why I have taken these three countries in  Indochina as examples was merely to describe the diversity of  Asia. The diversity will be even more evident if I mention the  cultures, religions, and societies of Cambodia and Laos. While  being located on or close to the Indochina peninsula, the  religions, traditions, and cultures differ greatly. And in some  countries, colonization by foreign countries has further  increased the difference.    There exists a big cultural and religious gap even among the  nations in Indochina, which seem to be homogeneous. It is not  easy to discuss traditional cultures and values as something  shared in common throughout Asia. Before we discuss Asia's  common identity, we, including myself, need to ask ourselves how  much we understand the real situations of other Asian countries.    Also, by stressing too much Asia's common characteristics  and  values, there is a tendency to view Asia's relationship with the  rest of the world in terms of "Asia versus non-Asia"--you may  call this Asianism. We need to be careful about this. It would  be too short-sighted to think that Japan should value its  relationship with Asian countries rather than its relationship  with the United States or Europe, faced with the movement in the  United States and Europe to integrate regional economies  (formation of EC, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement],  etc.)  <H5>  Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region </H5>   I do recognize the importance of Asia in our country's  foreign policy. And I do not deny the significance of regional  cooperation based on one region. But in achieving this, it would  be more appropriate to view Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia,  North America, and Australia as one Asia-Pacific region (in the  future, Southwest Asia may be included in this cooperative  framework), instead of viewing Asia as one fixed unit.    The reason for this is that more and more countries of the  Asia Pacific are recognizing that they do share some of the same  problems and goals. Suppose that Asian countries would form some  type of group by themselves. It should be the kind of  organization that would support and reinforce the existing  global framework or the whole Asia-Pacific framework.  Narrow-minded "Asianism" may be interpreted as the solidarity  and interests of nonwhite nations, and will not be desirable in  light of Japan's relationship with other Asian countries in  World War II.    Thus Japan's policy toward Asia should not be considered  separately from its U.S. and European policy, as if we were to  choose between the two. It should be discussed as a part of the  policy toward the Asia-Pacific region, and in relation to  growing global interdependence.    There are many opportunities for dialogue and cooperation  for  the countries of the Asia Pacific, and in recent years, the  importance of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is  increasing. APEC is a still young organization, started in 1989  by Australia's proposal. However, it has held five annual  minister-level conferences, and has been discussing the region's  deregulation of trade/investment, and economic trends.    Last November, APEC's informal summit meeting was held on  the  Blake Island off the coast of Seattle. For the first time, 14  leaders from the Asia-Pacific region gathered for this historic  meeting and discussed the economic trend of this region and the  world and trade investment issues, and voted for the declaration  concerning this region's economic prospect. This year, APEC's  second summit meeting is planned in Indonesia.    As an attempt at regional economic cooperation by Asian  countries, there is an idea for EAEC (East Asia Economic Caucus)  advocated by Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia. When this plan  was first proposed, it was called EAEG (East Asia Economic  Group). Back then the object of the plan was supposed to be to  create opportunities for conference (discussion) among the  nations of East Asia, and as the next step, to form a new  organization to reinforce the trade and economic links between  these countries.    When this plan was proposed, the Uruguay Round negotiations  were stalled, and some thought that this plan was to establish  an "economic bloc" by Eastern Asia alone. At the same time,  several countries pointed out that the contents of this plan  were not clear enough. The Bush administration of the United  States strongly opposed the plan, saying that "there is a  possibility that this plan may divide the Pacific."    Since then, there have been repeated discussions within  ASEAN, and the EAEC plan seems to have changed substantially in  its characteristics. Nowadays, EAEC is basically a place for  participants to discuss whatever subject they are interested in  and is one conference group in the framework of APEC.    Japan has been cautious about EAEC, because the purpose of  the organization and the detail of its concrete mechanism were  not clear. However, as I mentioned before, the recent agreement  in the Uruguay Round, the formation of NAFTA, realization of  APEC's conference in Seattle, in addition to the progress of  discussion within ASEAN, the situation concerning EAEC is  definitely changing. Under these circumstances, it is time for  Japan to reconsider EAEC, including whether to participate in it  or not.    However, the following will be the prerequisites: 1) EAEC  will not lead to formation of an economic bloc, and its purpose  will be "open cooperation" in accordance with the principles of  GATT; 2) its relationship with APEC will be clarified, and its  activities should be easily understood by the members of APEC;  3) it will not interfere with the U.S. participation (influence)  in the Asia Pacific, and will give careful consideration to  Australia's position.  <H5>  Security and Japan-U.S.-China Relationship </H5>   The environment concerning the security of the Asia Pacific  is diverse and complex. Each country in this region has a  different threat. Therefore, traditionally, their interests in  security have been on a subregional basis, such as that of the  Korean peninsula and Cambodia. This is why there has not been  establishment of an organization encompassing the whole region  as in Europe.    However, since the end of the cold war, there has been  finally an increasing interest in discussing the security of the  whole region. The "ASEAN Regional Forum" starting this year,  which is a meeting held for the whole region, will include all  the main players in the region, such as the United States,  China, Russia, Japan, ASEAN, Australia, Korea, and Vietnam.    The following are Japan's main policies concerning the  security issue in the Asia-Pacific region.    1. To maintain the presence of the U.S. military, which is  the primary factor for the region's stabilization. And to  maintain the Japan-U.S. security system, which is pivotal to the  presence of the U.S. military.    2. To devise a solution concerning individual conflicts,  such  as the ones in the Korean peninsula, Cambodia, and the South  China Sea, through the framework of the countries concerned.  Today, the problem of North Korea's (Democratic People's  Republic of Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons, is  the greatest cause of instability in the Asia-Pacific region.    3. To promote political and security talks for the whole  region, in order to increase the sense of security and  understanding of the policies between the nations. It is a  welcome development that the talks on politics and security have  begun to take place in the ASEAN expanded foreign ministers  conference, and the "ASEAN Regional Forum" is starting this  year, both according to Japan's suggestion.    4. To invest in improvement of the security environment by  promoting economic development of each country.    The common issues shared by the countries of the Asia  Pacific  concerning security after the end of the cold war can be  summarized as follows: 1) How will the U.S. military presence  affect in the future? 2) What direction will China's military  capacity take? 3) What role will Japan play in this area in the  future? And the countries in the region are closely watching how  the relationship of Japan, the United States, and China will  progress.    Many think that "the relationship of Japan, the United  States, and China is so-called zero-sum." These people think  that if the U.S.-China relationship takes a favorable turn,  Japan-U.S. relationship will cool off, and if the former cools  off, then the latter will take a favorable turn. It is true that  until the end of the cold war, such an aspect existed in the  relationship of these three countries.    However, looking back at the hundred-year history of the  relationship of the three countries, it is also true that the  recent 20 years have been the only period in which the  relationship between Japan and China was basically good. The  recent relationship of the three countries is an unprecedented  situation, and I personally think that we should not look at  this relationship as "zero-sum."    In other words, when the Japan-China relationship is  basically good, the United States can develop its relationship  with each of the two at the same time, and this will be  profitable for the United States. Thus, it seems that it is an  important task for the three nations to make their relationship  "positive-sum."    At present, Japan and the United States share basic values,  such as freedom, democracy, and a market economy system, and  maintain an alliance relationship in security and a strong  interdependent economic relationship. Most countries in the Asia  Pacific strongly desire that this favorable relationship between  Japan and the United States be maintained for the sake of their  own security and prosperity.    On the other hand, concerning Japan-China relations, both  countries are aiming to establish a more mature relationship.  The relationship between the two has been generally good since  the normalization of diplomatic relations. For Japan,  maintaining and developing our friendship with China is a key  point in its foreign policy. Japan has been cooperating as much  as possible to China's modernization, according to its belief  that China's continued reform and open-door policies will help  the region's security and prosperity. Also, Japan thinks that it  is important for China to deal constructively with the  frameworks of multiple countries (for example, NPT [nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control  Regime] and GATT).    Furthermore, Japan strongly hopes that the objectives and  contents of China's policies concerning its military  modernization will become clearer. Continued discussion on  security between Japan and China and China's participation in  the "ASEAN Regional Forum" to discuss politics and security in  the whole region will contribute greatly to building trust and a  sense of security among the countries of this region.    As for the U.S.-China relationship, both countries have been  trying to improve the relationship since the Tiananmen Square  incident, each recognizing the importance of the other. However,  problems remain to be dealt with, such as China's human rights  policy, the nonproliferation issue, and the trade imbalance  between the two countries. Among these issues, the greatest  pending problem is the human rights issue.    Improvement of the U.S.-China relationship will benefit  Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, and Japan should not  withhold its effort in helping them better their relationship.  Here, too, Japan's course should not be "choosing between the  two," the United States or Asia--in this case, China.  <H5>  Human Rights and Japan's Asian Policy </H5>   In the Asia Pacific, the interests and policies of the  developed countries, such as the United States and Australia,  and those of the developing countries do not always agree.  Reaction to the human rights issue is a typical example.    Japan often finds itself "caught in between" the developed  nations and the developing nations concerning the human rights  issue in Asia. However, that's a matter of opinion. Viewed from  another angle, in this very type of issue, Japan, which places  itself in the category of developed industrial and democratic  nations, while being a member in the Asian community, may be  able to play a unique diplomatic role.    In the human rights argument, developed nations insist on  the  universal human rights protection of individuals, regardless of  the degree of economic development. On the other hand, the  developing nations generally insist on considering each  country's political/social situations and degree of economic  development in protecting human rights. Also, the developing  nations' position is that the human rights issue is a domestic  issue which concerns sovereignty.    The summary of Japan's basic opinion is as follows: 1) Human  rights is not a value that only the Western nations possess. It  is universal. Therefore, human rights is an important factor in  diplomacy. 2) However, concerning diplomatic effort in  protection and expansion of human rights, it is appropriate to  take the most practical and realistic approach, through  understanding individual countries' situations, and the  confronting approach may not always be effective.    With this point of view, Japan has had its own unique  policies toward China after the Tienanmen Square incident,  Indonesia after the East Timor incident in 1992, and the current  Burma. (The approaches the countries of the West take do not  always agree either.)    These policies do not mean that Japan sides with some of the  developing countries that insist that human rights is a domestic  issue which concerns each country's sovereignty. Neither do they  mean that Japan agrees to the argument that the "rights" of  political stability and economic development should have  priority over civil and political rights.    While Japan understands to a certain degree why there are  such opinions as these, our position is that ceaseless effort is  necessary to improve these situations, and fixation of the  current situation or regression should not be allowed.    However, at the same time, in discussing the human rights  issue in the developing nations, we must carefully consider  social and political factors of these countries, such as whether  there exists a large middle class, whether economic stability  and development are maintained, and whether there exist  political groups which protect freedom of speech and human  rights.    Considering that it took a long time in the Western nations  for these factors to be achieved, it may not be very realistic  to demand and pressure the developing countries to have the same  degree of human rights protection as in the developed countries.  <H5>  Problem Concerning the Past </H5>   When discussing Japan's Asian policy, we cannot avoid our  "problem of the past" concerning Japan's actions before World  War II. Unfortunately, there still are some countries in Asia  which suspect that Japan has not fully repented of its past  actions.    Prime Minister Hosokawa called World War II "a war of  aggression," and he also stated that "we regret it deeply and  apologize from the bottom of our heart" referring to Japan's  colonization of Korea in the past. Asian countries, including  Korea, responded favorably, saying that his statement showed  that Japan was looking at its past truthfully.    On the other hand, the series of prime minister's statements  stirred up discussions about Japan's postwar conduct.    However, Japan has fulfilled its responsibilities, such as  reparation, constantly and sincerely despite the difficult  situation after the war, according to the San Francisco Peace  Treaty and related bilateral treaties, and except for special  cases, such as Taiwan and North Korea, Japan has settled the  "postwar conduct issue" with each involved government.    As for the comfort women issue, the Japanese Government is  seriously discussing how to express our feelings about it  because of the uniqueness of the problem in which "women's honor  and dignity were injured."    In order for Japan to put "past" problems behind and to  develop relationships with our neighboring countries with  prospect for the future, there are two things that are  especially important for Japanese people.    One is that some measures should be taken in order to help  the younger Japanese generation to better know and understand  history. In recent years, there has been substantial improvement  in the contents of school textbooks. However, to see this in an  actual classroom environment, there should be more improvement  in textbook content, such allocating more time to modern  history. At the same time, I hope that these improvements in  Japan will be understood and explained in foreign countries,  including Asian countries.    The other is that we need to express our resolution not to  repeat the same mistakes, not just by words, but by concrete  actions.    In relation to this, dispatch of Japan's Self-Defense Forces  for PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] activities in Cambodia was  an epochal event in Japan's foreign policy. The bill for this  deployment met strong criticism domestically, and some Asian  countries criticized and feared that it might move Japan toward  becoming a militaristic giant. However, the fact that Japanese  PKO personnel truly contributed to Cambodia's peacekeeping  despite many difficulties and at the sacrifice of lives, was  enough to wipe away these criticisms and fear. These days, all  Asian countries without exception understand that Japan's PKO  activities in Cambodia were that of a responsible member of  international society, and value them highly.    Thus, in order to wipe away the "past problem" image, Japan  must show concrete actions one by one. This is a very  time-consuming process. However, in order to overcome the  negative inheritance of the past, there is no other way.    However, we should not hate ourselves for our past problem.  The Asian countries' view of Japan is definitely changing with  time.    At the same time, the hope these countries have in Japan is  only expanding. There is no sign of its decreasing. The most  critical issue for the relationship between Japan and the rest  of Asia is how Japan will respond positively to meet their  expectations.    The role Japanese economy played in the recent economic  development of East Asia, the effect Japanese economic  cooperation (ODA [official development assistance] grants) is  having on these countries in improvement of infrastructure and  public welfare, Japan's positive diplomatic participation and  its role in political security (especially activities concerning  peacekeeping in Cambodia and the situation in the Korean  peninsula), the role the Japan-U.S. mutual security structure  still plays in the stability of the Asia Pacific, etc., are  major examples of Japan's positive involvement and its role. And  the most effective way for Japan to meet the expectation of the  Asian countries would be to deepen and expand these involvements  and roles.</p>

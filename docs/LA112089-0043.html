			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES;  </P> <P> SOUTH'S REFERENDUM HEADED FOR DEFEAT  </P> <P> A ballot proposal to establish an autonomous Muslim region with limited  self-rule in the southern Philippines appeared headed for defeat. Early results  in 13 provinces and nine cities indicated a strong rejection of the referendum.  Full results are not expected for several days. A low voter turnout was  reported, prompting a claim of victory by the Muslim separatist Moro National  Liberation Front, which had urged a boycott of the balloting. Defeat would mark  the first election setback for Corazon Aquino's government since it came to  power in 1986. It would dim chances of settling a Muslim separatist revolt that  has long divided the south, where more than 5 million Christians form a  majority over 3.5 million Muslims.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] 'Adil 'Awad Siyam Shulah, notorious terrorist  and one of the top leaders of the domestic branch of the  al-Jihad group, lay dead in a pool of blood following a brief  shootout on al-Bahr al-A'zam Street in al-Jizah on the night of  4 April. [passage omitted]    The slain terrorist was the deputy of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the  fugitive al-Jihad commander who lives abroad, and the group's  top man in charge of organization inside Egypt. As described by  a senior official in the security organs, he was the most senior  member inside the country and was worth a thousand ordinary  members.    It was Shulah who planned the attempted assassination of  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. He used to follow him daily  from his house to his Interior Ministry office so as to prepare  the plan well. It was Shulah who prepared the members who took  part in the ambush and the one who convinced one of those  involved in the crime to undertake the suicidal explosion,  blowing himself to pieces. 'Adil Siyam's control of his aides  was so awesome that he imprisoned Diya'-al-Din Dawud Mahmud  Hafiz, who later carried out the suicidal attack on the interior  minister, in a locked room for 30 consecutive hours to mentally  prepare him for the crime, only letting him out to perpetrate  the crime. It was Shulah who planned to attack Prime Minister  Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, assassinate Information Minister Safwat  al-Sharif, and UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his  visit to Egypt. His last crime was to plan the assassination of  the primary witness in Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's case. The witness was  killed when extremists shot him in the car showroom he owned in  Shibin al-Qanatir.    Notorious terrorist 'Adil lived in the al-Basatin quarter  but  moved between dozens of dens in al-Munib, the outskirts of  al-Qalyubiyah, al-Khankah, Shibin al-Qanatir, and the Bilbays  desert. He only held an intermediate trade certificate but  dressed elegantly and wore "RayBan" sunglasses and an elegant  leather jacket. He spent money freely and drove around in seven  different cars, all of them stolen.    In his various dens security men seized enough explosives to  blow up an entire city. In two apartments in al-Munib, they  seized police, officers, and garbage collectors' uniforms, which  he intended for his group members use when committing terrorist  crimes. Terrorist 'Adil Siyam's boldness even reached the extent  of preparing a number of his followers, dressed in municipal  workers' uniforms, to dig 12 metres across Salah Salim Street at  a specific spot, which was carefully chosen site for detonating  explosives in a major operation he was planning. The terrorists  wearing the municipal workers uniforms did in fact dig up the  street, lay down electricity cables, and connect them to a  secret hideout under the street which was to be the center for  detonating a explosive device to destroy any target that might  be using that road. Regrettably, no one noticed that those  digging up the road were terrorists and not municipal workers or  electricians.    The security men also seized an underground factory for  making explosives in the Bilbays desert. A long tunnel led to a  spacious hall, where the security men found a number of barrels  containing acid and chemicals that are used to make explosive  devices. They also seized 500 grenades that were ready for use.    The notorious terrorist was under the security men's close  observation for a long time. But they preferred to let him stay  free so as to capture all the members of the organization and  expose their plans and dens. The security organs did in fact  arrest 32 persons, including seven hardened criminals who were  being prepared to carry out suicidal operations similar to the  attempt to assassinate Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. The  security organs also discovered the means and ways by which  these groups were financed from abroad. Most of the remittances  that 'Adil Siyam received came from Palermo, capital of the  Italian island of Sicily, to an Egyptian bank. The security  organs monitored their account numbers and balances. The  remittances that this terrorist received from Palermo alone in  the last five weeks totalled $14,000, 4,000 pounds Sterling, and  a few thousand Egyptian pounds, all of which was seized in his  dens.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The three terrorists killed in Hebron approximately  10 days ago were involved in the murders of several Israelis in  the territories. An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman  reported that ballistic examinations of their weapons prove that  the three men participated in the murders of Efrayim Ayubi,  Shalom and Mordekhay Lapid, Me'ir Mendelovich, and Eliyahu  Levin. They also participated in other terrorist attacks in  which three Israeli citizens and six soldiers were wounded.    An Arab youth was captured this afternoon at the entrance to  the Cave of the Patriarchs in possession of a knife, a  switchblade knife, and a leaflet calling for revenge against the  Jews. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the youth  confessed he had planned to stab Jews.    Last night, the security forces discovered an arms cache  containing a Kalashnikov rifle, a handgun, and a large quantity  of ammunition, in Gaza city, near the home of a local resident,  who is a Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that the man was detained for  questioning.</p>

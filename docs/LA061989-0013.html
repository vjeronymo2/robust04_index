			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY PLANNING  </P> <P> Child abuse, abandonment, school dropouts, teen-age pregnancies, gangs, drugs  and prisons are so often the results of being "unwanted children." This is a  well-documented fact. Working mostly with Hispanic women in a family planning  clinic, I am hearing the recent and desperate concern of "what will we do  without the help of this clinic."  </P> <P> I strongly plead with the governor to restore these much-needed funds for  family planning, which ultimately benefit us all.  </P> <P> EVA L.

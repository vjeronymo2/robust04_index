Meanwhile, senior  police officials warned that bombings may become fashionable  again, especially in the deep South.    Police stepped up strict security measures in public areas  in  Hat Yai and there were also security alerts in Pattani, Songkhla  and Narathiwat said Pol Lt Gen Michai Nukunkhit, assistant  police chief overseeing the southern region.    More than 10 department stores in Hat Yai sought police  protection yesterday. Police commandos patrolled the town's  airport and conducted a bomb disposal rehearsal.    Most shoppers shunned the normally bustling main shopping  spot where the blast injured seven people Sunday. Sawai Na  Phatthalung, chairman of Songkhla's tourism business  association, said the bomb "has the biggest impact" on Hat Yai's  tourism.    "It's worrisome that planting a bomb in a crowded public  area  may become fashionable again," said Pol Lt Gen Michai.    A letter purportedly from the Pattani Liberation United  Organization (Pulo) was found yesterday in Hat Yai, claiming  responsibility for the downtown bomb attack.    Hat Yai police chief Pol Lt Col Khamronwit Thupkhrachang  said  the group called in the letter for the immediate release of four  arson suspects arrested for having allegedly set fire to  southern schools in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat in August last  year.    The letter, written in the southern Yawi dialect, was found  inserted in the door of a car parked 20 metres from the blast  site. It was handed over to police by the car's owner,  Khamronwit said.    The letter said the Pulo was not responsible for the arson  attacks on the schools.    "The group said it had no cause to attack the schools  because  Muslim children also studied there," the Hat Yai police chief  said.    On Sunday, two helicopter gunships and a command helicopter  made four raids on a separatist gathering on Yala's Kudong Hill.  The operation will continue for five to seven days.    Provincial bomb experts said ammonium nitrate and diesel oil  were believed to be components of the Hat Yai bomb. [passage  omitted]    Army Commander in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday  terrorism has become frequent in Thailand, probably because "we  are too friendly to tourists".    Wimon said the "friendliness", which stemmed from the need  to  promote tourism is resulting in security loopholes. "We  undoubtedly are good hosts. But this has provided a loophole  for foreigners with ill intentions to create trouble in our  country."</p>

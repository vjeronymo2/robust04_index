			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Li Yafei, deputy  secretary general of the mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that his association  will try its best to inform in detail its Taiwan counterparts on  the Qiandao Lake incident.    The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chun'an  County on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and  the robbery and murder of 32 tourists from Taiwan and the  mainland.    This morning, Li Yafei presided over a meeting at which the  mainland law experts informed a group sent by the Taiwan-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the relatives of the  victims of the incident who are from Taiwan.    Li said that he hopes that the two sides will take a truth-  seeking and truly objective and pragmatic attitude in the talks.    He noted that the mainland side should objectively inform  the  SEF group of the incident while the SEF group listens to the  report in a manner, which will be helpful to maintaining the  interests and rights of the people on the two sides.    He said that the mainland side promptly discovered the case  and dealt with it in a serious and responsible manner, which  showed great efforts in maintaining the interests of the people  across the Taiwan straits.    Only by promptly publishing the murders according to law  could condolences be expressed to relatives of the deceased from  Taiwan and the mainland.    He said that after the case was discovered, ARATS promptly  informed SEF about it.    On April 24, ARATS sent a message to SEF to invite SEF  officials and experts to come to Hangzhou to gain further  knowledge about the case.    He said that to meet the demands of the SEF visitors, ARATS  has arranged for them to go to Chun'an County to inspect the  murder, robbery and arson site on Qiandao Lake.</p>

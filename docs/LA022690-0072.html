			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS, YEN FALL SHARPLY IN TOKYO MARKETS;  </P> <P> PLUNGE: THE 4.5% LOSS IN SECURITIES AND THE JAPANESE CURRENCY DROP PROMPTED  FEARS THAT A "VICIOUS CYCLE" MIGHT BE STARTING.  </P> <P> The Tokyo stock market and the Japanese yen plunged today, prompting worries of  a "vicious cycle" in the securities and foreign exchange markets.  </P> <P> The market closed at 33,321.87, down 1,569.10 points, or 4.5%.  </P> <P> The key Nikkei index of 225 stocks had tumbled by 1,459.79 yen -- or 4.2% in  value -- to 33,432.18 by the end of morning trading.  </P> <P> Matters got worse in the afternoon as Tokyo share prices continued their rapid  descent. The Nikkei index at 1:46 p.m. in Japan was down 2,047.34 points, or  just over 6%, to 32,843.63. After the central bank of Japan started moving to  prop up the yen, the index bounced back to 33,128.18 by 2:42 p.m. for a decline  of more than 5% on the day.  </P> <P> If maintained at that level, the decline would have been the second biggest  ever in the Tokyo stock market, eclipsed only by the 3,836-point decline on  Oct. 20, 1987, when markets worldwide were plummeting. A day earlier, the Dow  Jones industrial average fell 508 points for its biggest decline ever.  </P> <P> The yen, meanwhile, plummeted to 148.50 to the dollar, a drop of 2.03 points,  or 1.4% below Friday's close. That is the lowest point for the yen in the past  5 1/2 months.  </P> <P> To keep the yen from falling even further, the Bank of Japan sold $1.3 billion  of U.S. currency, according to market sources quoted by Reuters news agency.  The Japanese central bank is concerned about keeping the dollar from rising  above the 149 yen, the sources said.  </P> <P> The troubles in the financial markets come amid mounting concerns over  worsening trade friction between the United States and Japan, expectations of  higher interest rates and uncertainty over the domestic political situation in  Japan.  </P> <P> The potential impact on the American stock market is uncertain, analysts said.  Although troubles in the Tokyo market last week caused major disruptions in  European exchanges, the U.S. stock market was only modestly affected.  </P> <P> Coming on top of two dramatic stock market declines last Wednesday and Friday,  the precipitous fall today spurred Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to  confess for the first time that he was "very worried." But he declared only  that he was carefully watching developments on both the stock and the foreign  exchange markets.  </P> <P> Hashimoto insisted that the "fundamentals" of Japan's economy remain sound. But  investors, he complained, are focusing on news reports of uncertainties in  political developments in Japan, where the ruling party won a convincing  victory in a lower house election Feb. 18, but lost control of the upper house  in an election for that chamber last July.  </P> <P> In addition, he added, investors are worried about the outcome of U.S.-Japan  negotiations on sensitive trade issues. Some analysts believe the two nations  are on a collision course.  </P> <P> Two days ago, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu accepted a surprise invitation from  President Bush to travel to Palm Springs on Friday and Saturday for an  emergency bilateral summit that is expected to focus on the so-called  Structural Impediments Initiative talks.  </P> <P> American trade negotiators argue that structural barriers in the Japanese  economic system are blocking a free flow of U.S. exports to Japan. Japanese  negotiators argue that American trade problems are largely of the United  States' own making, given its relatively low savings rate and high budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Mounting economic frictions have led to frequent criticism of Japan in the  United States. In Japan, there is growing resentment of what are viewed as  high-handed American demands.  </P> <P> Also likely to be discussed in the meeting between Bush and Kaifu are threats  of retaliation that the United States has made if Japan fails to open its  markets to forestry products, communications satellites and supercomputers.  </P> <P> Japanese government officials said privately that a "vicious cycle" had set in  which stock price declines depress the yen, and decreases in the yen's value  drive down stock prices.  </P> <P> Stock authorities were reported to be planning to ease terms of credit allowed  for stock purchases, and the Finance Ministry was purchasing government bonds  to raise their prices and keep interest rates on other instruments from rising  further.  </P> <P> At the end of morning trading on the stock exchange, about 15% of orders to  sell stock had not been matched up with orders to buy stock. Brokers confessed  that they were unable to predict how far prices might fall.  </P></p>

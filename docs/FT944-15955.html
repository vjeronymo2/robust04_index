			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets: The Soros way to sensible investing - Serious Money International speculator George Soros calls his theory reflexivity. The investor cannot make a totally objective assessment of markets, for his own views become one of the factors which influence future developments. A market consensus results in a bias, which can sometimes affect not just market prices but events in the outside world of fundamentals - which those market prices aim to reflect. So, the investor is not just shooting at a moving target - he is shooting at a target which is moving all the faster because he is chasing it. There is a double feedback mechanism at work. As Soros himself puts it: 'The stock market is generally believed to anticipate recessions; it would be more correct to say that it can help to precipitate them. Thus, I replace the assertion that the market is always right with two others: '1. Markets are always biased in one direction or another. '2. Markets can influence the events they anticipate.'* A neat example of reflexivity in action was last month's decision by chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George to increase base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent. The minutes of that meeting, published this week, make it clear that the attitude of financial markets played an important role in the decision. The chancellor noted that the markets were expecting interest rates to be raised sooner rather than later. He was concerned that if their expectations were not realised, markets could become more volatile and the eventual increase might need to be larger. George, who had proposed the increase, admitted there were arguments for delaying it but worried that such delay would increase the dangers - including financial market dangers. So, in the end, Clarke decided that an immediate increase in rates would be an act of prudent economic management. He added that moving rates then would keep the authorities in control, rather than being driven by the market. (Even chancellors need comforting illusions). The markets' expectations altered the course of events because of the influence they had on people with the power to fulfil those expectations. The base rate increase was premature. But an investor analysing the economic fundamentals correctly, and investing on the assumption that there would not be an early increase in rates, would have been wrong-footed. So, the intelligent investor needs to do more than consider the relevant fundamentals in any market. He needs also to weigh up the opinions of other influential investors and how people in the real world are likely to react to their perception of those opinions. If all this sounds hard, that is because it is. Soros himself once commented: 'I make as many mistakes as the next guy. Where I excel is at recognising my mistakes.' This week produced a couple of salutary reminders that equity investment is as much about risk as about reward. The first, described in detail on page V, comes from Russia. Emerging market fund managers, following Templeton's guru Mark Mobius, are eyeing Russia as the next honey-pot in the making. Barely was the ink dry on the first press reports of Mobius's enthusiasm, when the rouble plunged by a fifth - only to make up virtually all its lost ground two days later. Not quite like the home life of our own, dear Footsie. The other is a continuing horror story called Aerostructures Hamble. Floated on the UK market in June at 120p, it touched 21p yesterday after profit warning piled upon profit warning. A small lynch mob is prowling the City, furious that no details of the problems appeared in the prospectus. Remember Benjamin Graham's adage: 'Most new issues are sold under 'favourable' market conditions - which means favourable for the seller.' Guaranteed equity bonds - which combine a capital guarantee with some exposure to the stock market - are aimed mainly at building society investors (see page VII for some ongoing offers). So, why have they been made so complicated that the terms are hard even for professional advisers to assess? There is no easy way to pick out the best buys - the answer depends on your assumptions. All the bonds have slightly different minimum repayments; different percentages of your starting capital are linked to different multiples of FT-SE growth; some have a cap limiting the maximum return. What you get depends on your tax rate. And comparisons with other investments have to adjust for the fact that these bonds produce no income. Yet, they are being sold to people who are assumed to be stock market virgins. September's inflation figure - the lowest for 27 years - is good news for most. But not for pensioners. The September figure for the annual growth in the retail prices index (clocked at 2.2 per cent) is the one on which increases in state pensions and other benefits are based. Everybody's good news is somebody's bad news. * The Alchemy of Finance, by George Soros, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Lamb pleads guilty An old lady in New Mexico wins Dollars 2.9m damages after she spilt a cup of McDonald's coffee over herself, and a secretary in New York gets Dollars 7.1m for being sexually harassed by her boss. Now an Australian woman has been awarded ADollars 2.2m after being shot by a lamb. Anne Moulding, 29, was paralysed after she tried to lift the lamb into a truck and its foot kicked a loaded rifle and sent a bullet into her waist. A Sydney Supreme Court judge has ruled the property owner was negligent in failing to take basic precautions in the control of firearms. Heaven knows the size of the damages, if it had been proved that the shot was triggered by a ram rather than a ewe.</p>

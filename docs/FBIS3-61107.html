Weekly price change indices for consumer goods and services  in November of this year are characterized by the following data:                    2 Nov        9 Nov        16 Nov       23 Nov       30 Nov   Rate of price   103.2        103.1        103.4        102.9        102.2  growth for  basic goods  and services   including:   food products   103.0        102.8        103.4        103.1        102.0    nonfood         102.2        103.7        103.3        102.5        102.5  products   paid services   108.9        102.7        103.7        103.6        102.5  for the  populace      Price increases over the month for 70 main food products  amounted to 15.1 percent. By the end of the month, prices for  meat and meat products, sugar, flour, bread, and bakery products  had stabilized. At the same time, price increases during the  last week of the month for eggs, cereals, macaroni products, and  vegetables were maintained at the 4-6 percent level.    Potatoes, vegetables, and fruits increased in price by 5-8  percent in city markets the final week of November. Prices for  meat output remained virtually unchanged.    The increase in prices of nonfood products in November  amounted to 15 percent. The cost of fuel for the populace and  knitted wear increased by 2.5-2.8 percent, of footwear and  cultural and domestic commodities--by 1.5-1.8 percent. Most  noticeable at the end of the month was the increase in garment  prices--by 3.3 percent.    The increase in prices of paid services for the populace  this  past month significantly surpassed the overall dynamics of  consumer prices, amounting to 23.2 percent. Rates for dry  cleaning and bathhouse services increased by 6-8 percent over  the week. Rates for the remainder of services subject to regular  monitoring remained virtually unchanged the past week.  <H5>  Consumer Market Conditions </H5>   According to selective sampling data in the stores of  capitals of republics within the Russian Federation and okrug,  kray, and oblast centers, the saturation observed in stores in  November with respect to beef, sugar, butter, and sunflower oil  increased by 3-11 percent. With respect to milk, this index  decreased by 3 percent, eggs--by 10 percent.    As compared with the end of October of this year, the  saturation level at food stores increased in 39 cities (of 83  under observation), including by 3-17 percent in 36 cities and  25-30 percent in four (Vologda, Ryazan, Yaroslavl). The level  decreased in 32 cities, including by 3-8 percent in 20 cities,  and by 12-31 percent in 12. Stores in 12 cities remained at  their previous level of saturation with respect to food products.    Data (in percentages) characterizing the market situation  with respect to basic food items as of 29 November of this year  are as follows:                   Proportion of the total number of cities under observation                 where the product                  could be       could be          was not        was not                 purchased      purchased after   available      available for                 freely         standing in       for sale       sale as of 1                 without        line or upon                     November (for                 standing in    presentation of                  reference)                 line           coupons   Beef           30             5                 65             67   Cooked         83             -                 17             13  sausage   Milk           66             5                 29             26   Butter         78             3                 19             8   Eggs           65             2                 33             25   Sunflower      43             5                 52             63  oil   Sugar          71             5                 24             31      The situation in the market of nonfood products in everyday  demand is as follows: washing machine detergent was unavailable  in the stores of 57 percent of cities, toilet soap in 47  percent, toothpaste in 40 percent. Sales of toilet soap and  toothpaste over the past week diminished by 5 and 15 percent,  respectively. Sales of washing machine detergent rose by 17  percent. In Bryansk, Kaluga, Elista, Groznyy, Novosibirsk,  Tyumen, Abakan, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the saturation  coefficient with respect to these items was 1.3-1.7, as opposed  to 2.4 across Russia on the average. In Kyzyl, Magadan, Aginsk  (Aginsk Autonomous Oblast), and Ust-Ordynsk (Ust-Ordynsk  Autonomous Oblast), these products were entirely unavailable for  sale.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Formation of seed stocks is under way at agricultural  enterprises. By the beginning of November, 10.0 million tonnes  of spring grains and leguminous crops were on hand (96 percent  of requirement). As was the case last year, the great shortage  of soy seeds (63,000 tonnes, 50 percent) is making itself felt.  Some 2.2 million tonnes of seed potatoes were laid in store--82  percent of the necessary quantity.                       Seed on hand as of 1 November 1993    Reference data                      tonnes           percentage of the    seed on hand as of                                      requirement of       1 November 1992,                                      farms                percentage of                                                           requirement   spring grains      10 million       96                   97  (not including  corn)   including:   wheat              2.95 million     98                   100.4   buckwheat          111,000          81                   94   millet             48,000           92                   90   rice               52,000           77                   81   legumes            825,000          84                   80   Soy                63,000           50                   75   potatoes           2.2 million      82                   91      A grouping of agricultural enterprises by degree of  provision  with seed shows that the proportion of farms experiencing  shortages of seed for spring grains and leguminous crops  increased from 26 percent last year to 33 percent this year, for  seed potatoes--from 55 to 60 percent. One out of eight farms was  supplied with spring grain seed at the level of 60 percent of  requirement or less. Almost half the agricultural enterprises of  the Russian Federation were at this level with respect to  potatoes.

A significant shortage of seed potatoes is being felt at  farms of Russia's non-Chernozem Zone, where the level is 407,000  tonnes (16 percent) short of the full requirement. Only  one-fourth of the farms are fully provided with seed potatoes in  Smolensk and Sverdlovsk Oblasts and in Bashkortostan; one-third  in Pskov, Vladimir, and Moscow Oblasts, and in the republics of  Mordvinia and Udmurtia; about 40 percent in Kaluga, Tula, and  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblasts; 20 percent in Vologda and Perm Oblasts.  <H3>  Preparedness of the National Economy for Operation Over the  Winter Period </H3>   This year the preparedness of the Russian Federation economy  for operating under winter conditions, as has been the case the  past two or three years, is observed against the background of  diminished fuel production, reduced volumes of fuel deliveries,  and a lag in the commissioning of energy facilities and housing  and municipal services facilities.    At storehouses of mines and coalfields, 18.4 million tonnes  of coal (8.1 million tonnes more than the norm) were stored as  of 1 November. This is 36 percent greater than was the case 1  November of last year. Some 433,000 tonnes of furnace fuel oil  were on hand (48 percent less). Coal supplies on hand with  consumers amounted to 44 million tonnes, furnace fuel oil--9.6  million tonnes. These levels are 14 and 7 percent less,  respectively, than as of 1 November 1992. Judging from the  experience of prior years, these fuel levels are sufficient to  operate enterprises and organizations for one and a half months.    Coal reserves at enterprises of the energy sector,  metallurgy  enterprises, storehouses of rayon (city) fuel sales centers, and  housing and municipal services boiler facilities as of 22  November this year are characterized by the following data:                   Coal                                       Furnace fuel oil                  tonnes        consumption    percentage    tonnes       consumption    percentage                               days           of 15 Nov                  days           of 15 Nov                                              93 level                                  93 level   Total          26,727,000    34             94            3,481,000    29             84  reserves   including:   at energy      21,850,000    42             93            2,849,000    25             82  sector  enterprises   at             1,804,000     15             105           414,000      32             92  metallurgy  enterprises   including      813,000       9              104  for coking   at housing     678,000       58             94            218,000      31             99.2  and  municipal  services  boiler  facilities   at             2,395,000     22             93  storehouses  of rayon  (city) fuel  sales  centers      At the same time, coal at energy sector enterprises of the  republics of Khakassia and Sakha (Yakutia) remained at the  two-day operational level. Less than the one-week operational  level was in store at housing and municipal services boiler  facilities of Volgograd Oblast and the republics of  Bashkortostan and Altay. About 40 percent of Russian Federation  territories had sufficient coal to supply the populace and the  social sphere for a period of less than 15 days, including a  two-seven day level in Orel, Tula, Astrakhan, and Chelyabinsk  Oblasts, the Republic of Mordvinia, and Altay Kray.  <H5>  Wages </H5>   The average wage of workers in October of this year amounted  to R93,000 [rubles], a 10.5-fold increase over October of last  year and a 15-percent increase over the level of September of  this year. Consumer prices for goods and services increased  12-fold and by 20 percent, respectively.

For most regions in October, the increase in prices over  September levels outpaced the increase in wages. A significant  gap (10-19 percentage points) was observed in Arkhangelsk,  Vladimir, Ryazan, Lipetsk, Volgograd, Penza, Saratov, Ulyanovsk,  Orenburg, Kemerovo, Omsk, Tyumen, Irkutsk, Chita, Amur, and  Kamchatka Oblasts, in the republics of Mordvinia, Kalmykia,  Dagestan, Udmurtia, and Chuvashia, and in Altay Kray.    Preliminary estimates indicate that the average wage in the  Russian Federation economy in November of this year will have  constituted R105,000, an increase of 13 percent over October of  this year, while prices for consumer goods and services rose 15  percent.  <H5>  Enterprise Indebtedness </H5>   Credit indebtedness on the part of industrial and  agricultural enterprises and construction and transportation  organizations under observation as of 1 October amounted to R32  trillion. Of this amount, R8.7 trillion, or 27 percent,  constitutes delinquent indebtedness. The greatest proportion of  delinquent indebtedness was seen in enterprises of the forestry,  woodworking, and pulp and paper production industry (39  percent), chemical and petrochemical industry (41 percent),  microbiology (43 percent), coal (44 percent), and gas (52  percent) industries.    The greatest portion (72 percent) of delinquent credit  indebtedness comprises indebtedness to suppliers. The volume  dynamics of delinquent indebtedness to suppliers by sector of  industry and construction are characterized as follows (in  rubles):                     As of 1 Aug 93              As of 1 Sep 93              As of 1 Oct 93                    Total       Including       Total       Including       Total       Including                               delinquent                  delinquent                  delinquent                               indebtedness                indebtedness                indebtedness   Total in         8.527       3.368           10.184      4.066           14.092      5.209  industry         trillion    trillion        trillion    trillion        trillion    trillion   Including:   electric power   519         152 billion     612         201 billion     1.092       264 billion                   billion                     billion                     trillion   fuel industry    2.380       943 billion     2.966       1.293           4.028       1.587                   trillion                    trillion    trillion        trillion    trillion   ferrous          789         334 billion     1.014       439 billion     1.447       657 billion  metallurgy       billion                     trillion                    trillion   nonferrous       679         255 billion     770         270 billion     955         297 billion  metallurgy       billion                     billion                     billion   chemical and     890         442 billion     1.098       569 billion     1.370       686 billion  petrochemical    billion                     trillion                    trillion  industry   machine          1.298       504 billion     1.594       601 billion     2.150       805 billion  building and     trillion                    trillion                    trillion  metalworking   forestry,        419         242 billion     356         165 billion     479         222 billion  woodworking,     billion                     billion                     billion  and pulp and  paper industry    building         185         90 billion      245         115 billion     338         130 billion  materials        billion                     billion                     billion  industry   light industry   195         69 billion      225         84 billion      305         90 billion                   billion                     billion                     billion   food industry    706         207 billion     739         175 billion     1.086       249 billion                   billion                     billion                     trillion   construction     987         334 billion     1.125       429 billion     1.680       509 billion                   billion                     trillion                    trillion      The greatest increase in delinquent indebtedness to  suppliers  in October of this year was observed at enterprises of the  glass, porcelain, ceramics, and pottery industry--by a factor of  2.1; in ferrous metallurgy, the flour-grinding, cereals, and  mixed fodders industry--by a factor of 1.5; in the food  industry--by a factor of 1.4. At the same time, the growth rate  did not exceed 12 percent for ferrous metallurgy, the building  materials industry, and light industry. The proportion of  industrial enterprises with delinquent indebtedness to suppliers  as of 1 October of this year comprised 40.5 percent, as opposed  to 45.9 percent as of 1 September of this year.    The significant volumes of delinquent credit indebtedness  are  related to the presence of debit indebtedness.    As of 1 October of this year, the entire amount of debit  indebtedness amounted to R28.0 trillion, of which R10.1  trillion, or 36 percent, was delinquent indebtedness. The  greatest share of delinquent indebtedness is attributable to the  indebtedness of purchasers--R8.9 trillion, or 88 percent.    The greatest proportion of delinquent debit indebtedness was  observed in the oil refining, microbiology, forestry,  woodworking, and pulp and paper industries (47 percent), in  ferrous metallurgy (48 percent), and in the gas (52 percent) and  coal (55 percent) industries.    Due to a lack of their own financial resources, enterprises  are resorting to credits. The total volume of indebtedness with  respect to bank credits for sectors under observation as of 1  October of this year amounted to R6.5 trillion, including R3.0  trillion, or 47 percent, attributable to nonstate enterprises.    The absence of regulation with respect to mutual accounts  settlements between enterprises and with the budget exerts an  influence on their financial stability.    The solvency of observed enterprises and organizations of  industry and construction is characterized by the following data:                     Monetary assets, percentage of delinquent indebtedness                   to suppliers                    As of 1     As of 1   As of 1    As of 1       As of 1                   January     April     August     September     October                   1993        1993      1993       1993          1993   Total            78.2        102.1     91.5       79.8          79.3   including:   industry         79.3        107.1     95.5       83.9          81.7   construction     67.2        52.9      50.6       40.9          55.4      Credit investments in the Russian economy (not including  credits of the Russian Federation Savings Bank) as of 1 November  of this year, according to current operating data of the Central  Bank of Russia, amounted to R19.6 trillion, an increase of 17  percent over October (15 percent over September). Of the total  volume of credit deposits, short-term loans comprise 96 percent.  This represents a one-point percentage increase in their share  as compared with the beginning of the year. The average term of  offered credits is two to three months. Trading in  "super-short-term" credits (from a few days to one month) in the  credit and stock markets is becoming more prevalent.    The main source of resources for commercial banks has  traditionally been attracted resources (over 90 percent), of  which more than one-fourth are attributable to funds of  enterprises and organizations (in settlement accounts, current  accounts, other accounts), deposits, and investments; one-fifth  are attributable to interbank credits. Centralized credits of  the Bank of Russia comprise 84 percent of the latter.    The remainder of the indebtedness of commercial banks to the  Central Bank of Russia with respect to centralized credits  extended to enterprises and organizations in accordance with  federal programs comprised R7.9 trillion as of 1 November of  this year, an increase of 6 percent over October (2 percent over  September). Their share of the total volume of credit deposits  decreased from 44 percent as of 1 October of this year to 40  percent as of 1 November.    Since 15 October of this year, the interest rate of the Bank  of Russia for centralized loans was raised from 180 percent to  210 percent. With an increase in the prime rate, interest rates  for loans afforded by commercial banks to their clients have  also increased.</p>

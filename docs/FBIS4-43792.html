			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- Singapore Airlines ordered  10 more A340-300 long-range Airbus planes and took out options  for another 20 on Wednesday [22 June], the European consortium  Airbus Industrie announced.    The total order for the 30 planes would be worth 5.4 billion  dollars.    The airline, which already ordered seven A340's in December  1992, will thus become Airbus Industrie's biggest customer with  37 of this very long-range model.    The planes ordered Wednesday will be delivered starting in  spring 1996.</p>

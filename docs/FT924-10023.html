			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Police chiefs defend top ranks THE Association of Chief Police Officers yesterday defended the present structure of police ranks, arguing that the way the structure was used was more pertinent than any debate about 'losing ranks'. Its comments came in proposals to the Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and responsibilities. They follow proposals by police authorities to the inquiry, conducted by Sir Patrick Sheehy, that most higher ranks should be swept away.</p>

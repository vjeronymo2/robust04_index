			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 17 Jan (AFP) --  The Mexican Government "is using the economic and military aid"  that it receives from the United States to "massacre the Chiapas  Indians," the Zapatist National Liberation Front [EZLN] rebels  charged in a message addressed on 13 January to President Bill  Clinton. The letter was published today by the local newspaper  EL TIEMPO.    Signed by Subcommander Marcos, who explained that there will  be a delay in delivery with the package of documents issued from  7 to 13 January--the texts of which referred to the  cease-fire--to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, they reject  any charges that they attacked "civilian objectives," among  other things.    In an 11 January text, the EZLN stated "it does not know  Camacho Solis, but if this gentleman truly and honestly wants to  find a political and fair solution, we hail his appointment as  peace commissioner and we reiterate to him our willingness to  dialogue."    Camacho stated on Monday that he received a new message from  the Zapatistas, which is why he went to the capital to brief  Carlos Salinas on, with the certainty that there would be a  response for them by 18 January.    Salinas announced on 16 January that he will send to  Congress  "a draft law granting general amnesty" to EZLN members who  rebelled in Chiapas 15 days ago. This was considered by  political and social sectors as a new step toward peace.    In a 6 January communique, the EZLN requested, among other  things for dialogue, its recognition as a belligerent force, a  cease-fire, the withdrawal of government troops from Chiapas,  and democratic and social benefits.    In the message to Clinton, the U.S. Congress and people, the  EZLN asked if they "approved this military and economic aid to  combat narcotrafficking and to kill Indians in the southeastern  part of Mexico."    "Troops, aircraft, helicopters, radar and communications  equipment, firearms, and military weapons are now used not  against narcotraffickers and the big drug lords of the drug  mafias, but to repress the just struggles of the people of  Mexico," it added.    The Zapatists claim "we have nothing to do with  narcotrafficking or national or international terrorism," and  they say that "with the support the U.S. Government and people  offer to the federal government they are only staining their  hands with the blood of Indians."    "Do not stain your hands with our blood, becoming an  accomplice of the Mexican Government," because "our wish is for  all the peoples of the world: true liberty and democracy," the  message to the U.S. president concluded.    In a 13 January communique, the EZLN said that "no way will  we turn over our weapons or surrender our forces to the evil  government. The cease-fire is aimed at alleviating the  situation of the civilian population in the combat zone and  paves the way for dialogue with all the progressive and  democratic sectors of Mexico."</p>

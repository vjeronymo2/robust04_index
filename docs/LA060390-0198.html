			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS RESTORE FLORA, UPROOT INTERLOPERS  </P> <P> Charles Kaltenthaler claims to be a tree expert. Squatting on the dry grasses  of Upper Newport Bay in Saturday sunshine, the 6-year-old picked at the roots  of the young cottonwood tree that he was helping to plant.  </P> <P> "We're planting trees 'cause it gives us oxygen, and we breathe out carbon  dioxide, and 'cause they make a nice place for birds to live," Charles said. "I  climb trees all the time, but I'm not going to climb this one till it's good  and healthy."  </P> <P> Charles, two friends and the friends' father were among the 100 people who  turned out Saturday for the California Wildlife Fund's tree planting. Sponsored  by a local restaurant, the event drew environmentalists young and old who came  to restore native flora to the Newport Bay area.  </P> <P> "You can see all the (Argentine) pampas grass that's grown up around here, and  over there, the Brazilian pepper trees," said Jim Cokas, a member of the  volunteer naturalist program.  </P> <P> Those South American plants are not indigenous to the area, he added, and  therefore are not used for food or nesting by native animals and insects.  </P> <P> Besides producing oxygen, Cokas said, "all they do is take up space."  </P> <P> So, recruiting help from the community and from county environmental groups,  Wildlife Fund officials organized the event not only to plant more than 450  sycamore, cottonwood, oak, willow and elderberry seedlings, but also so  volunteers could help root out some unwanted plants, such as pepper trees and  pampas.  </P> <P> "I've talked to my friends about the bay, and they say, 'Leave it alone, why do  you want to landscape it?' " Cokas said. "But, you know, humans have already  inserted themselves into nature to such a degree that we can't back out now."  </P> <P> Much of the marsh of Upper Newport Bay is covered by the hearty pampas grass,  which Wildlife Fund spokesman John Scholl said was introduced here during the  1950s, when county developers planted it at many projects. As the grasses grew  and produced seeds, the plants gradually took root in Newport Bay.  </P> <P> Scholl said that by replacing the foreign plants with ones that naturally grow  in the area, the ecological balance of the area can be slowly restored.  </P> <P> Sergio Avila, whose restaurant provided food for the volunteers, said he has  been involved with projects to restore Newport Bay for the last several years.  </P> <P> "I really think of this place as a jewel, surrounded by concrete and  developments," Avila said, adding that he thinks that residents will respond as  their awareness increases.  </P> <P> And Frieda Kinoshita, an Orange resident who belongs to the California Native  Plant Society, said she is especially heartened to see the children out helping  with their parents.  </P> <P> "At 45, I've seen wild areas that my children will never get a chance to see,"  Kinoshita said. "I often wonder what are they going to say about us two  generations from now."  </P> <P> For every tree planted, Avila's restaurant donated $5 to the Wildlife Fund. The  money will go toward buying open space in California for preservation, Scholl  said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Agreement on ESA Manned </F> Flight Projects"; Subhead: "Last Minute French-German Agreement  Resolved Crisis and Enable Agreement in Principle on Manned  Flight Programs, Commitment to Which Depends Only on Adjusting  Spain's and Italy's Contributions"]    [Text] There was a pleasant surprise on 18 January at the  second session of the European Space Agency [ESA] that had  broken up in mid-December over a disagreement based on a  tactless letter from German research minister, Paul Krueger,  that entirely smacked of being an ultimatum to the French space  minister, Gerard Longuet. Since then the tension has eased and  the new French-German agreement has therefore made it possible  to break the deadlock and with other relevant European member  states arrive at a comprehensive agreement on both the tenor and  the cost of the two new ESA manned system programs.    Those are the Columbus (with the attached APM pressurized  module, the Eureca satellite, the external platform type  supplements, aiming instrument, remote manipulator arm and two  Mir 94-95 flights) and MSTP (with manned CTV ballistic capsule,  automatic ATV orbital tower and ARC test flight, external remote  manipulator and EVA spacesuit). By 31 March both those programs,  moreover, are supposed to be merged into a single program, by  combining the Columbus and MSTP programs, hitherto directed  respectively by Sweden's Frederik Engstroem and Germany's Jorg  Feustel-Buechl, into a single entity under a single authority  (to be defined). The polar platform (formerly in Columbus) was  already reassigned (more logically) to the ESA observation  program.    An agreement was also reached on the budget of the two  programs, with 270.4 million units of account [UA] (FF1,780  million) for Columbus and UA207 million (FF1,363 million) for  the MSTP, that is, a total budget of more than FF3 billion for  European manned programs in 1994-1995.    In mid-January the member states, however, did not vote on  those new programs whose committal texts (declarations) should  be approved and submitted for the signature of the participants  on 31 January. By then, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France,  Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden will be ready to  participate in both activities with, in addition, the United  Kingdom for Columbus and also Switzerland and Canada for MSTP.    The only obstacle to be eliminated before the end of the  month involves adjusting Spain's and Italy's contributions  (because of the devaluation of their currencies they are forced  to pay more to the ESA). A compromise is expected to be found by  31 January to adjust their quota and finally make it possible to  commit to the Columbus and MSTP programs by the end of 1995.</p>

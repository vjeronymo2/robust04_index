During the  discussion, he pointed out: The PLA should set an example and  spur on the masses in building spiritual civilization and thus  make due contributions to social stability and promoting the  building of socialist spiritual civilization.    When a deputy from the Guangzhou Military Region, which is  situated in the forward place of reform and opening up, and a  deputy from the army unit served by Xu Honggang, a heroic  fighter ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause, talked  about how the troops should do something in building spiritual  civilization, Liu Huaqing said: General Secretary Jiang Zemin  called on the PLA to set a good example in building socialist  spiritual civilization. What should they do to set a good  example? In my view, it is first necessary to understand this  is an important responsibility entrusted to the people's army by  the party and the people in the new historical period and is the  great expectations of the masses of the people. All officers and  men in our Army should understand the importance of taking the  lead in doing a good job of building spiritual civilization and  consciously cultivate this habit, starting bit by bit from  ourselves. If the Army does a good job in building spiritual  civilization, a soldier will become a propagandist or an model  who can play an active, promoting role in building spiritual  civilization. Xu Honggang is just such a model.    Speaking on the need for the troops to set a good example in  developing good social conduct, Liu pointed out: Unhealthy  practices and evil phenomena should be resisted and held in  check. We should be concerned about the weal and woe of the  masses, do more good work for them, help them solve  difficulties, and help the masses in garrison areas get rid of  poverty and become rich. When the interests, life, and property  of the masses are harmed, servicemen should step forward bravely  and take up the cudgels so that the people can see hope from the  fine image of the troops and heighten their confidence.</p>

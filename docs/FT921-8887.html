But the message, as usual, does not seem to have reached his colleagues in the African National Congress. Some 20 merchant bankers - the middlemen for future investment - have just held a seminar in Johannesburg sponsored by British Invisibles, the City's committee on invisible exports. Officials of the ANC's economics department were invited, and would have found it a useful gathering . . . if they'd bothered to show up.</p>

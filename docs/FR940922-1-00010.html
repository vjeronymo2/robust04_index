			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provisions to assure that RACM (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a) of the Act). This permit program element, also known as the New Source Review (NSR) program, was submitted by the State of Idaho on May 17, 1994. EPA notified Idaho in a June 10, 1994 letter to the Administrator of the IDEQ that the NSR program submittal was complete. EPA is currently reviewing Idaho's NSR program submittal to determine if the program meets the requirements of the CAA. EPA intends to take action on Idaho's NSR program in a separate document when EPA has completed its review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544). Contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area have not yet been submitted by IDEQ. A findings letter, dated January 13, 1994, was mailed to the Governor of Idaho which informed him that the State had failed to make the required PM&hyph;10 contingency measures submittal for Ada County/Boise. The State has until July 13, 1995 to correct this deficiency for Ada County/Boise, or it will face Federal highway or offset sanctions (see section 179 of the CAA and 58 FR 51270 (October 1, 1993)). EPA intends to take action on the contingency measures for the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area when this requirement is submitted or intends to impose sanctions in the event this deficiency is not corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. This Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In this action, as described below, EPA is proposing to grant full approval of the emission inventory element and exclusion from the PM&hyph;10 precursor control requirements. These elements of the State's moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment SIP submittal for Ada County/Boise are separable and independent of the provisions that the State has not adequately addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also as described below, EPA is proposing to grant a limited approval of the control measures that have been submitted by the State as of this date. EPA may grant a limited approval of these control measures under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of EPA's authority under section 301(a) of the Act to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The proposed approval of these control measures is limited, however, in that EPA is not proposing that these control measures satisfy the specific requirements of sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) to implement RACM, including RACT, in moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. EPA believes, however, that the control measures adopted and submitted as of this date will achieve PM&hyph;10 emissions reductions in the Ada County/Boise nonattainment area. Thus, EPA is proposing to approve these control measures for the limited purpose of strengthening the SIP and making them federally enforceable (see e.g. sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, because the State has not yet adopted into the SIP and submitted to EPA certain control measures on which it relies in the SIP to demonstrate timely attainment and continued maintenance of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in the Ada County Boise nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to disapprove the RACM (including RACT) element. In addition, because the attainment demonstration and quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP) elements of the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 SIP depend in part on the control measures which the State has not yet adopted and submitted to EPA, EPA is also proposing to disapprove these elements. If this proposed disapproval becomes final, it will begin the period for the imposition of discretionary sanctions under section 110(m) of the Act and the 18-month sanctions clock for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under section 179 of the Act. If finalized, this disapproval will also authorize EPA to issue a Federal implementation plan as provided in section 110(c)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, however, prior to EPA's final action on this proposal the State submits the additional control measures on which it relies and, based on EPA's review, these additional control measures adequately address the outstanding deficiencies, EPA will consider withdrawing this limited approval/disapproval and will instead propose full approval of the PM&hyph;10 plan for Ada County/Boise relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements which were due November 15, 1991. EPA invites public comment on its proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) of the Act and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

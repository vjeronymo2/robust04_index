			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Broken biscuits Those who felt that McVitie's provided a rock solid core at the heart of UB's international ambitions must have felt a chill when the margins on its UK biscuit business slipped in the first half. The proximate reason for the fall was an increase in raw materials prices following the devaluation of the green pound, which was not passed on. Since UB argues that it has not raised prices in order to defend its market share, and any efficiency gains will probably be lost to competitive pressures, that margin erosion must be viewed as permanent. Indeed, as the supermarket chains can be assumed to be hanging tough on prices of own label biscuits, the capacity to increase the price of branded products is very limited. The undermining of brands by own label biscuits also bears an uncomfortable resemblance to the war-torn bread market. Cash flow from the high margin UK business has been used to fund UB's international ambitions. North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific are apparently the local markets in which UB wants to star, yet even when cash flow was higher, it looked too small an engine to drive a global business. The position in the highly competitive North American market looks the most vulnerable since UB's Keebler holds a weak second position. Sale of the business to a company like Pepsi with a strong distribution chain would release cash to pursue the underdeveloped European snacks market. Whether UB's distribution in Europe can be made sufficiently strong to support the business is an open question.</p>

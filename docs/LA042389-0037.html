			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: KEEP 'EM LAUGHING  </P> <P> Improv owner Budd Friedman and his partner, Mark Lonow, are about to bring  stand-up comedy right into your home -- and you'll be the comic. Look for "The  Improv Comedy Game" ($18.95) this summer, in which players "start out as an  amateur," Friedman told us, with the object "to become a star."  </P> <P> A toss of the dice will determine where a player lands on the board: On a  square that accelerates one's stand-up career (example: "You 'kill' at Improv.  Budd and Mark make you a 'regular.' Score three points."); sets the player back  ("Heckler is funnier than you. He gets TV series. Lose two points."); or  requires the player to perform material from one of four categories -- Cracks,  Gags, Improvs, Groaners. Generating laughs earns additional points, pushing  them up the ladder of success.  </P> <P> Players can try their own jokes or choose among the hundreds provided (and  still being written). Professional comedians who have worked at the Improv are  contributing jokes, such as:  </P> <P> From Steve Mittleman -- "I have a really weak chin. It takes me three or four  hours to change a pillowcase."  </P> <P> And from Carrie Snow -- "I'm reaching my sexual peak, and it's lonely at the  top!" Todd David Schwartz  </P></p>

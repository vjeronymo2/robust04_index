			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong recovery in Madrid Most bourses were closed for the Ascension day holiday. MADRID recovered more ground, mainly in the afternoon when the influence of the US PPI data was combined with expectations of a domestic interest rate cut. The general index rose 5.68, or 1.8 per cent to 327.16, turnover rising from Pta32bn to Pta33.6bn but accelerating towards the close. Construction stocks starred. Huarte, up Pta55, or 3 per cent to Pta1,875, was recommended by James Capel, which said that the company had the largest order book in the sector; Uralita rose Pta110, or 7.7 per cent to Pta1,540. Utililities climbed after Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, up Pta80 at Pta4,220, delivered a 55 per cent rise in first quarter net. Iberdrola rose Pta31 to Pta977 and Sevillana by Pta29, or 4.4 per cent to Pta684. MILAN fell back on options expiry, while the market's overall tone remained cautious. Investors were awaiting further political developments, as well as the release of Fiat's 1993 results and, more importantly, its forecasts for 1994. The Comit index shed 7.05 to 803.02. After the close the car group announced that first quarter results showed a return to profit after a loss of L222bn in the same 1993 period. Its shares closed up L125 at L7,135. Generali, the insurance group, which also forecast better results for 1994, gained L850 to L48,300. DUBLIN ended at a new low for the year, affected, said Mr Adrian O'Carroll of Dillon Read, by declines in Bank of Ireland and CRH, the building materials group. The ISEQ index lost 9.41 to 1,792.74, but in below average turnover. TEL AVIV registered its ninth fall in succession as the Mishtanim index lost 3.00, or 1.4 per cent to 214.62. ISTANBUL rose 3.8 per cent after a three-day fall, the composite index ending 602.09 higher at 16,335.55. Brokers said that investors were still cautious buyers of state-controlled companies as lira interest rates stayed firm. WARSAW recovered 2.6 per cent after rate cut news from the National Bank of Poland, the Wig index closing 268.4 higher at 10,674.6.

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Air Canada eyes rival's international business AIR CANADA has offered to buy rival Canadian Airlines' international business for CDollars 200m (Pounds 102m) and assume CDollars 800m of debt and lease obligations for three 747-400s and five 767s. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada chairman, said the offer would bring stability to Canada's airline industry, providing one viable international carrier while preserving Canadian Airlines as a domestic and North American carrier. Both companies would be strengthened, he said. 'Together we could create jobs and avoid the import of management control.' Mr Harris said that under the offer Air Canada would take over Canadian's international cockpit and cabin crews. It would get Canadian's Asian and European routes and apply for new destinations, such as Amsterdam and mainland China. He ruled out a complete merger.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Bolsa looks for signals as Spanish economy recedes - The post-election mood Spain's stock market professionals are making an intense study of the government that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the newly reappointed prime minister, selected last week. The Bolsa is looking for government signals that will hint at future interest rate movements and possible fluctuations in the value of the peseta. Until it is certain that it is reading such messages correctly, its watchword is extreme caution. This is understandable. The signals so far are conflicting, while the economic problems are all too clear. Spain is in recession. Growth estimates for this year vary between zero and minus 1 per cent, and the financial community has clear ideas about what has to be done. Public spending must be stopped in its tracks, it says, unit labour costs must be reduced demonstrably and private sector borrowing must become substantially cheaper. Next week the national statistics institute will publish its labour force survey for the second quarter of the year. This is expected to show that 107,000 jobs were lost between April and June, raising the unemployment rate by one percentage point to 22.7 per cent and the jobless total to 3.4m. Surgical measures are required to kick start the economy, and the Bolsa into action. Unless the government has shown its hand forcefully by the time these first-half employment figures are published, the peseta could come under pressure. Already there is widespread dismay over the public deficit. By May it had grown by 24.4 per cent against the first five months of last year and was already close to the total deficit forecast for 1993. The political situation, however, is fluid. It is not yet clear just how far Mr Gonzalez's new team is willing or able to take the required surgical measures. The new economy and finance minister, Mr Pedro Solbes, a technocrat and a non-socialist, says he plans an austere budget and so, indeed, does Mr Gonzalez. But the prime minister also says that he wants to maintain social spending at its present levels, and that he wants a social pact with the unions. The unions, which recently have been negotiating wage increases of more than 6 per cent, at least 1.5 percentage points above inter-annual headline inflation, say they are willing to moderate their wage claims; but in return they will want the government to shelve a planned overhaul of Spain's rigid hiring and firing rules. Just about the only good news on the economic front is that the recession has hampered imports and narrowed the trade deficit. The January to May accumulated trade deficit was down by 38 per cent compared with the first five months of last year, and it represented 4 per cent of GDP against 6.1 per cent at the end of last year. Much more good news, nevertheless, is necessary. Calling for government action, market players use macho images: 'Now is the time to take the bull by the horns,' says one. This means, among other things, recognising that current social spending is unsustainable; and taking on the unions. Gestemar, the securities arm of the March group, wants 'a swift and strong reduction in interest rates to 8 per cent or even lower (down from the current intervention rate of 11 per cent) during the next 12 months'. It also wants the peseta to fluctuate within its ERM range, or 'even leave the system if necessary'. The 'cut and run and go for growth' argument is doing the rounds in Madrid but, so far, it has made little impact among senior policy makers. This is principally because Spain needs to import capital and can ill-afford an over-weakened currency that will raise the cost of its borrowing. A more likely scenario is a halfway house, in which the government will be more forceful than many in the market currently expect, although less so than they say is necessary. The budget will be more restrictive than in the past, the unions will be more reasonable and unit labour costs will ease somewhat. Interest rates will come down only very gradually, tracking the Germans, and the peseta, which has remained generally below Pta77 to the D-Mark, could slide towards its central parity of Pta79.11. In these circumstances some observers think it wise to give the Bolsa a rest for a while. By the end of May, in advance of the political uncertainties and the worsening economic figures, Madrid's market had put on some 20 per cent. At the beginning of this year, this was the gain that most analysts had expected for the whole of 1993.</p>

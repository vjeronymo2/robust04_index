			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jose Luis Castillejos] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Defense Minister  General Mario Rene Enriquez said today that the Guatemalan Army  is prepared to greet peace, to redefine its role in society, to  become smaller, and, at a given moment, to obey the rulings of a  truth commission.    The self-styled "general for peace" said that the Army "has  opened the doors to pacification" in this country where an armed  conflict has created hatred and violence. During a meeting with  the Foreign Press Club, Enriquez reported that the 47,000-strong  Army has begun to draft new objectives for itself in order to  adjust to the national situation that will emerge once the armed  struggle initiated 33 years ago concludes. Enriquez explained  that the military reorganization process is considering  disarming 17,000 members of the 400,000-strong paramilitary  Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC] as well as redefining the  Guatemalan State defense policy.    He added: "Once a peace agreement is signed, the Armed  Forces  could be dedicated to defending the 3,000 archaeological sites  that international bands of jewel-traffickers loot, protecting  the borders, and preventing the indiscriminate felling of trees  in Peten (in northern Guatemala), one of the areas considered to  be a world lung.    Regarding troop reduction, Enriquez said that the Guatemalan  Army is small and should be increased to 100,000. However, he  said that if the peace agreements call for a reduction, the  institution will obey. The general said that "quality can  substitute for quantity," which means making the Army, which has  been accused of violating human rights, more professional.  Right now, the Guatemalan military favors Refashioning the  Military [Reconversion Military], which means tasking the Army  with functions that up to now have been carried out by other  institutions. These functions include natural disaster  assistance, the eradication of drugs, and environmental  protection. Guatemala is the only country in Central America in  which a war is under way, and for this reason, according to  Enriquez, the Army justifiably maintains its role as defender of  the state and nationality in the face of an enemy inspired by a  foreign ideology.    The government and the rebel Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity are continuing a peace negotiation process,  and it is expected that by August the discussions will be  centered on the guerrilla demand for the "demilitarization" of  the country. This means not only the reduction of the military  force but also the elimination of its influence in society.    The defense minister, one of the 11 Army generals on active  duty and who has worked for the institution for 29 years,  expressed his satisfaction with the way the peace negotiations  with the guerrillas are progressing. He said he is pleased with  the presence in the country of a UN Preliminary Mission. This  mission is determining what technical and financial requirements  must be met to establish an international verification program  in Guatemala. Referring to the establishment of a truth  commission similar to the one that operated in El Salvador,  Enriquez said it would be "biased and would try to weaken the  Army's morale."    The military commander said that the military institution  would accept resolutions on human rights violations only if the  government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio accepts a  commission of this nature. He regretted that the guerrillas  "will not share responsibilities for assassinations,  kidnappings, war taxes, and other illegal actions against the  interests of the nation."    Enriquez said: "The president will decide whether or not  such  a commission is created. We do not want biased recommendations,  though." Enriquez accused the guerrillas of violating the  Global Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March. According to  Enriquez, the guerrillas carried out illegal actions in the  combat zone of Ixcan, in the northwestern Department of Quiche,  a zone known also as the "heart" of the Poor People's Guerrilla  Army.    Enriquez charged that some nongovernmental organizations are  still giving economic assistance to the guerrillas for the  purchasing of weapons. He noted that the current Guatemalan  Administration is trying to secure evidence that these  organizations are helping the rebels as well as trying to  prevent them from entering the country.</p>

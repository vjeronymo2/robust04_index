			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the provincial price control bureau  contacted the governments, administrative offices, price control  bureaus, and grain authorities of all cities and prefectures,  announcing the ceiling prices for grain and oil sales.    The provincial price control bureau indicated that recently  the prices of grain, oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in some  cities in our province have increased too much, which is an  abnormal phenomenon. It has caused fluctuations of commodity  prices on the market and increased living expenses of urban  residents. The provincial party committee and government were  very concerned about this issue and, in good time, held a  special meeting to discuss it and make arrangements.    In order to ensure basic stability of the prices of daily  necessities of the public during the solar and lunar New Year  season, per approval of the provincial government, it is hereby  decided that ceiling market prices are set for a number of main  varieties of grain and oil. The provincial government-set  prices per 500 grams are as follows: 0.67 yuan for standard  wheat flour; 0.68 yuan for first-class whitened wheat flour;  0.75 yuan for refined wheat flour; 4.00 yuan for peanut oil; and  3.50 yuan for rapeseed oil. The prices of grain and oil in all  cities and prefectures shall be set in light of local conditions  by the city or prefectural governments or price control  authorities without exceeding the provincial government-set  upper limits. The prices of grain and oil products and other  varieties shall also [words indistinct]. The ceiling prices  become effective as of 23 January, which all state-run operating  units and individuals must strictly abide by.    The provincial price control bureau demanded that price  control authorities at all levels organize manpower to conduct  full-scale inspection of local grain and oil markets. They  should handle each and every case in which a unit or individual  is found violating the regulations of the provincial price  control bureau, and sternly penalize law-violating practices of  taking advantage of the situation, jacking up prices recklessly,  and disrupting market order, and expose them through the media.</p>

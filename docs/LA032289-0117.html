			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION FOES SHUT OUT IN DISPUTE WITH HOTEL  </P> <P> An Anaheim hotel, threatened on two fronts in the abortion controversy, has  refused to book accommodations for Operation Rescue, a New York-based  anti-abortion group that plans to blockade several Southern California family  planning clinics later this week.  </P> <P> "The general manager recognized they are a very controversial group and did  receive a threat from another source saying if he let Operation Rescue people  stay at the hotel, they had better tighten their security," said Mary Garcia,  public relations manager for the Ramada Hotel Group in Phoenix, which holds the  franchise for the Ramada Main Gate in Anaheim, across South Harbor Boulevard  from Disneyland.  </P> <P> "He recognized this as a potentially dangerous situation for the other guests  in the hotel," Garcia said of the general manager's decision not to book 50 to  100 rooms for the group.  </P> <P> However, Jeff Adler, spokesman for the hotel, said the group was not welcome  because its members did not meet standard hotel requirements to provide a list  of names of those who would be staying and to pay a room deposit.  </P> <P> Adler also said that members of Operation Rescue tried to intimidate the hotel  management into providing facilities: "They threatened to take it to Time  magazine unless we do as they say."  </P> <P> Speaking on behalf of the Anaheim facility's owner, Roger Manfred, Adler said:  "This hotel will not be held hostage by any group."  </P> <P> Ken Tanner, director for Operation Rescue's Southland activities, denounced the  hotel's decision and called it "religious discrimination" at a press conference  held in the hotel parking lot Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Tanner said about 500 anti-abortion protesters -- including Operation Rescue's  founder, Randall Terry -- are arriving in the Southland from around the nation  to participate in sit-ins at undisclosed clinics in Los Angeles and Orange  counties through Saturday.  </P> <P> About 200 of those were expected to need hotel rooms in Orange County, where  nightly rallies will be held, he said. Operation Rescue has a temporary  headquarters in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> The rejection by the hotel will not affect plans to block entrances of up to  five clinics a day for 3 days, beginning Thursday morning, spokesmen for  Operation Rescue said.  </P> <P> The religious-based organization, which claims 20,000 arrests during scores of  sit-ins nationwide over the past year, has created havoc in courts and jails in  Atlanta and Sunnyvale in Santa Clara County. About 2,000 demonstrators are  expected to participate in the sit-ins at Southland clinics, and hundreds of  pro-choice activists have pledged to be on hand to defend the rights of women  to obtain medical services.  </P> <P> The "rescues" could begin as early as tonight at one clinic where, a spokesman  for Operation Rescue said Tuesday, abortions are said to be performed 24 hours  a day.  </P> <P> The deployment locations for early morning "rescues" will be announced each  night at Operation Rescue rallies held at 7 p.m. at Melodyland Christian  Center, 400 W. Freedman Way, in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Tanner said Operation Rescue had planned to use the Ramada as a base during the  protests and had reached an agreement Friday with the sales manager to provide  rooms as available, an information table in the lobby and referral information  to Operation Rescue followers who called from the airport. He said no deposit  had been required.  </P> <P> But on Monday afternoon, he said his organization had received word that no  rooms would be available.  </P> <P> Tanner said the sales manager confirmed that there had been a "political  problem" about housing the group.  </P> <P> "My question is -- and Randall Terry's question is -- can people be  discriminated against based on their political and religious preferences?"  Tanner asked.  </P> <P> He said the group will seek to set up an information table in the Ramada  parking lot to advise "rescuers" of other hotels available in the area.  </P> <P> Tanner speculated that a telephone threat may have come from someone who  learned of Operation Rescue's plans to stay at the Ramada through the group's  telephone hot line.  </P> <P> He added that he suspects pressure was exerted on the hotel manager, from  either an outsider who called the number or from someone within the hotel  chain. "There must be a strong pro-abort community here," he said.  </P> <P> Anaheim police said Tuesday that they have not been notified of any threats  made against the hotel.  </P></p>

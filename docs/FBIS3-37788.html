			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] As the crisis in Bosnia has shown, the West needs to  learn "a new science of cooperation no less, if not more, than  Russia does," the First Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoliy  Adamishin, told Interfax on Tuesday [22 February].    According to him, Russia and the West will "go through  periods of complications, since currently they are involved in  readjusting their interests."    As the first deputy foreign minister said, Russia's present  course is "to regulate the inevitable differences in interests  by political means, through discussions, through partnership."  "If we are pushed off this path of narrowing our differences,  we'll have to search for other ways to uphold our interests,  since our interests cannot be discarded. Therefore the West  will have to reckon with us in one way or another," Adamishin  noted.    "Cooperation with Russia will yield considerably greater  results in the efforts to settle conflicts and ensure security  in Europe, than relapses into confrontation with Moscow  reminiscent of the "cold war," he pointed out.    President Boris Yeltsin's call for holding a special  conference between the leaders of Russia, the USA, France,  Britain and Germany to reach a political solution to the Bosnian  issue remains in force, the diplomat stressed.    According to Adamishin, there is a need to find "a formula  for consolidating cooperation." "The formats can be different.  One of them is the Security Council and the U.N. in general.  Another is what is taking place in Bonn, where high-ranking  officials from 12 European Union countries, Russia, the USA and  Canada began their consultations on Tuesday."    As Interfax's interviewee confirmed, at the conference  Russia  will be represented by the special envoy of its president,  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin. The meeting will not be  attended by the warring Bosnian sides. Its goal is to  coordinate the endeavors of Russia and its Western partners to  resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, who is making  a tour of the countries involved in the "Visegrad Group," is not  planning to visit Bonn, Adamishin said. "The conference is  taking place on the level of experts," he explained.    According to the high-ranking diplomat, the turning of G-7  into G-8 can become another form of interaction between Russia  and the West. "NATO's Partnership for Peace program can also  serve as an area where useful exchanges of views and  coordination of differring stands can take place," he said.    With reference to problems connected with a settlement in  Bosnia as such, Adamishin said that the withdrawal of heavy  artillery and other military hardware from Sarajevo by the Serbs  and Muslims is "a serious breakthrough achieved by political  means." "Now it's essential to consolidate this first success,"  he said.    According to the diplomat, Russia has a clear-cut program  for  further actions in this direction. "It provides for a final  demilitarization of Sarajevo. This can be achieved by means of  placing the city under temporary U.N. administration, as  virtually all plans for settlement envisaged," he said.    "The endeavors to resolve some other painful problems faced  in Bosnia basing on the lessons taught by the Sarajevo crisis  can pose another step," Adamishin noted.    He does not view the course of "further ultimatums" as "very  productive," he pointed out. "As developments in and around  Sarajevo have proved, the course of reaching a political  solution to the conflict Russia has always pursued yields the  best results. To bank on the assumption that all sorts of  ultimatums will be repeated, and Russia will continue to break  the deadlocks, will not lead to gaining a settlement," Adamishin  said.    He said he disagrees with the allegations that "the Serbs  would have had to yield to the NATO ultimatum anyway, and that  Russia just helped to save their face by asking them to meet its  request, not NATO's ultimatum." "Even though this concerns only  intentions, nevertheless the possibility that the Serbs would  have disregarded NATO's ultimatum cannot be ruled out. Events  could have developed differently, which would have led to  unpredictable consequences," Adamishin said.    According to Interfax's interviewee, the use of intimidation  to achieve one's goal is not the most effective method in  diplomacy. "This does not mean that Russia rejects the use of  force altogether. Moscow agreed that the U.N. forces in former  Yugoslavia can give rebuffs, if attacked. These forces include  Russian servicemen, and we cannot leave them unarmed from this  point of view. The question is that such decisions should be  taken with great considerateness, through the only possible  channel -- the U.N. Security Council," he stressed.    Russia's first deputy foreign minister called for a  continuation of talks between the three warring Bosnian sides.  "This is needed to reach a comprehensive solution in Bosnia,  which had actually been gained. Subsequently the Muslims went  back on it in the belief that they will gain more on the  battlefield than at the negotiating table," Adamishin pointed  out. "But since the ultimate goal is to achieve a final  political settlement, Russia concedes that the plan suggested by  the cochairmen of the international conference on settlement in  the former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, can  be slightly and finally corrected."    The vice president of the Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, Aleksandr Vladislavlev, has described President  Yeltsin's endeavors to settle the crisis in Bosnia as a  remarkable success for Russian diplomacy. The reaction of all  the parties concerned to the Russian president's initiative has  proved that, "when Russia proceeds from its clearly understood  interests and firmly upholds them, it regains the role of a  great power," he told Interfax's correspondent.    Vladislavlev urged all political forces, above all the  Federal Assembly, to discard prejudices and support the Russian  president who has proved to be "an outstanding statesman." He  also called upon all political parties and unions to use this  opportunity to achieve concord in the country.    Russia's initiative concerning Sarajevo is a substantial  success scored by Moscow; it proves that Russia has not  abandoned its long- term policy in the Balkans, the well-known  Yugoslav-born French businessman, Boris Vukobrat, who leads an  international fund for peace and solution to critical  situations, told Interfax.    Nevertheless, Vukobrat pointed out that the withdrawal of  military hardware from Sarajevo "does not mean that peace in  Bosnia has been achieved. However it might become a step toward  peace, if the forces involved in it realize that the holocaust  in Bosnia has gone too far, and that it endangers not only  Yugoslavia, but also Europe as a whole."    He urged the European countries, above all Russia and the  USA, to join their efforts to stop those who "wish to fan the  flames in Bosnia."    Vukobrat called for preventing Bosnia from being divided  into  ethnic states. According to him, this would be "a historic  mistake," since the liquidation of Bosnia is in the interests of  no ethnic group living there. "A divided Bosnia will become a  source of constant clashes, fresh wars and casualties," Vukobrat  pointed out.</p>

"I believe that cooperation between the two countries is  developing very successfully", Jiang Zemin said, opening the  meeting. He expressed confidence that the visit of the head of  the Russian Government would give a new boost to economic  cooperation.    Viktor Chernomyrdin conveyed to PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin  greetings from Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin and  his invitation to visit Russia in early September this year.    During the course of the meeting Viktor Chernomyrdin also  pointed out that Russo-Chinese relations are flourishing and are  not dependent on changes in the political scene. The level of  mutual relations and cooperation which has been achieved between  Russia and China gives hopes for Rusian-Chinese relations to be  switched to a higher stage -- a stage of economic cooperation.</p>

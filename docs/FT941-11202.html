			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bletchley seeks Pounds 5m and forecasts profits advance Bletchley Motor Group is calling for Pounds 5m after expenses via a placing and open offer of 1.53m new ordinary shares at 340p each. The proceeds of the issue will be used primarily to provide finance for the development of a multi-franchise site at Milton Keynes and the development of a new dealership at Letchworth. Kleinwort Benson Securities has entered into an agreement to procure placees for the shares which will then be subject to a clawback by existing shareholders on a 1-for-3 basis. In a trading statement Bletchley directors estimated that profits before tax for the year to end-December would be not less than Pounds 1.75m, an improvement of 43 per cent over last time's Pounds 1.23m. Their intention was to propose a final dividend of 5.1p (4.4p) to make a 9.85p (8.8p) total. The new ordinary shares under the open offer would rank for the forecast final dividend. Bletchley continued to see a 'steady growth' in sales during 1993 with all divisions performing well. Vehicle sales were 'very encouraging' with an aggregate increase in volume of some 20 per cent over the previous year. The shares closed 10p higher at 375p.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases on setback in industrial production Wall Street US SHARE prices finished on an easier note yesterday in the wake of some mixed corporate earnings reports and news of the first decline in industrial production for five months, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.97 at 3,345.42, having spent the entire day in negative territory. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.58 to 417.10, although the American SE composite managed to post a slight gain of 0.79 at 386.87, while the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.26 to 575.47. Turnover on the New York SE came to 208m shares. The morning's news of a 0.3 per cent dip in June industrial production, the first fall in the indicator since January, and a 0.4 percentage-point decline in capacity utilisation, provoked only a modestly negative reaction from investors. Although the figures confirmed that the economic recovery has been extremely sluggish, the very weak June employment report released almost two weeks ago had prepared the market to expect lower output numbers. Second quarter earnings continued to provide some direction for individual stocks. AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 in active trading in spite of reporting a net loss for the three months of Dollars 166m. If write-offs related to a computer project and the settlement of a class-action lawsuit are excluded, the carrier's underlying operating earnings were stronger than expectations. The news from AMR lifted other big airline stocks. Delta gained Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 , UAL Dollars 2 to Dollars 116 1/4 and USAir Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 13 3/8 . Although American Home Products reported record second quarter earnings of Dollars 296.1m (up 12 per cent from a year ago), the drugs group's shares fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , investors being disappointed by the earnings per share. TRW moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 56 3/8 on news of second quarter net income of 96 cents a share, more than double last year's 39 cents, although that included a big charge. Motorola climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 82 3/4 after the company revealed, late on Tuesday, second quarter earnings of Dollars 146m, up from Dollars 119m a year earlier. Cigna lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after the insurance giant warned that its April-June profits will fall below the Dollars 1.25 a share forecast by industry analysts. On the Nasdaq market, Sunrise Technologies jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 9 5/8 after stating that the US Food and Drug Administration had cleared Sunrise's holmium laser system for marketing in the treatment of glaucoma. Herbalife fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 7 3/4 on a report that two senior executives at the company have cut their holdings in Herbalife by more than Dollars 2m since late May. Canada TORONTO closed modestly firmer after active trading. The TSE 300 index put on 8.9 to 3,472.0, while rises outscored declines by 292 to 243. Volume totalled 30.4m shares, valued at CDollars 354.5m. Nine of the 14 sub-group indices were higher. Golds climbed a further 2.34 per cent as the New York spot gold price gained USDollars 2.80 to USDollars 353.85 an ounce. Two of the sub-group's most heavily weighted stocks, American Barrick and Placer Dome, were up CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 34 5/8 and CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 13 3/4 respectively.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y may face damages payment OLYMPIA &amp; YORK could face a court-ordered damages payment of Dollars 120m following a US court ruling that the troubled Canadian property group was in breach of a 1983 contract with a US pension fund. If such damages were to be ordered, this could affect O&amp;Y's efforts to avoid filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. But O&amp;Y stressed last night it might appeal against the ruling and that a decision on damages was in any case some months away. Judge Herman Cahn ruled on Friday in favour of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, a pension fund that in 1983 agreed to lend O&amp;Y Dollars 250m to refinance an office block it built as part of the World Financial Center in New York. O&amp;Y did not go ahead with the loan, deciding in 1984 to borrow instead from a bank group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust. Mr Michael Lesch, the lawyer representing the pension fund, said the ruling referred to 'a classic case of a borrower walking out on a commitment and of a court holding the borrower accountable for its breach.' Judge Cahn has yet to decide on the actual damages, a process that could take several months. The pension fund is seeking Dollars 120m, but O&amp;Y is believed to have set aside around Dollars 23m for possible damages. O&amp;Y said last night it had not yet decided whether to appeal. It called the Dollars 120m claim 'grossly exaggerated'. In a separate development, O&amp;Y severed its ties with two of its three main financial advisers - J. P. Morgan and Burns Fry, the Canadian investment bank. O&amp;Y said this was because it had completed 'the intensive planning, research and analysis phase on its long-term Canadian restructuring plan'. O&amp;Y continues to employ James D. Wolfensohn, the New York firm.</p>

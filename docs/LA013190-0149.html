			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MANILA FINDS BORROWING DIFFICULT  </P> <P> The Philippines, rocked by a coup attempt in December, is finding it difficult  to meet its borrowing target from foreign commercial banks for 1990, Finance  Secretary Jesus Estanislao said today.  </P> <P> The Philippines has tried to raise at least $1 billion in new money from  commercial banks, but Estanislao told reporters he now expects to get "anywhere  between $700 million to $750 million."  </P> <P> "This is lower than I would have wanted to see because I want the Philippine  economy to grow much faster," he said after a meeting with members of the  Cabinet.  </P> <P> "But at the same time I realize now that there is very little new money for  medium- and long-term purposes coming from the commercial banks in the  international markets," he added.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In a meeting held in the prime minister's  bureau this afternoon, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  presented a detailed Syrian answer regarding the continuation of  the negotiations. Syria insists that the withdrawal from the  Golan Heights be complete, but it is willing to recognize  Israel's security needs and to discuss normalization. This is  reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. [passage  omitted]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 2 May carries a  report by Sefi Hendler on the meeting between Christopher and  Rabin, adding that "according to what we learned from political  sources in Jerusalem, progress was indeed achieved in talks with  Syria. Even if it is not exceptional, this is unprecedented  progress on the Syrian track. This is the first time since the  beginning of the negotiations with Syria that the Syrians have  not rejected Israel's proposals out of hand. In their meeting,  Christopher presented to Rabin Syria's answers to the security  issues relating to the withdrawal. This is the first time that  Syria has addressed Israel's security needs. The Syrian  response is currently being examined."]    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said we are at the first stages  of our negotiations with Syria, therefore he cannot say whether  he is optimistic or pessimistic. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir  reports Mr. Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction Israel has not  used Christopher's service for relaying to Syria a withdrawal  map or the final withdrawal lines.    Yitzhaq Rabin said he was furious over the fact that a  regular army battalion is forced to guard 415 Jews in Hebron  instead of fighting terrorism. Mr. Rabin said the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] is being stretched to the limit in guarding the  settlements and the Green Line instead of fighting terrorism.  Rabin said that it is not Elon More [West Bank settlement]  which is guarding Hadera and 'Afula, but rather the IDF. It is  not the number of settlements on the Golan Heights which defend  the Golan, but rather the number of tanks deployed there.</p>

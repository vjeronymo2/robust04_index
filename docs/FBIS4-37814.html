			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 23 (AFP) -- Lebanon is ready to  prevent cross-border attacks with Syrian help if Israel  withdraws its troops from the south, Lebanon's defence minister  was quoted on Thursday [23 June] as saying.    Muhsin Dallul said the government wanted Syrian troops,  which  entered in 1976 at the request of the Arab League, to stay in  Lebanon to help the army in deploying in all parts of the  country following the end of the civil war.    "We need help from the Syrian forces in providing some  brigades to be sent to the south in case there was an Israeli  withdrawal from the occupied areas," he told the United Arab  Emirates daily AL- KHALIJ.    "Our relationship with the Syrian forces is strategic in  this  respect. There are several areas where we need the support of  the Syrians. This issue is not for discussion at all because  the Syrian forces came to Lebanon at an official request and  their stay is still demanded officially."    Israel, which controls a border strip in the south to  prevent  cross-border attacks by Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas, has  accused the nearly 35,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon of backing  the guerrillas.    It has also called for border security arrangements with  Lebanon as one of the conditions for quitting the south.    "We reject any talk about security arrangements with  Israel,"  he said.    "We are sticking to UN Resolution 425 and we have the  capability of preventing any infiltration or operation from the  south against Israel after the implementation of that  resolution," Dallul said.    "But if Israel stayed, then we have a great national  decision, which considers the attacks against the Israelis in  the south as legitimate because we are not policemen for  protecting the occupation. We reject this occupation and  believe the resistance is carrying out a legitimate and national  duty, which must continue so long as the occupation stays."    Dallul said Israel wanted to destabilise Lebanon to scare  away tourists, a key hard currency earner for Lebanon. He  expected Israel to continue attacks on Lebanon but added: "Let  Israel do whatever it wants. We will not fulfill its wishes and  we will not stop resistance attacks."</p>

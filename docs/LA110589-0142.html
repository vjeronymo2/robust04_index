			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: WILLIAMS KNOWS A LOT ABOUT RUNNING TO -- AND FOR -- OFFICE  </P> <P> Reggie Williams burns with envy every time he sees Bo Jackson's television  commercial.  </P> <P> Bo may know a lot of things, Williams admits, but at least he's not doing them  all simultaneously.  </P> <P> Williams, on the other hand, is doing two things at once: trying to hold onto  his job as starting outside linebacker with the Cincinnati Bengals while at the  same time campaigning to remain a member of the city's City Council in  Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> "Bo at least gets to separate them," says Williams, a 14-year NFL veteran  closing out his career this year with the Bengals, and a council member since  last year. "He doesn't have to run from the football field to the baseball  field. I'm doing both at the same time."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Since 1910, an estimated 725 sports-related films have been made,  according to "The Book of Movie Facts &amp; Feats." Name the three sports most  often portrayed in movies?  </P> <P> Now it can be told Before baseball's playoffs, well before the Bay Area World  Series and the disastrous turn of events resulting from the devastating  earthquake, long-time sportswriter-columnist Leonard Koppett invoked what he  calls Koppett's Law.  </P> <P> It appeared in the Oct. 1 issue of the Boston Globe, simply stating that  "Whatever will cause the greatest inconvenience to the most people is what will  happen."  </P> <P> Out for the count Talk about freak accidents . . .  </P> <P> While sparring recently at Ontario's North Bay Martial Arts Club, two  kick-boxing opponents clinched, then tumbled out a third-story window, landing  on a pedestrian below.  </P> <P> The pedestrian was treated at a hospital and released. The two combatants, Jim  Lawrence, 26, and Bradley Sayeau, 23, were hospitalized with serious injuries  after the 30-foot fall.  </P> <P> "It was a freak accident," Ontario Provincial Police spokesman Rick Sapinski  said, before stating the obvious: "It was absolutely unintentional."  </P> <P> Fortunately for the passer-by on whom they landed, the athletes were kick  boxers, not sumo wrestlers.  </P> <P> On this date On Nov. 4, 1960, Wilt Chamberlain of Philadelphia scored 44 points  and set an NBA record by missing all 10 of his free throws as the Warriors beat  the Detroit Pistons, 136-121.  </P> <P> Texas teasers A few of the jokes circulating around the Dallas area, published  by the Dallas Times Herald and reprinted recently by the Daily News:  </P> <P>  -- You know why the Cowboys traded Herschel Walker? Because he didn't fit into  their offense. He wanted to score.  </P> <P>  -- Will the woman who lost her 11 kids here at Texas Stadium please report to  the field. They're beating the Cowboys, 14-0.  </P> <P>  -- Tom Landry is still the only coach the Cowboys have ever had.  </P> <P> Trivia answer Boxing, 179 times; horse racing, 118; and football, 103.  </P> <P> Quotebook Slumping Ram quarterback Jim Everett, who threw three interceptions  and completed only 19 of 45 passes the last time he played in Minnesota's  Metrodome, on his return there for today's game against the Vikings: "You talk  about my confidence. I'll be honest with you. I'll say it's on the lower side  right now."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FBI LOOKING INTO STEINBRENNER FAVORS  </P> <P> The FBI has started a formal inquiry into reports that past and present agents  in the Tampa, Fla., field office conducted personal favors for New York Yankee  owner George Steinbrenner, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported in today's editions that one of the favors included  gathering information on gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility decided last Friday that a  full-scale inquiry was warranted, FBI spokesman Mike Kortan told the newspaper.  </P> <P> Unidentified investigators said last week that Steinbrenner, who also owns the  American Ship Building Co. in Tampa, reciprocated for the information about  Spira by inviting bureau officials to his personal box at Tampa Bay Buccaneer  games and offering high-paying jobs to those who were especially helpful.  </P> <P> The retired agents said the background checks made for Steinbrenner were part  of a long pattern of assistance orchestrated by Phillip McNiff, a former FBI  agent who is now a vice president at American Ship Building.  </P> <P> McNiff, the special agent in charge of the Tampa office at the time, later  became one of three FBI agents, including John Lawn, a former Drug Enforcement  Agency chief, to go to work for Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> Spira was indicted on charges of extorting $40,000 from Steinbrenner for  information to discredit then-Yankee outfielder Dave Winfield. Winfield now  plays for the Angels.  </P> <P> Also Monday, one of Steinbrenner's lawyers, Robert E. Banker, accused baseball  Commissioner Fay Vincent and his investigator, John Dowd, of making a deal with  Spira for evidence against Steinbrenner.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner's association with and payment to Spira caused Vincent to force  Steinbrenner to quit as general partner of the team by Aug. 20.  </P> <P> Banker said Vincent is trying to discredit the eight-count federal indictment  against Spira, who is accused of threatening to harm and attempting to extort  the owner.  </P> <P> Vincent and Spira's lawyer denied the accusations.  </P> <P> "They made a deal with Spira that in return for information damaging George,  they would assist Spira in some way with regards to the criminal prosecution,"  Banker said in a telephone interview. "Or they simply don't want the Spira case  tried because they don't want the public to hear what Spira has to say or what  George has to say. I can't think of any other reason."  </P></p>

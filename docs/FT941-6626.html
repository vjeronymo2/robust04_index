			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Belief, claims and facts on the Catholic Church Sir, So many mis-statements are contained in the Very Rev Hugh Dickinson's article, 'Not all roads lead to Rome' (February 12). His claim of a 'steady stream' of American Catholics into the US Protestant Episcopal Church conflicts with that denomination's documented loss of almost one-third of its membership over the last decade. His assertion that 'the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary into heaven is a belief necessary for salvation' misrepresents the role of dogma in the Catholic Church. He coins the phrase 'Papal fundamentalism' (without even bothering to define the term) and then darkly equates it with 'biblical fundamentalism'. Is it really 'equally oppressive' to be asked to believe: a) that God preserved the body of the Virgin Mary from earthly corruption, and b) that God created the world in six calendar days? He characterises the Papal ban on contraception as an 'outrage against conscience and reason and is known to be by the majority of Roman Catholic lay people and priests'. True, a majority of Catholic laity appears either to dissent from or otherwise to disregard the teaching; but it can only be a small, small minority that characterises it an 'outrage'. Dr Dickinson attributes the stability of faith in the Catholic Church to an 'absolute authority . . . (that) can never admit that it was wrong'. But this overlooks the more basic point that, if Christ's teachings on faith and morality are themselves authentic, and if one believes that Christ protects 'the Church' from 'error', one would assume a fairly consistent and uniform interpretation down through the centuries, whether or not its structure was 'authoritarian'. Whenever any man, theologian or scientist, changes his views, he necessarily begs the question: were you right then or now? For a 'church' to denigrate the beliefs of its ancestors in faith can only prompt the same question. Organised religion, whether Christian or otherwise, has been characterised as a union of faith, morality, and liturgy. True, one can identify 'churches' which trivialise faith and morality. Shinto presents the best case. But the American experience suggests that the 'market' for such a 'church' is extremely small. In diminishing the importance of belief and morality, the Anglican Church is pursuing a 'market niche' of small dimensions. A liturgy, regardless of how 'Catholic', will not sustain its membership. Finally, as in an earlier piece on Bishop David Jenkins, he betrays a deep antipathy to any 'faith' not buttressed by demonstrable scientific evidence. But how different this is from the attitude of Christ Himself, for whom 'faith' was superior to verified knowledge (John 20:29).

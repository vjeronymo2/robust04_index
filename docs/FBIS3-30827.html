			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ol)": "A Battle for the Future Is Under Way"] </F>   [Text] Prague--The Czech Government does not anticipate  any dramatic breaches in the economy's development this year or  any new and fundamental systemic measures. This statement was  made by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus yesterday at a seminar for  senior enterprise managers.    According to him, there will be economic growth this year of  some 2-3 percent. This should be confirmed by the results for  the first quarter, which, of course, will be compared with the  low figures for the first quarter of last year, a period  immediately marked by the collapse of the federation. The  government's aim is to establish the Czech Republic "for all  time" in the world of single-figure inflation.    At the seminar, which was also attended by Finance Minister  Ivan Kocarnik and a number of other government economists and  enterprise representatives, Klaus expressed his concern about  too-rapid wage increases, but he also assured businessmen that  the wage regulation applied by the government this year will be  moderate and mild. The issue involves, he explained later,  ensuring that the current level and structure of wages and other  costs are maintained. Given the current productivity of labor,  infringing them could force Czech enterprises out of their  markets, which is the experience of some West European countries.    In the opinion of the prime minister, an absolutely  fundamental battle over the future nature of our economic system  and societal arrangement is currently under way. The question  is, he emphasized, whether there will really be a free society  in our country, with a free market or a neosocialist system that  would lead us into the same traps as the former communist  regime. When someone regulates something, someone else is  regulated, and we have had very bad experiences with this, he  said. Immediately afterwards, he asked all those present to put  pressure on the tendencies to excessively regulate the economic  processes.    Klaus devoted a great deal of attention to the koruna's  exchange rate. As he said, the koruna's long-term stable  exchange rate is a key element of the entire transformation  process and is a firm mooring for all of the other economic  quantities. The transition to full convertibility, which,  incidentally, has its own specific features in each country, is  not, according to him, a short-term aim but, rather, a long- or  medium-term one.    There is no reason for us to get rid of the fixed point in  the form of the koruna's stable exchange rate now, emphasized  the prime minister. He cited the need to maintain monetary and  fiscal autonomy as another argument against the rapid  implementation of full convertibility because the Western  countries with whom we would be competing do not have to deal  with the transformation tasks we are dealing with. The koruna's  entry onto world markets could also lead to undesirable  speculation in the Czech currency.    In another part of his speech, often punctured with English  or German expressions, Klaus said that the era of rescuing  enterprises via the state budget or the National Property Fund  is coming to an end. As far as social policy is concerned, the  government's aim, in particular, is to improve the specific  targeting of all benefits.    When he was speaking about the government's endeavor to  restrict the bureaucratic moloch, an individual burst of  applause was heard in the almost full congress hall of the  Palace of Culture, where the seminar was held. "I am glad that  someone is happy," responded Vaclav Klaus.</p>

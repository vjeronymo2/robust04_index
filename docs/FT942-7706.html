			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Yen's strength hits Nintendo Weak consumer spending and the sharp appreciation of the yen brought an abrupt end to the spectacular rise of Nintendo, the Japanese video games maker, which yesterday reported a sharp drop in sales and pre-tax profits. Consolidated sales fell 24 per cent in the year to March 1994, to Y485.6bn (Dollars 4.7bn) from Y634.7bn. Pre-tax profits plunged 44 per cent to Y92.8bn from Y166.2bn a year ago. This is the first drop in sales and pre-tax profits suffered by Nintendo since 1990, when it reported lower results because of a change in its year-end. Last year, Nintendo's pre-tax profits overtook those of Matsushita, a company several times its size. Part of Nintendo's difficulty last year stemmed from its heavy reliance on one product - video games - at a time when its main market in Japan was depressed and fierce competition made life difficult in Europe and the US. At the same time, it is also heavily dependent on exports - but the yen's sharp rise against foreign currencies has cut deeply into repatriated profits. Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, president, said the yen's strength had been so damaging on overseas business, it would be nice to be able to pull out of all foreign markets. Nintendo's parent sales fell 17 per cent, to Y467.1bn, with pre-tax profits falling 30 per cent to Y115.1bn. The company forecasts that parent sales will fall again this year, to Y410bn, and pre-tax profits will rise to Y123bn. However, it expects after-tax profits to decline to Y62bn from Y65bn.</p>

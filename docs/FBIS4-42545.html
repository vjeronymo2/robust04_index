			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by </F> Federico Guiglia; place and date not given: "Too Many Wise Guys  in the Senate" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- The result was an 8-5 victory for the  opposition. The defeated majority inevitably took issue with  the referee of the match they had just lost in the Senate. They  accused [Senate speaker] Carlo Scognamiglio of ignoring the  fouls committed by the Left, by permitting the establishment of  a new parliamentary group which at the last moment disrupted the  precarious balance among the committees. Giovanni Spadolini's  successor as speaker of the Senate was not troubled by the  criticisms or surprised by the outcome. Before attending the  dinner given in Clinton's honor, in his first interview with IL  GIORNALE he explained why the controversial clash in the Senate  may in fact have buried associationism forever. "The British  would argue that `rule abuse' [two preceding words in English],  what we Italians would call a trick, occurred in this instance,"  he said. "But abuse of the rules cannot be sanctioned by the  speaker. The obvious shortcomings of regulations that are now  obsolete permit a group of 10 senators to be represented on all  13 committees. The opposition exploited this fact. But the  craftiness displayed -- and of course we may not have a good  opinion of it -- was not decisive."    [Guiglia] Why was it not decisive, if the government forces  were defeated?    [Scognamiglio] It was not the numbers that were the crucial  factor in the majority's defeat. Proportionately, the  government forces obtained more or less their due number of  votes in the Senate. Nothing different happened from what we  already know. People place too much emphasis on the committees,  forgetting that the Senate as a whole is independent. Now the  Senate can act as a "cooling chamber": The majority will have  to reflect on what measures to present. With no excesses.    [Guiglia] Having left through the door, is associationism  reentering through the window?    [Scognamiglio] On the contrary, we are moving toward a  complete democracy. The minority's rights are protected, just  as the government majority is now encouraged to make good laws.    [Guiglia] Let us try to undermine your optimism: The Senate  is turning down that which the Chamber of Deputies approves, and  vice versa. Are we moving toward an early election?    [Scognamiglio] If there is a threat of filibustering, it  means that the minority will have abused its rights, by not  permitting the normal functioning of democracy. In such an  eventuality, all the necessary conclusions will have to be drawn.    [Guiglia] But will the Marxist Carpi, the new chairman of  the  Industry Committee, ever be able to agree to privatization?    [Scognamiglio] The same rules apply to him as apply to me.  Since becoming head of the Senate I have ceased to be a Liberal.  I hope that Senator Carpi will do the same with Marxism.    [Guiglia] With regard to ideology, how to explain the  anti-Italian campaign unleashed abroad under the banner of  antifascism?    [Scognamiglio] I have no idea how it originated. Be that as  it may, a section of the foreign press is misrepresentating the  real situation in Italy. Italy is suffering an injustice, which  will be remedied in time and in practice.    [Guiglia] This prejudice is taking root in Europe, but not  in  America. Is this a coincidence, or is there a historical and  political difference?    [Scognamiglio] In the United States, as in Italy, there is  no  danger of the growth of a nondemocratic right-wing party.  Unfortunately this danger does exist in France, Germany, and  Denmark, and it is probably this that causes the greatest  anxieties.    [Guiglia] You were elected as an innovation in the Second  Republic. What changes have there been, will there be, in the  proceedings of the Senate?    [Scognamiglio] No laws have been passed yet. I think I have  displayed respect for the rules and for the people's will, which  is an area in which it is better that there be no "innovations."    [Guiglia] Well, Irene Pivetti, the speaker of the Chamber of  Deputies, is proving more active than her predecessors. Which  are better: "figurehead" speakers, as in the past, or  "interventionist" ones?    [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to Pivetti's initiative  in favor of Rwanda, I consider it appropriate. The two  parliamentary houses have the power to "address," and the appeal  made to the government by the Chamber of Deputies Speaker  certainly expressed the general feeling of the nation. I would  not talk in terms of activism and passivity. With the end of  associationism, the speakers of the assemblies no longer have  the sole role of mediating between majority and opposition.  They now have the role of guaranteeing the diversity of  expression of majority and opposition.    [Guiglia] Has the time come to carry out the grand reform,  or  has that time passed?    [Scognamiglio] I believe that the Italian people voted  pragmatically. Senators and deputies were elected in order to  have a good government, not in order to carry out the grand  reform. If the government does well, the changes will come in  due course. Otherwise, the issue of the major rules will return  to the forefront.    [Guiglia] Can President Scalfaro remain in his post after  his  statements last Sunday [28 May] about "institutional purposes?"    [Scognamiglio] I have already said that the president  remains  the focal point despite the evident inconsistencies introduced  by the first-past-the-post electoral system. If the president  were to resign, his successor would be the expression of a  political majority to which he would ultimately be  "subordinate." The very fact that Scalfaro is the expression of  a political majority that no longer exists ensures that this  hypothetical problem does not arise. I fully agree with what  the haed of state said: He can only be set aside if and when  there are changes to the Constitution that affect the presidency.    [Guiglia] But is there not an "ethical issue" regarding the  president?    [Scognamiglio] I see no ethical issue regarding the  president.    [Guiglia] In abstract terms, are you in favor of the direct  election of the head of state?    [Scognamiglio] I would say that it is consistent with the  method for electing parliament.</p>

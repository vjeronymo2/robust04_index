			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Late bookings cloud Owners Abroad forecast LATE BOOKINGS by holiday-makers have made it impossible to forecast full-year tour operator profits, Owners Abroad, the UK's second largest travel company, said yesterday. Although bookings have improved in the past few weeks, the expected post-election boom has not materialised. The 1992 package holiday market is likely to be between 6 and 8 per cent bigger than last year, but there are still 500,000 holidays too many on sale, Mr Howard Klein, chairman, said. Owners Abroad has already cut 100,000 holidays from its programme and is looking at the possibility of further reductions. Mr Klein said that, as in any other retail business, there was bound to be further discounting, but he did not expect the industry to engage in large-scale price-cutting during the peak season, which begins next week. 'We are not in a late 1980s price war,' he said. The company announced a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax losses from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 27.2m for the six months to April 30, which was higher than City expectations. However, interim results provide little indication of prospects for the year as a whole because the first half includes only 25 per cent of annual bookings. The annual overhead charge, on the other hand, is spread evenly through the year. In addition, the company does not record profits from a package tour until the holidaymaker actually departs. The company has sold over 1.8m charter-based holidays so far this year, 17 per cent up on 1991. It has sold 80 per cent of its summer programme and 91 per cent of its July holidays. Full-year results would depend on the prices it was able to obtain for the remaining 20 per cent of its summer holidays. 'Discounting has meant that margins have come under pressure,' Mr Klein said. The company has net cash of more than Pounds 100m. It expects to have average annual net cash of about Pounds 50m - the first time it has been cash positive throughout a financial year. Turnover was up 29 per cent at Pounds 185m. There was an exceptional item of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 610,000) to take account of the introduction of three new aircraft at the Air 2000 subsidiary. Fully-diluted losses per share were 14.04p (14.66p). The interim dividend is increased by 8 per cent to 0.9075p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin declared that  Moscow is to restore cooperation with the countries of the  Eastern Europe. "At present several nongovernmental  organizations try to establish a normal economic mechanism of  interaction between these countries and they undoubtedly will  have future," he noted in his interview with INTERFAX Saturday  [7 May].    At the same time Shokhin believes that Russia is to  "overcome, in particular, the problems of debts" on the way to  restoration of mutually beneficial cooperation with the  countries of the Eastern Europe.    He believes that there are some advances in Russia's  relations with Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia but  "unsolved debt problems with respect to Poland and Bulgaria  inherited from the USSR" still hinder restoration of  "traditional ties."    Shokhin believes that "the old mechanism of mutual  relations,  in particular, barter deals" represent "the second serious  obstacle" on the way to restoration of mutual cooperation  between these countries. Russia's previous partners are less  interested in deliveries of their strategic resources in  exchange for oil and gas, Russia's traditional raw materials.    Shokhin is convinced that "large projects, as, for example,  construction of the oil pipeline Yamal-Poland-Germany and then  to the Western Europe" should become the basis for cooperation  between Russia and foreign countries because these projects help  to simultaneously solve the problem of employment "both for  Russia and its partners."    In addition, they help to implement "numerous private  projects" which are "the locomotive for economic ties'  restoration," noted Shokhin.</p>

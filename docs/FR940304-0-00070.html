			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra tintinnabula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was found only on the island of Hawaii on the northern to the eastern slopes of Mauna Kea. Today, 3 populations of the species are known to occur on State-owned land extending over approximately 6 by 1 mi (10 by 3 km) from Kilau Stream to Honohina Gulch and containing approximately 18 known individuals (HHP 1991k1 to 1991k6). This species typically grows in dense koa-, 'ohi'a-, and tree fern-dominated Lowland Wet Forests at elevations between 2,100 and 3,400 ft (650 and 1,040 m) (HHP 1991k3, 1991k4, 1991k6, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990). Associated species include other kinds of ha'iwale and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hedyotis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sp. The major threats to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cyrtandra tintinnabula <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are habitat disturbance and plant damage by feral pigs and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a specimen collected on Mauna Loa by James Macrae in 1825, Weddell (1856 to 1857) described  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Urtica sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , choosing the specific epithet to refer to the Sandwich Islands, an older name for the Hawaiian Islands. Later (1869), he transferred the species to another genus, resulting in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the nettle family (Urticaceae) is an erect annual herb 8 to 24 in (20 to 60 cm) tall covered with coarse stinging hairs as well as shorter non-stinging hairs. The opposite, stalked, thin, toothed leaves are 0.6 to 3 in (1.5 to 7 cm) long and 0.4 to 1 in (0.9 to 2.5 cm) wide. Most of the small petalless flowers are male, but they are mixed with some female flowers in clusters 0.08 to 0.2 in (2 to 5 mm) long which originate in the leaf axils. Sepals of male flowers are fused into a four-lobed calyx about 0.02 in (0.5 mm) long which encloses four stamens. The calyx of the female flower, about 0.04 in (1 mm) long and enclosing an unstalked stigma, swells slightly in fruit and encloses a flattened achene (dry, one-celled, unopened fruit) about 0.04 in (1.1 mm) long. The only Hawaiian member of the genus,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnid sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is distinguished from other native Hawaiian genera of its family by its annual herbaceous habit and its stinging hairs. It is distinguished from the alien, naturalized species  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Urtica urens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (dwarf nettle) by the lack of calyx lobes (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurred on the island of Hawaii on the eastern and western slopes of Mauna Kea, the northern to western slopes of Mauna Loa, the Humuula Saddle between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, and the southeastern slope of Hualalai. Twelve extant localities are known, extending over a distance of approximately 38 by 15 mi (61 by 24 km) in much of the historic range of the species. It has not been seen on Hualalai for some time and is presumed extirpated there. Known populations now occur on or near the following areas: Puu Kanakaleonui, Puu Laau, Ahumoa Cone, Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA), and Sulphur Cone. Because the species is an annual plant, the total number of individuals varies with the time of year and amount of rainfall. At the time the proposed rule was written, several hundred to a thousand individuals were known from PTA, a State- and federally owned area of land which is managed by the U.S. Army. Other, smaller populations totalling approximately 80 to 130 plants were located on privately and State-owned land (HHP 1991l1 to 1991l7, HPCC 1991e; Robert Shaw, Colorado State University, pers. comm., 1992). Extensive surveys in 1992 and 1993 indicate the presence of tens of thousands of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in many populations on and near PTA (R. Shaw,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 1993). This species is clearly much more abundant than previously thought. This species typically grows in open  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sophora chrysophylla <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (mamane)- and naio- dominated Subalpine Dry Forests at elevations between 5,840 and 8,600 ft (1,780 and 2,620 m) (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990, HHP 1991l1 to 1991l3, 1991l6, HPCC 1991e, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990). Associated species include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Asplenium fragile, Santalum paniculatum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ('iliahi), and the naturalized  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Urtica urens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (HHP 1991l1, 1991l6; R. Shaw, pers. comm., 1992). Individual  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plants and populations of plants are threatened by competition from alien grasses such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anthoxanthum odoratum <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (sweet vernalgrass) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Holcus lanatus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (common velvet grass); grazing by feral pigs, goats, and sheep ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ovis aries <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); habitat disturbance and damage to plants as a result of military exercises; and fire (HHP 1991l6, HPCC 1991e; Ken Nagata, U.S. Department of Agriculture, pers. comm., 1992). However,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is maintaining large, reproductive populations throughout PTA in areas that are relatively secure from these threats. The thousands of plants found in and along lava flows are particularly unlikely to be threatened by feral herbivores, military activities, or competition from alien grasses (Loyal A. Mehrhoff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. observation, 1993). It is also unlikely that either natural or man-caused fires could destroy a significant percentage of the total populations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  fails to meet the definition of either an endangered or threatened species. Therefore, the Service has withdrawn  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperocnide sandwicensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from consideration for endangered or threatened status (see notice of withdrawal of proposed rule published concurrently with this final rule).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

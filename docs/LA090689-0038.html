			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> St. Louis Cardinal relief pitcher Todd Worrell will be examined today by Dr.  Frank Jobe and may require surgery to repair an injured elbow.  </P> <P> Worrell, 3-5 with a 2.96 earned-run average, would probably miss the remainder  of the season if he sustained a torn ligament, team spokesman Kip Ingle said.  If there is only muscular damage, the right-hander would be placed on a  rehabilitation program and could return in a few weeks, Ingle said.  </P></p>

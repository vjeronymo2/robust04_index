			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 8 (TANJUG) -- U.N. Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali described as relative success the accord on  the one-month cessation of military activities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Geneva Wednesday. This document  came as a compromise which at the last moment saved from fiasco  the conference which the Moslem-Croatian delegation for the  first four days boycotted and then blackmailed to the end.    According to a U.N. spokesperson in Geneva, Butrus-Ghali set  out that the accord was only the first step towards achieving  lasting cessation of hostilities and finding a generally  acceptable political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Head of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) delegation Radovan  Karadzic said prior to the official announcement on signing the  accord that the Serb side has once again demonstrated its sense  for reaching compromise, but expressed doubt this would set the  Moslems on course to peace and understanding.</p>

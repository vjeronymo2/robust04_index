			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL LUNCHES;  </P> <P> HOW TO BEAT THE LUNCH BOX BLUES;  </P> <P> MENUS: THE LITTLEST FOOD CRITICS -- CATERERS COME UP WITH NEW TWISTS ON OLD  FAVORITES IN AN ATTEMPT TO PLEASE THEM.  </P> <P> Having a hard time figuring out what to pack in your child's lunch box? You're  not alone. When we asked some of the best caterers in town to come up with  interesting new ideas for school lunches, the repetition was amazing. There  were lots of peanut butter sandwiches, chicken or turkey in abundance, and more  celery than you can shake a stick at. For dessert -- cookies, of course.  </P> <P> There's a lesson here; these caterers understand the aesthetics of eating. They  know that no food critic is more exacting (or more of a traditionalist) than a  child, and that the last thing any kid wants is to show up at school with Mom's  latest experiment.  </P> <P> When it comes to kids, caterers know enough to stick with the tried and true.  And we know that if you try these recipes, your kids will be very happy when  lunchtime rolls around.  </P> <P> From Don Ernstein, owner of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods, (213) 933-6211  </P> <P> Peanut Butter, Banana and Jam Spirals  </P> <P> Homemade russet potato chips  </P> <P> Carrot curly Q's  </P> <P> Gooey Bars  </P> <P> Fresh or bottled apple juice  </P> <P> PEANUT BUTTER, BANANA AND JAM SPIRALS  </P> <P> 1 loaf Pullman white bread, sliced 1/2-inch thick, lengthwise  </P> <P> Peanut butter  </P> <P> Ripe banana  </P> <P> Favorite berry jam  </P> <P> Trim crusty sides off bread slices.

[Unidentified reporter] You said the [pump-priming] plan has  been approved. Did the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  also indicate its approval?    [Hosokawa] The SDPJ -- please ask the SDPJ directly for a  more accurate account of its views -- said that it is impossible  for the party to agree to the proposed tax reform that links a  tax cut with a tax hike, with the date of implementation clearly  stated. It said that while it could agree with certain points  in creating a national welfare tax, this new tax has certain  aspects that are identical to those of the consumption tax. It  wanted the tax cut to be implemented through issuing short-term  special government bonds, and it asked that a consultative body  to discuss compensatory revenue sources be set up in order to  build a consensus. All parties made very tough statements, but  in the end, they agreed that because the plan was based on the  judgment of the responsible official of the administration, they  could not stop the government from proposing the plan, and they  agreed that they would not stop the government from doing so.  This was the general reaction of the parties.    [Reporter] When did you start to think about this national  welfare tax? That is my first question. The second question  is: From my reading of this [prime minister's press release], I  cannot see how this tax is different from the consumption tax.  I think there will be criticisms from the people that only the  name has changed. In your opinion, what is the difference  between the consumption tax and this national welfare tax?    [Hosokawa] With regard to the national welfare tax, please  see item 1, the big 1, the 1 in brackets in this handout. It  tells about the nature of the national welfare tax and says that  the tax will be used as a source of revenue to build a vigorous  and prosperous society even in the era of the aging society.  That is indeed the purpose of the tax. While we do not have a  clear definition of a special-purpose tax, the purpose of the  national welfare tax is completely different from that of the  current consumption tax. In a broad sense, we can say that it  is a special-purpose tax.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when the consumption tax was  introduced, there was much talk about using it for welfare  purposes. [Former] Prime Minister Uno clearly said during the  upper house elections that the consumption tax will all be used  for welfare purposes. At that time, Prime Minister Uno did not  clarify what he meant. I think Prime Minister Uno did not mean  that this will be used as a special-purpose tax; he meant that  because welfare expenses were expanding every year, the creation  of the consumption tax would mean that much additional revenue  would be available for welfare. Is not the new tax just the  same?    [Hosokawa] This time, the purpose has been stated more  clearly. As I just said, the purpose is evidently different from  that of the existing consumption tax. This should be clear even  from what is written in the statement distributed to you. There  was a lot of discussion about whether we could make the new tax  more clearly a special-purpose tax. However, the building of a  welfare society is not a simple matter -- for instance, building  ramps on the edges of sidewalks, or constructing housing units  for the aged.... Some may suggest that the use of revenue from  the tax be even more limited -- for instance, be limited to  pensions or to basic pensions. However, welfare can be viewed  from various standpoints. Therefore, I believe that the  national welfare tax will be more in line with the welfare  purpose if we think of it as a special-purpose tax in a broad  sense.    [Reporter] May I, Mr. Prime Minister? What is the basis for  setting the national welfare tax rate at 7 percent come 1 April  1997, or three years from now?    [Hosokawa] We have presented a vision for the 21st century.  We are considering the sources of revenue and other factors. A  pension reform will also begin -- we have to deal with it -- and  we need to meet the various needs of the aging society. Under  such circumstances, and judging from various viewpoints, we  decided that a 7-percent tax rate would be appropriate. The  finance minister will give you the details about this. He will  speak about this here later.    [Reporter] You have to make it clear here why it is going to  be 7 percent three years from now. You have to clarify under  your vision for welfare how much revenue would be required for  the aging society, and therefore, how much of a tax burden will  have to be imposed. Without clear-cut figures, there will be no  clear numerical basis. Please be very clear about this.    [Hosokawa] We have not computed the accurate data for the  vision for welfare, and this is only a rough estimate. The  vision for welfare will only be completed by March. While this  is a rough estimate, we have a general idea of the minimum  required revenue. Therefore, we came up with the 7-percent  figure.    [Reporter] If you are saying that this is a rough  estimate, is there a possibility that the figure might change by  1 April 1997?    [Hosokawa] When?    [Reporter] I mean, if this is a rough estimate at this  point,  is it sufficiently possible that the figure might change by 1  April 1997?    [Hosokawa] No, the percentage will remain unchanged. It will  not change. Although I used the term rough estimate, we have  made a general calculation. Maybe the expression rough estimate  was not appropriate. On the whole, we have come up with  definite figures.    [Reporter] But Mr. Prime Minister, raising the existing  3-percent consumption tax to the 7-percent national welfare tax  would mean an increase of 4 percent. Based on current revenue  from the consumption tax, I think there will be a revenue  increase of about 9 trillion yen. However, taking into  consideration the planned 6 trillion yen in tax cuts and the  amount required for the redemption of government bonds, I think  that there will be a tax hike of 1 trillion to 2 trillion yen in  April 1997. The idea of balancing income, consumption, and  assets you mentioned a while ago is, I think, based on the  so-called principle of balancing a tax cut and a tax increase.  Could you spell out why the idea has led to a virtual tax  increase?    [Hosokawa] It is true that as you mentioned, there will be a  tax hike after 1997. However, because the purpose is to  establish a tax system which does not put a heavy burden on  working generations and which is capable of steadily supporting  Japan's aging society, you should not evaluate the tax hike  simply from the point of the tax burden.    [Reporter] I would like to confirm what you have said. I  think what you have said is that the government will incorporate  the national welfare tax revenue into the general accounts  budget. Are you going to devise a way to allow the government  to use the revenue from the new tax for welfare purpose? For  example, a law stipulates what the oil tax should be used for.  Will you formulate a way to make it possible for the government  to use the revenue preferentially for welfare?    [Hosokawa] As I have said, the national welfare tax will be  used preferentially for welfare purposes. My statement here  says that the government will legislate the new tax for this  purpose. As I said earlier, the revenue will be used not only  to pay old-age pensions but also to meet various other demands.    [Reporter] So the tax revenue will not be used specifically  for pensions.    [Hosokawa] That is right.    [Reporter] I understand the idea you demonstrated in your  statement, but it seems that the revenue from the national  welfare tax can be used for any purpose. I think that people  would have the impression that the government changed the name  of the consumption tax to the welfare tax only to reduce  opposition to the consumption tax. Could you explain the  differences between the two taxes?    [Hosokawa] My statement here clearly indicates that the  government will legislate the new tax whose revenue will be used  to realize a vigorous society. I believe that the public will  understand the purpose of the new tax if they read this  statement. I greatly hope that the people will understand its  purpose.    [Reporter] Do you mean to say that despite the fact that  it will not be enacted into a law, a commitment will be made  that the administration in power at the time will use this tax  revenue for this purpose?    [Hosokawa] Well, it will be turned into a legal system.    [Reporter] But the purpose for which the revenue will be  used  will not be specified. Is that right?    [Hosokawa] That is correct. No purpose for its use will be  specified. Yes, that is correct.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I ask a question now?    [Hosokawa] Yes.    [Reporter] Well, it is desirable to make a proposal for such  a reform program. Of course, it goes without saying that this  program cannot be enacted until the Diet approves it.    Well, then, seeing that someone has brought up the same  issue  just now, we understand that the SDPJ is opposed to the program.  Therefore, I would like to ask you your opinion on whether the  program will be passed by the Diet by winning over the SPDJ in  your dealings with the Diet sessions from now on. For instance,  if the SPDJ should insist on continuing its opposition, what  will happen to the current coalition cabinet? Do you plan to  seek the cooperation of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in  settling this issue? What are your views on these basic  questions?    [Hosokawa] To say nothing of the SPDJ's opposition, there  are  also many people within my own party -- the Japan New Party --  who are strongly calling for this issue to be handled with great  caution. Also, discussions were held today on this issue within  all the parties. After very active deliberations within their  own parties, party representatives have finally decided what  action to take.    Incidentally, the case of the SPDJ was mentioned just now.  However, from the government's point of view, and in order to  have this bill passed, we will do our utmost -- because we have  been allowed to make such a decision at the 11th hour -- to  obtain the understanding of all the parties concerned, let alone  that of the SPDJ.    [Reporter] Concerning this issue, I would like to ask you  whether changes might be made to the general program that was  announced today, while efforts are being made to promote  intraparty cooperation, and also whether, Mr. Prime Minister,  you gave a briefing on this program to LDP President Kono during  your talks with him yesterday.    [Hosokawa] No, I did not talk about this program yesterday  because it was only today that this program was brought up for  deliberation at the meetings of representatives, of the Council  on Economic Affairs, and of the government and ruling parties.  Thus, because there was a lapse in time, I did not mention this  program.    [Reporter] No sufficient deliberations have been carried out  on this program within the ruling parties. And, Mr. Prime  Minister, you have put this program before the people all of a  sudden. Therefore, the people must have become, shall I say,  greatly confused. If this program should be converted into a  government proposal without sufficient deliberation being  carried out, I am afraid that our people may gain the impression  that the proposal was formulated very impetuously. What do you  think of this?    [Hosokawa] You have just mentioned deliberations within  parties. Please be informed that each party was asked to set up  a council on economic affairs last December. At the same time,  various issues have been discussed at the meeting of  representatives [of the coalition parties]. And if  deliberations should be carried out at these forums, there  certainly will be numerous issues that will have to be  discussed. It is my belief that as far as the coalition parties  are concerned, appropriate procedures have already been followed.    [Reporter] It seems to me that no discussions have ever been  carried out on the proposal concerning the national welfare tax.  What do you say to this?    [Hosokawa] On the basis of the national welfare tax....    [Reporter, interrupting] And it seems to me that no proposal  for taxation in the form of the national welfare tax has been  presented to the ruling parties for discussion so far.    [Hosokawa] Well, shall I say that this proposal surfaced as  we reached the final stage of consultations? Also,  deliberations have been carried out on this argument from  various points of view. As I have mentioned just now, the basic  precondition for carrying out these deliberations lies in the  vision on welfare issues that I had disclosed on New Year's Day.  Thus, because we have asked for deliberations based on such a  vision, I do not think that our proposal has been made  impetuously.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you promised that there  would be multifaceted discussions at the Council on Economic  Affairs. However, discussions had virtually ceased while the  political reform bills were being deliberated in the upper  house. Moreover, according to the briefing we received, a  considerable portion of the council's deliberations were devoted  to hearing briefings from the Finance Ministry. We have the  impression that the Finance Ministry held sway in the council,  or that the ministry's views were included uncritically in the  plan.    [Hosokawa] That is not at all true. Of course, the financial  authorities are supposed to do their job as the keeper of  government finances. The ruling coalition parties, and also the  administration, spoke from their respective standpoints. For  instance, regarding the term national welfare tax or regarding  the period of implementation, the ruling coalition parties led  the decisionmaking process.    [Reporter] If you claim that the existing consumption tax is  to be abolished and that the national welfare tax is to be  created to be used for welfare purposes, I think it would be  logically more consistent to designate this as a special-purpose  tax for welfare. Why would you include this in the general  revenues?    [Hosokawa] I have reiterated this several times tonight. I  hate to repeat myself, but it would not necessarily be desirable  to limit the purpose to, say, pensions. Considering that  welfare today involves various needs in different areas, to meet  the welfare needs in preparation for the approaching aging  society, we will be more capable of dealing with the needs of  the aging society by designating this as general revenue. This  was the basis for the decision.    [Reporter] Because the plan does not have the approval of  the  SDPJ, did you make the decision being fully aware of the danger  that this might pose to the administration?    [Hosokawa] Not only the SDPJ. It is true that there are many  people in all the ruling parties who have reservations about  this issue. This....    [Reporter, interrupting] For instance, some SPDJ members  hold the radical view that their party should withdraw its  cabinet members from the administration. Do you think that this  is unavoidable?    [Hosokawa] It is natural that the cabinet should unite to  deal with this issue, and I said to the SDPJ today that I need  their cooperation. In this regard, SDPJ cabinet members said  that while they are members of the cabinet, they are also party  members. They would like to talk with their party. That was  what they said, no more and no less.    [Reporter] With regard to the issue of taxation, Mr. Prime  Minister, you used to talk about a reexamination of the ratio of  direct and indirect taxes, and such other issues. Also, one of  your major points has been that the people's understanding is  important. All press briefings in the past never indicated that  the figure of 7 percent was ever discussed at the meeting of the  ruling parties' representatives, or at the Council on Economic  Affairs chaired by Mr. Hata. I think you cannot deny the fact  that the people will have the impression that this figure came  up suddenly today. Do you really think the people will approve  of this figure?    [Hosokawa] Deliberations in the Tax Commission are one way  of  integrating the people's opinions. The decision was made on the  basis of prolonged discussions in the commission. Moreover, we  have three years [before the welfare tax is implemented], and we  are faced with the situation of a rapidly aging population at a  rate not found elsewhere in the world. Considering that we have  to improve welfare and to deal with the aging society, we can  never handle these by irresponsibly issuing deficit-covering  bonds. This is not something that a responsible government can  do. I am sure we can win the people's understanding on this  point.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, may I? At the time of the  political reform bills, you took the position that the  government's proposal was the best but that you had to respect  the Diet's deliberations. This time, it is expected that there  will be a lot of opposition on the issue of the tax rate, or  whether the tax should be a strictly special-purpose tax -- as  has been discussed today -- within and outside the ruling  parties. Will you still approach this problem by taking the  position that the government's proposal is the best but that you  have to respect the Diet's deliberations?    [Hosokawa] It goes without saying that I have to respect the  Diet's deliberations.    [Reporter] Does this mean that there might be some  amendments?    [Hosokawa] Well, I can only say that this would be like the  case of the political reform bills.    [Reporter] Tell us why the national welfare tax is to be  implemented on 1 April 1997.    [Hosokawa] It has often been pointed out that if [the tax]  comes too soon [after the income tax cut is implemented], it  would not be effective, that it would not have any effect on the  economy. The time lag should be extended as much as possible.  From the point of view of stimulating the economy, I think that  that is the most sensible decision. And, from the fiscal point  of view, we have very limited choices. I made the final  decision while giving as much consideration as possible to both  factors.    [Reporter] I have heard that most, not some, SDPJ  members oppose the new tax. I am sure you plan to enact the  bill to introduce the new tax during the current ordinary Diet  session. Your answer may change depending on how the LDP will  react to the tax, but are you confident in having the bill  adopted?    [Hosokawa] What I can say now is that I will do my utmost to  win their understanding.    [Reporter] Do you treat the bill the same way as the  political reform bills? I mean politically....    [Hosokawa] I am not clear what you mean. But this new tax  is one of basic pillars of economic reform. We asked ourselves  whether the government should continue having a tight budgetary  plan, whether it should implement income tax cuts to pull the  nation out of the current recession, and how it should finance  the cuts. The introduction of a new tax is the only choice left  to the government, I believe. Like political reform bills, it  will not be easy to get the bill adopted. It is true that each  political party has members who take a cautious approach toward  this issue. But I have to seek their understanding. For this,  the government intends to make an all-out effort.    [Reporter] If a tax hike is implemented in such a way, many  people will have apprehensions that the 7-percent tax ratio will  probably be raised to 11 percent in the future. What do you  think of this?    [Hosokawa] As I have repeatedly said in Diet  interpellations, the government has the chief objective of  keeping the national burden rate below 1 percent. I think it is  very important to introduce the new tax in such a way that it  does not put too much burden on working generations and the  generations do not lose interest in working. Based on this  idea, I made a decision. I am sure the people will understand  if I explain my idea.    [Dean of the press corps] We are running out of time. We  would like to conclude this conference with a couple more  questions.    [Reporter] There are many points in your explanations that  are hard to comprehend. It seems that your decision is based on  a speculation that it will be necessary to introduce a new tax  three years from now. When you speak to the public, can you  tell them that your decision is based on a speculation? I  think, unless you beg, the people will not accept your idea.    [Hosokawa] I do not quite understand what you are trying to  say. There are demands that to deal with the aging society, a  health care, social infrastructure, medicare, and pension system  should be improved. I said in a New Year speech that to meet  these demands, the government has to ask the people to share a  certain level of the burden. As I said earlier, the government  has not yet calculated exact figures. But roughly speaking,  this expression may not be appropriate as you pointed out, but  roughly speaking, the government has decided on or calculated  rough figures. I think you understand this.    [Reporter] But earlier you said you cannot give figures. If  you have calculated rough figures, you can tell what they are  and explain how you obtained them, can't you?    [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, the Health and Welfare  Ministry will formulate a welfare vision and finish the work in  March. While watching the progress in the ministry's work, the  government will decide on the ratio of the national welfare tax  and other figures. The government intends to calculate exact  figures. My proposal to introduce a new tax is based on this  plan.</p>

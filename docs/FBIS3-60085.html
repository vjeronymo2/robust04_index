The leader of the group, Mir Zafar, 32 and Amin Gaffy, 36,  told the BANGKOK POST yesterday that the help provided by  Pakistani mafias was aimed at boosting the morale of  newly-recruited drug couriers so they do not fear arrest because  they will not be forgotten.    The families of the jailed smugglers also receive material  help from the Pakistani mafia bosses, he said.    Mr Zafar said this was a very shrewd way of luring new  Nigerian couriers into carrying out the illegal work.    He and his group, who have made many trips to Bangkok,  refused to talk about how their group was connected with the  drug-trafficking operation.    However, he said professional drug couriers from his country  are not afraid of being caught because they are sure that  someone will help them and their families if they are imprisoned  in a foreign country.    "All drug couriers have prepared themselves for all  circumstances," he said.    Some couriers come from extremely poor families and the  living conditions at Thai prisons was much better than in their  hometowns, he said.    That is why they are not afraid of being caught, he said.    According to Mr Zafar, Pakistan mafias have linked their  drug  business to other international drug networks, by recruiting  their own countrymen, Nigerians, African nationals, Mujahideen  warriors from Afghanistan, Europeans and Chinese.    Pakistan mafias are influential in their country and also in  the international drug network.    A study by a US accounting firm has estimated the entire  black market economy in Pakistan at US$20.8 billion a year. A  large portion of this income is from the drugs.    The profits allow enough for the drug mafias to penetrate  the  Pakistani state and economy at all levels, such as supporting  political parties in election campaigns.    The profits also allow the drug mafias to buy protection at  the highest political levels in Pakistan, the report said.    According to Mr Zafar, the methods to save jailed drug  couriers include using its own human rights group to launch  campaigns against the Thai government and Corrections Department  officials for alleged inhumane treatment of foreign prisoners  with the hope of getting better treatment from the authorities.    Such campaigns include accusing the prison authorities of  providing poor food to foreign prisoners so that they will get  better food or be allowed to purchase food from outside.    Foreign prisoners who are jailed on drug offences will  always  have enough money to buy things in prison as they are provided  with cash by their Pakistani boss.    Pakistani mafias always plan to find ways for the  repatriation of their couriers, he said.    But Mr Zafar said drug trafficking from Burma, formerly  routed through Thailand, has been reduced in recent months  because of tough measures by narcotics officials.    The masterminds have already changed to new supply routes  from Burma to China or Bangladesh for shipment to other parts of  the world.    Narcotics officials late last year arrested many Nigerian  couriers and seized several hundred kilogrammes of heroin, he  said.</p>

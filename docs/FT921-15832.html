			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Ratners faces downgrading by US credit rating agencies RATNERS, the ailing jewellery group, was dealt a further blow yesterday as both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, announced they were to review its debt for possible downgrading in anticipation of poor trading results on both sides of the Atlantic. S&amp;P will meet the company's management in the coming days to review the group's current trading results, plans and projections. But it placed the BBB rating on Ratners' variable-term preferred American depository shares on credit-watch with negative implications. Moody's also placed the BAA2 preferred stock rating of Ratners under review for possible downgrade. In London, the move caused little surprise and was not thought likely to add significantly to the company's cost of borrowings given the low prevailing interest rates in the US. Ratners shares marked time yesterday as the market awaited further trading information from the company later this week. They closed  1/2 p down at 21p. The company, which has been looking to strengthen the board for many months, is also believed to be close to appointing a non-executive chairman, although any announcement will not necessarily coincide with the company's trading statement due out on Friday. Reports that Mr Gerald Ratner might be removed from the company altogether were played down by some analysts. 'It is hard to imagine a Ratners without a Ratner there,' said one. Chase Manhattan yesterday emerged as the custodial owner of 5.1 per cent of Ratners shares. This nominally makes it the second biggest shareholder behind Schroders Investment Management, which at the end of November controlled 9.9 per cent.</p>

The  number of factories set up by the Mafia to refine heroin in  Sicily is much larger than first thought. The news was  disclosed by the accused in a heroin-processing trial at the  fortified courtroom-bunker in Rome's Rebibbia Prison. A heroin  refinery in the area near Trapani was the largest ever uncovered  in Europe. Gianfranco D'Anna reports.    [D'Anna] During the 1980s from Palermo to Trapani every  Mafia  clan ran a heroin refinery; a flood of drugs was exported to  every European capital and to North America. In the underground  network of hidden refineries in the areas around Palermo and  Trapani, there are at least 40 well-organized clans, but so far  only five of these clans have been discovered; four in Palermo  and another, which is considered to be the most sophisticated  and dangerous, in Alcamo.    Totuccio Contorno, Rosario Spatola, Fabio Savone, and all  the  other informers who are being questioned in the fortified  courtroom-bunker in Rebbibia Prison by Trapani judges, have  stressed how enourmously important the refinery of death at  Virgini in the suburbs of Alcamo is to the Mafia. In its few  months of activity, the refinery produced 1,200 kg of heroin and  was still carrying on with its processing operations when an  additional 400 kg were discovered. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Security Council [NSC] has decided to  ban a request by the Vietnamese to present a cultural exhibition  in the northeastern region. It also set stringent measures for  dealing with hundreds of thousands of illegal foreign workers.  The NSC reasoned that Thailand and Vietnam do not have a  cultural exchange agreement and felt that a cultural performance  should be staged in the capital.</p>

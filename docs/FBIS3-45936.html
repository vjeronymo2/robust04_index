In 1993 alone, China completed investment of 44.7 billion  yuan on fixed assets in municipal construction, an increase of  57.9 percent over the previous year, according to Hou Jie,  minister of construction.    Across the country, large and medium-sized cities have  doubled capacities for supplying water and gas to citizens,  achieving average daily supplies of 6 million tons of water and  1.6 million cubic meters of gas.    The country's daily urban sewage disposal capacity has  increased to 800,000 tons, two times the 1992 figure. Also, an  additional 30,000 kilometers of road were built in 1993.    Many big and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai,  Guangzhou and Shenyang are collecting funds specially for  boosting the construction of public facilities.    At present, a number of huge municipal works have been  completed nationwide, including the Beijing airport expressway,  the huge Shanghai Yangpu river bridge and the sewage disposal  project of the Suzhou river as well as water, power and gas  projects scattered among the capital cities of Hefei,  Shijiazhuang, Dalian, Qingdao, Ningpo and Xiamen.    According to the minister, China also achieved marked  results  in utilizing foreign capital for urban construction. Some 73  cities nationwide had received loans totaling 2.595 billion U.S.  dollars from 16 countries and international financial  organizations worldwide.    These loans helped finance such municipal works as subways,  overpasses and garbage disposal systems.    The minister said that in 1993, China invested a total of  306  billion yuan in urban housing construction, up 78.2 percent over  the 1992 figure, and completed a record 200 million sq m [square  meters] of floor space.    Up to now, 172 cities nationwide have expanded their average  per capita living space to above 8 sq m. The nationwide housing  shortage has been eased to a great extent, according to the  minister.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROOKIE JOHNSON, 29, AGAIN PROVES VALUABLE FOR ORIOLE STAFF, 6-1  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles have found a surprise stopper. He is Dave Johnson, a  29-year-old rookie right-hander.  </P> <P> Johnson got his second consecutive complete game victory Sunday as Baltimore  beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-1.  </P> <P> Craig Worthington hit a two-run home run and Johnson pitched a six-hitter as  the Orioles increased their lead in the East to 2 1/2 games.  </P> <P> The performance gave a lift to a struggling team that had used up its pitching  staff in a 13-inning loss to the Red Sox 13 hours earlier.  </P> <P> As their lead in the East faded, the Orioles brought Johnson up from Rochester  and started him Aug. 1 at Boston. Although he had impressive minor league  statistics, his only previous chance in the majors came with Pittsburgh in  1987. He pitched 6 1/3 innings of relief, all in games already out of hand, and  had an earned-run average of 9.95 before being shipped back to the minors.  </P> <P> Johnson was shelled in his debut. But when the Orioles gave him another chance  at home against Minnesota last Tuesday, he went the distance for a 6-1 victory,  giving the bullpen a needed rest.  </P> <P> "This is the time we needed a complete game," pitching coach Al Jackson said.  "We used seven pitchers last night. He saved us."  </P> <P> Johnson, a Baltimore native, pitched at Memorial Stadium in a high school  all-star game when he was 18. He and his wife live in a trailer park in  Baltimore.  </P> <P> "Usually, when I return to Baltimore, I get a job driving a truck until  spring," Johnson said. "Now I go to work at the ball park. My wife and I look  at each other two or three times a day, and its like we don't realize what's  happening. Nothing could be better than this."  </P> <P> Boston Manager Joe Morgan, who used to drive a snowplow in the off-season, was  impressed.  </P> <P> "He did a great job," he said. "He had a lot of stamina. It looked like he was  out of gas a couple of times, but he kept going."  </P> <P> The Red Sox split the four-game series. Wade Boggs, their best hitter, went  three for 20.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 5, Cleveland 4 -- Among the teams in a position to challenge the  Orioles in the East, the Brewers have shown the most signs that they are  capable of making a run.  </P> <P> Although the usually reliable Dan Plesac failed to hold a lead in the ninth at  Cleveland, the Brewers came back to win in the 10th on a sacrifice fly by Robin  Yount.  </P> <P> It was the fifth victory in the last six games for the Brewers, putting them in  a three-way tie for second with Toronto and Boston, 2 1/2 games behind.  </P> <P> Plesac, who had saved 14 games in a row, was upset when two singles and a  sacrifice fly by Brad Komminsk tied the score in the ninth.  </P> <P> Kansas City 8, Toronto 3 -- Royals Jose Tartabull and Bo Jackson hit home runs  at Kansas City, but the go-ahead run came when Brad Wellman scored on a wild  pitch in the seventh.  </P> <P> Rookie Tom Gordon pitched a strong seven innings and when the Royals scored  four times in the seventh, his record improved to 14-4.  </P> <P> New York 9, Minnesota 7 -- About the time it appears the Yankees are done, they  manage to stay alive in the East.  </P> <P> They trailed, 7-3, going into the eighth inning at Minneapolis. But Steve Sax  singled to start a four-run rally that tied the score, then walked to begin a  ninth-inning uprising that won it.  </P> <P> New York's Jesse Barfield singled in two runs in the eighth and doubled home  two in the ninth.  </P> <P> Chicago 6, Seattle 4 -- Carlton Fisk drove in four runs at Seattle and hit the  White Sox's first home run this month.  </P> <P> Fisk hit a three-run homer in the fourth, but it was Ozzie Guillen's single in  the eighth that broke a tie.  </P> <P> Detroit 4, Rangers 2 -- Lou Whitaker's tie-breaking two-run single with two out  in the ninth inning gave the Tigers a win over the Rangers in Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> With two out, Mike Brumley singled off reliever Kenny Rogers, 2-2, who was  replaced by Texas relief ace Jeff Russell. However, Brumley stole second and  Russell walked Gary Pettis and hit Dave Bergman with a pitch to load the bases.  Whitaker singled to center on a 1-2 pitch. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

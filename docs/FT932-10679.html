			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: ICI share dealing details THE Stock Exchange hasissued details of proposed dealings on a 'when-issued' basis in the shares which will result from Imperial Chemical Industries' proposed demerger and the rights issue from Zeneca, its bioscience part. Last week Salomon Brothers International stopped making an unofficial 'grey market' in the new securities at the Stock Exchange's request. The Exchange said then that it would sanction dealings once the terms of Zeneca's rights issue had been set. Dealings will start at 2.30pm on May 12, the day ICI is to announce the terms. They will be in the new ICI shares, the Zeneca shares ex-demerger and the nil-paid Zeneca rights. All dealings will be conditional on the demerger going ahead. If it does not the trades will be declared null and void. Prices will be quoted on the Seaq system.</p>

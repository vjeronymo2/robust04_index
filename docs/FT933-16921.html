			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Observer: Winged words 'What's in a name?' If Shakespeare's Juliet asked her oft-quoted question at the moment, the corporate world could supply some punny if not funny replies. Ratners, whose name was perhaps indelibly tarnished by association with crap, has re-titled itself Signet Group. The new name has 'a nice ring to it', explains chairman Jim McAdam. Besides, in sound albeit not in spelling, it has transformed what had been an ugly duckling into a young swan. New feathers have also been taken on by Control Securities, just switched to Ascot Holdings. Finance director John Kerslake says that although some old geezers are still around there, that is not why the new name was chosen. Nor has it anything to do with hot water. Moreover, although it's purely a flight of fancy, Kingfisher's progress since its translation from Woolworth suggests yet a further change. Surely Heron would do well to rename itself Phoenix now it is rising anew from the flames - lit by a Ronson, of course.</p>

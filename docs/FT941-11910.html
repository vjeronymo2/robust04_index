			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Fuel VAT debate 'avoided' Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, last night accused the government of deliberately avoiding a further challenge to the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. She said the timetable for discussion of the remaining stages of the finance bill would prevent a vote on an attempt to delay for a year the initial 8 per cent VAT levy, due to take effect in April. She accused ministers of running away from a further vote because Tory backbenchers who had reluctantly backed the government were still being bombarded with criticism from their constituents. Mrs Beckett said the timetable, imposed by the government through use of the parliamentary guillotine, meant the report stage would not be dealt with until after Easter. That would be too late for a new Labour clause on a delay. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, stressed the exceptional length of the 417-page bill and said the refusal of Labour to co-operate in drawing up a voluntary timetable justified the guillotine.</p>

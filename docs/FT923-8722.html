			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Mandarins peel away from the corridors of power Until recently, the public sector was a world apart. The odd ex-headmaster might surface in the Department of Education or an academic economist in the Treasury. But they were highly exceptional breaches of a monastic order. For the rest, civil servants were recruited young, initiated into the mysteries of administration by apprenticeship, and only those sufficiently imbued by Whitehall were judged suitable for senior office. All that is changing. The monasteries are far from dissolved, and are never likely to be while Sir Robin Butler and his ilk preside. But fraternisation is now positively encouraged, not just between the various branches of state administration, but between the public and private sectors. As yet, it is more talked about than happening, but a few of the chief executives of the 'next steps' Whitehall agencies have come from local government, the NHS, even the private sector, and interchange at other levels is increasing. The Environment Department is even running a secondment scheme to encourage 'co-operation and the cross-fertilisation of fresh ideas' between officials in Whitehall and local government. What are the outsiders making of Whitehall, and the Mandarins of life outside? According to a report* by Saxton Bampfylde, the executive recruitment consultants, based on the 'touristic perceptions' gained from interviews with numerous high-flyers who have moved between the two of late, the cultural divide between Britain's public and private sectors is a 'Berlin Wall' which has barely started to crumble. 'Culture' is the word to stress: some of those who moved out to the private sector found the experience considerably less dramatic than they expected. One former civil servant, now working with a leading consultant, said: 'I haven't made that much of a move: in consultancy I work in a similar way with similar people. It's more agreeable and I earn more money. In industry it would have been different.' 'Industry' recurs as the deepest part of the Divide. 'It sounds appalling now,' recalled one civil servant, 'but we thought 'industry', whatever it was, was for northern chemists. People like us went for the Treasury or the BBC.' The interviews revealed ignorance and mistrust to be deep-seated. 'Stated baldly,' says the report, the prejudices came down to two: 'the public sector views the private as venal, vulgar and narrow', while the private sector sees the other as 'timeserving, slow, fixated with process, inefficient, naive and opposed to change'. Far from having bridged the gulf, Saxton Bampfylde believe the 1980s probably widened it further 'by endorsing defensiveness in the public sector and populist - 'less government' - views in the private.' In the words of one senior civil servant they quote: 'I was talking to an otherwise perfectly sensible industrialist about the council and he said 'privatise it'. It was simply idiotic - a knee-jerk reaction - but he was an ardent Thatcherite and that was the rhetoric of the 1980s.' On a less crude level, the Whitehall emphasis on 'process' as against the private sector stress on 'results', and the cultivation of different skills in the two spheres, were found to be key factors. It was not just 'competitiveness' versus 'elegance of expression': in the public service, precedent and a sense of history and continuity matter - but not much in the private sector. Rival dress senses also featured prominently. 'When I left the Treasury,' said one senior banker, 'I gave up my Hush Puppies and bought a proper pair of black Oxfords. Everyone assumed that if you had been in the Civil Service you would be wearing cheap shoes, have a bad haircut, live in Surbiton and only be interested in your pension rights.' This Berlin Wall, it seems, is littered with shoes. * Privatising People? Career moves between the public and private sectors, Saxton Bampfylde, 35 Old Queen Street, London SW1, Pounds 49.</p>

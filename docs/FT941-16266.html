			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: W Midlands Travel in slow lane West Midlands Travel, the largest bus operator in the Midlands which was bought by its employees from the local authorities in December 1991, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.6m for the year to March 1993 on turnover of Pounds 150m. The results, announced to the employees last weekend, were little changed from the preceding year - eight months of which were in public ownership - when pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.8m on turnover of Pounds 149m. Mr Don Colston, chief executive, expects the pre-tax figure for the year to March 1994 to be little changed again at around Pounds 10m. The 1991 buyout, which cost Pounds 72m, was financed solely by debt. Half of this sum has now been repaid, Mr Colston said. Debt repayments have been absorbing cashflow and he noted that funds would have to be found 'in the not too distant future' for investment in the bus fleet.</p>

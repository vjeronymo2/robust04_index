			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] is  preventing electoral registration teams from operating in two  locations of Malema in Nampula Province. The MOZAMBIQUE  INFORMATION AGENCY [AIM] reports that Renamo officials in (Leia)  and (Nicuassula) claim they have not yet been instructed by  their seniors in Maputo to allow the teams to register voters  for the October elections. Aurelio das Neves, chairman of the  National Elections Commission in Nampula Province, told AIM that  if a solution is not reached locally, he could still contact the  Renamo leadership in Maputo today for explanations.</p>

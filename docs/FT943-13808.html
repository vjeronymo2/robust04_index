			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Disabled bill seeks equal, not special, treatment Sir, Having recently returned from Glasgow, where I stayed in one of the few hotels in the UK which has facilities for deaf people, I was pleased to read of Lord Tebbit's comments encouraging hoteliers to improve facilities for disabled customers ('Tebbit fires salvo for disabled', July 14). For too long, disabled people have been viewed as 'problems' rather than as valued customers and a source of revenue. Deaf people have a great deal of loyalty to those hotels which they know have adapted facilities. A lesser-known fact, however, is the low cost that such adaptations involve, and how easy they are to install. In the US, where there is legislation, deaf and hard of hearing people no longer have to plan their trips around where these facilities are to be found. Lord Tebbit expressed concern over the potential costs of the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. Many of the costs in the government's analysis of the bill are inaccurate, and are based on a five-year implementation timetable. The bill provides for the timescale to be approved by the secretary of state and includes both a test of reasonableness and provisions to exempt businesses where adaptations would create undue hardship. The essence of the bill is equal treatment not special treatment. What is needed is full discussion by all sides - business, government, disabled people and their organisations - to ensure that all the UK's disabled citizens have access to reasonable accommodation in hotels and elsewhere.

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Argyll turns to sterling bonds to raise Pounds 150m ARGYLL, the supermarket group, yesterday became the latest UK company to raise fixed-rate finance through a sterling bond issue, a further sign that UK finance directors believe long-term sterling interest rates are unlikely to fall much further from their current levels. The group raised Pounds 150m through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds to meet part of the Pounds 600m cost of its store development programme this year. The bonds, with an 8 1/8 per cent coupon, were priced to yield 8.1 per cent, or 80 basis points more than the 9 per cent gilt due in 2000. Falling UK interest rates, and a move by many companies to shift their borrowing to shorter-dated instruments, has left the Eurosterling market starved of longer-dated paper, with demand reported in particular for bonds of seven years or longer. As a result, yield spreads between corporate and government debt have narrowed steadily in recent months. Other issues recently have been concentrated in the long-dated domestic debenture market, with Forte, the hotels group, last week raising Pounds 200m, the largest issue of secured bonds for 18 months. Mr Colin Smith, finance director of Argyll, said the money raised yesterday has not been swapped into a floating-rate liability, since the company is matching the coupon payments to the expected cashflows from store developments. Although unrated, Argyll was said by bankers involved in the transaction to be seen by investors as a similar credit to rival supermarket group Tesco, which carries a AA3 rating. A Tesco Eurobond issue maturing in 2002 was yesterday yielding around 70 basis points over gilts. Argyll's bonds firmed in later trading yesterday, with the spread over gilts narrowing to 76 basis points.</p>

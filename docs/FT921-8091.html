			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Tories attack Labour's plan for companies THE CONSERVATIVES yesterday turned their election fire on the Labour party's plans for business, claiming that a return to the 'failed corporatism' of the 1970s would represent a charter for the destruction of jobs and enterprise. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, emerged from his pre-Budget purdah to lead a day of ministerial attacks on Labour's proposals for a more interventionist industrial strategy. His speech was accompanied by a Conservative analysis which concluded that Labour plans for a medium-term industrial strategy would signal 'a return ticket to the world of social compacts and social contracts and to the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and the National Enterprise Board'. Among the threats to business, the speech listed proposals for new regulations and red tape of 'baroque proportions'; plans for a minimum wage and greater employment protection which would result in a 'massive' increase in employment costs; the establishment of a 'training bureaucracy financed by a payroll tax'; and interference in investment decisions. Mr Lamont told the Institute of Directors that the Labour public relations offensive was an attempt to disguise the extent to which the party still rejected the central principles of the market economy. 'The fact is that Labour no more believe in a free, deregulated market economy than you believe in a flat earth', he said. The Conservative attack  -launched earlier in the day by Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, and echoed in a Commons debate on industrial relations by Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary - reflects ministerial concern that Labour's approach has won respectability among industrialists. Mr Lamont sought to contrast a Conservative stance based on 'properly functioning markets free from unnecessary bureaucratic interference' with a thinly veiled Labour commitment to constant intervention. He argued that despite a change in rhetoric, the substance of the Opposition's policy documents pointed to a tightly regulated and centrally-directed business sector. Labour would 'draw the teeth' of the Conservatives' union legislation, force companies to submit their investment decisions to 'social audits', raise employment costs by introducing a minimum wage and smother small enterprises in red tape. He characterised its planned training levy as an 'elaborate bureaucratic interference' with the decisions of individual companies. At the heart of every significant training decision would be 'compulsory consultation with trades unions and local authorities'. Labour support for the European Community's and its programme of directives, meanwhile, threatened to add Pounds 5bn to the costs of British business. Parliament, Page 11 Observer, Page 18</p>

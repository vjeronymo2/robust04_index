			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Personal View: Europe cannot afford to miss Asia boat For those of us living in Hong Kong, at the heart of the Asia-Pacific region, these are heady times. Every statistic shows the region as the most dynamic in the world, and likely to stay that way for the decade ahead. The latest report of the Asian Development Bank predicts that the region's developing economies will achieve average annual gross domestic product growth of 7 per cent this year, compared with less than 2 per cent for developed countries. China, whose GDP growth has averaged 9 per cent over the past decade, is tipped to grow a further 13 per cent this year, and 10 per cent next year. Pause a moment and think what that means for Asia's potential as a consumer market: an economy of 1.2bn people - about a quarter of the world's population - growing at about 10 per cent a year. A new age of consumerism is emerging in Asia bringing breathtaking opportunities for trade and investment. To illustrate the point: By 2000, the economies of Asia will together be larger than those of Europe or North America, and will be home to two-thirds of the world's population. The number of affluent Asian households, with an annual income of Dollars 30,000 or more, will rise by 50 per cent, to 50m homes. Average incomes in Hong Kong and Singapore equal the European average, and are already higher than those in the Irish Republic, Greece and Portugal. Asia's imports from Europe amounted to Dollars 129bn in 1991 - Dollars 21bn more than US imports of European goods. The region is already the largest buyer of Europe's food, chemicals, machinery, and textiles and clothing. For its extraordinary potential to be realised, Asia needs the full engagement of companies from all regions, especially the advanced industrial economies. Indeed, Asia would not be where it is today, at the heart of international trade, without immense investment from countries outside the region. But is Europe going to play the same role in Asia in the years ahead that it has played in the past, or will it look inward to the single European market as it struggles with recession? We see executives preoccupied with forging links with the emerging economies of east and central Europe. Will these priorities keep investment and management attention out of Asia - or at least on the margins - at a time of unparalleled opportunity? I raise this because I feel uneasy about forecasts suggesting that the economies of east and central Europe will, within the decade, emerge from their transition from command economies. Hong Kong's experience as mainland China's principal joint venture partner in economic reform suggests that the transition will take longer. China's transition, while comparatively smooth, has not been free of economic and political difficulties. But by capitalising on a range of advantages, it has been able to put perestroika ahead of glasnost and motivated hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurial overseas Chinese to invest in their home provinces. Hong Kong on its border has acted as a funnel for potential investors, an efficient entrepot, and as a base for Chinese companies to learn the ways of market economies. If solutions to Europe's complex economic problems are to take years to unfold, can European companies afford to bury themselves in long-term prospects if it means neglecting opportunities to profit now from buoyant growth in Asia? Opportunities in Asia may no longer exist once Europe has put its house in order. The US, for example, is hosting a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle next week, which is intended to forge closer economic links between the US and wider Pacific region. The US has unveiled an export promotion programme intended to boost annual exports from almost Dollars 700bn at present to Dollars 1,000bn by 2000, with Asia as an important target for growth. Unless European companies move quickly there is a real possibility of missing the boat in Asia. In raising the alarm my motives are not entirely philanthropic, because we in Asia will also pay a price if European companies are not fully engaged in the region. As leaders in innovation and high-tech production in many sectors, we need the stimulus Europe's companies would bring. In short, we need Europe's companies in Asia. Hong Kong can provide a principal gateway to a new economic alliance between east and west. The author, who is chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, will be speaking at a conference in London today on the future of Hong Kong</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: A question of Trust To the outsider at least yesterday's Pounds 9.5m out-of-court settlement between Drayton Consolidated Trust and Invesco MIM is highly unsatisfactory. Obviously if this were another Guinness or Blue Arrow - which it is plainly not - the Serious Fraud Office would have been on the job by now. It is not every day, though, that a fund management group agrees to hand back to its client the equivalent of 10 years' hard earned fees, as well as consciously paying Pounds 3m over the odds to purchase two of its unquoted investments. The lack of transparency may not be important for the narrow self interest of long-suffering Drayton shareholders. It would be reassuring to know the assumptions on which the payments have been calculated, but no doubt County and Cazenove have extracted the best terms in the circumstances. What is perplexing in a wider context, though, is the nature of the problem. It is obviously more than lousy stock picking, since there are plenty of other red-faced investment managers which have seen the asset values of their unquoted portfolios plunge 50-60 per cent over the last five years. Judging by yesterday's statement, however - which refers to all the circumstances of Invesco MIM's management of Drayton Consolidated - there is more to it than just the disastrous episode of the investment in the Scottish confectionery manufacturer Alma. Shareholders in both camps might like to suck it and see. Perhaps the real trouble is that the City does not wish to hold up a mirror to Invesco MIM. There is no suggestion of anything illegal - but by all accounts full disclosure of what happened at Drayton Consolidated would raise delicate issues such as multiple directorships, cross-holdings, and co-investing by employees. There has been a lot of talk about corporate governance lately; the City has some catching up to do.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and  chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, left Amman this evening  following a two-day visit to Jordan. During the visit, he met  with His Majesty King Husayn and several senior Jordanian  officials.    In press statements, Papoulias said that the EC understands  His Majesty King Husayn's great role, and fully understands both  Jordan's needs and the necessity of extending aid to it after it  has sustained damages as a result of the Gulf war and the  inspections in the port of al-'Aqabah.    Papoulias added that he conveyed to King Husayn a letter of  thanks and appreciation from the EC for his majesty's role in  the reconciliation among Yemeni leaders. Asked about the  possibility of requesting the EC to disarm the Israeli settlers  in the occupied Arab territories, Papoulias said: There is a  joint declaration by the EC. We believe we can push this  request forward. He noted that an appropriate atmosphere should  be created to resume the peace negotiations by pooling various  efforts.    Papoulias said that after ending his regional tour on  Sunday,  he will head for Brussels to meet with his EC colleagues in  order to brief them on the outcome of his tour. He expressed  hope that the EC will take new initiatives on the region in  order to promote the peace process.    Asked whether it is possible to convince Israel to allow the  deployment of international troops in the occupied Arab  territories to protect the civilians there, Papoulias said: We  will seriously discuss this problem. An alternative solution  would be to send international observers, so we can secure the  resumption of the peace negotiations and dialogue. We will also  discuss various ways and means to guarantee security for the  Palestinians.    Papoulias was seen off at Amman airport by Talal Sat'an  al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; the Jordanian  ambassador to Greece; and the Greek ambassador in Amman.</p>

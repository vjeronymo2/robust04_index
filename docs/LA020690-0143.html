			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> FARMER EXONERATED IN DOG DEATH  </P> <P> A San Fernando Superior Court judge has ruled that a Canyon Country rancher  charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a neighbor's dog had a right to  kill the animal because it was trespassing on his property and threatening his  livestock.  </P> <P> Judge John P. Farrell on Monday dismissed the charges against Ernest Lynn  Reubens, 59, who shot Freckles, a brown and white springer spaniel belonging to  4-year-old Erica Owen.  </P> <P> Farrell said he based his decision on a section of the Food and Agriculture  Code that allows livestock owners to shoot any dog trespassing on their  property.  </P> <P> Farrell dismissed the charges after the closing arguments in Reubens' second  trial. The first trial ended in a mistrial in December. In that trial, Judge  Ronald S. Coen ruled that the agriculture code section did not apply.  </P></p>

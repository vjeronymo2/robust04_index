			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 25 Jun (MENA) -- Informed sources in Sanaa  have told MENA's correspondent that Yemeni opposition parties  will submit an initiative to stop the grinding war that has  entered its eighth week between rival sides in Yemen.    These sources explained that the initiative calls for an  immediate cease-fire, an unconditional dialogue, cancellation of  all resolutions and measures that have resulted from the war and  from the declaration of session, and for compliance with the  Pledge and Accord Document as a basis for dialogue.    The initiative also calls for forming a military committee  comprising of all the political forces to supervise the  cease-fire. It notes that resuming dialogue is the only way out  of the Yemeni crisis and the only way to protect Yemen's unity.    Yemeni sources affirmed that the initiative enjoys the  interest of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni  Socialist Party's unionist leaders.    The Yemeni opposition parties include the Nationalist Forces  Federation and the National Grouping of Opposition, which is  comprised of the Right Party, the Yemeni Unionist Group, the  League of the Sons of Yemen, the Nasirite Unionist Organization,  the National Democratic Front, the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party--Yemen's branch, the Democratic September Organization,  and the Nasirite Popular Reform Party.</p>

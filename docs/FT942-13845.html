			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: California earthquake pushes Allstate into loss Allstate Insurance, swamped by catastrophe claims from the recent southern California earthquake, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 275.2m for the first quarter of this year. The loss was a reversal for the US insurance group, which in the same quarter of last year made a profit of Dollars 320.1m. The insurer said the earthquake, which struck the Los Angeles area on January 17, was the second costliest catastrophe in its history, after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The company recently revised its estimate of earthquake losses from Dollars 600m to Dollars 950m. It was the company's second revision; initially it put losses at Dollars 350m. Although Allstate's revenues rose during the quarter by 4 per cent to Dollars 5.32bn, the cost of meeting catastrophe claims from the earthquake and the severe weather which blanketed much of the US during the winter left the company nursing an operating loss (excluding after-tax capital gains) of Dollars 349.4m. A year earlier, Allstate reported an operating profit of Dollars 259.3m. However, Allstate's life insurance operations remained profitable during the quarter, with income rising slightly to Dollars 64.4m on revenues of Dollars 724.6m.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Report says PM ruled out any deal with Fayed The prime minister yesterday published a report by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, after an investigation into allegations of impropriety against members of the government brought by Mr Mohamed Fayed. In the report Sir Robin said that he was asked to investigate the allegations on September 30, one day after they had been brought to Mr John Major by an informant. According to Sir Robin the informant said that the Harrods chief had sought a meeting with the prime minister 'principally because of Mr Fayed's wish to have the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the takeover of the House of Fraser revised or withdrawn'. The report said: 'He had made a number of allegations against government ministers and was contemplating passing them to others.' The prime minister told Sir Robin that it would be impossible for him to meet Mr Fayed. Mr Major added that he would not make any deal with the Harrods chief - 'regardless of the cost to the government's reputation'. On October 3 the prime minister instructed Sir Robin to follow up all the allegations with the ministers concerned. Sir Robin had conversations with the ministers the week before the Conservative party conference. On Monday October 17, after his return from Bournemouth, Mr Major concluded that he should accept the resignation of Mr Tim Smith, the junior Northern Ireland minister. Before this happened, however, allegations that Mr Smith and Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, were paid to raise questions in the Commons on Mr Fayed's behalf were published in The Guardian newspaper. Mr Smith told Sir Robin that he received payments from Mr Fayed between 1987 and 1989 without declaring the information in the Register of Members Interests until just before the end of that period. The report said: 'He acknowledged that he should have done so earlier.' According to Sir Robin Mr Hamilton emphatically denied throughout his inquiries that he had received any payments deriving from Mr Fayed. 'I have found no evidence which controverts Mr Hamilton's assurances on these matters,' Sir Robin wrote. Mr Hamilton confirmed that he had received hospitality from Mr Fayed 'as a private guest, as he believed' before entering the government. He had, however, not thought it necessary to declare it in the register of interests. The report said that when Mr Hamilton became a DTI minister he declared his previous interest in matters concerning Mr Fayed and stood aside from any involvement as a minister in issues concerning the House of Fraser store group, which includes Harrods. Concerning the other allegations made by the informant, Sir Robin said he had looked at them 'so far as I am able' and had put them to the ministers concerned. 'In some of them there are patent inaccuracies and all have been denied explicitly, unequivocally and in writing,' Sir Robin wrote. He added: 'The fact that there is reason to think that these allegations too have now been made available to others who have so far chosen not to publish them suggests that they too may have found that there is a lack of evidence to establish their validity.' Sir Robin does not list the names of all the ministers concerned, nor the allegations made against them. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, confirmed yesterday that he was one of the ministers. He said he had 'never been guilty of any impropriety' as a minister or MP.</p>

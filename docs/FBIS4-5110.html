			<p>BFN     [Text] The Citizens National Bank (CNB) is moving to file  complaints with the Seoul district civil court against the Bank  of China [BOC] for failure to pay 1.2 million dollars of letters  of credit (LCs) on time.    According to the state-run CNB, the Bank of China's branch  in  Shenyang, China, opened LCs for a Korean exporter K.C. Sunil Co.  last year and the CNB purchased trade bills from the Korean  exporter in December. After buying trade bills from K.C. Sunil,  a small-sized trading company which exports aluminum foil, the  CNB asked the Bank of China to honor the LCs opened by the  Chinese bank but was rejected. The CNB said the Bank of China  refused to settle the payments, citing what it claims to be  problems with shipping documents.    The incident came to light as a CNB branch manager involved  in the transaction jumped to death from an apartment in southern  Seoul Friday in despair of the alleged financial fraud. The CNB  claimed that it is customary in international banking practices  for a bank who issued LCs to honor them if there are no special  problems with shipping documents. But the CNB yet failed to  illustrate what was specifically wrong in the shipping documents.</p>

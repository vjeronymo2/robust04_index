The committee, which is chaired by Dr. Nabil  Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, and Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, will  meet next week. The delay will allow the committee to take into  account the outcome of the talks Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa is holding in Israel with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    According to responsible Palestinian sources, the Israelis  are showing some flexibility in handling the Palestinian  requests. In return, the Palestinians are showing understanding  of Israeli security concerns.    The sources say that 'Arafat and Peres agreed during their  meeting in Oslo that the Palestinian flag will be hoisted on the  buildings that will be set up on the crossing points between  Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt to administer  travel procedures. An Israeli security official will monitor  the flow of travelers from behind a smoked, one-way mirror.  [passage omitted]</p>

No matter how good the arguments for deregulation  are, however, they will not produce any tangible results. Why?  Because the problem lies in the procedural law.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The Committee on Economic Reform recently issued its interim  report on deregulation. The report calls for freedom in  principle with no exceptions, and proposes the strengthening of  functions of third-party organizations and ombudsmen (OTO  [Office of Trade Ombudsman]) to accomplish deregulation  effectively. Can we really carry out deregulation?    My view is that the current conventional arguments for  deregulation produce a limited effect. In carrying out  administrative reform, the current method -- a committee  approach -- cannot achieve success unless the administrative  authorities support it. This approach is being used by force of  habit because of the long reign of the former regime. We need to  free ourselves from this way of thinking. Although there are  strong expectations for supervisory organizations and OTO, their  functions, status, and degree of independence are unknown. If  worse comes to worst, these organizations will be a mere  addition to the already enormous administrative structure, and  result in a net increase in the number of government employees  and the amount of their work.    Also, the proposals in the report seem too inclusive and can  be interpreted as a message to all of the ministries to share  the pains of adjustment equally. They don't provide a clear  picture of in which areas deregulation will be focused or how it  will be carried out.    Japan subscribes to the separation of three powers. What's  important is to reform Japan's economic and political systems by  using more effectively the roles of legislative and judicial  powers and thereby achieving a dynamic check and balance between  the two. What I want to stress here is the use of judicial power  in solving the problem.    Speaking of the judicial solution, however, I think that the  existing legal framework contains numerous restrictions, and  that it does not necessarily serve as a means to protect the  rights and interests of the citizens. To make it easier for  people to bring about administrative litigation, we need to make  the procedural law more consumer-oriented. To support this kind  of change, we have to promote further "disclosure of information  on deregulation."  <H5>  All Too Inclusive </H5>   The first paragraph of the interim report raises a question:  "Why is deregulation necessary?" Here, it says, "Each area needs  to be examined equally, and no `sanctuary' should be allowed to  exist. Even in examining such areas as welfare, education,  labor, and finance, this tenet should be applied." In the next  paragraph, the report states that "economic control should be  based on freedom in principle." Then, it goes on to say,  "Control measures over entry, plant and equipment investment,  and imports that have been employed for the purpose of adjusting  demand and supply will be abolished at the earliest possible  time."    All this is quite amazing because if it is done, all the  problems of Japan will be solved immediately. Declaring  "freedom in principle and control as an exception" means that  administrative functions themselves are deemed unnecessary.  Proposals for "reform," including administrative reform, have  been made many times in the past. But this is the first time a  report has advanced a principle clearly to this extent, except  for the final report of the Committee on Administrative Reform  issued recently. In this sense, the current report is  epoch-making, indeed.    The problem, however, is that the report lacks basic  strategies to implement its grand principle.    The current committee approach requires consultation with  the administrative authorities in carrying out the  administrative reform, and thus is up against a big wall. In  fact, the majority of the committee members are former  government officials. As ministries and agencies have the  essential information, they expend great efforts in ground work  to make ambiguous all the points that are unfavorable to them,  watering down the final plan. The interim report, which  proclaims the epoch-making principle in general, does not  specify the effective date for abolishing control over entry or  over plant and equipment investment; it simply states that such  control "shall be abolished at the earliest possible time" and  that "flexibility will be introduced in regulatory control."  This will permit the government officials to evade their  responsibility on one pretext or another in the future.    As a reference, the report lists about 500 related laws and  regulations. Indeed, the list does seem all too inclusive and  looks like an index to a compendium of laws. Does this mean that  all the ministries will share the pains of adjustment? Who is  going to review and examine each of these laws and regulations,  and how? As it stands now, a person in charge of each of these  specific laws and regulations is going to review its contents.  The review will require manpower, and conclusions to be drawn  from such a review seem self-evident.    What's necessary is to present a concrete vision of why  deregulation will be carried out and what kinds of industries  and socioeconomic structure Japan should strive to build. Based  on such a vision, we need to restructure our strategies to  ensure steady progress in deregulation. Just as the  restructuring of the political world became possible, we also  need to change the basic framework for system reform in the  economic world.  <H5>  Corporations Will Also Benefit From Deregulation </H5>   One of the reasons for strong resistance to deregulation  pertains to the issue of employment -- a fear that abolition of  official regulations may increase unemployment.    To be sure, deregulation may cause unemployment in certain  industries and corporations in the short run. However, once such  deregulation is thoroughly carried out, new growth sectors will  surely emerge. They will absorb the excess labor and may even  increase overall employment and productivity. Therefore, it is  important to make steady progress in deregulation so as to  provide business opportunities to new businesses and to  facilitate labor mobility among industries.    Some people might argue that the domestic industries have  grown big because of protective regulations and the increased  public spending. Furthermore, they might say that because of  such regulations, new industries, and innovations were born  through these regulatory webs.    In the postwar years, however, the steps taken to liberalize  and open the market made it possible for Japan to become an  economic power. Liberalization increased competitive pressure on  the domestic front, urging the major industries to invest in  plant and equipment for mass production. This in turn expanded  the domestic market, serving as a driving force for a continuous  increase in productivity.    In speaking of deregulation and import liberalization,  people  tend to emphasize the benefits to consumers. However, the  beneficiaries are not limited to consumers. In fact,  corporations benefit from such deregulation and liberalization.  Most goods and imports that are used by corporations are  partially finished products, not consumption goods. Lower prices  in these intermediary goods benefit the corporations.    In fact, Japan's import liberalization in the 1960's was  made  possible largely by the desire of corporations for lower prices  in raw materials. By switching the energy source from coal to  oil, Japan was able to cut its energy cost and to build its  heavy and chemical industries. If the cost of fuel were high,  the cost of electricity would have been higher, which would  increase the manufacturing costs and the prices of such raw  materials as plastics and synthetic fiber. In a sense,  inexpensive raw materials made it possible for Japan to achieve  the high economic growth of the 1960's.    Currently, Japan's unemployment rate is inching up  gradually.  Because of this, "subsidies for employment adjustments" are  being provided even to such key industries as home appliances  and automobiles, increasing the number of white-collar employees  and engineers who receive 70 percent of their wages and stay  home. An anomaly in the export sector attests to the severity of  the current recession.    Manufacturing companies have surplus labor, and the banks  have bad assets. Being unable to borrow funds, the companies  have been slow to restructuring their businesses. And, even if a  corporate executive wants to make a drastic move in  restructuring and writing off bad assets, he becomes hesitant  because such a move will certainly be accompanied by reductions  in dividends and capital, leading to a management responsibility  issue. Also, the tax system stands doggedly in the way of  mobilization of real estate transactions, as taxes on land  values and transactions are prohibitively high as if they were  penalties. Also, in order to revitalize Japan's agricultural  industry, mobilization of farmland is needed. What's needed now  is to promote mobilization immediately in the labor, financial,  stock, and real estate markets. The solution to the current  recession can surely be found by untangling the rigidity of the  current system.    The subsidy for employment adjustments is too passive as a  policy to be taken at present. Instead of making the existing  enterprises retain their excess labor, we need to create new  industries that will absorb the excess labor. Changing the  direction of incentive giving will be the shortest cut toward  revitalizing the economy. Making it possible for venture  businesses to borrow money at low interest rates, and  considering providing them with preferential tax treatments --  there is a room for government supports.    What's most important, however, is to open up business  opportunities by eliminating entry control completely. This will  immediately make corporations and citizens optimistic about  their future. Redeployment of human resources by companies and  accelerated disposition of bad assets -- that is, ways to  mobilize human resources, funds, and land -- need to be promoted  aggressively. This is why deregulation is urgently needed now.  <H5>  Domestic Industries as Main Pillars </H5>   Restructuring is most needed for the domestic industries.  The  Maekawa Report was based on a premise that the competitiveness  of the export industries had to be weakened to reduce the trade  surplus and thereby to reduce frictions with foreign countries.  However, it used a double standard in dealing with deregulation  issues, leaving the domestic industries almost untouched,  probably because of their large capacity to absorb labor.    The premise of the report has reached the limit now that the  exchange rate is close to 100 yen per dollar. Unless  restructuring is carried out, Japan will never be able to come  out of the vicious circle of adjusting to the strong yen. In the  past, Japan has taken pride in its world-renowned  competitiveness in such manufacturing industries as  semiconductors, automobiles, and home appliances. However, this  outstanding competitiveness has resulted time after time in a  vicious circle; it leads to a rapid increase in exports, which  in turn, sooner or later, is going to raise the value of the  yen, to which the companies have to make bloody efforts to  adjust themselves. Then, once Japan tides over the strong yen,  it is looked upon warily again by the United States and Europe.  We are no longer in the era [when we can afford to repeat the  vicious circle] of "tiding over" the strong yen.    Such domestic industries as agriculture, finance,  construction, distribution, energy, electric power, and gas have  long benefited from protection. They are the underlying cause  for price differentials between here and abroad, making it  difficult for consumers to share the net profits from the strong  yen.    In many cases these industries are "exempt" from application  of the Antimonopoly Law, including these sections on cartels and  the resale system. Even today, when Japan is a major economic  power, such exemption is permitted.    In such sectors as electric power and gas, "local monopoly"  has been allowed, the reason being their public utility status.  In the areas of agriculture and construction, an enormous  structure of vested interests has been created by politicians,  bureaucrats, and businessmen, using public works projects and  subsidies. Such protection of domestic industries has outlived  its historical mission.    Inequality is limited between the continuing protection of  the domestic industries and the pressure on the export  industries for their adjustment efforts and sacrifices; it goes  beyond the structural confines of these industries and their  markets. Such export industries as automobiles and home  appliances are comprised of assembly-type companies that have a  vast array of domestic companies under them. Every time the  value of the yen increased, these companies requested and  promoted reductions in production costs from their  subcontractors that manufacture parts for them. But the  effectiveness of this method has reached its limit. If the  export industries continue to be low, the Japanese economy  itself will become shaky and weakened.    For the Japanese economy to find a way out of this stalemate  and to revitalize itself, a major change needs to be made so  that the domestic industries can become a driving force for  growth. Also, it is important for the export industries to grow  out of their single-minded emphasis on cost reduction and  instead to strive to develop their own technologies and  management know-how so that they will not have to flinch when  faced with another increase in the value of the yen. To do so,  we have to build a socioeconomic structure that will widen the  room for originality and creativity, stressing the principle of  self-responsibility.    Some people say that deregulation takes a long time. But  once  it's done, it can be achieved in a remarkably short period of  time. At present, there are lively new entrants to the  international communications sector. Thanks to this, charges for  international telephone calls, which used to be fixed at about  10,000 yen per a few minutes, have been declining rapidly.  Besides, requests for approval of reduced charges continue to be  filed. By choosing night-time calls for discounts, for example,  consumers can enjoy much reduced rates and a variety of  services. Nowadays, operators will look up telephone numbers in  London, free of charge. Once deregulation begins, therefore, it  will change the existing situation completely and improve the  quality of services as well. Indeed, the "age of consumers" has  arrived. As long as the right objectives and structure are  presented, restructuring can be achieved at an amazingly swift  speed. What hinders such a possibility is the existence of  restrictive regulations.  <H5>  Information Disclosure as a Starting Point </H5>   To make real progress on deregulation, it is necessary to  promote disclosure of information so that the public can grasp  its current status and overall picture. Journalists have been  asking me often lately, "I understand the importance of  deregulation and opening up of the market. But where should we  start?"    This question aptly indicates that the public doesn't have  much basic information on deregulation. Although the grand  principle has been presented at the general level, it is not  clear what kinds of problems have beenmanifested in which areas,  or what sort of insider information the authorities have on  these problems. Unless such information is disclosed, the public  will remain in the dark on specific issues and be forced to  subjugate themselves to government officials.    Another reason why I want to stress the importance of  information disclosure relates to the procedural law. From the  beginning, the framework of Japan's administrative laws has not  been constructed in favor of plaintiffs, the citizens. Under  this framework, if a plaintiff doesn't have enough pertinent  information, he will not be able to win his lawsuit. Therefore,  what matters most is disclosure of information relating to the  regulations. This is a starting point for deregulation. Revision  of existing laws, especially of the procedural law, is necessary  to make the system more consumer-oriented.    The framework of existing administrative law espouses the  concept of the existence of "official power." This concept was  established, modeled after German public laws, prior to the  World War II by professor Tatsukichi Minobe (Tokyo University).  According to this concept, decisions made by an administrative  agency (such as a decision to levy taxes or to disapprove an  application for a license, for example) are considered valid  until such decisions are later revoked, or if they are clearly  invalid. In other words, even if an administrative decision is  illegal, the people subject to the decision are bound by it.    In sum, the concept upholds the administrative power over  citizens. It is an interpretative legal doctrine that was born  the effort to give relief to the citizens under the constitution  granted by the Emperor, and that was considered as democratic  during the prewar period. However, the concept has been rigidly  followed even after the Constitution of Japan was established  [after the war]. This is quite odd in this age when human rights  are to be respected most. In reality, however, the legal views  of administrative officials as well as of judges have not  changed much.    Given the existence of "official power," decisions made by  the authorities are presumed legal for the time being, and,  therefore, the burden of proof rests with the citizen who brings  his complaints in an administrative litigation. As people say  that "one with the burden of proof will lose his case," this  burden is quite heavy, and the chance of winning such a lawsuit  is almost nil for the citizens.    Furthermore, there are rigid requirements in place regarding  the competency for bringing about a lawsuit. "Competency  requirements for plaintiffs" set restrictive conditions, making  it not necessarily possible for anyone to bring a lawsuit. Also,  because of such restrictive conditions as "benefits of  litigation," the subject matter to be judged at a court must be  clear and concrete. However, as it is not quite clear if any  contestable decisions exist in the case of notification or  administrative guidance, an intent for litigation may be turned  down even before it comes to court. Also, as influential  ministries and agencies issue their administrative guidance in  person or on the phone, actual complaints can hardly be  presented in the form appropriate for litigation. Unable to  bring a lawsuit, therefore, the people must remain quiet in  desperation on one hand, and the regulations remain intact on  the other.    Let's assume that one was able to bring a lawsuit after  solving all of these technical problems for litigation. In  reality, however, suing an authority requires lots of courage,  money, and knowledge. And the litigant may be most likely  considered as being disrespectful of authority and accused of  having disturbed the existing order of the industry in question;  he could be "ostracized" as a result. Therefore, to bring a  lawsuit against an authority, some kind of a system is needed  where, for example, company A can pursue a lawsuit, representing  the entire automobile industry.    To solve the aforementioned problems and to streamline the  procedures for litigation, it also seems important to have a  full-scale examination of the legislative framework, adapting  eagerly such new ideas as "litigation by representatives."  <H5>  Litigation Funds for Freedom in Business Operations </H5>   What kind of strategy can we think of in order to dismantle  regulations under the existing law?    I would like to propose establishment of "litigation funds  for freedom in business operations" as a highly effective means  to this end. For example, if each of 2,000 corporations listed  on the stock exchange market, or their presidents, contributes 1  million yen (it could be out-of-pocket money) to the funds to  foot the bills for litigation, the total amounts to 2 billion  yen. Then, an annual report is issued, summarizing the results  of lawsuits financed by the funds. It will raise public  awareness, and at the same time can be usee as leverage to  promote information disclosure.    The litigation funds have the advantage of limiting the  number of freeloaders because successful litigation by an  individual against an authority to ease a regulation will also  benefit a third party in the same situation.    Besides, there is a tendency in Japan to discourage  administrative litigation, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, if  there are no such cooperative funds for sharing the cost of  litigation, no one is willing to bring a time-consuming lawsuit.    Some time ago, Yamato Transport filed an application for a  trucking license with the Ministry of Transport [MOT]. The  application was flatly denied, and the company was unable to  make much progress in this matter for six years. Becoming  increasingly flustered, the company finally decided to take the  matter to court. Then, all of a sudden, the ministry granted a  license, and the matter was resolved. The reason for this is  that "if the matter goes to court, the MOT has to prove the  `reason for not granting a license'" (per Mr. Akio Ogura, NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 17 October 1993). This case proves that  litigation is the final resort, and that it is quite an  effective tactic.  <H5>  Law and Economics </H5>   Many suggestions on deregulation have been made on the  general level in the past. A private-sector, Hiraiwa-style forum  (headed by Professor Iwao Nakatani), in which I participated,  proposed establishment of the "doctrine of legal regulations"  and enactment of the "basic law on regulations." The objective  of this proposal was to reaffirm the superiority of judicial  power over administrative power. However, I'm not sure if this  kind of straightforward approach can break down the fortress of  administrative authorities.    As mentioned earlier, the reason the fortress of  administrative authorities can't be dismantled is that the  current framework of procedural law does not favor citizens. As  long as this situation continues to exist, the authorities will  never be ordered to submit evidence or required to explain  clearly the need for a particular regulation. In the long run,  however, this means that the administrative organs in Japan will  miss the opportunities for tensions and challenges. It is  unfortunate for the citizens at large that the proud  administration of Japan is losing its innate vitality.    In Japan, the basic law does not serve adequately as a check  against administrative control. Defying the possibility of  misunderstandings, I should say that administrative laws in  Japan are written so simply that they can be interpreted quite  flexibly, like molding clay, by the authorities. Also, as a  rule, administrative officials have been trying to resolve  problems by persuasion, rather than by issuing edicts. Such  being the case, the authorities probably have not assessed the  economic effects of regulations in a strict sense.    Because of these reasons, the ultimate point of contention  is  at the level of how each individual regulation is applied. It is  important to put the substantive laws in order, but what's  equally practical is to stress equality in procedural matters so  as to guarantee the correct ways of applying and interpreting  the substantive laws. In this respect, courts of law should be  used actively and flexibly.    To do so, it is important to promote restructuring,  including  that of the legal framework, so as to create a consumer-oriented  system. However, legal scholars do not seem to have developed  their awareness on this issue. Also, there are no specialists in  legal matters in the Hiraiwa Committee who are independent from  administration. More than ever, there seems to be a need for  legal scholars to acquire knowledge of economics.    In the United States, where the arguments for deregulation  were initiated, the importance of [the connection between] "law  and economics" is well recognized. Economists are required to  have common-sense knowledge of the law, and legal scholars of  economics. This is the point stressed by Dr. Coase, who  received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1991. Without being  armed with law and economics, arguments for deregulation, no  matter how good their general theorems are, will be of "no  practical use" in terms of specifics.    Japan has also entered the era when procedural law must be  thoroughly reviewed from the consumers' perspective in  cooperation with legal scholars. Without such an effort to make  a drastic remedy by enacting a set of laws regarding  administrative procedures and information disclosure, the  committee approach will result in a repeated submission of  impractical proposals.</p>

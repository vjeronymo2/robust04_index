			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES MIRROR NET SLUMPS 33%; SOFT AD MARKETS CITED  </P> <P> Times Mirror Co. reported Tuesday that its first-quarter net income fell to $46  million, down 33% from the $68.8 million in earnings the company posted in the  first three months of 1989.  </P> <P> Revenue for the Los Angeles-based media concern -- which owns broadcast and  cable properties as well as the Los Angeles Times, Newsday in New York and the  Baltimore Sun papers, among others -- increased 3% to $875.2 million.  </P> <P> Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive of Times Mirror, said the  company's first-quarter results "were adversely affected by the weak  performance of our advertising-supported business lines, which continued to  operate under extremely difficult market and economic conditions."  </P> <P> Despite the difficult conditions, many analysts continue to believe that Times  Mirror has been spared the brunt of the advertising slump because the largest  of its media properties -- including The Times, the company's four television  stations and some of its cable systems -- operate outside the northeast United  States, where advertising has been weakest.  </P> <P> Yet analysts are divided over whether the advertising slump will remain  confined.  </P> <P> "I don't see the problem spreading throughout the country," said Rodd J.  Macklin, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore. "The L.A.  Times had a fairly decent period in terms of advertising in the first quarter."  Excluding part-run issues, he said, The Times was only down about 2%, compared  to double-digit decreases for some of the company's other papers.  </P> <P> In contrast, John P. Reddan, an analyst for the Moran &amp; Associates Inc.  investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., is more pessimistic: "I don't see any  signs of it (soft advertising) bottoming yet; I could see it getting worse."  </P> <P> Times Mirror's results were also affected by a surge in The Times' daily and  Sunday circulation, about half of which was attributable to the closure of the  Los Angeles Herald Examiner last November. Although the 9.5% gain in The Times'  daily circulation and 5.6% improvement in Sunday circulation helped boost  revenue for the paper, it also increased operating costs.  </P> <P> Times Mirror's newspaper publishing group, its largest business segment,  reported a 38.1% decline in operating profit and a 1.3% decline in revenue for  the quarter.  </P> <P> Times Mirror's professional book companies, which include Matthew Bender &amp;  Co., Richard D. Irwin and Mosby-Year Book Inc., made strong gains, offsetting  an advertising slowdown among the company's consumer magazines. As a result,  the book, magazine and other publishing segments recorded a 21.7% increase in  operating profit.  </P> <P> Cable television also posted increased revenue and operating profit for the  quarter, primarily by attracting more cable subscribers.  </P> <P> Although broadcast television revenue rose slightly in the quarter, increased  programming costs produced a 14.1% decline in operating profit, the company  said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Notorious as an unruly  river in central China, the Huaihe river has now been tamed  after 40 years of effort.    The river flows through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong and  Hubei Provinces, and its valley covers 270,000 sq km. Both the  population and cultivated land in the valley account for one  eighth of the country's total.    As a result of its geographic location in the transitional  belt between southern and northern climates, the valley floods  during torrential rains and suffers from severe drought if there  is no rain.    Soon after China's liberation in 1949 the central government  mobilized farmers and invested 50 billion yuan to construct  irrigation facilities.    The people of the valley have dug 12 new river courses with  a  combined length of 1,400 km and built 5,300 reservoirs able to  store 25 billion cu m of water and other irrigation facilities.    Now the irrigated areas in the valley have expanded to 7.3  million ha, ten times more than in the period before liberation  in 1949.    The output of grain produced in the valley accounts for one  sixth of the country's total, and that of cotton and oil-bearing  crops for one fourth.</p>

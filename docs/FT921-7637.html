			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Provident Financial 6% lower PROVIDENT FINANCIAL, the Bradford-based consumer finance group, saw pre-tax profits fall by 6 per cent, from Pounds 36.1m to Pounds 34.1m, for the year to December 31. Mr John van Kuffeler, chief executive, said that the result was satisfactory when set against the failure of the UK economy to improve during the year and the fact that the group was without a chief executive for five months after the sudden death of Mr Peter Hogg in May. Provident Personal Credit, the largest subsidiary which specialises in weekly collected credit, produced excellent results and kept tight control on its costs and margins, the company said. Two other weekly collected credit companies in the group, HT Greenwood and Lawson Fisher, fared less well because of continuing re-organisation and the impact of the recession on bad debts and sales of merchandise. Mr van Kuffeler said that profits rose by Pounds 5m to Pounds 38m for weekly collected credit as a whole. Provident does not publish figures for its provisions against bad debt but the charge for the year was about 30 per cent up on 1990. Halifax Insurance, the motor insurance subsidiary, reported a 46 per cent increase in the number of its policy holders, particularly in the woman motorist sector. Profits were slightly down because of increased thefts claims and the costs of expansion. Colonnade Insurance Brokers increased its number of branches from 69 to 100 during the year. Peoples Motor Finance suffered from the downturn in the car market and higher bad debts and its contribution to profits was about Pounds 1m below the previous year. Steps have been taken to reduce costs and rationalise the branch network, by reducing the number of its branches from 13 to eight. Provident's staff numbers are 6,700 compared with 6,867 in 1990 in spite of the Colonnade expansion. Group turnover advanced from Pounds 318m to Pounds 360m. Earnings per share came to 46.63p (48.05p) and a final dividend of 16.5p is proposed, bringing the total for the year to 25p (23.5p).</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Producer prices up 0.2% US producer prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in April, the Labour Department said yesterday in a report showing that the weak economic recovery is restraining price advances, Reuter reports from Washington. April's rise in the producer price index matched 0.2 per cent advances in both March and February. The report generally supported financial analysts' views that price pressures are under control and that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has room to lower interest rates without fanning inflation. During the first four months of the year, producer prices had risen by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 per cent, the department said. In 1991, the PPI fell by 0.1 per cent.</p>

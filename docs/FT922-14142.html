			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Shenzhen SE to offer seats to foreign brokers CHINA'S Shenzhen Stock Exchange plans to offer foreign brokers seats so they can directly trade 'B' shares reserved for foreigners, according to the Beijing-controlled China News Service, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. It also quoted sources in Shenzhen, a special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, as saying listings for Shenzhen shares would also be sought on the Hong Kong and Singapore stock markets. 'The Shenzhen Stock Exchange plans to offer seats to some foreign brokers so that they could trade 'B' shares directly,' it said. Although most demand for 'B' shares comes from Hong Kong, brokers in the British colony must deal through counterparts in Shenzhen. Although the news service did not say when action would be taken, it said the aim was to expand foreign business on the market. 'B' share trading started in Shenzhen on February 28 and four stocks are listed for foreigners. 'Shenzhen would select some qualified companies to issue stocks in Hong Kong and Singapore and to list them there,' China News Service said. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is studying the listing of China stocks. Analysts say, however, that problems must be solved first. Accounting standards remain a key problem. The lack of a securities law in China governing how to resolve disputes is another hurdle.</p>

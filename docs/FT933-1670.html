			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Privatisation to pay for French tax cuts THE French government said yesterday it planned to raise about FFr50bn (Pounds 5.69bn) next year on sales of state companies, helping finance a budget that aims to cut both taxes and the government deficit, Reuter reports from Paris. Budget minister Mr Nicolas Sarkozy said the six-month-old conservative government had put together a 1994 fiscal package to contain spending, give a boost to the economy and create jobs. Briefing reporters after presenting the bill to the cabinet, Mr Sarkozy said he was budgeting for economic growth of 1.4 per cent in 1994. The government sees a 0.7 per cent shrinkage this year. The economy slipped into recession in the second half of last year and while the worst appears to have been left behind, unemployment, now at 11.7 per cent, is still marching to new highs every month. Mr Sarkozy had little to add to the budget details that have already dribbled out in recent weeks. A government statement said the priorities were 'containing spending. . . reducing the deficit, supporting economic activity and giving the state the means to carry out the essential'. The privatisation drive is due to be led off by banking giant Banque Nationale de Paris soon and this will be followed by a host of others over the next five years. The government is hoping to raise FFr43bn this year and about FFr50bn in 1994. This will help cut the budget deficit, which has been pumped up by slowing economic growth over the past two years, by 5.6 per cent to FFr299.7bn next year. Government spending will rise by 1.1 per cent next year compared to the revised 1993 budget drawn up in May - a drop in real terms because consumer prices are expected to grow at twice that pace. However, the budgets of the justice, social affairs and education ministries will all rise by more than 4 per cent. The interior ministry will receive 3.7 per cent extra, with spending on policing rising by 12 per cent. The government also confirmed that it would be simplifying the horribly complex income tax system, cutting the number of tax brackets to seven from 13. Income tax itself will be cut, to the tune of FFr19bn. More than 90 per cent of taxpayers will see their income tax bills drop by at least 3 per cent and 44 per cent will pay at least 10 per cent less next year. There will also be sweeping changes to tax on savings, designed to entice savers out of the massively popular money market mutual funds and into either the stock market, to help companies invest, or into straight consumer spending. However, the income tax cuts will fall far short of compensating for July's rise in the broad-based social security tax, the CSG, to 2.4 per cent from 1.1 per cent. That tax will raise FFr50bn for the government in a full year.</p>

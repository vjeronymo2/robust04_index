			<p>BFN     [Text] With President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Russia and  Uzbekistan as momentum, the government agencies involved in  foreign affairs, national security, and public security have  gone into an emergency duty system for a week from today until 7  June.    In particular, these agencies are heightening their degree  of  alertness more than ever before, including preparations against  an eventuality that might arise during the president's absence,  in that President Kim's tour of this time is being made under  the circumstances in which North Korea's nuclear issue is at a  grave stage.    From today on, the military has gone into a special alert  stance [tukpyol kyongye] by strengthening the around-the-clock  watch system, while keeping an eye on the movement of the North  Korean Army and reconnoitering the area along the truce line.</p>

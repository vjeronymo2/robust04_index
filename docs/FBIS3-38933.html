			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sezai Sengun report: "We Have Become Interested in Junk </F> From Russia"]    [Excerpt] Turkey has reached an agreement with Russia to  buy 110 BTR-80 armored vehicles from that country, regardless of  the fact that Ankara has decided to replace the engines and  transmission units of the BTR-60 armored vehicles it purchased  from Russia some time ago. The decision Turkey made to change  the engines and transmission units of the BTR-60 vehicles, which  are used in southeastern Turkey, was made only six months after  the vehicles were put into service. Consequently, the decision  to buy Russia's BRT-80 armored vehicles adds to Ankara's string  of wrong decisions.    Meanwhile, Turkey has also reached an agreement with Russia  to buy 19 MI-27 general purpose helicopters. The preliminary  agreements for the purchase of Russia's armored vehicles and  helicopters were concluded when Lieutenant General Teoman Ekan,  under secretary of the Ministry of National Defense, visited  Russia in January. The cost of the armored vehicles and  helicopters was also established in the talks Erkan held with  the officials in Russia. Turkey will pay $1,650,000 for the  armored vehicles and $65 million for the helicopters. The  agreements will be signed when Minister of National Defense  Mehmet Golhan visits that country.    Recalling that the BTR-80 vehicles have diesel engines,  several arms experts have said that a very important factor has  been overlooked. Stressing that the BRT-80's will be used  against the Kurdish Workers Party militants in southeastern  Turkey, they noted that they are very wide and cumbersome  vehicles with limited maneuvering capability. Meanwhile, the  question of how successful the Turkish pilots will be in  Russian-made helicopters, which are not as advanced as the  helicopters manufactured by the Western countries, has prompted  anxiety. The experts have stressed that the technology used in  Russian-made helicopters and the supply of spare parts may  create a problem in the future. [passage omitted]</p>

The meeting analyzed  commodity prices in the province and discussed a detailed  program on further carrying out price reform, strengthening  macrocontrol and regulation, and controlling price hikes. Vice  Governor Liu Guanghe addressed the meeting.    He said: Last year the province implemented some price  reform measures, as a result the price structure was further  adjusted. This played a positive role in stimulating production,  invigorating the circulation field, making the market  prosperous, and propelling economic development. But there were  also price increases in the province's economic operations.  This mainly found expression in excessive price hikes after  July, which caused an annual increase of 12.3 percent in  commodity prices. [passage omitted]    Liu Guanghe continued: This year is a year of making overall  progress and breaking through focal points in economic  structural reform and is also a crucial year to fulfill the  Eighth Five-Year Plan. To maintain social stability and ensure  the healthy development of reform, opening up, and economic  construction, the provincial party committee and government  demand that price increases in retail sales of commodities in  society be controlled at approximately 10 percent. To achieve  this end, the following points should be given attention.    First, proper management should be exercised over the  momentum of reform. In accordance with central uniform  arrangements, the province's main task in deepening price reform  is to relax control over the prices of competitive commodities  under the precondition of maintaining a relatively stable total  price level, to rationalize the small number of commodity prices  and service charges fixed by the government, to gradually  abolish the two-track system for prices of production materials,  to speed up the marketization of production factors, to  establish and improve the reserve system for important  commodities, and to control their market prices. [passage  omitted]    In principle, no locality or department should introduce new  price increases; if any price increases are to be introduced,  these should be submitted to the provincial price bureau for  approval.    Second, macrocontrol and regulation should be strengthened  and excessive price hikes should be controlled. A reserve  system should be established for major commodities. [passage  omitted]</p>

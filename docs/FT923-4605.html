			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon requests share suspension SHARES in Harland Simon, the control systems group, were suspended yesterday at its request after the company apparently ran into serious financial difficulties. The reason given for the share suspension was the need for clarification of Harland's financial position, a phrase often used when negotiations between companies and their bankers have broken down. Harland, which makes control and automation systems, said it hoped to make a further statement next week. It is understoood that Barclays, Harland's bankers, had called in some of its overdraft facility, leading to a working capital crisis. Harland's overdraft, which is repayable upon demand, stood at about Pounds 14m at the end of July, but has since been reduced by Pounds 6.9m with the proceeds of the sale of Vickereys, a specialist blade and equipment maker. Harland had hoped to use the proceeds of the Vickereys sale to repay borrowings, and then draw down fresh facilities for general working capital needs. However, Barclays has kept the money and is refusing to extend new facilities. Harland has been in trouble since a profits warning in February, prompted in part by exposure to companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Since then the shares have tumbled from 653p and a capitalisation of Pounds 115m, to 20p at suspension, worth only Pounds 3.5m. Mr Roy Ashman, the former chairman, has been replaced and the company has since been dogged by reports of collapsing morale and dwindling orders. The accounts for last year were qualified after its auditors were unable to trace the ownership of a stake in a loss-making information system, PIL. The auditors could not conclude whether PIL was an associate. Borrowings of about Pounds 5.4m represent more than 40 per cent of shareholders funds, which fell sharply last year following losses and provisions. Further disposals were planned to reduce borrowings. A large institutional shareholder said yesterday's announcement was 'totally out of the blue'. He said shareholders were expecting news of further sales, and had believed Harland's banking relationship to be sound.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Retrenchment at YHA UNEMPLOYMENT in Australia and the Home Counties made itself felt in Newcastle yesterday when the Youth Hostels Association announced the closure of its northern England office. The association expects numbers of overnight visitors at its 230 hostels in England and Wales to fall to 1.9m this year, against a 1989 peak of 2.15m. The fall in Australian visitors was partly offset by an increase in the number of Americans who have traded down from hotels to youth hostels in an attempt to make their dollars go further. The number of UK hostellers has fallen sharply as youth and student unemployment has reduced the association's traditional market. Mr Colin Logan, the association's chief executive, said the business lacked recession-resistant qualities. Apart from the closure of the Newcastle office, the association is reducing the marketing department at its St Albans headquarters and cutting the number of field managers. The total number of jobs lost will be 11 out of a management and administrative staff of 120, although Mr Logan said five new jobs should also be created. The association is retaining regional offices in Wiltshire, Derbyshire and Cardiff.</p>

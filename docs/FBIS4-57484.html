			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 19 May (NOTIMEX) -- Tonight, Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate for the Dominican  Revolutionary Party, PRD, demanded the annulment of the  elections held on Monday and the holding of new elections  because of alleged election fraud.    Pena Gomez made the demand before a group of diplomats and  foreign journalists, who arrived in the Dominican Republic to  cover the election process. The Social Democratic candidate  said the annulment of the elections is the only way to prevent  the Dominican masses from trying to seek a solution to the  crisis by themselves.</p>

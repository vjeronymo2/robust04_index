			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES LIFT STAY ON GIRL'S ABORTION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA ORDERS EXPEDITED REVIEW OF 15-YEAR-OLD'S PETITION  </P> <P> The Supreme Court cleared the way today for a 15-year-old Florida girl -- and  any other minor in the state -- to obtain an abortion without the consent of  her parents or a judge.  </P> <P> The justices, without comment or recorded dissent, lifted an order Justice  Anthony M. Kennedy had issued two days earlier blocking a Lake County girl,  identified only as T.W., from having an abortion.  </P> <P> The court's action makes unenforceable, at least until September, a Florida law  requiring some girls to get permission from their parents or a state judge  before having an abortion.  </P> <P> Florida officials, reacting to the high court's order, asked the state Supreme  Court today to expedite its planned review of T.W.'s case, or to allow the  state law to be enforced until the Florida court's previously scheduled  September review of the case.  </P> <P> Kennedy's order had sparked widespread speculation about his views on abortion.  </P> <P> He is considered to hold a pivotal vote in a Missouri case asking the justices  to reverse or curtail the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion. A decision  in that case is expected by late June.  </P> <P> The Florida case began when T.W., who is 12 weeks pregnant, sought a judge's  permission earlier this month for an abortion. She said she feared physical and  emotional abuse if she told her parents.  </P> <P> The judge struck down as unconstitutional a parental-consent law enacted in  February, and his ruling was upheld by a state appeals court.  </P> <P> In the past, the nation's highest court has approved some parental-consent or  parental-notification laws, as long as an unwed girl under 18 and still  dependent on her parents had the alternative of getting a judge's permission  for the operation. About two dozen states have such laws.  </P> <P> But the appeals court said the Florida law was too vague and could result in  arbitrary denials of permission by judges.  </P> <P> The Florida Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to review T.W.'s case in the fall  but refused to let the parental-consent law be enforced until then.  </P> <P> A lawyer who was appointed by the judge in T.W.'s case to represent the fetus  then sought help from Kennedy, who handles emergency matters from Florida for  the high court.  </P> <P> "Minors in Florida are free, without constraint of any kind, to obtain an  abortion," lawyer Richard Boylston told Kennedy. "In the absence of a stay, the  unborn child of T.W., a minor, and hundreds of other unborn children will be  aborted pending a decision by the Florida Supreme Court."  </P></p>

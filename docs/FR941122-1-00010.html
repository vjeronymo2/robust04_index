			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It should be noted here that the Leland Act specifies that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be no mechanism for appropriating funding prior to the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular legislative session in order to qualify for a delay of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effective date. The language in the Act refers to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriating mechanism. If the State legislature fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate the additional State funds in a regular session, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay in the effective date will be granted. Also, the Leland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act does not authorize a delay in the effective date if a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislature is scheduled to meet in regular session in calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 1994, but sometime after April 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For some State agencies, the State legislature may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled to meet in regular session during calendar year 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but the State's laws allow the State legislature to be called  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into special session or provide other means (other than a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session) by which the State may appropriate additional funds. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request for a delay of the effective date should be submitted if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State with a biennial legislature which does not meet in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year 1994 has no mechanism to appropriate the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State funds under State law other than to call a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislative session to appropriate the additional State funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of deciding whether or not to grant a request for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay in the effective date, the Department is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define ``special legislative session'' to mean a legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session that is not scheduled to occur on a regularly scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis. Thus, a regularly scheduled short legislative session in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even number years to consider necessary or emergency bills would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered a regular legislative session. Legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sessions that are not scheduled on a standing regular basis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be called under State law for a specific purpose would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered a special legislative session.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is taking this proposed position because it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes that in many cases a special legislative session could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost a State more than the additional State administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding that would be involved for the Food Stamp Program. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, this position conforms with AFDC's policy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for implementing Section 13741 of the Leland Act which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a similar change in Federal reimbursement rates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AFDC Program. State agencies should note that this position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treats State agencies with biennial legislatures the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether or not the State has called a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> session in calendar year 1994 for some specific purpose or has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chosen not to call a special session.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has also considered how it would interpret the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria in Section 13971 of the Leland Act that a State have ``no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism, under the constitution and laws of the State, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriating the additional funds required *&blank;*&blank;* before the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such regular legislative session *&blank;*&blank;*'' The Act is not clear as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what kind of appropriating mechanism would meet the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation as a sum of money set aside or allotted by official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or formal action for a specific use. Accordingly, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation mechanisms could be interpreted to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process by which the State legislature or other entities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State appropriate funds as well as State procedures to set aside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds from discretionary or emergency accounts for specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, State constitutions and laws provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation by the State's legislature. However, some State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laws also provide other funding mechanisms such as voter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiatives to appropriate funds, procedures allowing State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials or emergency commissions to authorize the spending of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds from the State treasury, another program's revenue account,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or an emergency account, and procedures by which funds previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriated for one program may be transferred to another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. The Department recognizes that while these mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may exist under State law, they may not be useable by the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for several reasons. Voter initiatives to amend the constitution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or law to provide State funding require months just to raise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue to a sufficient number of voters and schedule an election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are beyond the control of the State. Regarding the spending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of discretionary or emergency funds, State officials would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reluctant to declare an emergency in order to utilize emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to transfer funds from the State Treasury or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounts to the State's Food Stamp Program for a non-emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose. Further, the interpretation of what is a State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation under State law as opposed to emergency funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer mechanisms varies by State. The Department believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that State legal officers are in the best position to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what are the appropriation mechanisms that are readily available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and useable under the State law. Accordingly, the Department is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing to interpret the law to cover only mechanisms by which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State legislature appropriates funding and not to cover voter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiative mechanisms and State transfer mechanisms from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary or emergency accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

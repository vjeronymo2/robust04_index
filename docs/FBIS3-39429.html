They will not be allowed to deviate a  single inch from the determined route or take a closer look at  an earth mound or a tree at the giant plant. The strictly  communist North Korea will not allow any inspections of the site  where the IAEA expects underground secret nuclear plants to be  located.    "We know that the two plants exist," IAEA spokesman David  Kyd  told KURIER. "They are clearly recognized on satellite  pictures. They are located right in the center of the Yongbon  site."    However, North Korea categorically denies everything. The  plants in question are merely "military facilities."    In the seven declared nuclear plants where the IAEA will be  granted access, North Korea cannot build an "atomic bomb"; it  can only produce fissile material. "North Korea started its  nuclear program 20 years ago. We are absolutely certain that it  possesses more plutonium than Pyongyang admits," Kyd stressed.  Only 5-8 kg are needed to produce a single atomic bomb.    According to Kyd, only the United States can exert the  required pressure needed to ensure the inspection of the two  secret plants. "The IAEA does not have any instruments; only  Washington has something to offer" -- that is economic aid for  extremely poor North Korea or the U.S. promise to renounce the  large-scale maneuver, planned together with South Korea.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 29, IRNA -- Two Persian dailies today  commented on the recent claims by the United Arab Emirates on  the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and said that such  claims had no impact other than straining bilateral ties.    UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan  [Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan] in a recent interview repeated the  baseless claims over the three Iranian islands of Abu Musa,  Greater and Lesser Tonbs.    `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' in an article said that the statements  had no reasonable basis otherwise the UAE officials would not  have refrained from holding direct talks with Iran. The paper  said that Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati visited the UAE  at the invitation of his counterpart last year to know about the  UAE stance. But the UAE officials did not utter a word about  the islands during Velayati's lengthy talks there. After  Velayati's return to Tehran and contrary to the articles of the  joint communique, the UAE officials resumed their claims over  the islands.    Referring to the invitation extended to the UAE ruler Shaykh  Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan to visit Tehran, the article said  that his refusal to pay a visit to Tehran was an indication to  the fact that the UAE is not following a documented claim but  rather a propaganda ballyhoo which not only is not in the  interest of the region but makes it apt for the Zionist  influence.    Turning to Shaykh Hamdan's statement that the issue will be  referred to international tribunals, the paper criticized that  the UAE officials first called for direct talks but now have  changed their view and stressed that they do not follow a steady  policy.    "If we review history and the time when colonialism had not  found its way to the region, we will find out that at that time  not only the islands belonged to Iran but also no country under  the name of the UAE existed in the region," JOMHURI said. It is  generous of Tehran that it is not following the policy of  changing the present borders among regional countries in an  attempt to preserve the security and stability of the region, it  concluded.    Another Persian daily, `ABRAR' said on the same topic that  Shaykh Hamdan talked about the international court of  arbitration where the very existence of the UAE could be  questioned -- a sheikhdom a little older than two decades which  is now raising territorial claims. The United Arab Emirates,  comprising several sheikhdoms, was a British protectorate until  1971. Since then Britain brought to power one of the nomadic  tribes and turned it to a sheikhdom. it covers not more than  830,000 sq. kms and its population including native Arabs and  immigrants from Pakistan, India and other countries does not  exceed 1,800,000.    The interview of Shaykh Hamdan, son of Shaykh Zayid, was  published by all the media financed by Saudi Arabia and  extensive propaganda was made on this claim.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAN FLED TO WILDS TO 'DISAPPEAR'  </P> <P> Most visitors are drawn to this mountain hamlet for its lush forests, cascading  streams and towering, snow-capped peaks. David L. Schoenecker came to escape.  </P> <P> The 48-year-old chemical engineer from Anaheim Hills fled here after mailing a  letter to an Orange County newspaper columnist saying he had killed his own  wife.  </P> <P> Schoenecker pitched camp in remote, wind-swept areas so cold that ice formed on  the inside of his tent. He was captured Friday by an Old West-style posse a day  after the body of his wife, Gail, 40, was found by Anaheim police. She had been  shot through the head with a .357-magnum handgun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disappearance Planned  </P> <P> Upon his arrest, Schoenecker said he had planned to "disappear into the  mountains of Idaho," police said.  </P> <P> Schoenecker was transferred Saturday from custody in Superior, where he was  held in Mineral County's 69-year-old brick jail, to the Missoula jail, where he  faces an extradition hearing Monday.  </P> <P> Anaheim Detective Dave Tuttle said Schoenecker was moved so he could be closer  to a lawyer of his choosing and because it would be more convenient for Anaheim  police, who are questioning him. Before his transfer, Tuttle and a second  Anaheim police detective questioned Schoenecker for 1 1/2 hours. Tuttle  declined comment on whether Schoenecker had given a statement. Schoenecker was  led back to jail in handcuffs afterward.  </P> <P> A short time later, however, Schoenecker was overheard telling another reporter  in a jailhouse interview that "my mind is very confused" and "I'm afraid."  </P> <P> In the interview, Schoenecker provided some explanation for including certain  people on a list of 54 acquaintances and relatives whom police say he wanted  "punished." Police found the list in Schoenecker's home and notified those  named on it to take precautionary measures. Most live in his home state of  Wisconsin, police said.  </P> <P> Schoenecker said Saturday he had harbored grievances against some of his  classmates in grade school. He said one girl "just slapped me as hard as she  could and threw a book at me, and I don't know why."  </P> <P> That girl's name was on the list, he said. Schoenecker also referred to grudges  he had against two boys from his youth. "We weren't necessarily the best of  friends and not the worst of friends."  </P> <P> When asked what he had planned to do to the 54 people named on the list,  Schoenecker said, "I don't see myself as hurting everybody."  </P> <P> Schoenecker said he mailed a letter to the newspaper columnist Monday, although  he thought at the time "it was foolish." Afterward, he said, he considered  fleeing toward Mexico, traveling through Utah and Nevada. But he disliked that  option because it would necessitate putting stolen license plates on his car,  Schoenecker said.  </P> <P> According to Mineral County Sheriff Wade Van Gilder, Schoenecker bought a lot  of camping gear at a Missoula sporting goods store and drove an hour west to  Cedar Creek Road, near Superior. His car was discovered abandoned there with a  flat tire. Van Gilder said the car was headed toward Hoodoo Pass, which crosses  over the 7,000-foot Bitterroot Range into Idaho.  </P> <P> Schoenecker said he had planned to abandon his car "in a location that seemed  ideal, according to the map." He said he carried with him topographical maps of  the area, as well as for much of the United States.  </P> <P> With snowdrifts of up to 4 feet deep pressing in on both sides of Cedar Creek  Road, Schoenecker was forced to hike along the road, which was covered with  about 3 feet of packed snow, Van Gilder said.  </P> <P> While Schoenecker headed for Idaho, news that a wanted killer was in the area  spread in tiny Superior (population, 1,000). Schoenecker was described in law  enforcement bulletins as armed and dangerous.  </P> <P> Although residents have grown accustomed to fugitives occasionally passing by  on Interstate 90, George Howell, editor and publisher of the Mineral  Independent, said this was something different.  </P> <P> "They thought, 'Here's some nut running around with a gun,' " Howell said.  </P> <P> But Superior is a rough-and-ready logging town, where men cruise around in  pickup trucks with gun racks. The guns are kept primarily for hunting the large  numbers of elk, deer, moose and bear in the surrounding wilderness. So it was  with no trouble that Sheriff Van Gilder called out reinforcements to his staff  of two deputies and two reserve deputies. Two snowmobile riders reported a man  of Schoenecker's description backpacking up Cedar Creek Road. The posse tracked  Schoenecker from where the dust-covered Bonneville had been found abandoned  earlier in the week halfway up the mountain pass.  </P> <P> Answering Van Gilder's call were seven members of the Mineral County Search and  Rescue Team, a group of volunteers frequently called out to find lost hunters  or to retrieve boaters from the swollen Clark Fork River. The group has little  experience, however, in tracking armed fugitives.  </P> <P> "I was nervous. You never know, he could have been waiting for us," said  volunteer Steve Unruh. Two men on horseback bogged down in drifts of snow and  had difficulty going on.  </P> <P> The seven men continued hiking up the road at a rapid pace, picking up  Schoenecker's tracks when they reached the snow level at about 5,000 feet.  Harvey Vincent, a search team member and local newspaper printer, said the  tracks were easy to follow because Schoenecker was heavily laden with supplies  and his steps sank deeply into the snow.  </P> <P> Gordon Hendricks, president of the search and rescue team, said the posse  members could see from the tracks that Schoenecker was slowing down.  </P> <P> "His steps were so short that you could tell he was packing a lot," Hendricks  said. "We found out later his pack must have weighed 100 pounds."  </P> <P> Besides the tracks, Schoenecker left a trail of empty soda cans, a towel from a  Missoula motel and chewing gum wrappers, Vincent said.  </P> <P> Van Gilder said it was apparent that Schoenecker didn't know he was being  followed "until we caught him."  </P> <P> As they closed in, Van Gilder said, he dispatched three helicopters from  Missoula to fly ahead and try for a better fix on Schoenecker. One helicopter  spotted Schoenecker trudging ahead up the road, the sheriff said. Schoenecker  even paused to wave at it.  </P> <P> Van Gilder summoned the helicopter back to pick up him and Tim Coleman, a  reserve member of the posse. The copter flew ahead of Schoenecker and dropped  down onto the road. The sheriff and Coleman jumped out, pistols in hand.  Coleman set up position behind a fir tree on one side of the road while the  sheriff got behind a tree on the other.  </P> <P> By this time, Schoenecker had hiked about 20 minutes and came into view. Van  Gilder said he allowed him to walk another 25 yards down the road before he and  Coleman emerged from their hiding positions, guns trained on him.  </P> <P> "I just told him, 'Halt!' and that if he moved I would shoot him dead," said  Van Gilder, 38. "I had a .357 magnum and I was going to use it. I told him to  lie down on the road. He did. He was tired and cold and wet."  </P> <P> Schoenecker was wearing a Windbreaker, leather hiking boots and a baseball cap.  He had a loaded .357 magnum pistol within reach.  </P> <P> Schoenecker said he had spent three nights sleeping in the wilderness and had  packed ample supplies, including "canned beef, cereal, water, toothbrush, some  meat, raisins, cooking (utensils), sleeping bag and tent."  </P> <P> In questioning the man afterward, Van Gilder said Schoenecker used an alias at  first but later admitted his identity.  </P> <P> Schoenecker easily could have lost himself in the wilderness, local residents  said, because the forest is so vast that even expert hunters can lose their  bearings in it. Had he made it into Idaho, residents said, he might have  disappeared.  </P> <P> Van Gilder said Schoenecker was not far from eluding the posse. If he had  reached bare earth again where his tracks would not have shown, the sheriff  said, the posse probably would not have picked up his trail.  </P> <P> "What it boils down to," said Grant Stelling, a Superior grocer, "is that  there's a lot of wilderness out there."  </P></p>

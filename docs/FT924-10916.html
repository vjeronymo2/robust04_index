			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta coffee futures market set a fresh eight-month high yesterday while cocoa touched a nine-month peak. Dealers said the COFFEE market, which reached Dollars 930 a tonne in the January position before closing at Dollars 924 a tonne, up Dollars 33 from Monday, rose on technically-inspired investment fund buying. They thought it could climb further before producers were tempted to return as sellers, but would not speculate on the extent of the upside potential. The rise in COCOA prices, which mainly reflected sterling's weakness against the US dollar, lifted the March position to Pounds 734 at one point before it closed at Pounds 724 a tonne, up Pounds 9 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices were also aided by the pound's fall, the cash position closing Pounds 21.50 up at Pounds 1,427.50 a tonne. The rise was further encouraged by workers at Codelco, the Chilean state metals group, threatening a strike call at the end of the week if the company did not negotiate on privatisation plans.

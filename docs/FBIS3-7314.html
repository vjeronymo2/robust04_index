			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) President Yohei Kono on Monday [28 March] slammed the  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for its perceived  failure to tackle a number of pressing political tasks.  Speaking at a lecture, Kono pointedly criticized Hosokawa's  abortive tax hike plan that would have replaced the current 3  percent consumption tax.    Stating that the Hosokawa administration has raised doubts  about its political capability since its formation last summer,  the LDP chief also said the government should be blamed for the  long delay in the Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget.  The delay is due largely to the government's decision to  postpone customary year-end budget formulation until early this  year, Kono said.    Kono also demanded that Hosokawa come clean on a  questionable  loan he allegedly received from a scandal-tainted trucking firm.    Kono is the first LDP president who has failed to become  prime minister in nearly four decades. Under the LDP rule that  ended last August, the post of party chief automatically carried  the premiership because of the party's majority strength in  parliament.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf while </F> vacationing in Villa Gesel by "special correspondent" Norberto  Beladrich; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Beladrich] Everyone is still  very well aware of what happened in Santiago del Estero,  surely...    [Ruckauf] I am convinced that Santiago del Estero has not  been a "victim" of the transformation process. What should have  been done there was just not done. There was a chaotic  government, very bad mismanagement of the economy, and an  astronomical financial crisis.    [Beladrich] For you then Santiago del Estero is a unique  case?    [Ruckauf] I did not say that; but it is very different from  the rest because all the ingredients were right for an  explosion. Think back to January 1993, the salary roster  amounted to 20 million pesos; in October it escalated to 36  million pesos, while income amounted to some 5 million pesos...  Other provinces have problems regarding the income-expenditure  ratio, but no province had such a bad ratio as Santiago del  Estero. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN RETURNED TO U.S.;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA POLICEMAN ACCUSED IN ABDUCTION  </P> <P> A 30-year-old Santa Ana police officer, accused of abducting his two children  from his estranged wife's home after visiting them in northeastern England on  Thursday, is back in the United States, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Malcolm Lowery has contacted British police and told them that he and his  children, Sarah Jane, 8, and David Anthony, 7, are back in America and in good  health, according to Inspector Edward Hill of the Newcastle upon Tyne Police  Department.  </P> <P> The children were allegedly taken from the home of their mother, Barbara  Lowery, 30, at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, Hill said. "She left the room, went to  the bathroom, and while she was there he took the children (away) in a car."  </P> <P> Officials on both sides of the Atlantic do not know how Lowery evaded an  all-points bulletin.  </P> <P> Neither Lowery nor his estranged wife could be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Department spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said Lowery telephoned  the department Monday. "He's obtained legal counsel, and he's going to be in  contact with British authorities to resolve the custody situation," she said.  </P> <P> Lowery, who was hired in October, 1987, has been on vacation and is scheduled  to return to patrol duty next week, Thomas said.  </P> <P> "Upon his return, his supervisors will discuss the issue and evaluate his  conduct," she said.  </P> <P> "Basically, the only thing we can say is that British authorities have  contacted us and said they do not intend to file any criminal charges against  Officer Lowery," she said. "They feel it's a domestic issue and not a criminal  issue."  </P> <P> Hill said Barbara Lowery "intends to take legal action to have the children  returned."  </P> <P> The Lowerys came to the United States from Britain in 1985, he said, adding  that Barbara Lowery and the children returned home in 1987 because "she didn't  like America."  </P></p>

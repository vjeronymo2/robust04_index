			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gander seeks Pounds 5m in placing Gander Holdings, a residential property development and investment company, is raising Pounds 5m before expenses, via an issue on a 1-for-4 basis of 71.6m shares at 7p each by way of a placing and open offer. The company specialises in refurbishing properties in Kensington and Chelsea in London and proceeds of the issue will be used to continue its property acquisition programme. Since the present management took over in January, Gander has raised Pounds 2.7m through a 1-for-2 rights issue and has bought a further six properties for Pounds 2.61m. Mr Oliver Vaughan, chief executive, said the residential market in west London was at a turning point. 'There is a window of opportunity to make acquisitions now,' he said. The board believed that the availability of opportunities might have diminished by 1995 as the market continued to improve. The company's shares trade under Rule 535(2), but it intends to seek a listing in due course. The placing and offer is fully underwritten by Charles Stanley &amp; Company.</p>

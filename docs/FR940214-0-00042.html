			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Each State architect/engineer (A/E) will compile and maintain data on costs of all projects. Total project estimates will be compared with estimates available through the Marshall &amp; Swift computer program. These estimates, along with the line item costs recorded in FmHA's Automated Multi-Housing Accounting System (AMAS) cost tracking system, will be used to establish a benchmark for future project costs. Any proposal that exceeds these costs must be carefully evaluated for possible cost reductions. The borrower will be responsible for resolving the differences in cost to bring the project into line with the lesser of the cost tracking system or Marshall &amp; Swift estimates. Final determinations must be realistic, interrelated to maintenance and operation costs, and based upon local conditions and common sense. The State will consider circumstances such as high land costs, remote rural areas, etc., which could present a problem in achieving such an alignment of costs. The AMAS cost tracking system will be used to record both estimates and actual line item costs. At the time the preapplication estimates are being examined by FmHA, the percentages for builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements will be calculated to determine if they are within the allowable percentages established in this paragraph. They will again be calculated at the time the final estimates are submitted to FmHA. Estimated amounts in excess of the allowable percentages will be reduced to the appropriate percentage. Once the final estimates are approved by FmHA, payment of builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements will not exceed the estimated amounts. Allowable percentages for builder's profit, general overhead, and general requirements will not exceed 10 percent, 4 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. This will not be interpreted to mean that, if historical percentages for these costs were below 10, 4, and 7, respectively, FmHA will allow the costs to be increased automatically. Adequate justification and documentation will be required to approve an increase to 10, 4, or 7 percent for cases where any of the costs were previously below those levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The elimination or reduction of unnecessary delays in application processing can contribute to cost containment through lower interest and other business expenses on land, inventory, tests, design studies, etc. When reasonable processing timeframes are established, known and followed, appropriate time can be planned for preparing quality application and construction documents. This can result in better instructions to the builder, fewer errors and lower construction costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Most materials and systems are available in a range of qualities and prices. The construction documents will be carefully reviewed for specifications that require qualities or grades higher than necessary. These specifications will be accepted only if fully justified and no reasonable alternatives are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Designs which employ standard building material dimensions and reduce waste will be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Sites will require a minimum amount of site development work. The State Director may authorize a site requiring higher than normal site development costs only if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The proposed site and site development costs are less than the cost of the normal site and site development costs; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) There are no other sites available in the market area with a lower combined cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) All project site densities (units per acre) will be within the following ranges, regardless of site conditions unless local zoning requirements dictate otherwise:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

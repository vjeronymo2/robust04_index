			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Jordanian side, led by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan,  minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Greek side, led  by Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and the current  chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, held a session of talks  at the Foreign Ministry this morning.    The two sides addressed friendly bilateral relations and  ways  of enhancing them, as well as relations with the EC. They also  discussed the latest developments in the region and in the peace  process.    Al-Hasan stressed the deep relations of friendship and  cooperation between Jordan and both Greece and the EC. The  special relations King Husayn has with European leaders have  contributed a great deal to developing these relations.    Al-Hasan reviewed the developments in the peace process and  Jordan's important, pivotal role through its constant calls for  achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. He also  reviewed the tremendous, courageous efforts His Majesty King  Husayn has made to advance the peace process toward its  objectives in line with Resolutions 242 and 338 and the  foundations of international legitimacy on which it was  launched. These foundations are represented in Israel's  withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, ensuring the  legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national  soil, ensuring Jordan's rights to territory and water, and  resolving the problem of the refugees.    Al-Hasan pointed out that Jordan has borne great burdens as  a  result of the repercussions of the Arab-Israeli dispute, the  Gulf crisis, and its reception of successive waves of emigrants  resulting from these crises -- including one in 1948, another in  1967, and ending with the Gulf crisis in 1991. This is in  addition to the indebtedness and other financial burdens it has  borne in this context.    Al-Hasan noted the difficulties Jordan is facing as a result  of the siege imposed on the Gulf of 'Aqabah, despite Jordan's  commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy.    Al-Hasan also briefed the guest on Jordan's democratic  process and the eagerness of the leadership and the people to  perpetuate and develop it in line with the principles of rule by  the Constitution and legislation and respect for human rights.    Minister al-Hasan noted his appreciation for the support and  aid that the EC states have extended to Jordan and the region,  as well as the EC's efforts to promote the peace process,  particularly the multi-party negotiations. He also appreciated  the EC's sponsorship of the economic development working group.  He expressed hope that this aid will increase to enable Jordan  to continue its important role in the peace process.    The two sides also discussed the hideous massacre that the  Israeli settlers committed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque during  the dawn prayers last Friday in the blessed month of Ramadan.  They emphasized their condemnation of this criminal act and  stressed the need to provide the necessary protection for the  Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. They also  stressed the need to disarm the settlers, and the importance of  speeding up the achievement of a comprehensive peace that will  end the regional conflict.    For his part, the guest minister stressed the deep ties of  friendship between Jordan and both his country and the EC  states. Thanks to His Majesty King Husayn, these relations were  established and consolidated through his strong friendly  relations with their leaders, he said. The guest minister also  said he appreciated his majesty's wise policy and courageous  positions in support of a peace that will be accepted by the  coming generations.    The guest minister also stressed his understanding of the  economic difficulties and burdens Jordan is facing as a result  of its commitment to the peace process. He also noted  appreciation for the important role Jordan is playing to serve  the causes of peace, and stressed the need to support Jordan to  continue this role. He lauded the democratic experience Jordan  is living.    The two sides reviewed relations between Greece [as heard]  and the European states and the ways to consolidate and promote  them in various fields. In this regard, the two sides noted  their good bilateral political relations and the need to expand  this in the economic, cultural, tourist, air transport, and  other fields.    Regarding relations with the EC states, the two sides agreed  on the importance of convening the Jordanian-European Commission  Joint Cooperation Council as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (7): Purse strings become tighter - The financing of deals is now more risk-sensitive THE FINANCING of mergers and acquisitions has become more risk-sensitive in the course of the past year. At the same time as the pace of mergers and acquisitions has slowed, the financing of M&amp;A business has become increasingly selective. 'Financing has become much more difficult for entrepreneurial companies,' says one banker. 'High-risk financing is just not happening.' Capital constraints and a bad record on loans to highly leveraged companies have tightened the purse strings of banks that are considering acquisition-related lending. The highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) which fuelled management buyouts and leveraged buyouts in the 1980s, mainly in the US, are no longer available. On the other hand, there is a continuing trend for the deleveraging of companies which became heavily indebted through MBOs and LBOs in the 1980s. Strong equity markets for much of the past two years have enabled companies, particularly in the US, which had borrowed in order to acquire during the 1980s takeover boom, to refinance their debts and rebuild their balance sheets. The US junk or high yield bond market, after several years of inactivity, has been showing signs of life, but companies have been returning to that market mainly to refinance outstanding bonds. Some companies have been able to achieve considerable cost savings, where improving credit ratings have been coincided with a low point in the US interest rate cycle. But after a strong start to the year, equity markets have become more difficult, and sources of funding have dried up again. As a result, the limited activity in the M&amp;A market has been orchestrated largely by big, cash-rich companies, such as Nestle, the Swiss food group which recently won its fiercely contested FFr13.42bn bid for Perrier, the French mineral water company. Another example is Kraft General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris group of the US, which made an agreed Dollars 1.5bn bid for Freia Marabou, the leading chocolate, confectionery and snacks producer in Scandinavia. Recently, Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, launched a Pounds 780m cash bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products group, the first sizeable hostile takeover in the UK for some months. 'Some companies can use cash, or take up bank credit lines, to buy first and worry about refinancing later, because they have the capital strength to separate those two decisions,' says one banker. 'Smaller companies do not have that luxury.' The difficulties experienced by less cash-rich companies in securing funding for takeovers may help spawn fresh approaches to acquisition financing. The most innovative financing so far this year was Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's funding of its Pounds 3.6bn takeover of Midland Bank, which involved a rare use of the bond market for the initial financing of a takeover. HSBC Holdings' Pounds 448m 10-year subordinated Eurobond provided a number of subsidiary benefits, including boosting capital and avoiding excessive dilution of shareholders' funds. It is widely thought that the offer of more generous terms on the bonds  - and a cash alternative - when Hongkong Bank increased its bid on June 2 helped secure the deal by edging out Lloyds Bank, its rival. Initially, the bonds were to be priced to yield 160 basis points above the 10-year gilt yield, a spread which was generally considered inadequate given the credit quality of the offering: deeply subordinated debt issued by a bank holding company. Under the increased bid, Hongkong Bank offered par bonds at a spread of 240 basis points above the comparable gilt yield, and a cash alternative for investors who did not want to take the bonds. Since then, the spread has tightened to around 160 basis points, creating profits for shareholders who took the bonds rather than the cash. The offering is the first of its kind in the Eurobond market. Because Eurobonds are internationally-traded bearer instruments, the structure facilitated distribution to a much wider range of investors than would have been possible with a domestic sterling bond issue. The existence of broad overseas demand helped buoy confidence in the UK, where the structure of the deal could have severely limited distribution. Although HSBC's approach may be imitated by other banks, corporates are unlikely to follow the same path. 'Accounting for banks recognises that subordinated debt is close to equity; corporate accounting does not accept that,' says one corporate financier. There are still examples, if rare ones, of companies taking on large amounts of debt to fund ambitious acquisitions. The Dollars 1.85bn bid for Spain's two largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson, by Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) will increase its long-term debt by Dollars 760m - assuming refinancing and asset sales go according to plan. But for the moment, most companies are not keen to take on substantial amounts of new debt, and the demand for acquisition-related financing appears likely to remain at a low ebb, with little sign of a major pick-up in M&amp;A activity in sight.</p>

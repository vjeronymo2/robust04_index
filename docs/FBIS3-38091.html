The plant used to produce  launchers for medium- and shorter-range missiles.    The inspection was made within the framework of the Treaty  on  Medium- and Shorter-Range Missiles joined by Kazakhstan after  disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The republic has a  quota on sending its inspectors to the United States and an  obligation to admit U.S. representatives to Kazakh facilities  liable for inspection.    The inspection was the first of the sort in sovereign  Kazakhstan. It was held in an atmosphere of cooperation and  mutual respect thanks to the correct stand of the Kazakh Defence  Ministry's accompanying team on treaty obligations, said the  Americans.    The experts are sure Kazakhstan will continue to fully  observe its military obligations.</p>

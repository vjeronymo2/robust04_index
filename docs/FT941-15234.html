			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Back to front basics: Hugh Dickinson says the government has underestimated voters' intelligence Complexity - that is the problem with Back to Basics. Politicians like things to be simple and believe that the public response to issues, policies and events will be gut reactions, which they know how to provoke. Back to Basics was based on two assumptions: first, that the basic gut of Great Britain is uniform, wholesome and above all simple, and second, that people do not like to be asked to think. Both are false. The government has lost the trust of many people because its Back to Basics campaign failed to recognise that Britain is a complex community with widely differing gut reactions. Even within the Conservative party the 'basics' of a Suffolk mayor, a cabinet minister and Sir Edward Heath are manifestly incompatible. That is not what we mean by basic morality. Sir Edward even says that it is dangerous for a political party to adopt a moral perspective. You cannot get much more basic than that. The Church has been struggling with the problem of morality in a complex society for hundreds of years. Unless there is a common spiritual commitment to certain fundamental values, moral exhortation is whistling in the wind. We have tried it. Certainly, the electorate is deeply anxious about the moral disintegration suggested by the breakdown of families and a wave of crime. But the government has made a mistake in supposing that the same electorate will respond to offers of a quick fix. It seems, indeed, that the British public is now learning to think about complex issues - for example embryology - and is quite enjoying the experience. Yes, there have been some typically gut reactions to 60-year old pregnancies and to the idea of giving a woman eggs from a dead foetus. But even those with strong feelings add that we must have time to think. This is not an easy candidate for a Back to Basics basket. Nor is abortion, that political land mine just waiting to be trodden on. Then there are the issues of law and order - dauntingly complex to anybody except the Neanderthals. Most of us now suspect that longer sentences in more (privatised) prisons will not reduce crime. It is a sop to the gut of the rottweiler tendency. Sending naughty boys on trips abroad does stick in the gullet. But it is at only two thirds of the cost of keeping them in prison and is three times as effective in preventing them re-offending. That way of making good citizens out of bad lads will certainly not be part of the basics basket. What about traditional family values? Surely the Church will root for them? Any priest or counsellor who knows the pain and trauma of fractured families and broken marriages must long for a community stable families and faithful marriages. But I find myself less and less able to attribute all that human misery to personal irresponsibility or moral failure. That simple censorious Back to Basics judgment, which was the gut reaction at the Conservative Party conference, misses the complex dynamics of families and relationships under huge psychological pressure in a changing society. It may also be taking a very rosy view of what happened 50 years ago. Families and marriages were certainly held together by social controls. But women were grossly oppressed. Our politicians seem unable to understand that the frightening symptoms of social disarray are just that - symptoms. (Any priest knows that the 'sins' recounted by the penitent are not the real problem.) They point to a much deeper and systemic malaise which is the direct consequence of policies and attitudes which have exalted personal choice over community responsibility, personal gain over the common weal, competition over co-operation. Those are the basics of the Thatcher years. No one should be surprised that they have spilled over from public and commercial life into the streets and then into homes and personal relationships. The moral fabric of a community is seamless and entire. Adultery matters. It breaks one thread of the fabric. But so does embezzlement. So does the alleged suppression by Ministers of the evidence which could acquit three innocent men in the Matrix Churchill case. So does being economical with the truth. Such actions erode trust. Our society needs moral reconstruction. But by public example and a consensus about fundamentals much subtler than a natty political slogan. Hugh Dickinson is Dean of Salisbury</p>

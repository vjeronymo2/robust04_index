			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Cambodian killings condemned Britain yesterday condemned the killing of three western hostages, executed by their Khmer Rouge captors, as a barbaric outrage and said it would press Cambodia to bring those responsible to justice. The British Embassy issued a toughly worded travel advisory requesting that their nationals avoid Cambodia after Mr Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, confirmed that the hostages' remains had been exhumed near Vine Mountain, about 150km south of Phnom Penh. Briton Mark Slater, 28, Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, from France and David Wilson, 29, an Australian, were taken hostage by the Khmer Rouge on July 26 after a train ambush in southern Kampot province in which 13 people were killed. Along with three ethnic Vietnamese and an unknown number of Cambodians, the three foreigners were marched at gunpoint to a Khmer Rouge base near Vine Mountain.</p>

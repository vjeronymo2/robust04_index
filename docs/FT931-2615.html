			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: BASF AG sales fall 17% over two months BASF, the German chemicals group, yesterday underlined the deterioration of German industry when the company said its domestic subsidiary, BASF AG, registered a 17 per cent decline in sales during the first two months of 1993, compared with the same period last year. Mr Jurgen Strube, group chairman, said the situation in Germany had continued to weaken since the beginning of the year. Orders had fallen to an all-time low. Unrelenting pressure on prices, the exceptionally low level of demand, particularly in Germany, and low utilisation rates had led to lower profits, said Mr Strube, although he insisted the group was still in the black. During the first two months of 1993, the entire group's worldwide turnover fell 10 per cent on the same period last year. In western Europe, turnover fell 20 per cent. Mr Strube warned that in spite of cost-cutting he no longer expected to match last year's profits during the first quarter. The chances of achieving 1992 profit levels during the full year were becoming increasingly remote. He said there were no prospects of a recovery in western Europe this year, and any improvement in BASF's 1994 results would be self generated. BASFsaid it was accelerating its restructuring. A further 4,000 job losses were announced, as well as short-time working, plant closures and capital expenditure cuts. Last year had been a disappointment, said Mr Strube, who added he was not satisfied by the way BASF had performed in comparison with international competitors. The company had experienced a dramatic collapse during the second half of 1992. Group pre-tax profits for the year fell 41.3 per cent from DM2.11bn to DM1.24bn on turnover down 4.5 per cent at DM44.5bn.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (6): One step up the ladder  -Portfolio flows investment in stocks and bonds - are widely considered to be one step up the ladder of desirability. Much of this investment goes into the stock market and into bidding up the price of existing assets, but there is an element of new investment, to the extent that these higher market levels allow for new issues of equity and debt. All developing countries have seen a dramatic increase in portfolio investment flows, which trebled to Dollars 21bn in 1991 over the level of 1989, and were projected at around Dollars 27bn for 1992. Total volume of portfolio flows now exceeds net flows of official finance to developing countries, reflecting what is clearly the growing dominance of the private sector in international finance. According to the World Bank, portfolio flows to Latin America multiplied fourfold from 1990 to 1992. Portfolio investors are not a homogeneous bunch - and neither can all portfolio investment be viewed as equal. Apart from rich Latin Americans, the universe of portfolio investors also includes aggressive speculative investors such as the so-called hedge funds, which helped to cause havoc in the European Monetary System last year, and conservative investment institutions dipping a toe into more exotic markets in an attempt to improve returns. Some of this investment is therefore quite transitory; some more permanent. The fact that sometimes relatively modest outflows from a stock market can precipitate steep price declines may limit the mobility of this capital. This is because some investors are unwilling to take large losses and prefer to hold on to await a future price rally. Some traders in the bond and equity markets argue that, over time, the profile of the portfolio investors in Latin America has changed. The first wave of buying was by investors who believed the price of assets in the region had simply fallen too far: this was speculative capital centred on trading desks, and to some extent hedge funds and wealthy individuals. It was encouraged by the settlement in Mexico of a debt reduction agreement which, along with low US interest rates, has taken the debt question off the list of prime investor concerns. Since then, into the bond market have moved buyers attracted by high absolute yields - preferably in double digits - seeking an improvement in credit. This group are important buyers of Eurobonds. Many do not look very carefully at bond prospectuses - and they include individuals and mutual funds focusing on emerging markets. This group of investors - looking only at absolute yields and not worried about the more subtle aspects of credit quality - had a role in temporarily and unsustainably compressing yield spreads towards the middle of last year, between borrowers of very different calibre. THE other culprit was over-aggressive bidding by bond underwriters for bond mandates: this left huge amounts of Latin American paper on the books of underwriters late last year, and effectively closed the new-issue market for several months. The backlog was only cleared this year by the rally in US interest rates, which lifted the prices of all dollar-denominated bonds. With US interest rates at current levels, it is unlikely that underwriters will be able to rely on interest rate falls to bail them out a second time. Nonetheless, some bond market traders say Latin bonds are moving into another stage of evolution: sophisticated but often conservative institutional investors are said to be moving in. If indeed this is happening - and it should be facilitated by changes in the last couple of years in US securities regulation, which have helped to reduce some of the more onerous disclosure and prospectus requirements for issuers selling securities to institutional investors - then the market in Latin American bonds will be moving towards a more important maturity. These institutions are careful asset allocators, which use modern portfolio theory, buying bonds and equities essentially to diversify risk. They are interested in good credit quality and liquidity, and focus on the spreads or margins over US Treasury bill rates. They will seek diversification benefits: examining, for example, correlations between, say, US and Mexican government bonds. The justification for portfolio diversification by investment institutions is stronger in the case of equities than it is for bonds. Dollar bonds, issued by whomever, tend to track the US bonds market; while, for non-dollar bonds, the perceived exchange rate risk against the dollar is to some extent built into the yield differentials between that market and the dollar bond market. For equity investors, this is not the case, and there has been a gradually expanding interest in the region's stock markets from institutions. For the most part, Latin American stock markets are followed by the emerging-markets group within investment institutions, which controls a small but generally growing percentage of the overall portfolio. In the UK, there has perhaps been a longer tradition of investment than in the US in what we now call emerging markets. But the traditional emerging markets for UK investors have been in the countries of the Commonwealth, and only recently has interest arisen in Latin America. Far more important for Latin America is the attitude of US institutions, some of which already treat certain Mexican stocks as part of their North American, rather than their emerging markets, portfolio. The potential supply of capital flows from this source to the region is immense, even if only a tiny percentage of the institutions' portfolios are devoted to the region. In the US alone, institutional investors hold more than Dollars 6,000bn of investable funds. Indeed, if these investors decide to follow their portfolio theory, the optimal level of Latin American investment in a portfolio is considerably above their actual levels, leaving much scope for growth. There are many ways in which countries can improve the friendliness of their markets to such investors: improving and enforcing regulation, improving the quality of corporate disclosure, improving market liquidity and the like. Governments can issue bonds in the international markets across the maturity spectrum to provide benchmarks for other issuers from that country, a tactic followed by Mexico. They can also act to reduce the likelihood of disorderly borrowing abroad - of which there were several examples in 1992. Although it may go against the grain of liberalisation of financial markets, some bankers and academics believe governments should impose a queueing system on fund raisings in the international bond and equity markets, such as that operated until recently by the Bank of England. This is because a mispriced or badly-timed issue by one fundraiser - there were several examples of these last year - can all too easily affect market psychology and prevent others from having access to the markets. It is also argued that some kind of quality control is worth considering on would-be issuers. This is important in the international bond market, where no Latin bond issue has defaulted in recent years - a record which, sooner or later, probably will fall, with potentially disruptive affects for other borrowers. In the shorter term, there is concern about the relatively poor performance and volatility of both Latin bond and stock markets in 1992. Salomon Brothers' index of Brady bonds showed a total return of 4.6 per cent for 1992. Stock market investors also had a much more difficult year in 1992 then they did in 1991. Double-digit gains were observed only in Peru, Mexico and Colombia, and in both Mexican and Peruvian markets there was extraordinary volatility. This was after a year in which there were gains above 100 per cent in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Chile rose by 90 per cent, while Venezuela was a 'disappointing' 34 per cent. Although not usually classed as portfolio capital, there is another potential source of private capital that has been largely forgotten in recent years: the commercial banks. If international banks are to become a more important source of finance for the region during the 1990s, the growth will be gradual. Not only will the experience of the 1970s make them cautious for some time to come; but, more important, it will also take time for banking regulators throughout the world to reduce the mandated provisions that banks have to make against loans to developing countries. There is, however, scope for project investment - particularly where loans can be repaid through receivables arising from cross-border commerce - and support for companies planning direct investment: at the moment, most favoured source of foreign capital.</p>

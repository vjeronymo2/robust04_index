			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Firm gilts encourage recovery in share prices - Market report An erratic session saw UK shares stand up well against falls in the US bond market and the dollar following the announcement of the sharp rise in US payroll numbers last month. London securities houses focused on squaring off trading positions while awaiting news from the meeting of G7 countries. Traders warned, however, that the fall in the dollar increased following comments from President Clinton, and came too only as the London markets were closing for the day. British government bonds closed very firmly, brushing off the weakness in US bonds on the view that the G7 meeting is unlikely to bring dramatic action on the interest rate front. Gains in long-dated gilts ranged to around half a point, with the short dates steady after early falls. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the day just 2 points off at 2,962.4. After opening firmer, the blue chip sector held until the the US employment news drove the Footsie down by 12 points. The market rallied when Wall Street came in higher, showing a gain of nearly 20 Dow points in UK trading hours. The broader based FT-SE Mid 250 Index ended barely changed, down 0.1 at 3,454.6. Over the week, the Footsie has gained 26 points in fairly thin turnover as investors have become gradually more confident that the G7 meeting which closes tomorrow, will not bring any aggressive action on global interest rates. Some analysts expressed concern at the late weakness in the US currency, warning that this could threaten markets next week. The FT-SE Mid 250 is 38.8 points higher over the week. Trading volume increased to 585.7m shares yesterday, from 567.2m on Thursday. Equity trading was swollen by activity in banking stocks as the proceeds of Thursday's large sale of stock in Royal Bank of Scotland found their way across the stock market. Blue chip dollar stocks were narrowly mixed at the London close, with pharmaceuticals attracting some support but the oil sector looked irregular in spite of this week's firmness in crude oil prices. There was a rally in Enterprise Oil shares which have been depressed since the failure of the group's bid for Lasmo. But the domestic retail stocks made little further response to the more optimistic view on interest rates which has developed. On Thursday, retail, or customer business recovered sharply after several sessions in the doldrums; the retail total of Pounds 1.3bn, compared with under Pounds 1bn daily earlier in the week, reflected both a return to more profitable business levels for London brokerage houses and also an indication that investors have recovered from their concerns that the G7 meeting might set the stage for a hike in US interest rates. Stock market strategists have drawn confidence from the Footsie's successful bounce from the 2,930 area and the chart specialists now believe that the Index could test its next confidence level at around 2,990, and then, if successful, at 3,017. Most UK securities firms are still predicting a renewed advance by equities before the end of the year. In its technical review of the market, Derivatives Securities suggests that we may be able to say, in retrospect, that; 'It started in Naples,' the venue for the G7 meeting, where the major countries are expected to discuss interest rate policies. If they elect to leave rates alone, comments the firm, then the dollar could be in for renewed volatility.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Looking to life after Rio WHAT happens now that Rio is over? The summit's main legacy will be a Sustainable Development Commission to monitor countries' record on environmental protection, and apply 'peer group pressure' to those who lag behind. This will be similar to the Human Rights Commission established under the auspices of the UN. Precise details will be worked out later this year, but the commission will probably have 50 members drawn from various governments, and will be closely linked to the scientific and non-governmental communities. It will report through the economic and social committee (Ecosoc) to the general assembly. The commission would operate on the basis of reports submitted by member countries. Other machinery set in motion in Rio includes the secretariats of the two treaties that were signed here by over 150 countries on climate change and bio-diversity protection. These would have the job of organising periodic reviews. Will there ever be another Earth Summit? Exhausted delegates doubted it yesterday. But President Mitterrand of France departed with the suggestion that there be another 'rendez-vous' in three to five years.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Overseas lifts assets The Fleming Overseas Investment Trust had a net asset value of 360.6p per share as at December 31, up some 18 per cent on the figure of 306.6p reported six months earlier. The year-on-year improvement, against a value of 271p, was 33 per cent. The trust, which seeks capital appreciation, easily outpaced its benchmark - the FT-A World Index excluding UK in sterling terms - which rose just 4.7 per cent over the latest six month period. Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, chairman, said the outperformance reflected an underweight position in Japan and exposure to south-east Asia and emerging markets. 'These gains have resulted almost entirely from underlying strength in equity markets, rather than from currency changes'. Available revenue amounted to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 2.87m) pushing earnings per share down from 2.16p to 1.91p. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. The Fleming Enterprise Investment Trust, which concentrates on achieving capital growth from medium-sized UK companies, reported a net asset value of 231.7p at end-December, up from 199.9p six months earlier and 170.7p at the end of 1992. Net revenue for the half-year amounted to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 734,000), equivalent to earnings of 3.05p (1.83p) per share. The interim dividend is raised to 1.4p (1.3p).</p>

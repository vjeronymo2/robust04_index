			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Chilean economy expands by 10% THE Chilean economy has grown by almost 10 per cent in 1992, its best performance in 30 years, according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister. The higher-than-expected growth was spearheaded by a 30 per cent increase in private sector investment, evident in new mining projects, a construction boom in Santiago and a host of small manufacturing businesses. Mr Foxley forecast the economy would grow at least six per cent in 1993. The independent Central Bank has used interest rates and a revaluation of the peso to lower inflation by almost six points to 13 per cent this year. Mr Foxley said the Treasury would continue to generate fiscal surpluses of around three per cent of GDP to keep inflation in check. However, many economists believe the inflation target for 1993 of 11 per cent will be difficult to meet. Mr Foxley said high levels of employment and the government's social policies were beginning to narrow the income gap between rich and poor. Increases in the minimum wage, family benefits and state pensions had allowed 1m Chileans to escape the poverty trap since President Patricio Aylwin's government came to power three years ago. One third of the population, about 4.3m people, still live in deep poverty. Mr Foxley said the government was concerned about the high levels of youth unemployment. Venezuela's economy continued to post strong gains for the third consecutive year in 1992, growing by 7.3 per cent in real terms, according to preliminary year-end figures published by the Central Bank of Venezuela, Joe Mann writes from Caracas. However, the public-sector deficit was estimated at 6.1 per cent of GDP, compared with a 0.7 per cent surplus in 1991, while the current account ran a deficit of over Dollars 3.7bn in 1992, against a Dollars 1.6bn surplus last year.</p>

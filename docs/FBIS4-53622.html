			<p>BFN     [Text] On 19 May, the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] and Shinto Sakigake [New Party Harbinger] decided to form  a policy consultation council to discuss their views on tax  reform and to hold the council's first meeting on 23 May. The  two parties also agreed that tax reform should come as part of  drastic administrative reform programs.    The parties were in general agreement that they should  formulate their own administrative reform plan and that they  should not cooperate with the ruling coalition in tax reform in  case it is not cooperative enough on their administrative reform  plan.</p>

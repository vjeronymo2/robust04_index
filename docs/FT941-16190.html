			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / French fear veto for joint venture Vallourec, a French steel tubing company, promised last night to redouble efforts to persuade the European Commission to approve a three-way joint venture with German and Italian steelmakers, after rumours that Brussels was poised to veto the deal. The Commission is nearing the end of a four-month in-depth inquiry into the joint venture to produce seamless, stainless steel tubes with subsidiaries of Mannesman of Germany and Ilva of Italy. It should decide before the end of this month. Brussels officials refused to comment on reports yesterday that a three-year merger task force had recommended to Mr Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, the deal should be blocked. If the Commission vetoes the joint venture it will be only the second time the EU's 1990 merger regulation has been used to ban a deal outright. Mr Arnaud Leenhardt, Vallourec's chairman, said yesterday the reports of an impending veto had come as 'a great surprise' to him and his partners in the deal. 'There's a lot of competition in the areas where we operate, and the venture would not do away with competition,' he said. In November 1991, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, persuaded fellow commissioners to outlaw a Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, causing a political storm.</p>

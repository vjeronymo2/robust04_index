			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / French car sales at lowest point for 18 years The depressed state of the French car market was demonstrated in statistics yesterday showing car sales fell by 18.3 per cent to 1.72m last year, the lowest annual figure since 1975. The figures from the CCFA, the French carmakers' committee, showed a particularly sharp fall in December. Car sales last month totalled 152,000, a fall of 31 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Industry analysts in Paris said December's decline was exaggerated by artificially high sales at the end of 1992, the result of a rush by consumers to beat the expiry of tax incentives for low-pollution models. Excluding such factors, the decline in the month's sales was estimated at about 16 per cent. But the figures for December demonstrated the continued weakness of the car market. 'The impact of recession and depressed demand is very clear,' one industry analyst said. 'Cars, more than other consumer products, continue to suffer from a lack of economic confidence.' French manufacturers had, however, some cause for comfort. The combined sales of the French car companies represented 60.3 per cent of the market, an increase of 0.5 per cent compared with 1992. Renault, the state-owned group, limited its fall in sales to 15.1 per cent, partly reflecting the successful introduction of models such as the Twingo. Citroen saw sales fall by 16 per cent, and was also supported by the introduction of models like the Xantia mid-range car. Peugeot, however, its partner in the PSA Peugeot-Citroen group, suffered a fall of 22.6 per cent. Most industry executives expect some recovery in the market this year, although they emphasise the slow pace of revival and continued high level of competition. Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot- Citroen, forecast total car sales in France would rise to about 1.85m units in 1994. French car manufacturers also continue to suffer in the face of difficult international markets. According to figures from the CCFA, exports amounted to 1.68m in the first 11 months of 1993, a fall of 13.25 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dragan Marijanovic: "Who Is General Fikret </F> Muslimovic, Appointed to the Joint Staff of the Croat Defense  Council and Formations of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Officer Who Knows a Lot"]    [Text] If he has actually decided to weave the  strings of power in his hands into something that implies a  lasting peace, together with Corps General Ante Ros, which he  recently promised during his visit to Medjugorje, then that is  good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He finally has a real  opportunity to materialize unity between Croats and Bosniaks,  which he has always advocated, at least verbally.    Bosniak General Fikret Muslimovic, the main Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina officer for the Bosniak side in the recently  formed Joint Staff of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first Muslim general to visit  Medjugorje since the unsuccessful and abortive meeting between  Tudjman and Izetbegovic, which took place in the same location  exactly one year earlier, when it turned out that despite the  mediation of Owen and Stoltenberg, even in a place like  Medjugorje miracles do not exactly happen every century, much  less every day.    The generals who represented the two armies at that time  were  Slobodan Praljak for the Croats and Sefer Halilovic for the  (still at that time) Muslims. Nothing came of the firm  handshakes after the signing of the peace "documents" and the  optimistic statements into the microphones of all the relevant  world media companies. The war escalated, an unprecedented  Muslim offensive in central Bosnia began, and hundreds of  thousands of Croats were expelled.    At that time, former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Lieutenant  Colonel Fikret Muslimovic, with the rank of colonel in the Army  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was on that army's General Staff as the  head of all intelligence and security activities. He was in a  position where he was considered the person to whom even the  slightest whiff of dilettantism had to be attributed at the  outset. The top intelligence officer--or "security officer," as  he was called at the time--acquired his skill and agility  through many years of service in the notorious department led by  former JNA General Vasiljevic. Muslimovic was one of the main  links in this murky chain even as the storm began to brew in  Slovenia, and then in Croatia. In some insider circles in  Sarajevo, it was said at the time that Muslimovic could have  advanced much further if he had not happened to be a Muslim,  which is very likely, although like the majority of officers in  the former JNA who were not of Serb nationality, he identified  himself as Yugoslav.    The Serb drums of war in Bosnia forced Lt. Col. Muslimovic  to  opt for the just-formed Territorial Defense, an offshoot of the  Patriotic League, which was formed by people primarily of  Sandzak origins. At the very outset of the war in and around  Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Muslimovic, under  the roof of the state presidency building, assumed the duties of  head of a similar political agency, attempting to apply the  experience gained in organizing the disbanded army to the new  conditions. To the extent that the author of this article can  recall those days and the talks with the present-day Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina general in Sarajevo, he mostly preferred  Croat-Muslim unity and the need to "go to the Drina together";  however, it never occurred to him to acknowledge the real  contribution of the HVO to that common cause.    At the time, Muslimovic was among the people who, after the  establishment of a tolerable Muslim defense in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, felt that they should take the matter into  their own hands and that other defense units should join them  according to plans drawn up in Sarajevo, which of course did not  work at all. At that time, Muslimovic's sympathies were reserved  for the HOS [Croatian Defense Force], which had experienced a  precipitous fall in esteem among the Croat nation. During that  period, Muslimovic's main associates were certain Sandzak  commanders, especially a young man nicknamed Zagi, and it is  impossible to say how it is that some of the people around  Muslimovic were in fact unsuccessful in defending certain parts  of Sarajevo.    From the beginning, he was opposed to the creation of any  Croat state community in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and at the mention  of Herceg-Bosna this seemingly peaceful man would react in a  manner that is inadvisable for such a high-ranking officer. He  also selected some Croats as his associates, people who under  such circumstances were deprived of any and all autonomy, which  certainly comes as no surprise since the top Muslim soldier and  Muslimovic's boss at the time was Sefer Halilovic, who ended the  way he did. After his fall, Muslimovic advanced in the service,  and he has in fact experienced his professional finale in recent  days, with his appointment to the Joint Staff of the HVO and  formations of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which role he  has remained in Medjugorje as the head of the Bosniak military  delegation, which has begun working on the more concrete  implementation of the signed agreements together with a  corresponding delegation from the HVO.    Gen. Muslimovic has not concealed his satisfaction with what  has been achieved, and he brims over with optimism. Curiously  enough, he has not mentioned a "joint advance to the Drina,"  although he did so before the agreements, when as part of the  Muslim negotiating team he negotiated with Croat military  delegations, mostly at the Sarajevo airport. What happens in the  period to come will show whether this means that Gen. Muslim has  finally understood the logic that the HVO is no one's mercenary  army and that it exists exclusively to protect Croat interests  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But one thing is sure: Muslimovic is the  officer in the Bosniak ranks who knows the most, and he pulled  some of the strings during the Croat-Muslim fighting. If he has  actually decided to weave the strings of power in his hands into  something that implies a lasting peace, together with Corps  General Ante Ros, which he recently promised during his visit to  Medjugorje, then that is good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He  finally has a real opportunity to materialize unity between  Croats and Bosniaks, which he has always advocated, at least  verbally. He himself will have to come face to face with the  possible fragments of a troubled conscience during the war with  the Croats from the one-year phase of his military career.</p>

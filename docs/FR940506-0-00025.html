			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Display of optional fields on the on-line EBB must take place when such fields are included in the downloadable data sets (unless, as stated above, they are not necessary for on-line use). Conditional fields must be supported by the pipelines when the conditional field is dependent on information in a mandatory field. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the conditional field is predicated on the response to an optional field, the conditional field will have to be supported only if the pipeline supports the optional field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the prearranged deal field is a mandatory field requiring a yes/no response. Pipelines, therefore, must support all the fields conditioned on the response to the prearranged deal field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Pipeline Modification of the Data Sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 563, the Commission stated that pipelines could not add fields to, or delete fields from, the data sets, finding that standardization required that all pipelines use the same structure for downloading. ASC X12 software is keyed to specific fields on the implementation guide, and the Commission was concerned that if pipelines could add or delete fields, shippers' software could not interpret the information. The Commission pointed out that the data sets were designed flexibly to accommodate special release offers or unique circumstances by including fields for special terms and miscellaneous notes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KGPC contends EDI permits the addition of fields without inhibiting communication with parties not using the additional fields. It asserts the Commission should not unnecessarily inhibit the ability of the pipelines to customize their EDI transactions with trading partners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although KGPC is correct that fields can be added to the ASC X12 data sets without affecting the ability of others to use the original version, the Commission is concerned that if pipelines routinely add fields, the result would be a plethora of non-standard data bases, and users of multiple pipeline data bases could have difficulty accessing information that others could obtain. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission, therefore, will not permit pipelines to add additional fields.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A simple example would be a standardized data set with 30 items. If pipeline 1 added data item 31 and pipeline 2 added data item 31 to provide different information, a user of both pipelines would be unable to use the 31st data item because its meaning would not be standardized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Working Groups 1 &amp; 2 are concerned about situations in which the circumstances facing a particular pipeline do not fit the standardized format. They cite, as an example, a mandatory data field denominated a yes/no (Y/N) field and a pipeline needing a third category (U) for unknown. They suggest the following working principle for dealing with these problems: the pipeline will make a good faith effort to comply with the data sets, but if it cannot, it must explain any discrepancies and seek a correction through the Working Group process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is concerned about pipelines changing the meaning of data set items. While the addition of an unknown element for a field, as Working Group 1 &amp; 2 suggest, would seem unlikely to cause major communication difficulties, the Commission cannot determine whether other changes in meaning might adversely affect those seeking to obtain information from multiple pipelines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, pipelines should make every effort to use the data sets as promulgated, for instance, using a ``no'' indicator or the miscellaneous note field even if these are not optimum solutions. When pipelines encounter difficulties in using the standardized data sets, they should inform the Working Groups so that revisions can be considered. Once changes are received from the Working Groups, the Commission is committed to reviewing them as quickly as possible, but the Working Group changes may not be implemented unilaterally without Commission approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, those using multiple pipelines may have difficulty learning of such changes, and their computer software may not be able to effectively process data sets from multiple pipelines if the meanings of elements are different.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Issues Relating to Specific Information Included in the Data Sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Operationally Available (Unscheduled) Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission adopted the Working Groups' consensus agreement to require the pipelines to provide information on the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline, or mainline segments. The Commission found that this information satisfied the pipelines' obligation to post the capacity available for interruptible service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR 284.9(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

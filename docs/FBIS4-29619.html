			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; fourth </F> in series entitled "Japan and the United States -- the Picture  Shakes": "Follow Motorola"]    [Text] The evening of 25 May on the eve of resuming the  stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the American  Automobile Manufacturing Association (AAMA), a "pressure  organization" for the Big Three, gave a party at a building near  the U.S. Trade Representatives (USTR) office.  <H5>  City That Fulfills Wishes </H5>   Chief executive officers (CEO) from General Motors, Ford,  and  Chrysler hosted the party. On the list of invitees were leading  representatives and senators from Congress and other influential  figures in Washington. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  was also present at the party. The AAMA held the party to  declare to officials of the U.S. Government and members of  Congress that it has moved its headquarters from Detroit, the  automobile city, to Washington, a city of politics.    Last October, the AAMA appointed as managing director Andrew  Card, who is well versed in the Washington situation and served  as secretary of transportation in the Bush administration, and  decided to move its headquarters to Washington. The AAMA has  wielded great influence on the U.S. trade policy toward Japan by  vigorously lobbying the administration and Congress for Japan's  voluntary restraint on automobile exports to the United States.    The AAMA had a reason to move its headquarters to  Washington.  An American lobbyist has pointed out that "Motorola has succeed  in prying open the Japanese carphone market through collusive  ties with the administration, and the way Motorola has pried  open the Japanese carphone market has become a model for other  American corporations." When the AAMA decided to move its  headquarters to Washington, Harold Poling, former chairman of  Ford Motor Company, said, "Things that matter to us will be  decided in Washington." The AAMA is trying to learn how Motorola  has successfully pried open the Japanese carphone market and,  according to concerned American officials in Washington, the  major points of the strategy Motorola adopted to crack the  Japanese market are as follows:    First, Motorola gains access to a certain foreign market it  targets. Then it widely sells its competitiveness and  technological capability and lead while surveying the  ideosyncrasies of the foreign market. Motorola wages  alternatively a negative campaign to taint the image of the  foreign market and a positive campaign to sell its own image, as  seen in the American presidential elections.    Second, Motorola sends its officials to key posts in the  administration who are charged with handling trade negotiations  and policies. Incumbent President Christopher Garbing [name as  published] of Motorola is a member on the USTR Advisory  Committee on Investment Policy. Assistant U.S. Trade  Representative Ira Wolf had worked for Japan Motorola until just  before taking his present post with the USTR.    Spurred by the Clinton administration's policies to bolster  the competitiveness of American industry and promote exports of  American products, many American industries are already showing  their intention to embrace the strategy that has generated  positive trade results in the semiconductor and carphone areas.  <H5>  Japan, A Nation of Hope </H5>   A Japanese company employee in Washington has revealed his  sense of crisis, saying: "Recently, top executives from AT&amp;T,  MCI and other American telecommunications companies have  frequently visited the office of Vice President Gore. Their  visits to the vice president's office may sow the seeds of  future trade friction between Japan and the United States." In  the United States, long- distance telephone companies are  suffering a drop in profits because of the fierce price  competition among them. Long-distance phone companies are  lagging behing local ones CATV [cable TV] business, which is  considered the backbone of information in the multimedia age.  They see as a new frontier the market in Japan, which has begun  moving toward relaxing bureaucratic regulations. There is a high  possibility they will use the Motorola strategy as a model for  charting their own strategies to pry open the Japanese market.    Mark Holland [name as published], author of the book "Top  Management Goes To Washington," has written in the NEW YORK  TIMES that "the Clinton administration's intervention in  economic matters means that all American businesses can reap  profits in Washington." With the Clinton administration trying  to embrace trade requests from American businesses and the  advent of American companies trying to learn from the Motorola  strategy to crack the Japanese market, American corporations  have further consolidated their preparedness to pry open foreign  markets.    Tsuneharu Takeda, chief of the Washington Office of Itochu  International, has pointed out: "During the Cold War era, the  United States tolerated Japan's rejection of its trade demands  out of security considerations. The Clinton administration,  which was inaugurated on a platform of revitalizing the American  economy, has no intention of tolerating Japan's rejection."  President Clinton, who places importance on resolving domestic  economic problems, has unequivocally stated: "In the present  world, expanding exports is the only way for an affluent nation  to make itself more affluent."  <H5>  Close Government-Business Ties Result in Weakening </H5> Competitiveness    In response, the Japanese Government is frantically trying  to  relax bureaucratic regulations, prompting the business community  to distance itself from the government. To cite an example, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked  automobile companies in late March to draw up their respective  plans for the purchase of foreign-made auto parts. In reaction,  top executives of several automobile companies said in distress,  "We will no longer comply with any requests from MITI." The  Japanese automobile industry, which has grown while maintaining  close ties with MITI, has begun to refuse to go along with what  MITI requests.    The close ties between the administration and the business  community in the United States and the alienation of the  business community from the government in Japan appear to carry  the risk of causing one trade friction after another between  Japan and the United States. The Motorola-style strategy, which  aims to exploit the close government-business ties to let  business use the government's influence, is nothing but a  "strategy designed to reap short-term profits by spending money  in Washington." The money spent in Washington would not serve to  improve the quality of American manufactured goods, but to  weaken American industrial competitiveness in the long run.  There is no reason for Japanese enterprises to excessively fear  the Motorola-style strategy.</p>

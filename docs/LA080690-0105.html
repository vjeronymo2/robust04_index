			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> AN ORANGE COUNTY 'MUSEUM' EXHIBITS QUESTIONABLE MOTIVE;  </P> <P> MISREPRESENTATION: POSTCARDS INVITE ARTISTS TO SHOW THEIR WORK AT A NONEXISTENT  FACILITY FOR A $12 FEE. IS IT FRAUD, OR MAYBE A BIZARRE BIT OF PERFORMANCE ART?  </P> <P> Seduction comes easy these days. Elaborate mailings assure us that we are among  the select few invited to subscribe to an upscale magazine, or to use a charge  card named after a precious metal. For a fleeting moment we may even believe  that we are being singled out as special. It's only human to preen.  </P> <P> Artists are hardly immune. The tiniest sign that someone really is interested  in their work is enough to send many a fledgling artist into orbit. After all,  toting slides to indifferent art gallery owners can induce depression in the  hardiest soul.  </P> <P> So imagine how you'd feel if you were an artist who got a tantalizing postcard  inviting you to show your work at a museum -- with just a few strings attached.  On March 31, someone mailed a batch of such postcards from a Los Angeles ZIP  code to an untold number of artists in Southern California.  </P> <P> "The Orange County Museum of Contemporary Art INVITES You to submit a Bio and  Slides (All Media) of your Art Work," read the post card, printed in a mixture  of script and sans-serif type. "The OCMCA is a (sic) Exciting and New  Contemporary Art Museum accompanied by a Sales and Rental Gallery. Please  submit your Materials and Twelve Dollars to: OCMCA, Registry Dept. P.O. Box  691951, Los Angeles, CA 90069."  </P> <P> The postcard is confusing. Are artists to be considered for curated museum  exhibitions or for the distinctly less thrilling prospect of showing in a sales  and rental gallery? Syntax aside, however, a bigger problem looms:  </P> <P> There apparently is no such entity as the Orange County Museum of Contemporary  Art. The California secretary of state's office reports that OCMCA has never  registered as either a nonprofit or for-profit organization, as required by  law.  </P> <P> Was someone out to defraud local artists? Was the solicitation someone's idea  of a joke -- or even a peculiar "performance" piece?  </P> <P> Deciding to play amateur sleuth after a Los Angeles artist mailed me the  postcard she received, I located several other L.A. and Orange County artists  who received the solicitations. One lives as far away as the San Joaquin  Valley.  </P> <P> "I don't know of too many museums that function like this," said Michael Hughes  of Los Angeles, who received a postcard. "It didn't sound right. . . . And why  was the post office box in Los Angeles if the museum was in Orange County?"  </P> <P> The "cheap" look of the postcard also aroused Hughes' suspicions, but "it was  the $12 more than anything else," he said, that made him question the offer.  Normally, no money changes hands when a museum asks an artist to exhibit work.  </P> <P> Diana Feld, an artist who lives in Santa Monica, admitted that the words invite  you initially hooked her. "Oh, I don't have to go out and solicit," she  thought. The $12 charge didn't strike her as peculiar, she said, because rental  gallery slide registries commonly require artists to pay a small fee per slide.  </P> <P> Feld's husband was skeptical, however, and suggested she call the museum to  check it out. When she discovered that Orange County directory information has  no listing for OCMCA, her bright hopes were dashed.  </P> <P> The Better Business Bureau that serves the Los Angeles-Orange County area has  recorded no complaints against any Orange County Museum of Contemporary Art.  U.S. Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch said his office hadn't received any  complaints about the museum solicitation either, but after receiving a copy of  the postcard, he agreed that it might fall under the category of bunco crimes,  or swindles.  </P> <P> Eventually, I learned that the post office box to which artists were supposed  to send the slides and money was opened on March 26 by one Scott C. Griesbach  in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Voter registration records show that  Griesbach was born in 1967 in Wisconsin and is a Republican. Directory  information had no phone number for him. A letter I mailed to his home address,  asking that he call me to discuss the matter, has gone unanswered. So far, I've  been unable to get ahold of him.  </P> <P> When Griesbach filled out the post box rental form, he didn't say he'd be  operating a business out of the box.  </P> <P> It was heartening to hear from Obritsch that the post office has processed only  "a negligible amount" of mail for the box number.  </P> <P> Several artists I spoke to said they sent letters asking for more information,  which they never received. One artist said he mailed a $12 check on April 20  and got nothing in return except his cancelled check, which was endorsed  "OCMCA" and apparently had been deposited.  </P> <P> The stamp on the back of the check indicates that it cleared through the  downtown Los Angeles branch of Security Pacific Bank on June 12, but a bank  representative said the numbers underneath the endorsement don't indicate that  OCMCA has an account there. Bank personnel are looking into the matter.  </P> <P> To open the account, the mastermind behind OCMCA would have to have produced  documents showing that he owned or was associated with a genuine organization.  The plot thickens. . . .  </P> <P> Obritsch said his office would need "quite a few" complaints in order to open a  formal investigation. And, in his experience, when the amount of money involved  in each solicitation is less than $50, people generally figure it isn't worth  their time to pursue the matter.  </P> <P> In this case, perhaps most of the artists who received the postcards were too  savvy to send any money. But anyone who did risk the $12 and wishes to squawk  to the proper authorities should write to the Postal Service's Regional Chief  Inspector, Western Region, 850 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, Calif. 94098-0100.  </P></p>

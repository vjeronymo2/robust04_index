			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the Russian State Duma failed to  approve the 1994 federal budget at third reading even though it  was put to a vote three times.    During the last round in the evening, 212 votes were cast  for  the budget, 43 against with 60 abstentions. Approval required  225 votes.    Acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin did not succeed in  persuading the Duma to pass the budget as a compromise reached  in close cooperation between the government and the lower house  of parliament. He said that without an approved budget the  government does not have the right to use credits of the Central  Bank but is limited to taxes which he said constitute only 60  pct of the necessary resources. This threatens this year's  supplies to North Russia and the gathering of the harvest and  puts off the planned raise in the earnings of government  employees.    After the voting results were announced the Agrarian faction  suggested putting off the matter till Friday as 15 of its  members were absent.    Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin gave instructions to cancel all  deputy business trips and visits of parliamentary delegations  and said that all deputies should come to Moscow for the crucial  vote.    Appropriate orders were given to the head of the office of  the Duma Andrey Voikov.    The voting is scheduled for Friday morning when a plenary  session is to begin at 9 a.m.</p>

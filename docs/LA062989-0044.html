			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE SAYS CSUN MUST REINSTATE FIRED PROFESSOR  </P> <P> A state board has ordered the reinstatement of a longtime Cal State Northridge  professor who was fired last summer for allegedly offering students "A" grades  in exchange for selling raffle tickets to raise money for his nonprofit  foundation.  </P> <P> The State Personnel Board, in a closed session Tuesday, voted to suspend Eleazu  S. Obinna for 90 days and then ordered CSUN to give him back his job in the  Pan-African studies department, said Walter Vaughn, the board's assistant  executive officer.  </P> <P> The board upheld the recommendation of Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry  who, in a written opinion, said that there was not enough evidence to support  university allegations that during the spring, 1988, semester, Obinna offered  his students A's for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets to benefit the United  Crusade Foundation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hearings on Campus  </P> <P> Berry wrote the opinion after listening to seven days of testimony during  appeal hearings held on the CSUN campus in November, 1988, and February.  </P> <P> Berry said Wednesday that he recommended that Obinna -- a tenured, 17-year CSUN  professor -- be suspended for unprofessional conduct for "selling tickets in  connection with a class."  </P> <P> "It is not an appropriate class activity," Berry said.  </P> <P> Obinna, 54, could not be reached for comment on the decision. University  officials declined to comment because the incident is a confidential personnel  matter, spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said.  </P> <P> The board, at Berry's recommendation, also dismissed allegations that Obinna  lied to superiors about class requirements for the upper-division course, Field  Work in the African-American Community, to cover up the alleged grade-selling  scheme.  </P> <P> Four CSUN students testified in November that they were told by Obinna and  former part-time CSUN instructor Willie J. Bellamy that the only work required  for the three-unit course was the sale of 20 $5 raffle tickets. The students  said they were told they did not have to attend class or complete any other  assignments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denied Allegations  </P> <P> Bellamy, who was fired but did not appeal, denied telling students that they  would receive A's for selling the tickets. He is now a religious studies  student at the school.  </P> <P> Obinna testified in February that he never discussed "sales for a grade." He  said students were asked if they would volunteer to sell tickets. To earn their  grade, students were required to go on field trips, perform community service  and write a term paper, he said.  </P> <P> In addition to Obinna's testimony, four of the 83 students enrolled in his  class testified that they never were offered grades in exchange for selling  raffle tickets.  </P> <P> Obinna's attorney, Francis E. Smith, said in closing arguments that even if  some students had concluded that they could earn a grade by selling the  tickets, "the discipline sought is nevertheless unreasonable."  </P> <P> Colleagues of Obinna had testified that they believed the Nigerian-born Obinna  was fired because of his blunt and often outspoken criticism of university  officials and policies in the past.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Slight Error'  </P> <P> Smith on Wednesday said that the board's decision indicated "that at most there  was a slight error in judgment" for encouraging the sale of the tickets by his  students. The university prohibits the sale of raffle tickets by outside  organizations.  </P> <P> The raffle money was to have been used by the foundation to create a community  center in Pacoima to assist black residents, Obinna said at the February  hearing. The raffle, which offered a donated sports car as the prize, was  subsequently canceled and the money has been held in trust pending its return  to ticket buyers, he said.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office sent an auditor to hear testimony in the  Obinna hearing but Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi said Wednesday that his office  is no longer actively investigating Obinna's foundation. "The issue was the  returning of the money, and most of the money paid by people has been  returned," Cordi said.  </P> <P> Students began complaining to university officials about the ticket-selling in  April, 1988, according to university memorandums filed in the case. The  university on April 28, 1988, announced the cancellation of Obinna's classes in  connection with an alleged grade-selling scheme.  </P> <P> After a campus investigation, CSUN President James Cleary on May 23, 1988, sent  a letter to Obinna telling the professor that he was being fired for  "unprofessional conduct and dishonesty" for the alleged grade-selling scheme  and then for denying it later when asked by his superiors.  </P> <P> Obinna denied the charges and appealed the firing. He continued to draw his  salary throughout the appeal hearings, university officials said.  </P></p>

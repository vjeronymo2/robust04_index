			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The heads of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)  agreed Thursday [16 June] to start consultations to pave the way  for the country's No. 2 opposition party SDP to return to the  ruling coalition, party officials said.    The two leaders also agreed to set up a policy forum, the  officials said.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and DSP Chairman Takashi  Yonezawa attended the meeting arranged by the nation's largest  labor organization, the Japanese Trade Union Confederation  (Rengo), which provides the main base of support for the two  parties. The DSP is a junior party in the coalition.    SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and DSP Secretary General  Kansei Nakano also attended the session. Rengo President Akira  Yamagishi represented the 8 million strong labor group at the  meeting.    Murayama told the meeting his party will continue to carry  out reform policies formulated during the administration of  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, of which the SDP was a  member party.    Yonezawa was quoted as saying he hopes for exchanges of  opinion between the two parties so that they can deepen their  understanding and realign the coalition framework.    Yamagishi said divisions between the two parties are having  a  detrimental effect on Rengo.    Yamagishi urged them to rebuild the coalition framework of  the Hosokawa administration, which preceded the present  government of prime minister Tsutomu Hata.    The SDP, the largest force in the Hosokawa government,  withdrew from the coalition in late April after the abrupt  formation of a parliamentary bloc excluding the party, forcing  Hata to form the first minority government in nearly four  decades.</p>

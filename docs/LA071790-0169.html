			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BROADCASTER WHO BARRED BLACK CALLERS IS BACK  </P> <P> A radio talk show host who was suspended for banning black callers returned to  the air today after his station manager said his action was not malicious.  </P> <P> Tim Lennox, suspended Thursday, returned to the air on WERC-AM.  </P> <P> But station Manager Berkley Fraser said Lennox was removed from his job as news  director and will be on probation for a year.  </P> <P> Lennox will also be required to develop, produce and serve as host of a special  series for the station on the topic "Birmingham faces the future," focusing on  race relations in the city.  </P> <P> Lennox said early in his two-hour talk show on July 11 that he would take no  calls from blacks that day. Lennox imposed the ban after three employees saw a  black youth break into a fellow employee's car and take her purse.  </P> <P> Lennox, 40, said later he made "an emotional spur-of-the-moment decision."  </P> <P> He and Fraser issued on-air apologies. On Thursday's pre-suspension show,  Lennox fielded listener reactions without commenting on them.  </P> <P> Fraser said Monday his investigation showed that Lennox's black ban was "not  based in malice and his 14-year career was without incidence of any racial  prejudice."  </P></p>

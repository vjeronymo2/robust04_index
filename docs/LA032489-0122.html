			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS GET BALANCE BACK WITH 115-92 WIN  </P> <P> A sure warning sign of Laker slumps, rare as they may be, is if one player  dominates statistically.  </P> <P> Balance and consistency among his starters is the way Coach Pat Riley says he  can accurately measure the Lakers' well-being.  </P> <P> Thursday night, for the first time in more than a week, the Lakers received  quality performances from starters and reserves. The result was a 115-92  victory over the Sacramento Kings before 16,517 fans at the Arco Arena.  </P> <P> "The last four games, we've been inconsistent," Riley said. "We haven't been  getting balance. One guy plays well, but two or three play poorly. You can't  win that way."  </P> <P> Riley's solution to the Lakers' woes, which included two consecutive home  losses preceded by two unimpressive close home victories, was to remove his  starters temporarily at the first sign of slippage.  </P> <P> "I talked to the team before the game and I told them I was going to play a lot  of people and see who could perform consistently," Riley said. "Let some of  them sit a minute or two and think about it. I told them that's the way it was  going to be for a while."  </P> <P> No Laker regular sat for too long on this night. Despite a shaky first half, in  which they struggled to take a three-point lead, the Lakers hit the floor  running in the second half and increased the lead to 13 points heading into the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Consequently, when Riley perused the box score afterward, he saw the balance  about which he had spoken before the game.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson, coming off what both he and Riley called an inconsistent  performance in the previous two losses, recorded his 14th triple-double of the  season. Johnson had 25 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds. He was particularly  impressive in the third quarter, when he scored 11 points, including  consecutive three-point shots that pushed the Laker lead to 17 points.  </P> <P> James Worthy, shrugging off a poor start, finished with 22 points. He made 9 of  14 shots, getting hot in the second quarter during the Lakers' comeback.  Support also came from Byron Scott, who had 20 points, and A.C. Green, who had  15 rebounds while playing just three quarters.  </P> <P> Benefiting from Riley's expanded substitution policy were Orlando Woolridge,  who scored all 13 of his points in the fourth quarter, and Tony Campbell, who  scored eight points in 15 minutes.  </P> <P> "I had not been playing as well as I'd like to the last couple of games,"  Johnson said. "So, tonight, I just wanted to get back into the flow of my game,  get out running.  </P> <P> "Everybody was into their games tonight. That was a difference. We need five or  six guys playing well every game, not just one or two. Everybody was doing it  tonight."  </P> <P> In the second half, at least. A consistent effort for a full game once again  eluded the Lakers, but this time they reversed a recent trend by playing poorly  in the first half and dominating the second.  </P> <P> After making just 40% of their shots in the first half, the Lakers emerged from  their daze to dazzle the Kings in the third and fourth quarters.  </P> <P> A renewed emphasis on stopping Sacramento's perimeter shooting -- Danny Ainge  made only 1 of 7 shots in the third quarter after scoring 12 points in the  first half -- resulted in a series of Laker fast-break baskets.  </P> <P> At one point midway through the third quarter, the Lakers scored three straight  baskets via the fast break, Scott and Johnson converting off missed King shots  and Green scoring on a layup after the Kings made a shot.  </P> <P> That sequence was immediately followed by Johnson's long-distance shooting  display. The Lakers had a 73-60 lead with just under three minutes in the third  quarter, when Johnson dribbled upcourt and sank a three-point shot with 2:45 to  play. That gave the Lakers a 16-point lead.  </P> <P> But Kenny Smith, who led King scorers with 21 points, countered with a drive  for a basket. Then Johnson did in the Kings for good by sinking another  three-point shot 40 seconds after the first for a 79-62 lead.  </P> <P> The closest Sacramento came after that was 12 points early in the fourth  quarter. The Kings shot just 40% and were outrebounded, 56-41. And the Lakers  made better than 50% of their shots (52.7%) for the first time in six games.  </P> <P> It became such a Laker runaway that seldom-used reserves Mark McNamara and Jeff  Lamp successfully executed their give-and-go wraparound pass through the lane  for the first time since unveiling it earlier in the month in a rout of the  Miami Heat.  </P> <P> So, if all is not totally right yet in the Lakers' world, at least they could  forget that poor first half and dwell on their second.  </P> <P> "If you're going to have hard times (in a game), have it early," Scott said.  "But this team has a lot of pride. We can take care of business when we have  to. That's what we did in the second half tonight."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made the 17th stop on his farewell tour. To honor  Abdul-Jabbar, the Kings established an annual scholarship in his name at Cal  State Sacramento. The scholarship will be awarded to a student based on  financial need and commitment to fighting illiteracy among underprivileged  youth in the Sacramento area. Gov. George Deukmejian and King owner Gregg  Lukenbill presided over the ceremony, which delayed the start of the game for  30 minutes. "This is a man who is highly talented and very gifted as an  individual," said Deukmejian, who also presented Abdul-Jabbar with a  commemorative desk clock. "Going beyond all of his records is the fact he's a  real champion. He's a genuine individual, a person who carries a quiet dignity.  . . . On behalf of all the people, we want to thank him for all the enjoyment  he has brought to California, starting at UCLA and continuing with the Lakers."  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar said he has followed the Kings' franchise through many changes.  "My relationship (with the Kings) goes a long way back -- too long, it's almost  embarrassing," he said. "I remember listening to the Knick games on the radio  against Rochester, which was this franchise. I remember playing against  Cincinnati, and that was this team. Then, I remember Omaha and Kansas City.  Finally, (the franchise) has a home. I think this is probably the best place  they could be."  </P> <P> Laker Coach Pat Riley, who played college basketball at the University of  Kentucky, said he expected the rumors that he was a candidate for the vacant  coaching position. "It happened before, about three or four years ago," Riley  said. "I was rumored to be going there. It's the same thing. I'm not going."  </P> <P> Strange statistic of the day: Before Thursday night, in four games against the  Sacramento Kings, Laker forward A.C. Green had made 17 of 27 shots. Less  impressive, Green also had made 17 of 27 free throws.  </P></p>

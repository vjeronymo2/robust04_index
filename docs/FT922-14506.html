			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Voluntary control to be urged by Cadbury CONCERN that government may impose restrictions on the activities of boards of directors has prompted a wide-ranging panel to urge voluntary action to improve corporate governance and the quality of corporate accounting statements. Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, said in an interview with the Financial Times that several recent corporate collapses had increased pressure for tighter controls. 'One of the issues before us is a political one, ' he said, noting that the Labour party had prepared a briefing paper on accounting reform. 'That will concentrate the minds of those companies who do not believe it is in their interests to raise standards,' he added. His committee had sought a consensus on self-regulation because all parties believed government regulation could be an alternative. He said that while regulation was more likely from a Labour government, it would not be inconceivable that a Tory government would seek some controls. Sir Adrian warned, however, that recommendations from his committee might not be as far-reaching as some would have liked. For instance, the final report, expected to be produced in late May, will make no specific recommendations on executive remuneration. 'Remuneration is a part of that much bigger question of board accountability,' he said. The report is expected to focus on the quality of accounts and the responsibilities of directors in preparing them. Details, Page 12</p>

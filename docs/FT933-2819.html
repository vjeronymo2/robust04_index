			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Falling bonds hit currencies THE US dollar and sterling fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday as their respective bond markets suffered sudden and steep declines, writes James Blitz. Both of the currencies have been afflicted by the same problem in the last two days. Unexpectedly high inflation figures have made dealers think that short-term interest rates in the US and UK will go no lower, and may even rise. This has lowered the attraction for investment at the 'long end' in UK gilts and US Treasury bonds. In the US, Tuesday's consumer price index showed a rise of 0.3 per cent in August, against expectations of a 0.1 per cent increase. Yesterday, UK figures showed a year-on-year rise for the retail price index in August of 1.7 per cent, against a 1.4 per cent increase in the year to July. Expectations had been for an August figure of 1.5 per cent. In time, the prospect of firmer rates in the UK and US may give the dollar and sterling a boost because of the higher return on short-term investment. But yesterday there was substantial selling in the gilts and US Treasury markets and both currencies fell as dealers liquidated positions. The dollar closed more than a pfennig down at DM1.5930 and the pound ended 1 1/4 pfennigs lower at DM2.4725. Sterling finished at Dollars 1.5515 from a previous Dollars 1.5465. The fall in US treasuries started a bandwagon effect in Europe. As dealers sold dollars for D-Marks, the German currency appreciated against currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. The French franc closed unchanged at FFr3.487 against the D-Mark, although it had visited FFr3.4962 at one stage. The Belgian franc also depreciated on the same day that the authorities in Belgium marginally cut interest rates. In spite of some easing in French and Belgian monetary policy in recent days, there were signs that dealers were becoming frustrated by the high level of European rates. In spite of yesterday's cut in Belgian rates, some Belgian franc interest rate futures contracts were unchanged and others sharply depressed. The fall in French franc interest rate futures in recent days is also a sign that the currency could court unpopularity with foreign exchange dealers. The Japanese yen traded erratically against the dollar as dealers waited for news of the Japanese fiscal stimulus, due on Thursday in Asia. At the start of trading, the yen was somewhat stronger, rising to a day's high of Y105.53 to the dollar, amid indications that the fiscal package could be in the order of 6 trillion yen rather than 5 trillion. But the yen later lost ground, closing at Y106.25 from a previous Y105.80. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America, said dealers may have been buying on the rumour of a big fiscal package and selling on the fact of it. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.5967 and Y105.95.</p>

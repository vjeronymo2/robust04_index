			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Spiridonov report under the "Party Organizational </F> Development" rubric: "Aleksey Kazannik's People's Conscience.  Former Russian General Prosecutor Creates Party of a New Type"]    [Text] Aleksey Kazannik, professor of the state and  municipal law department of Omsk University, has already  registered the oblast organization of a Party of People's  Conscience [PPC]. The new movement sets itself the task "to  formulate conditions to guarantee society against an inflow of  dishonest people into the power structures, and against the  making of incompetent decisions," as well as to create a system  for the selection of personnel and a mechanism of control over  the formulaic passing and retraction of decisions at all levels.  Only highly moral and law-abiding citizens can join the party.  The PPC counts on support from broad sections of the population,  from workers to peasants to entrepreneurs, who identify their  future with the prosperity of Russia.    According to Mr. Kazannik, he has already received requests  from representatives of 47 regions in the country for the PPC's  program documents so as to set up branches of the party in the  regions. The founding conference of the PPC may be held as  early as the fall, and the new party will be registered on the  federal level.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The coexistence of Hungarians and Serbs in Vojvodina  is growing more difficult, since nationalism has further  increased. This is what Andras Agoston, chairman of the  Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, told Hungarian  Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn. Andras Agoston expressed  hope that in the future a clear and verifiable system will be  established in the mother country to support the organizations  of Hungarians beyond the borders.    Gyula Horn considered it important that the Hungarian  political forces, independent of their party political  affiliation and ideology, should be united in support of the  Vojvodina Hungarians.</p>

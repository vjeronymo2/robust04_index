			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Private hospital fails despite Pounds 30m aid from government Health Care International, the Scottish private hospital opened four months ago to cater for overseas patients, went into receivership yesterday when its bankers failed to agree a rescue package. The hospital, located in an enterprise zone at Clydebank near Glasgow, had been unable to attract enough patients - only 20 of its 260 beds were occupied yesterday. Its failure is highly embarrassing for the government, which committed a total of Pounds 30m to the Pounds 180m project. Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, accused Scottish Office ministers of 'recklessly gambling public money on a shaky, ill-conceived project', while the Scottish TUC described the hospital as 'a harebrained scheme which common sense indicated was doomed to fail'. HCI, which employes 400 people, hit a financial crisis in late September because of a severe shortage of patients from its targeted markets of Italy, Greece and the Middle East. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the possibility of the hospital's now being taken over by the NHS was 'not part of our plan'. He hoped it would be possible for the project to be taken forward following receivership 'in pursuit of the original objectives of the company'. Though modern, the hospital is unlikely to interest other UK independent hospital operators, having already shown that a Scottish hospital aimed at the overseas market is not viable. Its use as a conventional private hospital is restricted by its location in an area with powerful pro-NHS traditions. London private hospitals used to rely heavily on overseas patients, particularly from the Middle East, but this market has reduced in recent years. Most hospital operators now balance overseas work with UK patients. Samuel Montagu, leader of the syndicate of five banks lending to HCI, appointed Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen as joint receivers. Although new equity funding was available from the Abu Dhabi Investment Company, the French bank Credit Lyonnais, one of five in the lending syndicate, refused to agree to the package, precipitating receivership. It said yesterday a viable refinancing plan had not been forthcoming. HCI was conceived by two Harvard professors, Dr Angelo Eraklis and Dr Raphael Levey. The equity investors are led by Harvard Management, which invests money for Harvard University. The Pounds 30m of public funds offered to HCI included Pounds 22m in regional selective assistance, only some of which had been paid. Scottish Enterprise, the development body, had lent HCI Pounds 4m and invested Pounds 1.4m.</p>

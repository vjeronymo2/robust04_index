			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Enes Musabasic] </F>   [Text] In March last year the UN Security Council adopted  the no-fly zone resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since then  the Serb aggressor has violated this ban several hundreds of  times, while the NATO planes did not react.    Finally it happened. By shooting down four planes of the  Serbian air force, NATO has carried out in full the task it was  given if the resolution was violated. One should immediately  say that the Serb aggressor again tried to test the readiness of  the international community to react decisively to such  challenges. In any case, this act will have long-term  consequences, and will considerably influence the future  developments in the military and political situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic's Serbs made a miscalculation.  They failed to keep in mind that things can change suddenly in  Bosnia after the NATO ultimatum. As a matter of fact, they  interpreted their factual defeat around Sarajevo as a victory,  but they were forced under threat of air strikes to withdraw  their heavy weapons. They were relying on Mummy Russia and  several hundred Russian soldiers, who came to Sarajevo as part  of the blue helmets.    Such a mood of theirs was encouraged by Russia, which has  been caught up in euphoria after their [Sarajevo] initiative and  the pressure they exerted on Karadzic's criminals. The Russians  have, however, now laid their cards on the table, and revealed  to all the protagonists in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war that they  are not neutral and that they are openly supporting the Serb  aggressor side. So the Serbs, busy applauding the Russians, and  still smarting from their defeat in Sarajevo, failed to notice  the change toward a more active attitude by the United States  regarding the war in Bosnia. Not even the ultimatum made them  see that. However, by shooting down four of their planes, NATO  -- carrying out the UN mandate -- has finally taught them the  lesson, which is what President Clinton himself told reporters.    The hitherto indecisiveness of the international community  only encouraged the destroyers of Bosnia. Through lies,  deceptions, and cunning -- after all, on top of Serb mythology,  that is what their entire project rests on -- Milosevic and  Karadzic (blinded) Europe and the world, while simultaneously  carrying out their dirty work. Perhaps they would have succeeded  in it again this time, had it not been for the chetnik planes  [words indistinct]. As it is, the shooting down of the planes  is a clear message to them and to all the protagonists in the  Bosnian war. The West has finally understood that only military  might can force the Bosnian Serbs and Milosevic to search for  political solutions through negotiations.    Finally, let us also say that after the sudden cooling of  the  relations between Washington and Moscow -- true, not only  because of the Bosnian issue -- the shooting down of the Serb  planes sends a clear message to Moscow as well. Talking of the  Russians, let us add that Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said  yesterday in front of a crowd of reporters that all the sides in  the Bosnian conflict possess an air force. He said that and yet  the ground did not open up and swallow him!    Only some 10 days ago, Vitaliy Churkin defended himself  before reporters in Sarajevo saying that he had never said that  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with the attack on the  former Yugoslav People's Army, even though he had said just that  into the microphones of Radio Belgrade. Finally, Moscow is  supporting the shooting down of the Bosnian Serb planes, but  with reserves, thus leaving itself room to criticize such  attacks in the future.    Kozyrev announced that the Russians would double their  efforts to stop the war in Bosnia and find a solution for peace.  Let us hope this will not be like their efforts to date.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: FRNs provide safe haven as European rates start to rise - International Amid the bloodbath in the world's bond markets this year, one area of the eurobond market, the floating-rate note sector, has thrived. With the move upwards in European short-term interest rates only just beginning, FRNs look set to remain in vogue. Since the turn of the year, investors have fled the fixed-rate markets at the prospect of rising inflation and higher short-term rates. Many of those brave enough to remain with bonds have turned to the relative safety of FRNs. These offer a variable rate of interest which moves to reflect changes in money market interest rates. They therefore provide some protection for investors when official interest rates begin to turn upwards. 'The bond markets are in a horrible state and in such times of uncertainty, the FRN is a valuable defensive instrument,' said one eurobond dealer in London. 'It's pretty grim out there. Investors are turning to FRNs because they don't want to buy anything else,' said another trader. The volume of new FRNs issued has risen dramatically, to Dollars 76.8bn so far this year, compared with Dollars 72.1bn for all of 1993 and Dollars 48.2bn for 1992. The first rise in US interest rates in February caused the initial surge in FRN activity. 'People realised the bull market was over and ran for cover,' said one dealer. However, the increase in the supply of new issues caused spreads to widen - the interest rate on an FRN is usually set at a 'spread' or margin over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), the benchmark interest rate for the market. That, and a slightly improved sentiment in government bond markets, spurred a move back into fixed-interest bonds. However, that move was only temporary. Further weakness in the fixed interest sector has caused a new flood of investors looking to break into the FRN market. 'Now people are beginning to realise that the bear market is here to stay, which means the FRN market will get busier,' said one dealer. Last week's sharp falls in European government bonds made it clear that any confidence the markets may have had left that European bonds could 'decouple' from the US market - which is further advanced in the economic cycle - is fast disappearing. 'Few people believe there will be any more interest rate cuts in Europe,' said a syndicate manager at a US investment bank in London. 'Many think the rest of Europe will now be pressurised into following the UK and raising rates. 'This should be bullish for long-dated fixed interest bonds, as long-term inflation prospects improve, and we should see a flattening of the yield curve. In the meantime, if you are not sure when that improvement will come and you do not want to stay in cash, the best bet is probably to get into a short-dated floating rate instrument.' Last week, Europe's interest rate cycle began to turn upwards for real when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, launched his pre-emptive strike on UK inflation. The half point rise in rates was undoubtedly the first of many steps upwards. With that dismal prospect for fixed interest bonds, the floating-rate sector will probably remain busy.</p>

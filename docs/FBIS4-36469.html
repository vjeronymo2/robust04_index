			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Me'ir Einstein on 9 June; place not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Einstein] Mr. Prime Minister,  we know the PLO has been trying to establish political facts in  Jerusalem. What is the government doing about it?    [Rabin] We launched consultations on the Jerusalem situation  two or three weeks ago, even before the public storm broke out.  Organizations providing the Palestinian residents of the  territories with services have been established over the years;  some of them are fully justified. These include the Supreme  Islamic Council, which is responsible for Temple Mount, a sacred  site frequented by Palestinians from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza.  This council has been in charge of religious services since  1967. There is the al-Maqasid Hospital, which has existed under  different governments for many years, and which serves residents  in and outside East Jerusalem. There are institutions in other  fields devoid of any political significance.    We intend to explore the situation. As Israeli law applies  to united Jerusalem, we may be forced to initiate special  legislation to avert any PLO attempt to set up bodies of  governing nature in Jerusalem. The PLO pledged that all  Palestinian Authority bodies would be in Jericho during the  interim period. We will insist on it even if special  legislation is needed to ensure it.    [Einstein] What about Orient House activities?    [Rabin] If Mr. Faysal al-Husayni wants to be member of the  Palestinian Authority, he will have to reside in Jericho. If he  wishes to remain in Jerusalem, he will have to waive membership  in the Palestinian Authority.    [Einstein] Does this mean we are going to close Orient  House?    [Rabin] We will check the legal aspects. In fact, the  attorney general has been doing it for about two weeks. A  discussion on the issue was held in my office and a similar  discussion was held at the Ministerial Committee on National  Security Affairs. The discussions dealt with moves we should  take to ensure that the agreement is adhered to and that all the  governing authorities and their institutions be situated in  Jericho, and not in Jerusalem during the interim period.    [Einstein] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin.</p>

He is a candidate of economic sciences, full member  of the Russian Information Science Academy and of the Russian  Academy of Social Sciences. He is 47, was born and grew up in  Yalta [Crimea]. In a conversation with journalists, he said  that he has his own "team," but is not yet going to change the  people in the present Crimean government -- he will first look  closely at them. He said that there would be no miracle: The  Crimea cannot become happy over two days on such a basis as two  inflating currencies and severed economic ties. As regards the  introduction into circulation of the Russian ruble, an economic  union with Russia, Ukraine, and other no less important matters,  Ye. Saburov was very cautious in his statements and gave to  understand that he does not want any tension in the relations  between these states and is going to act exclusively proceeding  from interstate agreements.</p>

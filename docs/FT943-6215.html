			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Chile targets education as spending priority Chile is to make education its main spending priority over the next six years as part of its strategy to 'cross the threshold' into the league of developed nations, Mr Eduardo Aninat, finance minister, announced. However, overall spending would henceforth increase at below the rate of economic growth in a move aimed at tightening the fiscal policy inherited from the previous administration. Business groups have frequently argued that a policy of pitching spending increases at above the level of growth was hindering the battle against inflation, stuck at a rate of around 12 per cent. The government had to 'prioritise' spending and show 'responsibility and discipline,' Mr Aninat said in a presidential-style address broadcast on Monday night. 'We cannot satisfy all demands at once, however legitimate they may be.' Greater spending on education would mean sacrifices elsewhere, although Mr Aninat did not specify where these would come. Some savings could be made by encouraging private-sector participation in infrastructure. Spending on education would be raised gradually until it reached 7 per cent of gross domestic product, a level comparable with that of Germany and the UK. The government currently spends 5 per cent of GDP on an education system generally believed to have stagnated over the past three decades. Mr Aninat said creating a modern, properly funded education system was 'a national task of the highest order'. Providing equal educational opportunities was the best way of helping Chile's 4m poor to escape from their present circumstances. President Eduardo Frei has pledged to eradicate extreme poverty - which affects about 1m of the 13m population - by the year 2000. In order to steer the economy away from dependence on commodities and to launch the 'second phase' of development with greater emphasis on value-added goods, Chile would need a well trained, adaptable and mobile workforce, Mr Aninat said. Only thus could workers in uncompetitive industries be retrained and relocated in more dynamic sectors. Productivity must be raised by 3.5 per cent a year to achieve desired growth rates of above 5.5 per cent. Such productivity gains were higher than Chile's historical norms but in line with rates recorded in the past few years. Mr Aninat set out targets for the year 2000, including doubling exports to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn) and the creation of 500,000 jobs. Modernisation must be funded mainly with domestic savings and not foreign debt, he said. Given 5.5 per cent growth over the next six years, per capita income would increase by nearly half to Dollars 4,700, he said - a realistic aim given average growth rates of 6 per cent over the past decade. 'In terms of purchasing power, reaching this level of income would mean attaining a standard of living just 5 per cent behind that enjoyed by Spain today,' Mr Aninat said. 'We are not prepared to let this opportunity slip by.' Chile recalled its ambassador to Peru 'for consultations' on Monday after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori withdrew a border treaty between the two nations from congressional consideration, Reuter reports from Santiago. The treaty was meant to settle disputes left over from a 1929 agreement on the coastal border.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOYNER GIVES ANGELS VICTORY IN 11;  </P> <P> AFTER YANKEES TIE IT IN 9, HIS SACRIFICE FLY SCORES WINNER  </P> <P> From No Name to No Runs, the incredible Lee Guetterman saga continued long into  Monday night at Anaheim Stadium, as the New York Yankees' reliever pitched  three more shutout innings to extend his scoreless-inning streak to 26.  </P> <P> Maybe Yankee Manager Dallas Green should have let him go for 27.  </P> <P> But when the 10th inning faded into the 11th, Green opted to rest Guetterman --  and the rest is history, in the form of a 4-3, 11-inning Angel victory.  </P> <P> Lance McCullers, Guetterman's replacement in the bottom of the 11th, proceeded  to match one streak with one of his own, putting the first three runners he  faced on base.  </P> <P> Then, after finally retiring Lance Parrish on a bases-loaded line out,  McCullers turned the mess over to Dave Righetti, who yielded a fly ball to  Wally Joyner, just deep enough to enable Devon White to tag and score the  decisive run from third.  </P> <P> McCullers (1-1) was charged with the loss, but White's legs should be credited  with an assist. White used them to first beat out an infield hit and then to  steal second and third bases.  </P> <P> With White on third, Brian Downing on first and McCullers struggling to a  3-and-0 count on Chili Davis, Green called for an intentional walk, loading the  bases, and waved his outfielders in.  </P> <P> That momentarily staved off defeat, as left fielder Rickey Henderson was in  position to snare Parrish's line drive for the first out of the inning.  </P> <P> At that point, Green called on Righetti to face Joyner. Joyner, who drove in  the Angels' third run with a seventh-inning single, then brought home the  game-winner, scoring White with his sacrifice fly to center. The two RBIs gave  Joyner 13 for the season.  </P> <P> White's run made a winner of Willie Fraser (1-2), who pitched two scoreless  innings after Bryan Harvey failed to hold a 3-2 lead in the top of the ninth,  serving up a game-tying home run to Roberto Kelly.  </P> <P> That sent the game into extra innings, allowing Guetterman, who had entered the  game in the eighth, to extend his club-record streak. Before 1989, Mel  Stottlemyre's scoreless streak of 22 2/3 innings in 1967 was the longest by any  Yankee pitcher at the outset of a season.  </P> <P> Guetterman still has yet to yield a run in 1989, retiring the Angels in order  in the eighth and 10th innings and pitching out of trouble in the ninth.  </P> <P> In the ninth, the Angels had Downing on third and Parrish on first with one out  before Joyner forced Parrish at second and Dick Schofield tapped back to  Guetterman.  </P> <P> Joyner was in the game at the time only because of an injury to Tony Armas, who  was back in the lineup after spending more than a month on the disabled list  with a strained hamstring. Armas started at first base in place of Joyner, but  lasted less than six innings before re-aggravating the same hamstring after  committing an error at first base.  </P> <P> Joyner, slogging through a five-for-26 slump, took a .218 average into Monday's  game -- and with left-handed nemesis Dave LaPoint on the mound for New York,  Angel Manager Doug Rader figured it would be a good night for Joyner to rest.  Joyner has a career batting average of .174 (four for 23) against LaPoint.  </P> <P> "I've been resting him against the guys he's had absolutely no success  against," said Rader, who also kept Joyner out of the starting lineup Saturday  against Tommy John.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to do the right thing for the guy. He's getting close. It'll come."  </P> <P> So Armas started. And he made the move look good, too, homering in his first  at-bat, sending a LaPoint pitch over the left-field fence in the third inning,  slicing a 2-0 New York lead in half.  </P> <P> But in the top of the sixth, with Yankee runners on first and second base and  no outs, Ken Phelps hit a roller to first that Armas bobbled. The real damage,  however, was done when Armas reached for the loose ball and made a vain attempt  to tag Phelps with a swipe of his glove.  </P> <P> Phelps was safe on the error, loading the bases, and Armas was sprawled on the  ground in pain. It was the hamstring again, bringing an abrupt end to Armas'  comeback.  </P> <P> Joyner replaced Armas at first base and, after Jesse Barfield forced Sax at  home, was on the receiving end of an inning-ending double play off the bat of  Mike Pagliarulo.  </P> <P> Then, after the Angels tied the game, 2-2, in the seventh, Joyner broke the  deadlock with a run-scoring single off LaPoint in the seventh. Chili Davis had  singled and advanced to second on Parrish's walk before Joyner delivered his  one-out single to right.  </P> <P> But the Angels' lead didn't hold up. After seven innings, Angel starter Bert  Blyleven was out of the game, giving way to Bob McClure, and before the eighth  inning was complete, McClure had given way to Harvey.  </P> <P> But Joyner bailed out Harvey and the Angels, who extended a little streak of  their own -- three wins in a row.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Angel owner Gene Autry underwent successful cornea transplant surgery on his  right eye Monday at the Estelle Doheny Eye Clinic Hospital in Los Angeles.  According to the Angels, Autry could be released from the hospital as early as  today and is expected to be on hand when Jim Fregosi is inducted in the Angel  hall of fame before Wednesday night's game against the Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> The Toronto Globe and Mail, in today's edition, lists Angel pitching coach  Marcel Lachemann among the candidates to replace fired Toronto Blue Jays  Manager Jimy Williams. When this was brought to Lachemann's attention before  Monday's game, the coach laughed. "They might've got me mixed up with Rene," he  said, referring to brother and former big league manager Rene Lachemann. "I  don't know where I'd fit in any list of candidates. I think they're just  picking names." Lachemann said he has not been approached by the Blue Jays, but  conceded, "I think it'd be ridiculous not to talk to anybody if they did. But  these people have been very good to me here. My home's here. I've still got a  lot to learn about the job I'm doing right now."  </P> <P> Dick Schofield missed a second consecutive start after sustaining a groin  injury Saturday, but filled in at shortstop in the eighth inning after Dante  Bichette pinch-hit for starting shortstop Kent Anderson. Bichette's plate  appearance, incidentally, was the first by an Angel pinch-hitter since May 4,  when Wally Joyner batted for Bill Schroeder. Yes, the days of Little Ball in  Anaheim are long gone.  </P></p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / PLO scales down peace talks team THE PALESTINE Liberation Organisation yesterday virtually suspended its role in Middle East peace negotiations in Washington, protesting at what it claimed were unfulfilled pledges by Israel. In an apparent response to the tough Palestinian action Israel quickly announced it would allow the immediate return home of 25 more of the 400 Palestinians it deported last December, in addition to the 101 whose return was agreed in January. A PLO spokesman in Tunis said the Palestinian negotiating team would be cut from 14 members to three. It would also suspend the work of three sub-committees. However, the PLO has carefully stopped short of withdrawing from the peace process, launched in Madrid 18 months ago. The Palestinian decision follows two weeks of growing frustration in Washington and worsening violence in the occupied territories. Members of the negotiating team were bitterly disappointed by a new Israeli document tabled last Thursday on ideas for an interim self-governing authority in the West bank and Gaza Strip. They said it was little different from previous proposals, offered no real transfer of authority, and contradicted the whole basis of the peace process. The Palestinians say Israeli troops have killed at least 18 Palestinians since the peace talks reconvened last month, while the economy is suffering because workers are banned from crossing into Israel. They also claim Israel has reneged on a promise to speed the return of the Palestinians deported last December to southern Lebanon, and to improve conditions in the occupied territories. It seems unlikely that the small Israeli concession on deportees will be enough to persuade the Palestinians to return a full complement to the Middle East peace negotiations. The Palestinians had already halted work on the sub-committee dealing with human rights. Work has now also been stopped on committees on self-government and the issues of land and water.</p>

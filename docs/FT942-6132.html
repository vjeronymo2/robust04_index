			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Accountability of societies probed: Governance may need change, says Treasury The government is considering ways of making building societies more accountable to their members as part of the Treasury review of the 1986 legislation which governs societies. But societies are set to retain some protection from predatory takeover offers by banks or other organisations. In a delay to the original schedule, the first stage of the review is now expected to be announced to the Commons in the second half of this month. Officials have submitted their initial views, but ministers have yet to decide what changes they wish to make. The review, set up in January, will also have to take account of the outcome of the legal challenge to the agreed Pounds 1.8bn Lloyds Bank offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. The two days of hearings ended last week, but judgment has been reserved. Despite the lobbying from banks such as Abbey National and TSB Group, ministers see political disadvantages in exposing societies to hostile takeover offers by other institutions. There is a recognition at the Treasury, however, that corporate governance arrangements which were adequate when societies were smaller organisations now need changes. The largest societies each have more than 1m members. Although many societies insist they are already accountable, measures to improve accountability appear to be the price they will have to pay for the greater freedoms they will enjoy as a result of the review. Among suggestions to the Treasury is a requirement that, if a society's board advises accepting an offer from a bank, then it should obtain two independent valuations in order to ensure that members do not lose from the society being undervalued. The second stage of the review is likely to consider what specific changes can be carried out through existing powers, through the new powers which will be available from the de-regulation bill currently before parliament, and what would require new legislation. Some of the existing restrictions on societies - most notably the ceiling of 40 per cent on the amount of funds they can raise on the wholesale market - look certain to be relaxed. Among other changes sought by leading societies is a rise in the limit on bonuses that can be paid to members when two societies merge, and an increase in the very limited stake that a society can hold in a general insurance company. Some constraints will be retained, however, as the Treasury seems likely to prefer an evolutionary approach: the government will argue that the option of conversion to plc status remains open to societies which believe they should be able to operate outside the regulatory restrictions.</p>

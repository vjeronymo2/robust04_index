			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman, March 16 (AFP)--A senior PLO official  Wednesday [16 March] called for a timetable for evacuating  Jewish settlers from the occupied territories.    Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat, said the settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza  Strip "are an integral part of the Israeli occupation, and that  is why it is necessary to set a timetable for their evacuation  in parallel with the withdrawal of regular forces."    If the Israeli Government really wanted peace, Abu-Sharif  said, "it must go ahead with such an evacuation."    The PLO demanded the dismantling of certain flashpoint  settlements in the occupied territories following the February  25 massacre of Arab worshippers in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish  settler, Barukh Goldstein.    Abu-Sharif said the United States financed the construction  of the Jewish settlements, and should "finance their evacuation  as they did for the settlements in the Sinai desert," which was  returned to Egypt.    He reiterated the PLO's refusal to resume peace talks with  Israel until the United Nations "assumes its total  responsibility for protecting the Palestinian people in the  occupied territories."    The UN Security Council is due to vote Friday on a draft  resolution on the occupied territories.    The PLO has called for the deployment of an international  protection force in the territories.</p>

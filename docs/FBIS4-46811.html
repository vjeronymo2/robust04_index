			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Hill Kulu: "Majority of Russian </F> Speakers Will Link Their Fate With Estonia"]    [Text] Relations between the Estonian majority and the  Russian-speaking minority are now better than they have ever  been, writes Hill Kulu. The writer is a researcher of Estonian  migrations who is currently a guest researcher at the Migration  Institute.    The status of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltic  countries has been described with terms like: "violation of  human rights" and "oppression of a minority." Nevertheless, very  little has been known about what these Russian speakers actually  think about it themselves, what their experiences have actully  been during the changes of the last few years, what are their  goals and aspirations. The Russian-speaking people of the  Baltics have become, regardless of their own desires, tokens in  a political game that has most actively been played by Russian  politicians.    The report of the Estonian Academy was published at the end  of last year. It dealt with the impact that Estonian  independence has had, between 1986 and 1993, on relations  between Estonians and Russian speakers living in Estonia.    The report contained a survey conducted during different  years, in which about 1,000 randomly selected Estonians and  Russian speakers were asked to give their opinion on various  social, political, and economic changes.    The survey revealed that, at the end of the Soviet era,  1986,  more than half of Estonians felt that relations with Russians  were poor. This aptly describes the situation in which the  relative number of Estonians as a proportion of the population  of Estonia was continuously decreasing, and newcomers were  increasingly taking over the really important positions in  society. The majority of Russian speakers said that relations  were normal, but, deep down inside, they felt that relations  between Russian speakers and Estonians were strained.    After the birth of the Estonian popular movement the strain  emerged into open, public view. The situation was at its worst  in 1988, but, since then, it has gradually improved. In 1993 the  majority of both Estonians and Russian speakers considered their  mutual relations to be normal, or even good to excellent.    In the opinion of Estonia's Russian speakers as well as the  Estonian majority, their mutual relations have improved during  the process that has led to Estonia's independence. They are  better in the Estonia of today than they have ever been before.  This positive development clearly indicates that both ethnic  groups have accepted their changed positions in Estonia's  society.    It is not possible to consider the Russian speakers in  Estonia to be one homogenous ethnic entity. Within their numbers  there continue to be various groups with diverse attitudes  toward Estonia and Estonian aspirations.    Based on these attitudes, the Russian-speaking segment of  the  population can be categorized into five different groups.    The first group is formed by those who have been negative  toward the Estonian popular movement and have not wanted  Estonian citizenship. Among the 40,000 Russian citizens living  in Estonia, this group is a majority. Generally speaking,  numerous former party officials and Army officers, who have lost  their positions and privileges through the change in conditions,  belong to this group. Among other things, they have actively  opposed the breakup of the USSR and have supported Russian  conservatives. At the present time less than 10 percent of  Estonia's Russian speakers belong to this group.    The second group is made up of those who have had  reservations about Estonian national aspirations, and have not  wanted Estonian citizenship. They currently constitute about  15-20 percent of their ethnic group.    The third group is made up of the uncertain. Throughout the  process leading to an independent Estonia, this group has been  the largest. Its proportional size varied between 40 and 50  percent. Only after Estonia became independent did it begin to  decrease in size, and at the present its size is around 15  percent.    One positive development, however, is that the majority of  those who were uncertain have, during the last couple of years,  accepted the Estonian aspirations and have decided to link their  own futures with Estonia. This fourth group, therefore, regards  Estonia with cautious approval. The fifth group is composed of  those who have actively supported Estonian aspirations from the  very beginning and have regarded their own future to be in  Estonia.    Thus about 60 percent of Russian speakers view things  favorably, more or less. In 1990 this figure was only 30 percent.    During the last two years an increasing number of Estonia's  Russian speakers have accepted the developments in Estonian  society, and want to, themselves, be participants therein. A  good example of this were the local elections in October of  1993, when two-thirds of the 27 Russian speakers elected to the  Tallinn city board of governors approved of an independent  Estonia and supported economic reforms.    Nevertheless, a small part of Russian speakers have opposed  the development of an independent Estonia right from the start.  Numerous pensioners are included in this group, which means that  their numbers will gradually decrease in the future.    It appears that the rapid progress in Estonia's economy has  had its influence on the change in attitudes among  Russian-speaking people. Many have noticed how good conditions  actually are when compared, for example, with Russia.    Zhirinovskiy-style speeches, which are currently arousing  fears in Europe, were given in Estonia as early as 1988, and  there were many speakers and listeners both. The situation has  changed now: Although speakers can still be found, the audiences  have withered away to nonexistence.    It is clear that, in the future, continued tolerance will be  necessary among both Estonians and Russian speakers. Some  ill-considered decisions have created unnecessary strain and  have retarded progress. An example of such a decision is the  outcome of the 1992 Estonian referendum, on the basis of which  the Estonian cabinet did not actively endorse the citizenship  applications of Russian speakers that had been supportive of  Estonian actions.    Now that Estonians rule Estonia, they should more actively  aid the integration of the Russian speakers. This is important  also on the basis of Estonia's own security considerations.    On their part, the Russian speakers must learn to actively  use the democratic organs of the Estonian state and become  accustomed to the role of being a minority, which may well be  difficult for members of a great nation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 18 (AFP)--Turkey on Wednesday [18 May]  warned Iraqi Kurds against cooperating with Kurdish rebels after  Turkish warplanes attacked a rebel base in north Iraq in the  second such cross-border raid this year.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said Turkey would  not remain neutral if either of the two Kurdish movements in  Iraq started cooperating with Turkey's separatist Kurdistan  Workers Party (PKK).    Nineteen aircraft took part in Wednesday's raid and eight  bombed the camp, 110 kilometres (70 miles) from the border and  500 kilometers (310 miles) from airforce bases in east and  southeast Turkey, according to military headquarters here.    All planes safely returned to base, but there was no  immediate word on casualties.    A first cross-border air raid at the end of January was  described by the military as their biggest air strike against  the PKK rebels in the 10 years of the movement's separatist  insurrection.    At the time military officials said the Zhalah base which  was  manned by 1,600 PKK rebels had been wiped out.    In a warning to Kurdish movements in Iraq Foreign Ministry  spokesman Ferhat Ataman said Wednesday that Turkey had so far  remained neutral in rows between Iraq's Democratic Party of  Kurdistan and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.    "Should one of these two movements cooperate with the  separatist organization (the PKK), it will no longer be able to  continue this neutrality," he added.    Ankara suspects Talabani of tolerating and even fostering  PKK  activities in Iraqi Kurdistan and notably in areas under the  control of Patriotic Union fighters, according to Kurdish  sources in Ankara.    Ataman said Turkey was concerned about the instability in  north Iraq but would stick to its non-interventionist policy.    Government officials meanwhile said 86 PKK fighters had been  killed since Monday in security force operations in southeast  Turkey, where Kurds are the majority of the population.    Officials enforcing emergency regulations in the region said  a large amount of weapons had been captured.    The army has stepped up sweeps since the end of March in a  major push to finish with the rebels once and for all, according  to official briefings.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Twyla Tharp and Dancers - Ballet For lovers of dancing, Garnier's palace - the Paris Opera - is now the best place in the world. Of course, the Mariinsky Theatre will always be our holiest shrine, but French government policies have, over the past decade, made the Opera a dance-house without rival. This season it will offer 10 different and richly varied programmes by its ballet troupe, plus visits by five invited companies from round the world. That I would not give certain of them house-room does not detract from the wisdom of the principles involved. Last week the first visitors arrived, billed as Twyla Tharp and Dancers, but  -with Miss Tharp obliged to stay in New York - amounting to 'and dancers', which proved to be her newest troupe of 16 tremendous performers. The repertory comprised seven pieces, created during the past 20 years, and across those years Tharp has established herself as the most imaginative and free-ranging of dance-makers. When she started out as a choreographer in 1965, she was embroiled - but only for a brief span - in the deadly boring fashion of the period for 're-inventing' dance. This meant inaction as action, and the inexpert as expert. This was not for Tharp. A fireball of a dancer, she soon revealed the quality that has since marked her every work - her fascination with movement. She has journeyed through modern and post-modern, through jazz and show-biz, social dance and ballet, and in her travels she has taken ideas from each, fusing, contrasting, linking (and rejecting) elements to create a style that has spanned most forms of theatre, and has yet retained an integrity that comes from Tharp's devotion to movement. It has been an education conducted in public, which has fascinated her audiences quite as much as it has fascinated Tharp. She has asserted both innovation and continuity, grafting popular dance onto balletic stock, freeing movement, re-thinking it, just as she dared to combine rag-time with Haydn in Push comes to Shove, and showed the classically sublime Baryshnikov as the best of jazz dancers. Her choreography, as we saw in Paris last week, acquires an exhilarating freshness from this liberated imagination. Tharp, herself a virtuoso with a pugnacious and Cagney-ish air to her most daring feats, loves bravura. Her present dancers are dazzlers all, and number such artists as Stacy Caddell and Shawn Stevens from New York City Ballet, Petter Jacobsson (lately with the Birmingham Royal Ballet) and Jamie Bishton, a favoured Tharpian for several years. Thursday night's programme opened with last year's Sextet, a minor piece which toys with South American dance and the classic vocabulary. It comes as a shot of adrenaline to alert the public to what follows. What follows is Tharp at her most stunning: this year's re-working of the latter part of her masterly Brahms' Paganini from 1980. Jamie Bishton is in white; two couples are in black. Brahms' variations coruscate around them, and the dance responds magnificently. Movement catches ideas from the score, transforms the prodigies of the pianism into a tremendous cut and thrust through which Bishton slides, curves, rolls and races like the world's greatest athlete, who is also the world's greatest dancer. Long swathes of dynamics, sudden subtle turns and curves, mark his dancing, which is glorious. So are his companions. So is the piece. Then to Baker's Dozen, which has always seemed to me a view of the happiest comradeship among its cast of six couples. They dance, buoyed up on Willie 'The Lion' Smith's enchanting piano music, and in their elegant white outfits, joking with each other in easy converse, they suggest a constant in Tharp's work: the need to make order out of chaos or disjunction. It is a beautiful and irresistible work, which the present cast perform irresistibly. One may also trace certain subliminal links with the last, and major, piece in this programme: In the Upper Room. Tharp here offers the contrast between ballet shoes and trainers - and all that implies of gymnastic energy set against formal dance, between sport and art, between popular forms and academic disciplines. Not that she belabours the point. There is a flux of movement, almost unendurably energetic - a fact dictated by the relentless blare and grind of a Philip Glass score: vile though I found it, Tharp gives it theatrical sense. Loose, grey-striped outfits reveal traces of other, red garments, and these are equated with differences in dance style. Jamie Bishton speaks (dances) for athleticism. Petter Jacobsson, classically dazzling, incarnates the rule of the academy, and magnificently so. But this analogy need not be pushed too far: Tharp's choreography justifies and illuminates both styles, and with increasing power as the work progresses. Its finale, in which choreography hurtles in and out of the shafts of light that are the decor - the activity emerging from nothingness - is a masterly exposition of Tharp's command of dance in the theatre. How long before we see Twyla Tharp and company in London?</p>

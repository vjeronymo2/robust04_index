			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PROFESSOR TO SPEAK AT SAUDI CONFERENCE  </P> <P> A Ventura College mathematics professor plans to fly to Saudi Arabia on Friday  to address an international computer conference that is being held despite the  tensions along the country's eastern border.  </P> <P> "I'm betting on things stabilizing, but everything depends on what happens in  the next week," said Ben Matley, 60, who founded the college's data processing  department in 1969. "If hostilities break out, I certainly won't be going."  </P> <P> Matley, an expert on the computer's role in economic growth, was asked in June  to present a 45-minute keynote address at the 12th Saudi National Computer  Conference in Riyadh, which begins Sunday.  </P> <P> Mohammad Mandurah, an administrator at King Saud University in Riyadh, wrote in  his invitation that Matley's 1988 book, "National Computer Policy," has  generated considerable discussion among Saudi academicians. He asked Matley to  discuss government computer policies in developing nations in his speech, which  will be delivered to an audience of predominantly European and Middle Eastern  experts.  </P> <P> Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District approved Matley's  request for time off for the trip, on the condition that he not go if the State  Department later recommended against travel to the area.  </P> <P> The State Department has recommended that Americans avoid Saudi Arabia's  eastern province, where military forces are massed to defend against a possible  Iraqi invasion. The department has made no recommendation on civilian travel to  Riyadh, the Saudi capital.  </P> <P> Matley, whose air fare and hotel bills are being paid by the Saudis, said he  received a facsimile transmission from Mandurah on Saturday night confirming  that the conference is still scheduled.  </P> <P> "As far as safety goes, I'll have 200,000 troops and aircraft carriers to back  me up," said Matley, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1955. "When you  think about it, there were 12 people murdered in L.A. on a recent weekend when  there was no one killed in Riyadh. So where would I really be safer?"  CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

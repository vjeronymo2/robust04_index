			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Rafael Bikbayev] </F>   [Text] Cairo May 4 TASS -- Russia is interested in  stability in the Middle East which is located in geographical  proximity to its borders, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said in Cairo on Wednesday.    Kozyrev attended the ceremony of signing a peace accord  between Israel and the PLO to implement limited Palestinian  self-rule.    "It is the proof of our closeness that it takes four hours  to  fly from Moscow to the Middle East and twice as much to the  Russian borders," he said.    "I am convinced that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are well aware of Russia's  adherence to regional settlement as one of the co-sponsors of  the peace process," Kozyrev continued.    He pointed up three key aspects in the Middle East peace  process. The first one is Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip  and the town of Jericho. The second one is peaceful  co-existence and mutual respect between Israel and Palestinians  and "probably even cooperation between them in the future." And  lastly, comprehensive settlement in the region.    "We hope that it will be reached in the not so distant  future  and we will witness the signing of an agreement on not only the  Gaza Strip and the town of Jericho, but also other territories,"  the Russian foreign minister added.    Kozyrev praised the "outstanding role" of Egyptian President  Husni Mubarak in furthering the peace process in the region.</p>

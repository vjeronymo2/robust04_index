			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Tomkins Though Tomkins's full-year figures are eminently sound, they are scarcely as glamorous as the recent performance of its share price might suggest. The 5 per cent rise in earnings per share means that for two years in a row the performance has been static in real terms. The company talks of operational gearing in an upturn. But the consensus forecast - normally well-informed in Tomkins's case - is for earnings growth this year of barely 10 per cent. In other words, the bounce is another year away again. But then, a forward multiple of 15 or so is not hugely demanding. Indeed, as Tomkins freely admits, it leads to a separate problem, in that the clapped-out companies which it might otherwise want to bid for are on the same multiple or higher. In other words, the market remains touchingly convinced that the bounce, when it comes, will benefit badly managed companies more than it will Tomkins. Perhaps the interim results season will throw up one or two victims, as BTR found a year ago with Hawker Siddeley. But if Tomkins could weather the past year with no real benefits from acquisitions at all, it doubtless reasons that time is on its side.</p>

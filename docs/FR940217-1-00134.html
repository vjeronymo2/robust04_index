			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council at the address under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place to be announced by a later notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Commander Walter (Bud) Hunt, Project Manager, and Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Counsel, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) Staff, (G&hyph;MS&hyph;1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Deepwater Port Act of 1974 (33 U.S.C. 1501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires the Secretary of Transportation to designate a zone of appropriate size around and including any deepwater port for the purpose of navigational safety and to protect the marine environment. This responsibility was delegated to the Coast Guard in 49 CFR 1.46(s). A deepwater port safety zone is designed to promote safety of life and property, marine environmental protection and navigational safety at any deepwater port and adjacent waters. No installations, structures, or uses that are incompatible with port operations are permitted in a deepwater safety zone. 33 CFR part 150 establishes the geographic boundaries of the safety zone for the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in Annex A and provides for the modification of safety zone boundaries as experience is gained in deepwater port operations. Changes in a safety zone at a deepwater port are subject to notification and consideration of the views of interested parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 29, 1980, the Coast Guard established a safety zone to protect three single-point moorings at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) (45 FR 85644). The rulemaking was considered ``nonsignificant'' under existing Department of Transportation (DOT) and Coast Guard regulatory guidelines. On May 13, 1982, the Coast Guard established a safety fairway to provide unobstructed approach for vessels transmitting to the LOOP safety zone (47 FR 20580). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 16, 1984, LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard a request for a waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR 150.337(a) which prohibits a tanker from entering or departing a safety zone by other than a designated safety fairway. LOOP submitted to the Coast Guard chart 11359 and indicated two uncharted areas adjacent to the safety zone which they referred to as excursion zones. LOOP requested that vessels calling at the deepwater port be provided with additional maneuvering room by allowing use of these excursion zones when departing or entering the LOOP safety zone. Deviations from the safety fairway into these zones came to be known as ``excursions.'' On February 20, 1987, the Coast Guard granted for 1 year a waiver of the requirements that tankers enter and leave the safety zone by the safety fairway. LOOP was required to document the number of tanker maneuverings requiring transit outside the existing safety zone, the percentage of excursions which occurred within the two uncharted areas identified as excursion zones, and the date, time, and approximate track line used for each excursion. Since then, the Coast Guard has renewed the waiver on an annual basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 30, 1987, LOOP asked the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent. On February 8, 1988, the request was denied on the grounds that future exploration for or extraction of oil or gas might occur within one or both excursion zones. If such activity took place, the Coast Guard might have to revoke the waiver for the sake of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In May 1988, CONOCO, Inc. (CONOCO) was issued an oil and gas lease by the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) under the Outer Continental Shelf and Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 U.S.C. 1331  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) in the area that was in the uncharted existing excursion zone. The lease included a provision for the government to suspend or cancel the lease with compensation when provided by the OCSLA. In August 1990, LOOP notified the Coast Guard that CONOCO intended to drill under authority of Lease OCS&hyph;G 9678 within Grand Isle Block 59, approximately 500 yards outside of the existing safety zone and safety fairway and inside the uncharted southerly excursion zone. The Coast Guard is concerned that a vessel casualty could result in a catastrophic pollution incident if a vessel collided with a drilling platform located in the existing excursion area. However, neither MMS policy nor budget provided for repurchasing a lease. While MMS supports the Coast Guard's interest in minimizing the risk of a catastrophic pollution incident at LOOP, it contends that CONOCO has a legal right of access to explore for and produce oil or gas from the lease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 21, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of petition for rulemaking and request for comments in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing a request by LOOP that the Coast Guard expand the safety zone that surrounds the deepwater port (57 FR 2236). LOOP requested the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent thereby enlarging the safety zone by adding the two excursion zones, and prohibiting structures. The proposed safety zone would broaden the entrance to LOOP and prohibit the erection of structures or mobile drilling operations. As a result, the enlarged safety zone would reduce the number of required vessel maneuverings, eliminate structures from the zone, possibly reducing the risk of accidents and subsequent pollution. The proposed safety zone reflects actual tanker activity at LOOP based on detailed records the Coast Guard has required LOOP to maintain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

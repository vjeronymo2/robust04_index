The objective of  the government troops is "to take control of the southern  borders" with Uganda and Kenya in an attempt "to cut off" the  SPLA's "supply lines," Major Daniel Kody, said during a stopover  in Egypt.    "A large number of" soldiers, including regular People's  Defense Forces--government militia--have been deployed on  various operational fronts, Mr. Kody, a Nuba who commands the  SPLA in Kaya, western Equatoria, further said. In the Nuba  mountains, at about 600 km southwest of Khartoum, fighting is  raging on three fronts. Other clashes are taking place in  Bahr-al-Ghazal, in the southwest, around the road running  parallel to the Aweil-Wau railroad and by which the Army conveys  its logistics and troop reinforcements further south. Finally,  the Armed Forces and the SPLA are also clashing between Juba and  Kit, in line with the government forces' objective to advance  toward Pageri and Nimule in eastern Equatoria. [passage omitted]    Mr. Kody said contrary to last year, the government has  decided to launch a dry season offensive this year, despite  increasing international pressure because "the government is in  a serious state of weakness." "The only means at its disposal  to obtain breathing space on the internal level is by achieving  military success in the field and to boast about it to the  nation," Mr. Kody explained. He said the peace initiative  launched by Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda within the  framework of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and  Development "stands no chance because the government is not  serious about its willingness to negotiate."

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Privatisation before restructuring, says bank PRIVATISATION and the encouragement of new small and medium enterprises and greenfield investments should take priority over attempts to restructure state-owned companies in eastern Europe, the EBRD has concluded from the first three years' experience of transforming centrally planned into market economies. Access to export markets was also critical to the success of economic transformation in the region, Mr Guy de Selliers, the EBRD's deputy head of merchant banking, told a seminar on privatisation and restructuring attended by heads of privatisation agencies throughout the region. Mr Lajos Csepi, head of the Hungarian state property agency, said that with competition for foreign investment from all the former Soviet states, and many of the best companies already privatised, Hungary's favourable treatment by foreign investors was over. Future privatisation would have to rely more on domestic savings and 'alleviated terms of sale'. To broaden the scope of privatisation Hungary planned a mass privatisation programme (MPP) next year to mobilise small savers. It will also offer leasing, instalment payments, subsidised credits and 'all reasonable ways' of encouraging domestic entrepreneurs to takeover the hundreds of less attractive Hungarian companies still awaiting either privatisation or liquidation. Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency, endowed with billions of marks to facilitate the process, found it 'easier to get financial assistance than to find internationally recognised managers experienced in turning round companies to work for a short time in eastern Germany', said Ms Birgit Breuel, Treuhand president.</p>

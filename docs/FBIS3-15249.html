He  also said that the first lot consisted of 60 warheads removed  from the strategic missiles of the 46th missile division and  43rd missile army. There are about 2,000 nuclear warheads in  Ukraine.    He expressed satisfaction that Moscow and Kiev had found a  political solution of this problem. He also said that delays in  the withdrawal of the strategic nuclear weapons were due to the  unpreparedness of corresponding documents. He believes that  after the necessary papers are prepared by the Ukrainian customs  and other agencies, there would be no further delays.</p>

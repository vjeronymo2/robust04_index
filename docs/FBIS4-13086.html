			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- In a significant development Germany  has said its economic relations with India will not be guided by  non-economic issues like human rights and child labour.    This was stated by German Minister for Economics Guenter  Rexrodt at a meeting organised by Federation of Indian Chambers  of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Associated Chamber of Commerce  and Industry (ASSOCHAM), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)  and Indo-German Chamber of Commerce here on Wednesday.    The German Minister's statement assumes significance in the  wake of US' attempt to bring in human rights issues in GATT  negotiations. The German Minister made it clear that his country  was committed to free and unrestricted trade.    Rexrodt, who is accompanied by a high-level business  delegation from Germany to attend the 11th Indo German Joint  Commission meeting, said his country will not use non-tariff and  noneconomic issues in trade negotiations, he said. "This is the  stand we have taken in the Uruguay Round of negotiations," he  said.    Indian industry is fearing that some developed countries may  block exports from India by creating non-tariff hurdles such as  human rights. "Germany never boycotts goods from other countries  on the pretext of non-economic issues," Rexrodt said in response  to a specific query. "Indian goods as well as Indian businessmen  are welcome in our country," he said.    Referring to the pending bilateral accord between India and  Germany on civil aviation, he said the "delay" was because the  countries were sending "wrong signals."    "I must say the administrative process in India is  complicated and takes a long time to finalise," he remarked  adding that Germany attached importance to this bilateral accord  on air transportation and regretted the delay.    Admitting that some countries had raised such non-economic  and non-tariff issues in GATT negotiations, he said Germany was  of the firm view that such issues should not be brought in trade  negotiations. Rexrodt said Germany was also against "social  dumping" as different countries had different social standards.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / President F W de Klerk calls for urgent meeting with ANC leader President FW de Klerk yesterday called for an urgent meeting with Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) president, to deal with the violence which he said was blocking resumption of constitutional talks, reports Patti Waldmeir. Mr de Klerk said his government would not resume the talks until agreement had been reached on how to tackle the violence, and on the ANC's campaign of mass protest which he said was exacerbating unrest. He was responding to Monday's shooting of at least 23 people in the Ciskei black homeland during an ANC march. His threat to suspend constitutional talks appeared largely empty, as the ANC had already halted such talks over an earlier massacre.</p>

Without specifying the party, the judge said that it is  one of the favorite parties for the October elections. In this  regard he asked for help from his Italian colleagues to  investigate the trafficking in money and, if possible, to stop  it.    Says Amorim: "Our main concern is that this party could gain  power in Brazil financed with money produced by illegal  activities in Italy. This poses a risk for Brazil, which could  be governed by a party of illegal deals, of illegal money."    He added: "I do not know the origin of the money, whether it  originates with the mafia or with drug trafficking. The  information was leaked, and I only confirmed it." He was  referring to an Italian television report that the party is  being financed by the mafia and by drug trafficking.    Amorim met yesterday with Rome District Attorney Vittorio  Mele and with the group of Italian judges who visited Brazil  last year to investigate Brazilian links with the Italian  corruption network: Vittorio Paraggio, Maria Teresa Saragnano,  and Mario Almerighi. He also met with Justice Minister Giovanni  Conso. Amorim passed secret information to the judges on  investments by Italians in Brazil made with money coming from  illegal sources.    He said: "Whoever finances a party abroad, investing cash,  does it because he expects a major economic return in the  future. In my capacity as a judge I cannot identify the party,  despite the fact that everyone in Brazil knows which party it  is. It is a party with strong candidates for the October  elections, and which wants to gain power."    Amorim also met with Giovanni Galloni, the vice president of  the Superior Council of Magistrates, with whom he exchanged  views on the work of the courts in the two countries. In the  opinion of Amorim, the Brazilian judicial branch is the only  institution without indications of corruption.</p>

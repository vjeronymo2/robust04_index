			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / EC farm policy on verge of wide-ranging reform THE MOST radical reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy was within reach last night as EC farm ministers were locked in a second night of hard bargaining. Agreement on the reform would send a signal that the Community is at last serious about restraining its chronic overproduction of food - now running at about 20 per cent over consumption and rising. A deal could also clear the way for a conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations to liberalise world trade. These talks have been stalled for the past 18 months because the US and other agri-exporters regard EC commitments to cut farm subsidies as inadequate. As well as clearing the food mountains, the reform could bring cheaper food. It could also gradually bring about a cleaner rural environment by making intensive farming less economically attractive. Independent estimates calculate that the reform could cut Ecu15bn-Ecu20bn (Pounds 10.5bn-Pounds 14bn) off EC food bills, with 15-20 per cent cuts on pork and poultry, 15 per cent reductions on beef, 7 per cent cheaper butter and 3 per cent off bread. Mr John Gummer, the UK agriculture minister, predicted that a CAP reform deal was 'more likely to be late tonight than next time'. Mr Louis Mermaz, representing France, the EC's agri-superpower, said that in broad terms 'we accept the proposal . . we are very satisfied'. The main obstacle to a deal was a brewing north-south row over demands by Italy, Spain and Greece for the right to produce more milk than they are allowed under the EC quota system - which none of the three has rigorously applied. Their partners appeared likely to concede to Spain and Greece, as relative newcomers to the EC, but remained obdurate on Italy. Ministers were last night taking turns to negotiate bilaterally, on this issue and other loose ends, with the European Commission and EC presidency, before regrouping for a final push at about 4am. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Arlindo Cunha, Portuguese farm minister currently chairing the council of ministers, reached a compromise yesterday morning which preserved the radical structure of the Commission's blueprint and offered a number of sweeteners to farm interests. The reform includes subsidised prices cut towards world market levels, and full compensation paid directly to the farmer. For all but small farmers this refund is conditional on their taking 15 per cent of their land out of production. This scheme should slice into oversupply while buttressing farm incomes. 'What we are involved in here is a totally different philosophy to what has existed for 30 years,' said Mr MacSharry. The main cut is likely to be a 29 per cent reduction on the subsidised price of cereals over three years. This will virtually eliminate the export subsidies at the core of the Uruguay Round impasse and looks set to be endorsed in spite of the misgivings of Germany, whose inefficient agricultural sector has dictated the high prices of the CAP. Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the German farm minister, appears to have come to this meeting with instructions to do a deal, and last night said he was ready to conclude the reform debate.

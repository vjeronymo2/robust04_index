			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / G7 Summit in Naples: Yeltsin seeks 'consultative structure' for group Russian President Boris Yeltsin wants the G7 to set up a consultative structure so the group can have more 'continuous' contact, writes Robert Graham. His idea is to use the G7 network for crisis management and more sustained consultation between summits. He sent the proposal to Italy as host of the Naples summit. The Italians appeared to favour the idea, which could ensure them more say in world affairs, as Italy is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>

According to it, Thailand has  proposed to major donors cooperation under the triangle program  of assistance for Indochina -- with Thailand serving as the  center, or providing facilities and personnel for projects being  carried out.    Starting in 1994, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, the  Philippines,  and Indonesia begin giving assistance to Cambodia under the  triangle program by assisting Cambodian refugees who have  returned home for resettlement in Kompong Speu and Takeo  Provinces. They will be given guidance in rice cultivation,  basic farming, fishing, fresh water fish farming, vocational  training, training in sewing and handicraft, and primary health  care. Japan will provide financial support while Thailand and  other ASEAN countries will provide technical assistance.    Under the program, which began on 1 March, 10 experts from  Thailand's Education, Agriculture and Cooperatives and Public  Health Ministries will spend a year working in Cambodia. One  group of four officials will be dispatched first, the second  will arrive in Cambodia on 4 April. Their tenure may be  extended later. There will also be an adjustment in the format  and method of assistance in keeping with the level of  development which Cambodia achieves.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Centel awaits takeover approval CENTEL, the Chicago-based telecommunications group, said yesterday that it was confident its shareholders had approved a controversial plan for the business to be taken over by Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telephone company, in a Dollars 3bn deal. Centel investors held a special meeting yesterday to vote on the deal, which stirred up strong opposition from some shareholders when it was announced last May. The results of the vote will not be announced officially until December 11. Many large shareholders registered their votes by proxy ahead of the gathering, and Mr John Frazee, Centel's chairman, said: 'We're confident that, when the votes are counted, based on proxies received to date, that the merger will be ap-proved.' The takeover involves Centel shareholders receiving 1.37 shares of Sprint stock for every Centel share. On the basis of Sprint's closing price yesterday of Dollars 25 7/8 , down Dollars  1/8 , that values each Centel share at around Dollars 35 1/2 . Centel closed unchanged at Dollars 33 7/8 . However, Centel shares were trading at over Dollars 42 before last May's announcement, and some shareholders argued at yesterday's meeting that the company was being sold on the cheap and would do better to remain as an independent provider of local and cell-ular telecommunications ser-vices. However, Mr Frazee replied that the recent deal under which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the biggest US long-distance telephone group, will acquire a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular, the largest cellular telephone service, 'validates the price' of the Sprint offer.</p>

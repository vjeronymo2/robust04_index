			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Modest uplift for Dow as bonds recover Wall Street A RECOVERY in bond prices and a bigger-than-expected rise in industrial production failed to lift US stock markets noticeably yesterday, and amid light summer trading share prices registered only modest gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.67 at 3,328.94. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly firmer, up 2.23 at 419.96, while the Amex composite closed up 0.09 at 386.82 and the Nasdaq composite 2.14 higher at 573.13. Turnover on the NYSE was light at 167m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1084 to 609. For the second consecutive day, share prices were unable to break out from a narrow trading range either side of opening values. The fact that bond prices bounced back sharply, having fallen more than a point yesterday on concern about the outlook for reducing the huge federal budget deficit, had little impact on equities. The announcement of a 0.4 per cent rise in July industrial production also failed to stir much interest, in the market, probably because investors heeded the words of analysts who noted that most of the rise in output was covered by one-off gains in utility use and mining production. Among individual stocks, Chrysler fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 20 5/8 in turnover of 1.7m shares on reports that a few banks in a 152-member consortium are refusing to renew their loans to the carmaker, which could jeopardise the entire Dollars 6.8bn lending package. In contrast, the other big manufacturers carmakers were higher, with General Motors up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 36 7/8 and Ford Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 41 1/2 . Black &amp; Decker dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 18 7/8 in turnover of 1.6m shares after the broking house, County NatWest, slashed its third quarter earnings estimate from 38 cents a share to 23 cents a share. On the American Stock Exchange, ASR Investments dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 2 7/8 after the company reporting a second quarter loss of 47 cents a share after a 32 cents a share charge. Last year ASR made a profit of 28 cents a share. Wang Laboratories, also traded on the ASE, fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 1 5/8 in heavy trading on speculation that the company, which has just paid employees two days early and is still delaying its fourth-quarter results announcement, may be preparing to file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. On the Nasdaq market American Funeral fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 12 1/4 after it the company adopted a shareholder rights plan to protect them from any takeover attempts through 'unfair tactics'. Somatogen rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 after broking house Merrill Lynch initiated coverage of the stock with an intermediate rating of 'above average'. Canada TORONTO STOCKS returned to a more normal pattern of range trading and light volume, partly recovering from moderate to heavy losses earlier this week, dealers said. The TSE composite index ended up 8.02 points at 3,368.47. Advances led declines 280 to 233 on a volume of 21.0 m shares valued at CDollars 199.2m.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Halifax house prices index fell last month HOUSE PRICES fell last month after rising marginally following the general election, according to figures published yesterday by Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, Andrew Taylor writes. Halifax said that the average price of a home fell 0.4 per cent last month after rises of 0.4 per cent in May and 0.7 per cent in June. Halifax said that in spite of last month's fall prices were firmer than earlier in the year, when they showed much bigger monthly falls. It added: 'Although there are few positive signs of any recovery. . . it appears likely that UK prices will stabilise in the second half of this year.' Halifax says house prices have fallen 5.2 per cent since July last year. This is marginally better than in June when the annual price fall was 5.6 per cent. The average price of a home last month was Pounds 65,077. The price of a new house was Pounds 69,673, just under 2 per cent lower than in July last year.</p>

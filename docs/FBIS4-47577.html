			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Lyapustin, `Ripping Off Patients: Hundreds of </F> Millions of Rubles Embezzled by ... Public Health Officials in  Chelyabinsk']    [Text] All theft is amoral, but I have never seen a theft  more amoral than the one that occurred in Chelyabinsk: the needy  were ripped off--patients at Chelyabinsk clinics.    The budget (federal, regional, and city-wide) is bursting at  the seams--money is short for everything: subsidies to the poor,  welfare... Salaries to scientists and teachers, library workers,  and other persons on the budget have been delayed. No one knows  how to cover the shortfall of funds for new remuneration and  deferred pensions and wages. Yet the situation in which our  public health has found itself is an outright failure.    We still have a long way to go to support medicine while  budget allocations are being cut, drug prices are going through  the roof, drug purchases from abroad are declining, and the  health of the population is becoming increasingly dependent on  the favor of the ``sponsors.'' Sometimes the hospitals are short  of bandaging materials, and the physicians are sometimes walking  the picket lines and sometimes--almost striking due to low wages.    The answer is still the same: no money!    Yet at the same time... the staff of the Department of  Prevention of Economic Crimes apprehended a group of embezzlers  who put their hand in the till which holds the meager  Chelyabinsk public health resources. No, it was not the  professional robbers who cracked the safe--it was the staff of  the medical affairs committee who ``helped themselves'' to the  alms of mercy... Those whose job description called for pinching  every penny.    The first among the apprehended were the bookkeeper of the  city public health committee, a procurement official from the  same committee, and an employee of the disinfection station.    They appropriated the budget allocations for medical  development and drug purchases while the chief accountant and  his team were pampering themselves rather than meeting hospital  demands. Resources from the City Public Health Department  account were transferred to commercial structures. But not for  drugs. The criminal team acquired... gold jewelry and valuables!  How much? The investigation will eventually find the final  figures but an astronomical amount is already becoming  clear--400 million rubles.    The money also went to the stores where the clearing  accounts  were turned into sets of furniture, TV and video equipment,  refrigerators, and fur coats. And to write off the funds and  appropriate everything was simply a matter of skill.    No sooner than the citizens of Chelyabinsk recovered from  the  shock caused by the publication of a report about this crime in  Vecherniy Chelyabinsk, a new report appeared in the  press: the chief accountant of the Chelyabinsk city sanitary  epidemiologist station was detained at the Sheremetyevo Airport.  She was trying to flee after pocketing, in the words of the  newspaper, 70 million rubles. When arrested at the airport, she  also was found to have foreign currency. Yet the city police are  not yet confirming the amount but they are not denying it  either--the investigation will reveal the ``bottom line.''    Yet sensations did not end here. The procurement official  from the medical committee turned himself in to the police  without awaiting arrest. The chauffeur of the medical committee  chairman was also detained. Valuables, cars, and ``luxury  items'' were confiscated. Thus far, they are talking about a  theft of half a billion rubles. Thus far... This is because the  chief physician of the Student Clinic No. 2 at the Technical  University has also been detained. Who is next?    Such are the figures and facts, but they are not final. The  total amounts stolen will be clarified, someone will be  released, and someone, on the contrary, will have the jail cell  door slammed. The investigation continues, and the final  conclusions still lie ahead. Why did the usually reticent  investigators have the preliminary information made so promptly  available to the local press?    Is it because that they are afraid that someone is  ``behind''  all this? Especially since Chelyabinsk residents have more than  just suspicions about it--the husband of one of the suspects  (defendant) turned out to be the chief of the tax police. Here  is another confirmation--the investigator, Lieutenant Colonel R.  Podvigina, was ``warned.'' After coming back home, Raisa  Mikhaylovna found the apartment door open and things out of  order in the rooms, yet nothing was taken. Just a hint...    Publications on the case of the budget millions appeared  during the finishing line of the recent elections. We know that  the oblast administration has committed a number of gaffes. Once  they gave a ``present'' of several million to a dealer for  buying American clothes but found the merchant in the  Krasnoyarsk interrogation lockup and, of course, without the  money. Another time, they ``allocated'' 200 million for sugar,  and as far as we know, have not received the goods yet.    The scandal at the ``curtain call'' of the election campaign  helped the opponents of the democrats to secure such a  high%age  of votes in Southern Urals.    Yet it is not up to me to decide whether it was necessary to  catch up to the chief accountant of the sanitary and  epidemiological station at Sheremetyevo due to the premature  publication of the case. And why did the warehouse with the  scarcest drugs costing tens of millions of rubles burned during  the same period?    The interrogation will see it more clearly and sort things  out. We will wait until its end and will promise to tell the  Trud readers about its outcome.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK brewing The UK beer market's capacity for change is becoming slightly unnerving. The deals announced yesterday between Bass and two local London brewers illustrate the latest trend - the revival of real ale and the retreat of lager. Bass is to sell old-style bitter from Young's and Fuller's in its pubs while they sell Bass lager in exchange. From Bass's viewpoint, this may be a pragmatic response to a shift in fashion. The wider question is how far the economics of big brewing rely on lager holding its 50-plus per cent share of the national market. Given the distorting effects of recession, the underlying pattern is not yet clear. But while premium lagers may not be losing ground, the big standard lagers and keg bitters are. These are the brands which offer the national brewer the biggest economies of scale and provide barriers to entry. Some ground may therefore be lost to competition. The big brewers will still control the channels of distribution; whether they can command the same margins in a fragmented market is another matter. It might be thought that the regional brewers would benefit accordingly. But control of distribution is everything. In 1988, Marston's, another regional brewer, did a pioneering bitter-for-lager deal with Whitbread. Within three years, Marston's said, sales of its main brand should be up 50 per cent. Three years on, its profits are lower than they were then. Sales through Whitbread, it says, 'continue to be disappointing'. It seems the diversity which is the consumer's gain is also the industry's loss.</p>

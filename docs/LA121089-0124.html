			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> DUKAKIS OKS BOSTON ASSAULT WEAPON BAN  </P> <P> Declaring that "assault rifles are built for one purpose -- to kill people,"  Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed legislation barring their sale or possession in  Boston and called for a statewide and national ban. "They belong on  battlefields, not in our schools or on the streets of our cities," Dukakis said  during a ceremony at a Boston police station that has been in the heart of the  city's battle against drugs and gang violence. The law, which takes effect  immediately, imposes fines of up to $1,000 and 2 1/2 years in prison.  </P></p>

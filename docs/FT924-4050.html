			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Lebanon put back on the telephone - US company wins contract US telecommunications company MCI has begun work on a rudimentary telephone system in Lebanon, the first significant US corporate involvement in rebuilding the country's infrastructure since the civil war of the mid-1970s. A satellite-linked telephone network, with capacity for 5,000 lines, was installed by MCI atop the post and telecoms building in Beirut last month. It has also built an earth station linked to its own satellite and an associated switch for telephone traffic. The company is believed to be discussing a new telecoms system linking Lebanon and Syria. This, like the Beirut installation, would be of political as well as business importance given the influence Damascus wields over Lebanon and the Bush administration's efforts to woo the Syrian government since its participation in last year's Gulf war. Siemens, the German electronics and engineering group, is already at work in Damascus installing 700,000 telephone lines in a contract underwritten by Qatari and Kuwaiti finance. MCI said the Lebanese system, which guarantees connections for the 600-1,000 largest businesses and banks that need international links, takes the place of hard-wire infrastructure and is 'the beginning of a new communications network for the Lebanon'. Mr Larry Codacovi, an MCI senior vice-president, said Lebanon's Council of Ministers had issued a licence by decree last month. The value of the initial contract is understood to be less than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m). Mr Codacovi added that MCI would pay the Lebanese authorities in hard currency a share of revenues generated by the new system, with the understanding that Lebanon would thus accumulate funds to buy equipment to build a more permanent telecommunications infrastructure. Although MCI is a service company that does not make equipment, it is hoping to share in an eventual reconstruction of Lebanon's communications system. But Mr Codacovi stressed he did not think Lebanon would be ready for advanced services for about five years. The estimated cost of rebuilding Lebanon's telecoms infrastructure is Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m.</p>

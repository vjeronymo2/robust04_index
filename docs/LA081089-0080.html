			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> HOUSING PROJECT APPROVED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday approved plans for the largest single-family housing  development in the city since it was incorporated in 1960.  </P> <P> The council voted 4-0 for a proposal by M. K. Development of South Pasadena to  build 32 three-bedroom homes on 2.9 acres on Elizabeth Street. The action  reversed the Planning Commission's denial of the developer's request to build  the homes on 4,000-square-foot lots rather than the 6,000-square-foot lots  required by zoning ordinances.  </P> <P> The decision is expected to encourage other developers to build housing in the  1.1-square-mile city of 20,000 people, Acting Planning Director Brad Tarr said.  </P></p>

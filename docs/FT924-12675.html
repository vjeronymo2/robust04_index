			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Keating hunts for TV compromise: Australia's subscription television troubles AUSTRALIA'S cabinet may decide today on rules for the introduction of subscription television. On the other hand, it may not. Given the government's dismal record on the issue, no one in Canberra is taking bets. Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, has already changed his mind several times about how to introduce pay TV, most recently last week. Now it looks as though the rules are about to be changed again, adding to the confusion facing viewers, television networks and Optus, the privately owned telecommunications carrier which will provide satellite facilities. Mr Keating initially suggested that Australia's three commercial TV networks and the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) would be allowed to hold up to 45 per cent of the equity in a single four-channel pay TV operator, which would have had a monopoly until 1999. But in a policy somersault in June, he announced that two licences would be awarded - one for existing media companies and another for new entrants to broadcasting, who would be given a year's head start over the competition. Now that model has been ditched as well after being rejected by the Senate, the upper house of parliament, which Labor does not control. Last week, Mr Keating outlined yet another plan to Labor MPs. This one involved the simultaneous award of one channel to the ABC and two four-channel licences for commercial operators, one of which would be reserved for new entrants. Mr Keating describes this style of policymaking as leading from the front. But he failed to agree the plan with Senator Bob Collins, the communications minister, the television companies, the leaders of Labor's powerful factions, or the opposition parties which control the Senate. The result has been a frantic round of talks in Sydney and Canberra at which officials are trying to hammer out yet another compromise. Only two things are certain: there will be protection for Australian equipment manufacturers, and strict limits on foreign investment - probably 35 per cent of each licence, with a 20 per cent ceiling on individual holdings. The final plan is also likely to accept proposals from Optus to use to digital compression, a newly developed technology which is not yet in use anywhere else, instead of the long established analogue broadcasting system. Digital compression would increase the quality and potential volume of satellite transmissions, and avoid an expensive switch to new equipment when digital becomes the world's standard technology. But the other elements of Mr Keating's latest proposals raise a number of tricky questions: Why restrict satellite broadcasting to nine channels? Optus told a Senate inquiry that it wanted to operate 24 national channels and a further 24 regional channels. Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), its government-owned rival, is also believed to be planning to offer up to 40 channels by cable within three or four years. Why restrict the ABC to a single channel? Mr David Hill, its chairman, says the plan would restrict the ABC to high-cost, low revenue news and current affairs. He wants several channels to exploit the ABC's expertise in educational, children's and sports programmes. In such a tightly restricted market, how would the operator of the licence for non-media groups compete with an experienced broadcasting group, which would start with half the market? Many analysts think there would be no bidders for such a licence. 'This does not make any sense,' says Mr Fred Brenchley, a Sydney media consultant. 'It is a commercial idiocy which no one can explain. If we have the capacity, why can't we have the full 24 channels and four or five operators? 'The government has not made the mental leap that is required between existing TV systems and what is possible with pay TV. They are still looking at it as a political handout to their media mates.' The 'mate' Mr Brenchley has most prominently in mind is Mr Kerry Packer, chairman of Channel Nine, the top-rating television network, which could probably outbid the rival Seven and Ten networks, which are both in receivership. Channel Nine would then dominate pay TV from the start, possibly in a consortium with overseas media groups such as Time Warner or Comcast, the US cable operator. Mr Bruce Wolpe, a consultant to Comcast, welcomed the new plan 'because it means a deal has been struck which is likely to survive the next election, and that will give a lot of confidence to the industry.' But it is far from clear that the government can strike a balance between the competing demands of the three main Labor factions, the conservative Liberal/National party coalition, and the Democrats, the small left-wing party which holds the Senate balance of power. A compromise could involve a phased release of channels, with more access for the ABC and tight regulation. At least one potential player thinks the government is wasting its time. 'I don't know what they are trying to regulate,' says Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of US-based News Corporation. 'With modern technology there is no limit to the spectrum. You could have 100 channels, and when you do that anyone can have a channel. Some will go broke and some will do well. What does it matter?'</p>

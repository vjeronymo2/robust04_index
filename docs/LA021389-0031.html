			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> SEA LION DEATHS BLAMED ON NETS  </P> <P> A federal biologist says the unusually large number of sea lion carcasses on  Southern California beaches probably can be traced to an increase in the squid  population. Sea lions apparently have congregated to dine on the squid, and  drowned after getting tangled in fishermen's nets, said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife  biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The marine animals drown  in nets at the rate of 2,600 a year off the Southern California coast, and  those deaths don't violate any fisheries law or threaten the population, he  said. The number of carcasses washing ashore -- 56 since Jan. 21 in Orange and  Los Angeles counties -- represents a small fraction of that total, Cordaro  said. One of the dead sea lions was shot, but most of the rest are believed to  have drowned in gill nets used to catch halibut, he said. Cordaro discounted  allegations made Friday by a conservation group called the Sea Shepherd  Conservation Society that fishermen have been killing the animals by feeding  them fish stuffed with explosives.  </P></p>

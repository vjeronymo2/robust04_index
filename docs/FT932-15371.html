			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Ethics guidance for accountancy firms ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will be required to provide more information to their successors when a client changes advisers, according to draft guidelines issued yesterday. The revised guidance on changes in professional appointments comes from the Chartered Accountants Joint Ethics Committee, which represents the three chartered accountancy bodies covering the UK and Ireland. It stresses that firms must provide minimum accounting information to a successor even if disputes over fees remain outstanding. The revised guidelines also emphasise that a change in a continuing appointment is to be treated in the same way as a change in auditors. The information a new firm should be told includes: reasons for a change; disputes with the client over principle or practice; and any unlawful acts or suspicions of fraud.</p>

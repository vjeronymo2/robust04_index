			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Zeneca and FT-SE indices The FT-SE Actuaries UK Indices Committee has released a statement clarifying how the demerger of ICI and Zeneca will affect constituents of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices. The text follows: Both ICI and Zeneca are expected to become constituents of the FT-SE 100 index when Zeneca becomes officially listed. The demerger would thus necessitate the removal of one constituent in order to retain 100 companies in the index. Once the demerger comes into effect on June 1 1993, all constituents of the FT-SE 100 will be ranked by size and the smallest capitalised constituent at this time will be removed from the FT-SE 100. Based on current market valuations, both ICI and Zeneca would qualify to become constituents of the FT-SE 100 on implementation of the merger. The company removed from the FT-SE 100 will become a constituent of the FT-SE Mid 250. The constituents of this index will be ranked by size and the smallest constituent will be moved to the FT-SE SmallCap. The treatment of demergers is governed by Rule 7.2.3 of the Ground Rules for the Management of the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices.</p>

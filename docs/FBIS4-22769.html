			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuznetsov, former inspectorate chief of </F> the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety  Central District, with introduction by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA  special correspondent Kirill Belyaninov, published under the  heading "Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl": "Nuclear Power  Industry Through the Eyes of An Unemployed Nuclear Oversight  Inspector"]    [Text]  <H5>  A Peaceful Atom For Every Home: Alas, This We Have Already </H5> Achieved    I am sick and tired of it all. Of endless competition in the  speed of printing documents fabricated by one political group in  order to destroy another; of careful calculation of the arc of  fire at the headquarters of hostile political groupings and  pocket-size parties; the national pastime of watching the state  of the liver of the also nationally elected president and of  bringing in astrologers to tell us the dates and details of  future coups. In the endless flak of arguments about how to  conduct another revolution, we have somehow forgotten that there  are far more real problems.    We have forgotten that in the Far East "friends and business  partners" from North and South Korea will soon leave  nothing--not even stumps--in centuries-old taiga; that 150  companies from America and West Europe are flooding the country  with toxic waste in exchange for Russian metal; and that,  finally, because of our own negligence and indifference the  threat of a new Chernobyl has become far more real than the  threat of a coup.    I am sick and tired of it, because dozens of LITERATURNAYA  GAZETA materials--and we wrote about it all: the "black market"  in nuclear materials, the Western radioactive waste coming into  our country, the catastrophic situation in the domestic nuclear  power generation--did not elicit any response from our own  government circles, which are busier attempting to reposition  themselves in the shadow of the ruling chair.    I am sick and tired of it because the almost two-year-long  struggle of Vladimir Kuznetsov, former Gosatomnadzor [Russian  Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] inspector,  fired for his attempt to shut down 10 unsafe nuclear reactors,  has not produced any results. Among the people he appealed to  are the first persons in the Russian "ecological" establishment:  presidential adviser A. Yablokov; Social-Ecological Union  Chairman S. Zabelin... None of them supported Kuznetsov, while  the truly horrible information he collected is still gathering  dust in the safes of highest-level offices.    You need facts? There are many of them in the article V.  Kuznetsov brought to the newspaper. Judge for yourself whether  coup rumors are more important than something that affects our  life.  <H5>  Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl </H5>   Last year I had an honor my "colleagues" in the line at the  employment agency could only dream about. Can you imagine an  unemployed American being is invited as a consultant to the U.S.  Senate, let alone the White House? Nevertheless, anything can  happen in Russia, and an officially registered unemployed  Russian may work for an equally official presidential adviser.  There are numerous advantages to this method: If the finished  report attracts the "highest attention," there is no need to  introduce the author, who has not gained any status in the  nomenklatura; in the event of failure, however, one may resort  to a tried and tested remark: "Well, you know, we have to use  the services of questionable characters, but after all, we do  not get any support from ministries and agencies...."    This in itself would not be too bad--one can swallow  personal  insult if the information you collected literally crumb by crumb  did indeed bring about at least some result. But time goes on,  and nothing changes. Presidential advisers shove the material  you prepared to the back of the desk drawer; ecological  organizations of the Social-Ecological Union and Physicians of  the World for Prevention of Nuclear War type shrug their  shoulders helplessly; and ministerial bureaucrats simply dismiss  the facts and figures they are shown.    It is easy to understand the reason for such attitudes. All  the reports and memoranda are devoted to the activities of only  one, albeit very impressive agency--the Russian Minatom  [Ministry of Atomic Energy], which has always held the status of  "sacred cow" in domestic industry. Nevertheless, let us try to  sort out what is hidden behind the polished sign of the  omnipotent ministry.    Radioactive waste disposal is perhaps one of the items at  the  top of the list of Russian ecological problems.    Existing capacities simply are insufficient, and the size  and  safety of storage facilities are limited, while construction of  new ones involves immense expenditures of technical and monetary  resources. At the same time, existing plans for dismantling  nuclear arms and nuclear power generation systems far from  always comply with the ability to safely store the resulting  radioactive waste. At the end of 1992 the total area of  contaminated land amounted to 52,263 hectares. Of them, 16 were  recultivated over the year. According to official data of the  Ministry of the Ecology alone, Russian Minatom enterprises have  accumulated radioactive waste with a total emission power of 1.7  billion curies, which are kept in 227 storage facilities, and of  these, 81 have already been sealed.    If only the problem were limited to the number of storage  facilities, though! At some enterprises the waste is kept in the  open; most solid radioactive waste disposal sites do not meet  elementary safety standards. And the system of handling solid  radioactive waste in our country not only does not meet IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] standards but is contrary  to the practice of developed countries.    The problems of enterprises whose names have been mentioned  in the world press for many years--Mayak Production Association  (Chelyabinsk-65) and Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7)--still  have not been resolved.    In 1992 the maximum allowable discharge of strontium-90 at  Mayak was exceeded by a factor of 1.8. The waste was dumped into  the Techa river. At the same time, at the Siberian Chemical  Combine norms of discharge of phosphorus-32 were exceeded by a  factor of 1.14. The average annual concentration of this  radionuclide in the Tom river was 2.9 times higher than the  allowable level.    In 1993 serious accidents involving radiation occurred at  both enterprises. Serious and very representative commissions  visited the sites; tonnes of papers were written, but no  particular conclusions were drawn from the events. Suffice it to  mention that the already approved program of replacing equipment  presenting nuclear danger at these enterprises is still not  being implemented.    This, however, is just a concrete case involving only two  nuclear facilities. Of much greater interest is something else:  In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the  past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly  subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp  criticism. Inspection of practically all domestic nuclear  installations showed that "the state of nuclear and radiation  safety in the Russian Federation as a whole cannot be called  satisfactory. Numerous problems associated with the use of  nuclear energy are being resolved extremely slowly and are not  regulated by law..."    After such a serious statement, however, which for the first  time indicated a split between Minatom and Gosatomnadzor,  information came out which at first glance completely refuted  the Federal Oversight's conclusions. The Rosenergoatom concern's  vice president, B. Antonov, representing the main user  organization, said that on the contrary, the safety of Russian  AES's [nuclear power stations] has increased: There were 45  fewer incidents at stations in 1993 than in 1992.    For a specialist this is a strange argument, to say the  least. The decline in the number of incidents is not at all an  indicator of AES safety. Last year a considerable number of  AES's were operating at reduced capacity. This happened because  of the considerably greater length of the repair season at power  generators of all stations: electric power consumers simply did  not pay their bills on time, and the AES's did not have the  money to buy materials and component parts in the needed  quantities.    In addition, controller-imposed restrictions on capacities  (up to 23.9 percent, plus the restrictions introduced by the  Federal Oversight--26.1 percent of the rated level) together  produce a figure equal to a 50 percent loss in power generation  output. The figures above confirm not only the thesis of  Rosenergoatom's imperfect--to put it mildly--calculations and  the resulting conclusion regarding the increased safety of the  AES's, but also bring up a no less important question: Can it be  that electric power produced by AES's at the old level of output  is not needed by the Russian economy, which constantly complains  about energy shortages? And what has caused these restrictions  if, in the opinion of Minatom bureaucrats, everything is going  so well in their industry?    Somehow, the No. 2 and No. 3 generators at the Balakovo  station and the No. 5 Generator at the Novovoronezh station,  which had been under long-term repair, as well as Balakovo's No.  4 generator, which was recently brought on line, have  disappeared from the list of AES's to be inspected. According to  the results of last year, it was these stations' power  generators, as well as those at the Kola AES, that were found to  be the worst in terms of reliability and stability of operation.    In June 1993 a "medium-gravity incident" was registered at  the No. 2 generator at the Balakovo AES--jamming of 11  regulation devices in the control and protection system; at the  Novovoronezh AES No. 5 generator in February last year there was  an incident classified as "insignificant:" the water-chemical  condition was off balance. At the Kola AES the incident was far  more serious: As a result of a hurricane, high-voltage lines in  the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the  shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators.    As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the  agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at  RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and  steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated  power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to  the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in  the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety  factors at most power generators is still at the stage of  development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned  measures with respect to power generators' technical  retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all  nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still  being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the  time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does  not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's  contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's  appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no  guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a  purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance.    Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation  industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety.    Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation  with respect to them is even more difficult than that with  nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme  obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and  technological systems, but also the absence of practically any  norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical  documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of  research systems, which would allow a definition of the  necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system  for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for  personnel training.    The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at  scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is  critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic  Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy  Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in  Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled  to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for  reprocessing it simply does not exist.    The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII  of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium-  and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped  underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a  result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total  activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in  underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done  only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and  nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted  into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological  medium.    Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center  Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem  associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary  storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the  territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the  city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the  way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the  1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that  it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste.    Normative documents, which have been at the development  stage  since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many  others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is  simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific  organization with respect to almost all Russian research  reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce  stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable  financial investment and bringing the system to the required  level or shutting it down.    The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the  activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic  Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in  the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for  solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past,  the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm."  Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this  agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the  outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the  peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of  Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of  decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this  question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once  again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by  grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to  anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear  power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency,  and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary  miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the  recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United  States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk  about selling it to other countries?    Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package  of  legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power  generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up  by priority financing.    Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows,  perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge  Chernobyl zone.</p>

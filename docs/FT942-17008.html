			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: Lorca's life - Theatre As the excellent Spanish Arts Festival continues in London, the Lilian Baylis Theatre is staging a life of the poet and dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca (1898-1936). This one-man show is written and performed by Trader Faulkner; its closeness to Lorca's life alone makes exhilarating theatre; but its greatest strength is the fine flamenco dance and music. Lorca lived life on his emotions. His poems and plays, particularly the 1930s' Earth Trilogy of Bodas de sangre, Yerma and La casa de Bernada Alba are rooted in the Andalusian earth. Few graduates in Maritime Law - Lorca's degree at Granada University - can have been so attached to dry land. Lorca duly evokes the bright streets and the dark interiors of Granada, the passion of flamenco and the sadness of Cante Hondo, the Deep Song of the Andalusian gypsies. This play makes Lorca's plays more understandable, his poems less aloof. And, through Lorca's poems, it looks west towards new writing in Spanish. Lorca moves at an uneven pace; there is no plot and little sequence. It tracks Lorca's sad, passionate life from leaving Granada in 1919 for Madrid, his studies and friendships there with Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and Manuel de Falla, his travels to New York and South America, and his return to Granada where he was shot by the Fascists on August 19, 1936. Everywhere he went he lived the painful life of a man on the verge of reinventing himself. He was passionately in love with Dali. As a homosexual, he was often abused as 'maricon' (queer) or 'perro' (dog), a nasty joke which inspired Bunuel's Chien Andalou. The play delivers all this, and sets Lorca's poems to music and dance, flickering in and out of Spanish and English. Each scene is punctuated by the flamenco dance and music which give the play its visceral quality. The language - both Spanish and English - is sensual and visual, using Lorca's own poems. There is a wonderful bullfight based on the death of Lorca's friend Ignacio Sanchez Mejias the matador - A las Cinco de la Tarde. There are sexually evocative love poems, stark pictures of rural Andalusia, and a loose-limbed South American sequence where the stern rhythms of Granada meet the New World. The piece is superbly acted and sung. Trader Faulkner as Lorca, with the excellent Tito Heredia (guitar), Liana Vargas (dance) and Luz Elena Caicedo (songs) produce an ensemble performance of top quality. Faulkner himself manages the bilingual feat of memory, the intricacies of flamenco steps, and maintains the intensity of Lorca's life. Lilian Baylis Theatre (071 278 8916) until April 23.</p>

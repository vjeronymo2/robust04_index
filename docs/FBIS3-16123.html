He underlined that the fate of the Black Sea Fleet should be  solved in accordance with the agreement between Russian and  Ukrainian presidents "according to which, the Fleet should be  transferred to Russia."    Gromov negatively assessed attempts of the Ukrainian party  to  drag out the process of the Fleet's transfer, and, in  particular, the proposal to make an inventory of the Fleet's  property.    According to Gromov, Russian Navy plans to receive new ships  from the industry, "We need a fleet which corresponds to  Russia's economy and is able to fulfill tasks related to border  guarding," stressed Gromov.    He also reported that the heavy atomic missile cruiser Petr  Velikiy under construction at the Baltiyskiy factory in St.  Petersburg is almost ready and will be put into operation soon.  The crew has already arrived in St. Petersburg; the cruiser is  to enter composition of the Pacific Fleet.</p>

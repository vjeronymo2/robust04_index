			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Environment protection pledge from top banks COMMERCIAL banks in 23 countries, with combined assets of Dollars 1,500bn (Pounds 847bn), made a formal commitment at the United Nations yesterday to pursue common principles of environmental protection in all their operations, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent, in New York. An official of National Westminster Bank of the UK, an initiator of this first such collective effort by the industry, told a press conference that environmental risk was now a vital element in credit risk. The group of 31 signatories did not include any US or Japanese banks. But Dr Mostafa Tolba, head of the UN environment programme, said Citibank had expressed an interest. The signatories included Germany's Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank; Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp; Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp; Westpac of Australia, Royal Bank of Canada, and Royal Bank of Scotland. Among the principles to which they have committed themselves is to ensure 'the best practices in environmental management, including energy efficiency, recycling and waste minimisation.' In a report published today the UN environment programme says that ecological destruction has accelerated over the last 20 years, David Lascelles reports from London. Malnutrition has increased, the gap between rich and poor has widened and children have become the worst victims of environmental mismanagement. The report predicts that the world's population, currently 5.4bn, will rise by a further 1bn by the end of the decade.</p>

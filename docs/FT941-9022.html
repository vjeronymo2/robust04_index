			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Swiss voters threaten to buck traffic trend Picture the scene. An elegant chamois buck stands nobly on a mountain hillside against a background of Alpine flowers and a lorry-choked motorway. He implores you to vote 'Ja' in a referendum on Sunday to force all transit lorries off the road and on to the rails. Nothing tugs at the Swiss heart as much as a combination of Alps and wild animals, as the designers of this campaign poster know. And it seems there is a fair chance that a majority of Swiss will heed the buck's call. The referendum, which arises from a petition by residents of Alpine communities four years ago, asks voters simply 'to protect the Alpine region from transit traffic'. The fine print stipulates that approval would mean a ban on all lorries in international transit (as opposed to those on local or import-export journeys) from Swiss roads. It would also prohibit the government from extending or enlarging motorways on transit routes. If a majority votes in favour of the so-called Alp Initiative, relations between Bern and the European Union, already strained by Swiss voters' refusal to join the European Economic Area 14 months ago, would become frosty indeed. Imposing a lorry transit ban, even after a 10-year transition period as the petitioners are demanding, would undermine a 12-year EU-Swiss transit treaty that came into force only last year. A vote to ban could also affect the European Union enlargement negotiations. Austrians, whose Alpine instincts are as strong as those of the Swiss, could become more obdurate in opposing Brussels' attempts to ease lorry transit restrictions in their country. The mood in Bern this week is sombre, as government leaders acknowledge their failure to weaken the attractions of the Alp Initiative. No opinion polls have been taken - partly because it is perceived to be an issue on which people might lie about their intentions - but everyone expects the outcome to be close. The vote takes place against the background of inexorably rising lorry traffic through the Gotthard pass, which bisects Switzerland. Since the Gotthard road tunnel opened in 1980, daily traffic on this most convenient route between Germany and Italy has risen 30 times to 2,500 lorries a day, of which 40 per cent are in transit. The Swiss government is expecting a further surge to 6,000 by 2000. For the occasional hiker, it is annoying to reach the peaks towering over the Reuss valley which leads up to the Gotthard pass and still hear the thunder of lorries far below. But for the residents of the canton of Uri, most of whom live and work cheek by jowl with the motorway in this narrow valley, the noise and fumes have become intolerable. Apart from the chamois buck, the most memorable image of this campaign is of a tearful Uri woman showing her asthmatic son on television. The government is sympathetic. Two years ago, it held out firmly against Brussels' demands that Swiss lorry weight limits be raised from 28 tonnes to the European Union 40 tonne norm. It also restricts transit lorries to weekday daytime operation. These constraints have already shifted 90 per cent of transit traffic to the rails, it points out. Thus, there is no need for further restrictions that would probably provoke EU retaliation. The Alp Initiative backers see things differently. A ban would encourage other countries to follow Switzerland's lead, they say, and would ensure that the new SFr20bn (Pounds 9.2bn) Gotthard rail tunnel that Switzerland is to build will attract plenty of business.</p>

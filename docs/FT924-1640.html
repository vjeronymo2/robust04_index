			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Retailers stick to seasonal plans RETAILERS pledged yesterday to press ahead with plans to open this Sunday - the last before Christmas - although some said they would take legal advice on continuing Sunday trading in the new year. Early legislation on Sunday trading was demanded by shops and councils on both sides of the debate. 'The European Court ruling adds urgency to the home secretary to reform this unworkable and unpopular law,' Mr Ron Trenter, chairman of Texas Homecare, the DIY chain, said. 'It should now be given parliamentary priority.' Stores and local authorities said the European Court ruling could not be seen as not a final judgment on the issue, as a House of Lords ruling is pending. 'The case has been somewhat overtaken by political events. Only two weeks ago the home secretary announced the funeral arrangements for the Shops Act 1950,' Mr David Ramsden, retail services controller of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, said. Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, said: 'Our plans are in place to open this Sunday and we do intend to. We have had only four days' notice and our customers and staff are expecting us to open.' He said the company would take advice from its lawyers about Sunday trading in the future. Tesco, the supermarket group, said its stores also would open next Sunday. 'The company feels it would be quite wrong to change its arrangements and disappoint its 1 1/2 m Sunday shoppers. It would also be unfair to deprive the 18,000 Tesco staff who work on Sundays of an income they are counting on just before Christmas.' The John Lewis Partnership, one of the retailers to hold out against Sunday opening, said the European ruling made clear that the Shops Act 1950 still stood. John Lewis said that Waitrose, its supermarket chain, was losing Pounds 1m a week by abiding by the law. The partnership also wants parliament to enact new legislation as early as possible. Some councils, which took rigorous legal action against stores trading on Sundays, said they did not plan to apply for injunctions until after the House of Lords ruled on the issue. Stoke-on-Trent City Council, which together with Norwich council has been involved in a protracted legal battle with B&amp;Q over Sunday opening, said the ruling was a 'complete vindication' of the city's stance. But Mr Paul Hodgson, the assistant city secretary, said: 'Now we have to wait for the House of Lords to rule on the matter.' Kirklees council in West Yorkshire rejected using injunctions in the immediate future, but said its policy of responding to complaints from the public would continue, although prosecution after a complaint, imposing only small fines, was less of a deterrent than an injunction that forced a store to remain closed.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (2): Not so complex, really - . . . For ATM but the idea of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) communications technology is essentially simple. It provides a common transport mechanism for digital communications traffic, regardless of whether it is between computers on a local area network (LAN) or across a public telephone network. This is a significant breakthrough. It makes it possible to move data between computers without the need to translate it into analogue formats. Although LAN technology uses a digital format, most traffic carried across wide-area telecommunications networks is still in analogue form. This means that a modem is needed at both ends of the network to translate data between analogue and digital form at and vice versa. In the long term, ATM technology will make this unnecessary. In the short term, ATM promises to boost the performance of LANs and allow companies to be more flexible in the way they set up their networks. According to the US market research company, CIMI, the average corporate personal computer user changes office locations every 14 months - with so-called 'power' users changing every seven months. This means that companies must be able to re-organise their LAN frequently to cope with changes in network traffic patterns. The US manufacturer, Network Equipment Technologies (NET) says that ATM technology makes it much easier for companies to do this. By using ATM technology, they can set up a 'virtual' LAN which can be re-organized quickly to cope with the changes. Like current LAN technology, ATM uses 'packets' to carry data. But it uses a fixed-size packet known as a 'cell.' Each cell contains only 53 bytes of data, including five bytes used for addressing and directing data through the network. An important advantage of ATM technology is that the cells can be handled by hardware, which significantly increases the speed of transmission. This is crucial when carrying voice and video signals - both of which are, of course, time sensitive. FASTER SYSTEMS Existing LAN technology operates at a transmission rate of 10-16 megabits a second - although there are faster technologies in the pipeline. Proposals for a 'fast' Ethernet, one of the two leading LAN technologies, promises to bring transmission speeds up to 100 megabits a second using existing cabling. In addition, there are moves to introduce a new standard called Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) which also offers 100 megabits a second. But ATM technology promises much greater transmission speeds. It starts at 155 megabits a second and has the potential to handle much higher rates up to 2.4 gigabits. This scalability of ATM technology is one of its main virtues and gives companies much greater flexibility in their use of LANs. In the long term, ATM technology will also help to solve the problems associated with moving data from one LAN to another through the public telephone network. The international standard for ATM communications has been agreed by all of the world's leading telecom suppliers under the auspices of the CCITT. Although it will be two or three years before the standard is fully installed, equipment which conforms to it is now beginning to emerge and opens up opportunities to improve the speed and efficiency of communications between computers. Large telecom suppliers - including AT&amp;T and MCI in the USA and British Telecom in the UK - have promised to move to ATM technology for their long-haul wide-area networks by the middle of the decade. Once in place, all types of data can be carried from source to destination without the need for any conversion. ATM opens the door to exciting new applications of computer networks - especially those which involve moving large amounts of data about such as video and audio. In the UK, for example, there are plans to upgrade the Janet network, which links universities and research institutes, to ATM technology. Known as SuperJanet, the new network will use ATM technology to link 200 sites across the UK. A pilot application to link six UK sites with ATM began in March 1993. When it is complete, SuperJanet will be able to carry the large amounts of data needed for applications like digital video and multimedia. One potential use of the network will be for 'remote' medical consultancy where a team of specialists will be able to observe and advise on an operation from locations across the UK. At the same time, commercial products which use ATM are beginning to emerge. Hughes LAN Systems, a leading supplier of ATM technology demonstrated an ATM-based digital video system at an exhibition in Washington, US, in March. The demonstration used Hughes ATM switches to carry full-motion, near-broadcast quality video images to five Sun SPARC Unix workstations. Hughes says that the system can be used for applications such as video conferencing, distributed training briefings and remote medical consultations. These early examples of the use of ATM communications show the exciting possibilities of the technology.</p>

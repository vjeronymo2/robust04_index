			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Traders put up the barriers - Currency risk As many multinationals have discovered to their cost, fluctuating exchange rates can have a dramatic impact on their fortunes. Japanese carmaker Mazda, for example, revealed a loss of Y65bn on its foreign exchange transactions in its 1993/94 accounts. Italian fashion house Benetton, however, achieved a one-off gain of L50bn from some well-timed currency hedges when the lira strengthened against the D-Mark by almost 10 per cent in three months last year. It is not surprising, therefore, that currency risk is regarded by most corporate treasurers as a more pressing concern than interest rate risk or commodity price risks. An increasingly popular tool for managing foreign exchange risk is the barrier option which some derivatives dealers say now represents some 10 per cent of all currency option business. This growing interest in barriers contrasts with falling demand for aggressively leveraged products. The derivatives market has grown up this year and the emphasis now is on 'putting your risk where you want it', says Fred Stambaugh, global head of currency options marketing with Chase Manhattan Bank. Like the vast majority of currency options, barrier options are over-the-counter instruments, tailor-made by banks to suit customers' precise needs or market views. There are four basic types - calls and puts, each with either a knock-out or knock-in feature. A knock-in barrier option pays nothing at expiry unless it is first brought to life as a result of the underlying exchange rate reaching a certain pre-determined level (the barrier). A knock-out option, on the other hand, begins life as a standard option but is killed off if the underlying exchange rate touches the barrier. Because of their uncertain life, they are generally much cheaper than conventional options. They have particular appeal to chart enthusiasts who wish to express ideas about support and resistance levels in their choice of hedging strategy. Consider, for example, a US company which imports German goods and expects a bill for DM20 in three months' time. If the importer is happy to pay the bill at the present exchange rate of DM1.515/Dollars , he would simply buy a three-month DM call/dollar put with this exercise price. This would allow him to buy the necessary D-Marks at this exchange rate in three months' time. Such an option might cost 2.5 per cent of the underlying amount (DM500,000). It would protect the importer against the dollar weakening against the D-Mark but, if the dollar strengthened significantly against the German currency in the next three months, the option could be allowed to expire unexercised and the DM20m could be bought in the spot market at a more attractive rate. A knock-out DM call/dollar put would give the same downside protection but only until the exchange rate reaches a level at which the importer feels this insurance is no longer needed. For example, a knock-out option with the same strike price and a barrier set at D1.60/Dollars might cost only half as much as the standard option. If, at any time within the three months, the spot exchange rate touches DM1.60, the option ceases to exist. The importer could then buy the necessary D-Marks in the spot market at this price and put it on deposit until needed. The user must be able to react quickly in the event of the option being knocked out, as the favourable rate may not last for long. Despite the undoubted attractions of barrier options, in terms of cost and flexibility, some company treasurers are wary. 'We can't price these options ourselves, so I am loathe to recommend them,' says the treasurer at a top UK company, who declined to be identified. The extra difficulty in explaining such products to the board is another reason cited by non-users. Conventional option pricing models are inadequate for the valuation of barrier options and, although leading banks claim to be able to price and hedge most of these structures, they admit it is not always easy. The difficulties are most pronounced when the underlying exchange rate is close to the barrier level as the option approaches maturity. 'Hedging some of these options close to expiry is a real nightmare,' says Chase's Stambaugh. To hedge options which they have sold, banks traditionally take an offsetting position in the underlying asset, but the size of this position has to be continually adjusted as the spot price of the asset changes. Close to the barrier the option value is extremely sensitive to changes in the spot value of the exchange rate, so big sales or purchases in the underlying currencies may be needed to keep the position hedged. As a result, barrier options are generally offered only on the most heavily traded exchange rates such as dollar/D-Mark and dollar/yen. 'We are not too keen on doing barrier options where there isn't a continuous spot market,' says Paul Jackson, head of foreign exchange options at Midland Global Markets in London. Hedging of barrier options is one of the hot topics in derivatives research at present, and a favoured solution by many is to use conventional options alongside a long position in the underlying asset to offset a short position in barrier options. This achieves a 'static' hedge which does not need continually adjusting and thus greatly reduces transaction costs. As these cheaper hedging techniques become more widely used, barrier options are starting to be applied to less actively traded currencies. Another growth area for these structures is in investment products to enhance yield or to allow investors to express a view on two or more assets with a single instrument. Bankers Trust, for example, has been marketing a call option on a basket of Belgian shares which knocks out if the Belgian franc appreciates by more than 3.5 per cent against the D-Mark. This is an example of an outside barrier, in which the barrier asset is different from the asset on which the basic option is written. Another popular application in this year's low interest rate environment, says Midland's Mr Jackson, has been to use two knock-out options to create structured notes which pay highs returns provided an underlying asset remains within a certain range. Institutions have been particularly active in selling such notes. A typical example is a one-year dollar-denominated bond which yields some 200 basis points more than conventional one-year paper provided the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate remains within the ranges DM1.48-DM1.68. Many variations have been sold, with a narrower currency range allowing greater yield enhancement.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: US derivatives debate intensifies MR Wayne Angell, a US Federal Reserve Board governor, has intensified the debate about the derivatives markets by declaring that he does not share the concerns of some fellow board members about the futures markets. 'I consider derivatives simply a product of the free market system,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. His views contrasts with those of other Fed board members  - notably vice-chairman Mr David Mullins, who has said derivatives need to be more carefully regulated  - and clash heavily with those of the Bundesbank, the German central bank. Mr Angell, who chairs the Basle committee on bank payment and settlement systems, said worries over the risks derivatives pose to the banking system could be alleviated by making global payment and settlement systems more responsive to the needs of the 24-hour markets. Derivatives, like other financial instruments, carry payment risks that increase the longer the period is between a transaction and its settlement. He said upgrades in the Fed wire system, which is used for payment transfers between US banks, will allow the system to operate on a real-time basis 16 hours per day beginning in April at most depository institutions. Mr Angell's comments contrast sharply with this week's warning from the Bundesbank, the German central bank, that the growth of global derivatives markets could endanger the stability of the world financial system. The Bundesbank in its latest monthly report argued that the rapid increase in the use of derivatives had led to an inter-linking of the world's financial market and made them 'vulnerable to a crisis'. According to the Bundesbank, the notional amount of futures traded globally has reached Dollars 140,000bn annually while the notional outstanding swaps (contracts entered directly between banks) total around Dollars 4,500bn. The US spotlight on derivatives is likely to widen next week, when the Commmodity Futures Trading Commission, the chief regulator of US futures exchanges, delivers its Congressionally-mandated study on derivatives to congress. Congress ordered the report when it reauthorised the agency a year ago and gave it new exemptive powers on over-the-counter derivatives. Industry insiders say that the CFTC report is likely to be more descriptive than critical.</p>

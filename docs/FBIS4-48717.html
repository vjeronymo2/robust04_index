			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 22 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress  [PAC] North West Leader, Dr Ben Marengwa, on Sunday called for a  PAC national congress to be convened to debate the party's poor  performance in the elections. Dr Marengwa, the PAC's premier  candidate for the North West, said the "electoral national  fiasco" had been caused by the inefficiency of the PAC head  office. "I therefore call for an immediate national congress of  the PAC to correct the ills. In the PAC certain heads must  roll."    Dr Marengwa would not elaborate on the nature of the  inefficiency or the party members he was criticising. "That  would be undemocratic," he told SAPA. "There is a national  conference planned for December, but we think this is too long a  time to wait. It must be brought forward. I have sounded out  other leaders and I believe I will have support for the call to  have an immediate congress. We need to make adjustments. This  has to be thrashed out."    Dr Ben Marengwa said he wanted to thank the 27,000 who voted  PAC in the North West, and the 243,000 voters "out of a  membership of more than a million who loyally voted PAC  nationally".</p>

The Local  Authorities Will Not Miss Their Chance in Any Event"]    [Text] Here is the first impression from the second  session of the Federation Council: compared to the previous  one, where Vladimir Shumeyko just barely made it into the  speaker's chair, giving out alluring promises on behalf of the  president, now everything is moving slowly and sluggishly.    It was thought that the upper house would immediately "show  its teeth" to the president, the government, and the capital in  general. Instead the senate began to spend hours discussing  internal rules of procedures. The apparatus officers consider  this as evidence of "serious and careful work of true  parliamentarians." Nonetheless, they had to approve the  decision on Boris Yeltsin's edict on the state of emergency in  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone without actually seeing the  document: It was not even circulated. The famous proponents of  autonomy, Yakutia President Mikhail Nikolayev and his Bashkir  counterpart Murtaza Rakhimov, have not attended the high meeting  for two days. Karelian leader Viktor Stepanov did not arrive at  all. "We have not as yet bestirred ourselves," Boris Yeltsin's  perennial opponent, Aman Tuleyev, admitted.    The general mood of the senators themselves was summed up in  a remark by Novosibirsk governor Ivan Indink: "When are we  finally going to get down to business? I am talking about the  economy and the tax system." Irkutsk administration chief Yuriy  Nozhikov added "questions of resources and export" to this list.  Federation Council members are making no secret that in  demanding a meeting with Premier Chernomyrdin, they seek to  understand not so much the present situation in the economy as  the intentions of the government and how far it is ready to  yield to pressure from the provinces.    As Omsk Oblast governor Leonid Polezhayev admitted, the  deputies' "abilities to protect local interests" would be  greatly expanded by the creation of their regional associations.  "Territorial factions," however, are in no particular hurry to  emerge. So far there is only Eduard Rossel, who told SEGODNYA  that 14 senators and 32 Duma members have joined the Urals  Deputies Association he is setting up, while the Urals Economic  Association has created within its framework a "foundation for  sociopolitical studies," allocating it the requisite funds. The  foundation, according to Rossel, will be responsible for  "coordinating draft laws not only among the deputies but also  those Urals enterprises that will be affected by these draft  laws."    Other regions are in no hurry to unite. Even Irkutsk  governor Yuriy Nozhikov and his Khabarovsk colleague Viktor  Ishayev, who have actually proclaimed a "financial state of  emergency" in their regions and stopped remitting taxes to the  federal budget, prefer to meet with Viktor Chernomyrdin  separately.    According to Mr. Nozhikov, the first watershed in the senate  will be between the regional bosses and the few "dispossessed"  deputies: "Unlike us, they are not responsible for the regions  and therefore will start seeking a stable position in Moscow.  This will be the fifth column of the central authority."    As for the local authorities, they are apparently bound to  divide: the interests of kray and oblast bosses still differ  substantially from the wishes of the ethnic autonomy bosses.  Only after that will come the time of "territorial factions."  It is important that these divisions will not weaken but  actually strengthen the senate: It is all the easier to promote  one's interests, the more conspicuous they are.    The Federation Council leadership has assured that Viktor  Chernomyrdin will make a speech today.</p>

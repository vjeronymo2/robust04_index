			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Lord Young admits DTI fault on Clowes THE government was at fault over its handling of the Barlow Clowes affair, Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary, has admitted. Lord Young, now chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group, agreed the Department of Trade and Industry could be blamed for failing to properly license the Barlow Clowes investment empire that collapsed in 1988. This month Mr Peter Clowes was jailed for 10 years for defrauding investors of Pounds 150m. Speaking in a Channel 4 television interview to be broadcast later this week, Lord Young said the government had been reluctant at the time to admit any responsibility. He was trade secretary when Barlow Clowes collapsed. It was only after the ombudsman's report, which criticised the DTI for maladministration, that the government agreed to pay investors compensation totalling Pounds 150m. Lord Young said concern over setting a precedent was behind the government's reluctance to take part of the blame.</p>

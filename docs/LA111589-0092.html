			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS RUN, GUN DOWN THE NUGGETS;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: DENVER FALTERS IN FOURTH QUARTER FOR FIFTH LOSS IN EIGHT GAMES  AT SPORTS ARENA.  </P> <P> Up and down the court they went, the Clippers and Denver Nuggets, proving to be  marathon men for lasting all game at such a pace.  </P> <P> How much run-and-gun? It was 102-92 . . . at the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> All that remained was to prepare the oxygen masks and decide a winner. The  Clippers got the better of both ends, claiming a 129-121 victory before a crowd  of 6,125 and making Denver still feel like it's playing in rarified air at the  Sports Arena, where the Nuggets have lost in five of their last eight  appearances.  </P> <P> As they had in Saturday's heart-breaking loss to New York, the Clippers came  back from a double-digit deficit to stage a late charge. This time, though,  they didn't lose.  </P> <P> Their first lead since the second quarter came at 117-116 on Tom Garrick's  layup with 3:27 to play. A second straight Clipper fast-break basket, when Ken  Norman got the layin and free throw, made it 120-116, a cushion they would not  waste.  </P> <P> That was part of a 10-2 run, the key to the Clippers, who trailed by 13 points  on several occasions in the third quarter, breaking a three-game losing streak  and improving to 2-3.  </P> <P> The Nuggets are 3-3.  </P> <P> Always up-tempo Denver led after two quarters, 69-63, but at the same time  pulled the Clippers to their highest-scoring half of the season. Gary Grant had  13 points on six-of-nine shooting, and Charles Smith 12.  </P> <P> The Nuggets, looking to break a two-game losing streak at the Sports Arena, had  to be especially happy with the big numbers. They shot a horrendous 37.3% (38  of 102) in a 122-108 loss Saturday at San Antonio.  </P> <P> They went 54.3% in the first 24 minutes against the Clippers, with Blair  Rasmussen hitting seven of 10 for 17 points and Michael Adams five of nine for  another 17.  </P> <P> The bulk of Adams' scoring came in typical style -- three-point shots. The  NBA's single-season record holder in long-range launches was three of five in  the first half, and he also had five assists, more than any player.  </P> <P> Denver broke the 100-point barrier with 1:08 to play in the third quarter on  Fat Lever's basket and subsequent free throw. The Nuggets led, 102-92, heading  into the fourth.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Two days ahead of schedule, and much to the surprise of his teammates, Danny  Manning took part on his first full-scale workout Monday. "I just wanted to go  out and play," he said. "I can't get much stronger in two days." Manning  wouldn't rate his performance, but the Clippers were glad to. "He looked good,"  Ken Norman said. "He hasn't lost anything. He really picked up the practice  with his enthusiasm and hustle." So good he could be activated soon? "I don't  know why he's not dressing tonight," Norman said before the game. The reviews  have been so good that it is conceivable Manning, who tore the anterior  cruciate ligament in his right knee Jan. 4 and underwent reconstructive surgery  10 days later, could be playing as soon as next week. He wouldn't go that far,  committing only to continued practices with the Clippers and plans to join them  for a two-game trip to Texas beginning today. "My only goal was that when I  came back, I wanted to play hard," he said. "I think I accomplished that." But  not all was well with the player who holds so much of the key to the Clipper  success. Tuesday, he had a killer toothache.  </P> <P> We've seen this before, but both sides in the Benoit Benjamin negotiations  agree to a noticeable warming trend, so much so that chances are better than  ever the free agent center may sign today. The holdup, as always, remains the  Clippers' insistence on incentive bonuses versus Benjamin's demand for  guaranteed money, with a base salary of $1 million currently for 1989-90 on the  table. Charles Grantham, the chief of the players' union who is making a tour  of NBA camps, has acted as something of a mediator/prodder during his stop in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Former Laker David Rivers was signed Tuesday, taking the place of Andre Turner,  cut the day before. Minnesota claimed Rivers in the expansion draft, but the  Timberwolves cut him recently. "It's sort of nice to be anywhere," he said.  "But to come back here (Los Angeles) is a bit nicer because this was my first  birthplace into the NBA." Rivers will wear uniform No.4.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AFTER '89, WARY BEARS HOPE THEIR WINNING RECIPE WON'T SPOIL  </P> <P> Mixing pride with advancing age is the sporting world's recipe for a Molotov  cocktail.  </P> <P> The return of the Bears' punishing defense to the top of the NFL heap may be  one of the young season's most welcome surprises, but it also could be one of  the most short lived. So enjoy it while it lasts. This thing could blow up as  early as Sunday, when the Bears play another 3-0 team with a strong defense,  the Raiders.  </P> <P> "I don't think so," said Mike Singletary, the intense but soft-spoken defensive  captain and middle linebacker.  </P> <P> "But we won our first four games last year," he added, "and about the time  everybody started talking about the Super Bowl, we got hammered by Tampa Bay  and Houston back to back."  </P> <P> In 1985, with irascible Buddy Ryan commanding the troops, the Bears' defense  revolutionized football. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, while almost  every other club spent its highest picks on draft day gambling on offensive  weapons, the Bears kept accumulating defensive gems.  </P> <P> It began in 1979 with the selection of Dan Hampton and Al Harris and stretched  through the selection of William (Refrigerator) Perry in 1985. The Bears  stocked the team with enough back-breakers over that stretch -- Otis Wilson,  Singletary, Todd Bell, Dave Duerson, Richard Dent, Wilber Marshall and Shaun  Gayle -- to win the Super Bowl in January, 1986, and terrorize opponents long  after the rest of their game would not have scared some college teams.  </P> <P> Indeed, so strong was the core left behind when Ryan took his scorched-earth  philosophy to Philadelphia, that the steamroller kept going with the same  brutal efficiency.  </P> <P> Until last year.  </P> <P> Chicago started 1989 by going 4-0 -- and then Hampton, an 11-year-veteran, went  down for his ninth and 10th knee operations. With him went the pass rush and  just about everything and anything that could have salvaged the season.  </P> <P> Marshall was long gone, via the free-agent express to Washington, and Wilson  was derailed for good because of a bad knee. Harris and Bell had already joined  Ryan in Philly. Perry could not push himself away from the table or past most  blockers, and line mate Dent, playing with a string of nagging injuries, was  chasing him up the scale.  </P> <P> Although Singletary and Steve McMichael performed credibly last season, there  was little they could do to fill all the gaping holes on the field -- and even  less to offset the psychological damage Coach Mike Ditka inflicted on the  handful of promising youngsters with his tirade of the week. Chicago slid to  6-10, and the team's defensive ranking dropped from No. 2 in 1988 to No. 25.  </P> <P> Asked whether the problems hurt team morale, Singletary smiled.  </P> <P> "I never knew," he said. "But I'll say this -- if you've never been there with  Mike, haven't seen the way he does things for a little while, how in the world  would you know what to expect or what to make of it?"  </P> <P> It is safe to say that no one expected Ditka to be this mellow by this juncture  of the season -- nor the Bears to be this good.  </P> <P> In three games, the team has one shutout, has surrendered just two touchdowns,  one the result of an interception, collected 11 sacks, forced the same number  of fumbles and intercepted seven passes. In the bargain, the Bears' defense has  proved that the precipitous drop in performance last year was in large part the  result of injuries and inexperience.  </P> <P> Nobody wants to be reminded that the numbers have come against three teams with  just two wins between them and that the players who provide much of the heart  and most of the soul on the unit -- Singletary (almost 32), Hampton (33) and  McMichael (three weeks shy of 33) -- already are playing on borrowed time.  </P> <P> "People are going to see our record and figure the defense is behind it. But  the real reason," Singletary said, "is that the offense is keeping us off the  field."  </P></p>

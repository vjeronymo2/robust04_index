			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Grand Front leader Fernando Solanas; place </F> and date not given]    [Text] [CLARIN] Solanas, give us your opinion of Sunday's  [10 April Constituent Assembly] elections.    [Solanas] I believe we had a great election throughout the  country. We obtained nearly four times more votes than in  October 1993, and we have the support of more than 2 million  citizens. And watch it; this alliance is not yet one year old.    [CLARIN] Are you satisfied with your results in Buenos  Aires?    [Solanas] What do you think? We went from 260,000 votes to  approximately 1 million, and in addition the Front beat Raul  Alfonsin practically without any resources. And, [Carlos]  Chacho Alvarez was spectacular in the federal capital, in  addition to Monsignor Jaime de Nevares' victory in Neuquen  Province and all the districts where we fielded candidates. The  seed has been planted; now we have to water it.    [CLARIN] But one must know how to water the seed; otherwise  it could rot.    [Solanas] At this time we must continue our opposition of  this model and continue to be consistent with our ideas and  conduct. In addition to that fact, we must continue to expand  the Front so it becomes the banner for all social forces in the  cities and the interior, the production and cultural sectors.    [CLARIN] Will there be a merging of the Front with parties  in "disuse" as forecast by Chacho Alvarez?    [Solanas] I am a staunch Grand Front supporter and logically  I will support any initiative that will serve to unify the  forces that are part of the Front. But we will be very careful  not to shut the gate: Ours is a very large house, and he who  agrees with our proposal can enter it.    [CLARIN] Regarding the criticism that is emerging from the  official sector in that you do not have a proposal?    [Solanas] What has happened is that the more than 2 million  votes were like a punch in the middle of the chest and they are  out of breath. The [Eduardo] Duhalde faction [of the  Justicialist Party] dropped from 48 to 42 percent, and Carlos  Menem does not have his re-election guaranteed.    [CLARIN] And what is the proposal?    [Solanas] We want a different country than the one we are  living in, a more just country with an equitable distribution of  wealth. We are an alternative to that neo-conservative model  and are going to clearly define a program for the 1995 elections  together with the Congress of Argentine Workers, the Agrarian  Federation, and the small- and medium-sized business sectors.    [CLARIN] Will you compete with Chacho Alvarez for the  presidential candidacy?    [Solanas] Please, do not let us start creating problems  where there are none.    [CLARIN] The fact is that Sunday's elections chose both of  you as candidates.    [Solanas] We have agreed with the Front's leadership that  the space we have gained and all the candidacies, even those for  town council members, will be respected. We will debate this at  the end.    [CLARIN] You are not going to be a presidential candidate?    [Solanas] I can be, and I may not be. This will be resolved  between all of us at the appropriate time.</p>

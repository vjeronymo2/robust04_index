			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Books: Fiction inspired by witch hunts and floggings - A great New England novelist SALEM IS MY DWELLING PLACE: A LIFE OF NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE by Edwin Haviland Miller Duckworth Pounds 25, 596 pages NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE: TRADITION AND REVOLUTION by Charles Swann Cambridge University Press Pounds 35, 284 pages THE SAVAGE vindictiveness of the 17th century Salem witch-hunt, so well dramatised by Arthur Miller in The Crucible, left its trauma on the high-minded descendants of its perpetrators. The notion of predetermined guilt, of an ineradicable stain, is the key to the Romances and many of the shorter tales of the great New England novelist, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Two new books show how the guilt that afflicts so many of his characters is related to historical events. A scholarly biography of Hawthorne by Edwin Haviland Miller, professor of English emeritus at New York University, focuses to begin with on two of Nathaniel's forebears. William Hathorne - as the name was originally spelt - settled in Salem from England in 1636. William was a soldier and a merciless judge, who once ordered an offending Quaker woman to be stripped to the waist, tied to a cart, and then flogged as it moved through the streets. It was his son John, an army colonel and a magistrate during the trials of the 1690s, who meted out equally cruel punishments to Salem women accused of witchcraft on the flimsiest, most contrived evidence. In making fiction out of the excesses of his Puritan ancestors, Hawthorne anticipated the technique of a modern movie-director. He was a master of crowd scenes, as in The Scarlet Letter, and of a subtle choice of camera-angles as in his most enchanting book, The House of the Seven Gables, where he tracks in and out of the various rooms in the house and highlights its curious structure containing relics of one prominent New England family  -his own  - over several generations. Hawthorne's favourite trick is the dissolve. He uses it incessantly in his work to show how past impinges on present. In Gables, he transports the reader from the founding generation to the present villain, Judge Pyncheon, who reincarnates Hawthorne's ancestor. Pyncheon is shown tyrannising his feckless cousin Clifford. This gentle aesthete likes to do nothing better than blow soap-bubbles - an instance of Hawthorne inventing an image of the kind of old man he felt he might easily become, but in fact did not. Miller's book is strong on this family context. When he turns to interpreting the texts, he opts for the straight Freudian explanation of Hawthorne's sometimes painfully revealing obsessions. Hawthorne's sailor father died at sea when the novelist was a small child; he became fixated on a mother, who withdrew into a world of her own. Then, after a long engagement, Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody, who gave him the abundance of affection his childhood had lacked. Sophia's older sister, the spinster Elizabeth Peabody, achieved her immortality when she became Miss Birdseye in Henry James's The Bostonians. The Hawthornes lived at different times throughout their happy marriage in Salem, Concord and Lenox. Sophia produced two daughters and a son, all of whom whom she adored second only to her husband, whom she thought of either as the Adam of a new Eden or as a reincarnation of the sun-god Apollo. For a while he was adored, too, by Melville, who dedicated Moby Dick to Hawthorne  -a passion not returned. Hawthorne's oedipal subconscious drives were firmly focused on the female maternal breast so prominent in The Scarlet Letter, where the heroine's is branded with a capital A. Charles Swann of the University of Keele, in his critical study Nathaniel Hawthorne: Tradition and Revolution, thinks the psychiatric couch approach to Hawthorne has been much over-done. He finds a fascinating wealth of evidence of Hawthorne's imagination drawing sustenance from the troubled of past of New England, and he discerns in some of the works a spirit of inquiry into the nature of fiction. Swann dissects at great length, and with breath-taking subtlety, The Marble Faun in the light of the Christian notion of the Fortunate Fall. He also examines it as a classic case of an unfinished work. Both writers are in no doubt as to the importance of some of the uncompleted posthumously published material which has become available in recent years - The Elixir of Life manuscript, and the less well-known tales, now all gathered together in the Tales and Sketches volume in the Library of America series. Each offers an interpretation of that strange tale, 'The Appeal of Alice Doane' which opens on Gallows Hill, Salem, on a pleasant summer afternoon in the present. Then, in a typical Hawthorne dissolve, the setting reverts to being the dreaded site of execution in the 17th century. A procession of those who have been hanged comes into view, followed by a long line of their accusers. Isolated in the rear on horseback is Cotton Mather '. . . proud of his well-won dignity, as the representative of all the hateful features of his time; the one blood-thirsty man, in whom were concentrated those vices of sprit and errors of opinion, that sufficed to madden the whole surrounding multitude'. That was a stunningly brave denunciation when Hawthorne penned it. Hawthorne's books sold only moderately well in his lifetime. He was haunted not merely by the past, but also by his creditors. He had been a class-mate at Bowdoin College of Franklin Pierce, whose career was in government. That led to Hawthorne's preferment to lucrative jobs at the Boston and Salem Customs Houses. It was in the Boston one that he discovered the original embroidered scarlet letter which set in train his book. Or so he said. When Pierce stood for President, Hawthorne wrote his campaign biography at his friend's request, but to the dismay of those who hated the candidate's anti-abolitionist views. Hawthorne was rewarded by being made American consul at Liverpool at the age of 49. It was a grimly uncongenial place for a fastidious New England family searching all the while for Bunyan's Celestial City: but they survived it. Hawthorne amassed a small fortune in shipping fees, enabling him to retire to Italy after Pierce failed to be re-nominated for a second term as President. It was during their stay in Rome that Hawthorne's older daughter Una contracted near-fatal malaria, never fully to recover, and the decline in his fortunes began. Back home in New England he suffered a complete crack-up. It is a moving story - well told here by Miller on a broad canvas, with many of the minor characters, like the transcendentalist Margaret Fuller and the publisher James Field, neatly etched in. In spite of stylistic archaisms, Hawthorne remains capable of an incomparable richness of texture which both these books help us to appreciate more fully than hitherto.</p>

Failing To See This Today Means  Bringing the Dark Ages Closer...in Houses and Plants"]    [Text] Perhaps there is no need to explain to anyone  what energy resources mean to Ukraine and its economy at  present, or to explain that our entire standard of living  depends more and more perceptibly on the cost of electricity,  coal, gas, and fuel oil.    A conference of the leaders of the basic sectors of  Ukraine--the power industry, metallurgy, and the coal  industry--held a few days ago by the Cabinet of Ministers  indicated that there would not be an easy solution. While there  was a general consensus to the effect that prices for products  should be reasonably restricted, the approaches themselves to  establishing price scales for energy resources got a mixed  reception.    This is how Vasiliy Kotko, deputy chairman of the State  Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Nuclear Energy, clarified  the position of the employees of the nuclear power industry.    [Kotko] The nuclear power industry was virtually the only  sector of the national economy of Ukraine to finish out the year  1993 with a noticeable increment in the volume of production.  Nuclear power stations generated a total of 75.2 billion  kilowatt-hours of electricity, or more than one-third of all  electricity generated in our country. This came close to the  maximum volume in the history of the operation of Ukrainian  nuclear power stations. These results are all the more  significant because they were achieved in an environment of  mounting economic crisis. They testify to the great potential of  the nuclear power industry, its high level of viability and  stability.    Nonetheless, the situation that has now emerged in the  industry is not just difficult, but we might say catastrophic.  All nuclear power stations are facing a most difficult economic  situation. Beginning in the second half of 1993, virtually no  fresh fuel has been purchased because of a shortage of funds; in  1993, two times less fuel was purchased than in 1990. Spent  nuclear fuel has not been shipped out for long-term storage,  once again because of a lack of funds. Contractual relations  between many suppliers and nuclear power stations with regard to  equipment, spare parts, and scientific servicing of nuclear  installations have actually been severed....    [Rassokha] However, the nuclear power industry operates by  way of complete self-recoupment and supports itself by proceeds  from energy generated. How could the industry have virtually  gone bankrupt financially with those kind of increments in  volume?    [Kotko] This is due to the fact that the nuclear power  industry generated electricity and sold it to the state, but the  state has not fully settled for it. There are two reasons for  this. The apparent reason is that our main and only consumer,  the National Dispatching Center of the Ministry of Energy of  Ukraine, does not pay for the electricity received from us, or  pays late. At present, the ministry is in debt to the nuclear  power stations to the tune of 550 billion karbovantsy,  approximately enough for one month of our operation. However,  this is the surface of the issue. The main reason is rooted in  the rate policy of our government. The government is trying to  contain the overall growth of prices in all sectors of the  national economy, i.e. inflation, through fixed prices for  power, coal, and gas. I will note that after the beginning of  1993, the rate for nuclear power stations remained unchanged for  almost half a year. The introduction of each of the new rates  was delayed by one to two months.    As a result, inflation has not been stopped, but the  resources of the power industry have been thoroughly undermined.  Right now it is hard to even assess the damage.    [Rassokha] What does the rate for electricity from nuclear  power stations come to at present?    [Kotko] It now stands at 118 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour.  On the whole our rates during all of last year were at the very  least two times lower than those of thermal power stations.  Nuclear power stations stand for efficient power generation.    In May 1993 the government raised the rate for our  electricity by a factor of 10 all at once. However, prior to  this we gave up the electricity almost free of charge for a long  time, for example, in April--at 10 percent of its actual cost.  In all of this, electricity is not the kind of product that one  may produce, deposit at a warehouse, and wait for its price to  grow. We have sold it, it is gone, and it is not possible to  recover the funds anymore.    [Rassokha] Given this economic array, why have you not  succeeded in persuading the government that a change in its rate  policy is necessary?    [Kotko] The government has officially acknowledged the need  for a change in the rate policy. Moreover, the government laid  down in a decree that prices for electricity should change  automatically if prices for energy sources grow by more than 20  percent. However, the Cabinet of Ministers is not acting on its  own decision.    [Rassokha] Why?    [Kotko] Because it understands that an increase in prices  for  energy sources and electricity will be followed by an increase  in prices for everything else. So it is trying to hang on to  previously established prices for a while longer.    Understandably, no one wants to raise prices for bread,  butter, and even that same electricity--neither the population  nor the government. However, this unpopular decision will have  to be made later after all, but with more difficult consequences.    [Rassokha] How much longer can the nuclear power stations  continue if this rate policy continues?    [Kotko] I believe that we have now reached the extreme limit  and have depleted the resources of the industry. If this policy  is continued, irreversible processes will begin.    This means that even if we do get the funds, we will no  longer manage to turn them around because our standard reserves  have been cut back to the limit. First of all, we will not have  time to buy fuel and will not be able to go on operating. Our  suppliers do not have fuel reserves either. They begin to  produce for us only after the receipt of prepayment. The  manufacturing cycle lasts no less than half a year; taking into  account the difficulties we have in converting and transferring  payments, we may receive the fuel even later.    I believe that if the situation is not changed right now, a  condition may develop as soon as tomorrow whereby the shutdown  of some power units, or perhaps of all the power stations in  succession, will become unavoidable.    First of all, our rate should now be revised immediately; it  should come to no less than 300 karbovantsy per kilowatt-hour.  It should change with inflation and with the cost of energy  resources taken into account. These are, at minimum, two  necessary conditions.    Last year the personnel of the nuclear power industry kept  their word and did a lot to prevent the energy crisis from  mounting. We are geared toward giving much of ourselves, too, if  we are given an opportunity to work normally and produce  electricity. However, we want our labor and our products to be  paid for accordingly.</p>

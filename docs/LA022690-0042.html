			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SHEDDING LIGHT ON INNER WORKINGS OF THE BRAIN;  </P> <P> DIAGNOSIS: MEG, A NEW WAY OF MEASURING MAGNETIC FIELDS, CAN BE USED TO STUDY  EPILEPSY AND OTHER MALADIES.  </P> <P> Lovers, lawyers and politicians are among the people who would like to be able  to tell what another person is thinking. Psychologists and neurologists have  more modest goals: they would like to tell how a person thinks, to map the  brain's activity.  </P> <P> For several years, medical imaging techniques have been giving astonishingly  vivid and detailed interior views of the human brain. These include the CAT  scan, an advanced form of X-ray; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which relies  on signals emitted by the atoms in the brain itself; and PET (positron emission  tomography), which uses a weak radioactive tracer.  </P> <P> Now a new technique -- magnetoencephalography, or MEG -- is being added to the  arsenal. Though still in its preliminary research stages, MEG is giving the  clearest views yet of the workings of the human brain by detecting the almost  vanishingly weak magnetic fields that flash into existence when neurons fire  momentarily. By detecting such fields, MEG determines which neurons are firing  and measures the strength of their activity.  </P> <P> To do this, MEG makes use of the world's most sensitive magnetometers, called  SQUIDs -- Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. A SQUID relies on a  type of superconductivity that British physicist Brian Josephson won a Nobel  Prize for discovering.  </P> <P> Superconductivity involves electric currents that flow with no resistance, at  temperatures close to absolute zero, minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit. In the  "Josephson effect," such currents are extremely sensitive to the presence of  even a very weak magnetic field, falling off markedly if such a field is  present.  </P> <P> In a SQUID, this sensitivity makes it possible to detect such fields even when  they are a billion times weaker than the magnetism of the Earth, which swings a  compass needle. That is the strength of magnetic fields produced in the normal  brain.  </P> <P> These fields are produced by electrical flows within neurons, and such electric  currents in the brain have been studied for decades using the technique of EEG,  electroencephalography. But the skull and the brain's internal fluids distort  the flow of these currents, making it difficult to interpret the measurements.  Indeed, a common EEG technique has been to remove part of the skull and place  electrodes directly on the surface of the living brain.  </P> <P> In MEG, by contrast, the magnetic fields emerge from the brain undistorted by  nearby fluids or tissues. The technique is totally non-invasive; the patient  does not even need to have his head shaved. The doctor simply presses a  detector, which looks like a beer can and holds several SQUIDs, against the  patient's head, then interprets the readings with the help of a computer.  </P> <P> Existing techniques allow no more than a few such measurements at any given  moment, however. Thus, scans of the entire brain must be built up over several  hours, with the detector being moved from place to place around the head. And  the resulting scans are easiest to interpret when the neural activity being  studied is concentrated in isolated spots within the brain, rather than being  distributed throughout its volume.  </P> <P> Because of this, MEG has thus far been used particularly for studies of  epilepsy. Epilepsy has been described as an electrical storm in the brain; it  features the uncontrolled and violent firing of neurons, in ways that produce  particularly strong magnetic fields. About 2.3 million Americans are  epileptics; their seizures can produce uncontrolled movements of the arms or  legs, abrupt memory lapses, loss of consciousness, or convulsions.  </P> <P> Most such people are helped with medication, but for as many as 50,000  patients, surgery is the only remedy, The neurosurgeon must cut away portions  of brain tissue that trigger seizures. First, however, these portions must be  located precisely.  </P> <P> Neurologist William W. Sutherling of UCLA said that by using MEG, it is  possible to map magnetic field patterns directly onto photographs of the  patient's head, graphically indicating areas of abnormal activity. MEG thus  locates these areas with high accuracy.  </P> <P> For all its promise, however, MEG still is in the research stage. Only a few  major hospitals have the needed instruments and facilities. The Food and Drug  Administration has licensed the use of MEG for research on epilepsy, but not  yet for its routine clinical use. And investigators continue to devote a great  deal of attention to such basic issues as signal processing as they learn to  extract the most information from their measurements.  </P> <P> At a conference held at New York University last year, other researchers showed  that MEG can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Until now, Alzheimer's  has been detected only by retrieving tissue from the brain for examination. But  Rodolfo Llinas and his colleagues at NYU have found a very abnormal pattern of  magnetic activity in Alzheimer's patients, in the regions of their brains that  respond to hearing.  </P> <P> "Our results show that the MEG technology can be usefully applied in  psychiatric patients," they have written.  </P> <P> "My bet is that this will become an important technology," said Christopher  Gallen of the Scripps Clinic. "These images may become as important to  psychiatry and neurology as are X-ray images to internal medicine."  </P> <P> Charting Normal Brain Functions  </P> <P> In an attempt to understand the workings of the hand-activity area of a normal  brain, doctors placed electrodes for three mapping procedures: MEG, or  magnetoencephalography, which charts magnetic fields, EEG --  electroencephalogram, which charts electrical energy and ECoG,  electrocorticogram, which maps the brain's direct electrical current from  electrodes placed on the brain itself. In MEG and EEG, electrodes are placed on  the scalp. Brain functions are so quick that each snapshot records activity for  500 microseconds -- about 1/20th of a blink of an eye.  </P> <P> Charting an Epileptic Seizure  </P> <P> Doctors used a combination of MEG and EEG mapping techniques to diagnose the  source of frontal lobe seizures. The series of snapshots, which lasted 4  microseconds each, pinpointed the patient's problem area. Subsequent surgery  and treatment lessened the frequency of seizures.  </P> <P> Source: William W.

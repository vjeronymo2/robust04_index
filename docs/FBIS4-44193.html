			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Antonio Ruberti, EU Commissioner </F> for education and research, by Gunnar Magnus; place and date not  given]    [Text] The EU's [European Union] "minister for research"  stressed how important it is to develop more environmentally  friendly technology. He also said that the EU's new emphasis on  transport research is linked to the goal of an internal market.    Italy's Antonio Ruberti is the EU commissioner for education  and research. He took part recently in the large-scale EUREKA  [European Research Coordination Agency] conference in  Lillehammer.    EUREKA is the name of the research group which now embraces  23 countries in Europe and the EU Commission. Projects are  proposed by cooperating companies in different countries, and it  is these countries which chiefly finance the research.  Consequently this research is closely linked to the needs of  business and industry.    The research fro which the EU grants money must from the  outset have more fundamental implications -- or be ahead of the  competition on the market, as the phrase goes. The EU's  research programs have existed for 10 years, EUREKA for nine.  And, according to Ruberti, the relationship is good: EU  research and EUREKA complement each other in many ways. Ruberti  said that the EU is involved in 27 EUREKA projects.    At the EUREKA conference Ruberti followed up Norway's strong  emphasis on environmental issues and more environmentally  friendly technology.    "In its recently adopted fourth framework program for  research the EU has made strong commitments in this field.  Environmental research is a separate area of investment, but  the environment also comes into fields such as energy,  transport, and biological sciences," he said -- and predicted  greater cooperation on environmental problems.    Several East European countries are now involved in EUREKA.  Russia attended the Lillehammer meeting with a large delegation.  Asked what Russian companies have to offer, Ruberti reminded me  of the country's technological background, particularly in the  military-industrial complex. The competence built up here can  be adapted to meet civilian needs.    "Russia has a very interesting potential. The fact that the  country is today experiencing problems does not mean that the  level of quality is low," he stressed, adding that the Russians  are very interested in EUREKA cooperation. But so far they have  not taken part in many projects.    The EU gives research support to the countries of East  Europe  -- both through a foundation and directly in the form of project  support. Of a total allocation of ECU540 million (around 4.52  billion Norwegian kroner) to countries outside the EU, nearly  one-half go to the countries of East and Central Europe, Ruberti  said. The money helps to maintain scientific centers which would  otherwise have been in great difficulties because of the  economic situation.    Through a center set up jointly with Russia, the United  States, and Japan, the EU is helping in the conversion from the  military to the civilian sector. The EU has also made money  available to improve the safety of nuclear reactors in East  Europe.    Recently the Socialist Left Party voiced criticism of this  project, partly with the argument that, in this way, dangerous  power stations are being kept in operation. Ruberti's response  is that it is not the EU which decides whether the reactors  should be in operation.    "We cannot afford to allow ourselves not to worry about  safety," he added.    The EU's fourth framework program for research continues to  focus on areas of investment from the third program:  information and communications, biological sciences, the  environment, industrial technology, energy, and human resources  and mobility. Two new areas have been added: Social research  and transport.    Ruberti said that transport and information research is  about  creating a better flow of goods and information. These fields  are closely linked to the political goal of achieving a single  internal market in the EU.    The new EU programs for education -- Leonardo and Socrates  --  have not yet been formally adopted. But Ruberti is expecting  support for them at a forthcoming ministerial meeting. The main  problem is finding the money, especially since the way is being  prepared for enlargement.    Norway is already deeply involved in research cooperation  with the EU, in part a as result of the EEA [European Economic  Area] agreement. But until we become members of the EU, we will  not be involved in the formal decisionmaking process. Ruberti  said that Norway can make important contributions in fields like  environmental research and fisheries research. He praised  Norway's approach to vocational training and further education.    Would an EU no-vote have any impact on cooperation? Not to  any great extent. But Ruberti cannot rule this out all together  and pointed to certain problems with Switzerland, which said no  to the EEA. For the time being at least the relationship between  Norway and the EU seems to be the very best in the fields of  education and research.</p>

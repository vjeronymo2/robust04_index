			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN INVESTORS SET TO BUY A PIECE OF PARIS  </P> <P> Japanese investors are expected to buy a large stake in France's Forum des  Halles shopping center, a thriving new complex that is as much a part of the  Paris cityscape as the Japanese-owned Rockefeller Center is to New York's  skyline.  </P> <P> France's Credit Lyonnais bank is about to clinch a deal to sell Nippon Life  Insurance Co. nearly a third of the shopping center for $68 million, bank  sources said today.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, a Nippon spokesman declined to comment on reports of the deal.  </P> <P> The Forum des Halles is a huge multistory complex in the heart of Paris near  the Louvre. It is the largest and busiest shopping center in the French  capital.  </P> <P> The sources said the deal, which would be Nippon's first investment in French  real estate, would have to be approved by the Japanese Finance Ministry.  </P> <P> A controlling stake in Rockefeller Center, a New York landmark and a symbol of  U.S. capitalism, was sold to Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. for $846 million  last month.  </P> <P> Nippon, a major life insurer, already has stakes in the French travel company  Club Mediterranee and construction group Bouygues.  </P> <P> France last March cleared the sale of one of its top cognac houses to a  Japanese concern, part of a growing drive by the Japanese into the French  luxury goods sector.  </P> <P> Both the Paris restaurant Lucas-Carton, which has a prestigious three-star  ranking in the Michelin gastronomic bible, and the jet-setters' hair salon  Carita have been sold to Japanese interests.  </P></p>

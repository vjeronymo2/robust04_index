			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aden, 6 Feb (MENA)--A responsible security source at  Aden International Airport has dismissed the press report  released by the Interior Ministry in Sanaa today that the  Ugandan aircraft that was impounded at al-Hudaydah Airport today  entered the country illegally. The source said that the  aircraft was intercepted over al-Hudaydah and was forced to land  at the airport.    The source added that the aircraft, which operates for a  British company, was flying from London via Athens to Aden after  it had been chartered by the Yemeni Airlines Company [al-Yemda].  The aircraft had permission from the Aden Airport authorities  to land at Aden Airport. The source stressed that Aden Airport  officials had informed the aviation authorities in Sanaa and  al-Hudaydah that the aircraft had permission to land at Aden  Airport.    The source said that the officials at the Civil Aviation  Authority and the Air Force Command in Sanaa and al-Hudaydah  will be held responsible for the consequences of such illegal  acts. He noted that these acts represent a grave step that  jeopardize air transportation movement in Yemeni airspace and  harm Yemen's reputation and international position.    The source demanded that the aircraft, crew members, and  load  be immediately released.</p>

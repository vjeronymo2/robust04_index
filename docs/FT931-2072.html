			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / West cannot help Yeltsin: Europe No one can predict the end of the escalating political crisis in Russia. At one extreme of the political spectrum, there is a danger of civil war; at the other, a danger of prolonged stalemate between President Boris Yeltsin and the Congress, leading to the paralysis and conceivably the collapse of the central Russian state. The one thing which is certain is that the western bandwagon being drummed up for an emergency international meeting to help Mr Yeltsin, is misconceived, and likely to make matters worse. Lead drummer in the bandwagon is President Francois Mitterrand. During a lightning visit to Moscow last week, he called for an urgent summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries, to increase their help for Russia. Boris Yeltsin was enthusiastic, but not the Japanese. They currently hold the chairmanship of the G7, and they were irritated that President Mitterrand should hijack the regular summit which they will be hosting in Japan this summer. In any case, they are annoyed with Yeltsin for refusing even to talk about returning the four northern islands seized from Japan by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world war. But the Japanese could not stop the bandwagon. The Germans were ready for an early meeting; US President Bill Clinton was ready to think about it; all western countries were worried that Mr Yeltsin and his economic reform programme could be brought crashing down by the obstructionism of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov and the Russian congress over which he presides. Unfortunately, this 'Help Yeltsin' campaign is driven by mixed motives. After the present French parliamentary elections, Mr Mitterrand will likely face a hostile conservative government with a huge majority. He needed to underline in advance, by his visits to Moscow (and Washington), his claim to control French foreign policy. But in this domestic French debate, Yeltsin's predicament is purely accessory. In any case, Mr Mitterrand's recent record makes the campaign suspect on other grounds. He dragged his feet over the unification of Germany; he used what influence he had to keep Yugoslavia together; and he did his best to keep the Soviet Union alive as well. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr Mitterrand's judgments have been surprisingly fallible. The problem is that the proposal for an urgent G7 summit has been framed as a response to the growing constitutional crisis in Russia. It implies that there is some sudden action which the west could take, which would either save Mr Yeltsin, or save his liberal economic reform programme, or preferably both. There is no basis for such an assumption. There is obviously a strong case for the west to help Russia, if it can be done; gradually, over a period of years, financial aid, technical assistance, political advice and foreign investment could be helpful. But it is doubtful whether the west can do anything directly to change the political course of events in Russia; it is most unlikely that the west can intervene effectively in the present crisis; almost certainly it should not try. In any case, western perceptions of the power struggle in Moscow seem distorted by Manichaean oversimplifications: in the white corner is Battling Boris, the liberal democrat; in the black corner is Retrograd Ruslan, the power-mad conservative. These stereotypes do not admit the possibility that Russia may be different. We may believe in the superiority of pluralistic democracy and market forces; but is it sensible to imagine that the Russians can knock up from scratch a politico-economic system which took us hundreds of years? If it comes to that, why should we assume that they would want, or could use, an implant of one of the many different western versions? Hear Boris Kagarlitsky on the subject*: 'In repeating the slogans of western neo-conservatism, the Russian ideologists consciously closed their eyes to the fact that its key economic concepts were elaborated, and the prescriptions applied, in conditions utterly different from those now confronting Russia . . . The proclaimed goal of becoming a developed capitalist state in the mould of Britain or France is simply objectively unattainable. It is naive in the extreme to think that the gulf in levels of development and wealth can be bridged with the help of a few salutary laisser faire prescriptions . . . 'What sort of privatisation can we talk about in the absence of a functioning economy, in a country where laws do not operate; where there is no developed system of commercial law; and, most important, where there is no civilised and responsible bourgeoisie? . . . The bourgeoisie needs several generations in the most favourable conditions to come into existence, and several more generations to become civilised . . .' The utility of a G7 crisis meeting is unclear. Declarations of western support did not help Gorbachev; why should they help Yeltsin? They might easily make matters worse, by ratcheting up the conflict between Yeltsin and the congress. The west may prefer a victory for Yeltsin and liberalism; but a victory for congress would only be the second-worst outcome. Much the worst result would be a prolonged and inconclusive struggle, since that could prompt the disintegration of power from the centre to the regions and the republics. The west can do little to help Yeltsin win; but it can certainly increase the danger of prolonged conflict and disintegration. * Disintegration of the Monolith, by Boris Kagarlitsky, Verso, 169 pages, Pounds 10.95</p>

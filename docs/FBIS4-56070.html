			<p>BFN     [Text] Prompted by the attacks on the Bihac security zone,  President of the State Presidency Alija Izetbegovic has written  to the heads of state of the member countries of the contact  group for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the UN secretary general, and the  Security Council presiding member. At dawn this morning, the  Serbian forces began an extensive attack on the Bihac security  zone, which has been surrounded since the beginning of the war.  Our troops are putting up a bitter resistance, but the  situation is extremely grave. I appeal to you to take measures  for the protection of the Bihac security zone that are in  accordance with the applicable UN Security Council resolutions.  The situation is extremely critical and calls for urgent  action. This is stated at the end of President Izetbegovic's  letter.</p>

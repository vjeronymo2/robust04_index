			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exemption request was based on monitoring data which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that the NAAQS for ozone was attained in this area for the 35 months prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the State's request would be contingent upon the collection and verification of one additional month of data. The required additional month of verified data was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 consecutive months. Texas submitted its exemption request prior to the publication of the national interpretation in order to expedite Victoria County's 1994 highway project funding schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has evaluated the State's exemption request for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. The EPA believes that the exemption request and monitoring data qualifies Victoria County, Texas, as a ``clean data area''. In addition, the EPA has determined that the exemption request meets the requirements and policy set forth in the General Preamble for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions from the build/no-build test for transportation conformity, and today is approving Texas' request for exemption from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  build/no-build test of transportation conformity for Victoria County. The 182(f) exemption will be conditioned upon the area's monitoring data continuing to demonstrate attainment after the exemption has been granted. If the EPA later determines that Victoria County has violated the ozone standard, the 182(f) exemption will be rescinded. Past conformity determinations and transportation plans would not be affected, but new conformity determinations would then be subject to the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provisions of the conformity rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this FR publication, the EPA is proposing to approve this exemption petition should adverse comments be received. This action will become effective on October 11, 1994, unless notice is received by September 12, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action, and another final action will be published addressing any adverse comments. If no such adverse comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on October 11, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has reviewed this request for exemption from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> et seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). Small entities include small businesses, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because an exemption from the Federal transportation conformity rule does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

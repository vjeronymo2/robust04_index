			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the  Popular Arab Forces Conference, has condemned the abominable  crime perpetrated by a gang of Zionist settlers this morning  against Palestinian Muslims at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.  In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, he said this repulsive  crime exemplifies the hatred felt by Zionists toward our  Palestinian Arab people and confirms the impossibility of  cohabitation with the invaders and killers who usurped Arab land  and honor. He called for the intensification of the intifadah  as the correct response to Zionist crimes and violations of  Palestinian human rights. Hammudi urged dynamic Arab forces and  the international community to condemn this appalling massacre  and its imperialist backers, especially the U.S. Administration  -- the Zionist entity's strategic ally. The blood of innocent  martyrs is an offering for the redemption of Palestine from the  abomination of the racist, hateful Zionist occupation, Hammudi  said.</p>

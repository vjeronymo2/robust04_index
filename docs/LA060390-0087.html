			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WITH FEMALE PRESIDENT, HAITI'S WOMEN SAVOR FIRST REAL TASTE OF POWER;  </P> <P> FEMINISM: ECONOMIC SURVIVAL TAKES PRIORITY OVER SLOWLY DEVELOPING POLITICAL  ACTIVISM.  </P> <P> Women till the poor land, toil in sweatshops and perform the other drudgery  that moves Haiti's meager economy, but the choice of a woman as president in  March was their first real taste of power.  </P> <P> "They dominate in agriculture, trade and industry," sociologist Daniele Bazin  said. "They, in fact, run this country."  </P> <P> Until Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, 46, was installed March 26, women were virtually  excluded from power in Haiti, which has been ruled by dictators through much of  its 186 years.  </P> <P> As recently as the early 1980s, women were regarded as "legal minors," barred  from opening bank accounts, buying property or traveling without the consent of  their husbands.  </P> <P> Those laws have been repealed, but little has been done to improve the hard lot  of most Haitian women.  </P> <P> Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, has become  a symbol of women's aspirations since taking office as provisional president.  </P> <P> "I accept in the name of Haitian women," she said at the inauguration.  </P> <P> Her civilian administration, which is to govern as caretaker until democratic  elections can be held, replaced the 18-month-old military government of Lt.  Gen. Prosper Avril, who was driven into exile by a popular uprising.  </P> <P> The choice of Pascal-Trouillot by a coalition of opposition groups "had  psychological impact," historian Suzy Castor said.  </P> <P> "When the army gives up power to a civilian, and to a woman at that, it has a  lot of meaning," she said. "I don't have illusions, but it represents a few  steps."  </P> <P> Symbol she may be, but the elegant, highly educated president has little in  common with her illiterate, impoverished sisters.  </P> <P> Women from privileged families have gained ground in Haiti -- about half the  doctors are women, for instance -- but only one-fourth of university students  are women. What money is available for higher education usually goes to a son.  </P> <P> Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, is  the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation.  </P> <P> Most of its 6 million people live in the countryside, working tiny mountain  plots of coffee, sugar cane, rice and corn with primitive tools. Agriculture  accounts for 32% of a gross national product valued at $1.5 billion annually.  </P> <P> Half the work force is unemployed, and average annual pay for those who find  jobs is only about $370. Most city dwellers live in slums without electricity,  potable water or adequate sewers, and life expectancy is 53 years.  </P> <P> The 8,300-member army is a way out of poverty for men. Women run the  households, care for the children and support the economy in countless ways.  </P> <P> Most of the distribution and sale of crops is carried out by peasant women who  walk long distances in the mountains to sell their goods at outdoor markets.  </P> <P> Women called "Madames Sara," for a migratory bird, handle most of the trade  with the rest of the Caribbean, traveling to the Dominican Republic, Puerto  Rico, Martinique, Curacao, and Panama to buy kitchenware, shoes and food for  sale at home.  </P> <P> Government tax incentives and low wages attract foreign-owned manufacturing  plants that produce electronics, clothing and sporting goods for sale abroad,  mostly in the United States. Women make up about 75% of the factory workers,  who are paid only $3.20 a day.  </P> <P> Paul Latortue, a Haitian economist at the University of Puerto Rico, said  women's economic contribution is "overwhelming."  </P> <P> "Though we don't have the data, I believe women produce the better part of  Haiti's GNP," he said.  </P> <P> About 80% of Haitian mothers rear their children alone. Marriage is commonly  viewed as a preserve of the upper class and most children are born out of  wedlock.  </P> <P> Couples who live together consider themselves married, but men have no legal  obligation to pay child support or alimony. Men change wives at will and may  have several at the same time.  </P> <P> "Men run around a lot to prove their virility," said Irene, a 22-year-old  housemaid who asked that only her first name be used.  </P> <P> Claudette Werleigh, social affairs minister and the Cabinet's only woman, said  men often have several "wives" in a lifetime.  </P> <P> "Among the poor, the man has many women, so he is absent," she said. "He  escapes the problems, the sick children, the crying."  </P> <P> Haiti has an infant mortality rate of 135 per 1,000 births, highest among  Western nations, and women tend to have several children so a few will survive.  Children are a woman's protection when the man leaves, and often go to work  when very young.  </P> <P> "The only thing a woman has to look forward to in Haiti is that her children  will have a better life than she does," said Bazin, the sociologist. "They are  her insurance policy, and she will slave so her child can get an education."  </P> <P> Violence against women is common, but usually goes unreported because abused  women have nowhere to turn.  </P> <P> "There are no women's shelters," said Lilian Pierre-Paul, a popular radio  newscaster. "When they are beaten they come here. They come on foot, in trucks,  to talk to me and ask for help."  </P> <P> Feminists say attempts to organize have been difficult because Haitian women's  priority is economic survival. "Women don't have time to go to meetings," said  Michele de Ronceray, a sociologist and political activist.  </P> <P> Women's groups have sprung up in recent years, however, and some observers see  Pascal-Trouillot's government as a turning point.  </P> <P> "We go the countryside and women are saying they are concerned about their  lives," said Daniele Fouchard, founder of am education and health center for  illiterate women and children that has 300 branches.  </P> <P> "For years, they weren't able to say what they were thinking; they were afraid  to talk," she said. "People are thinking something can change with a new  person, with a woman as president."  </P></p>

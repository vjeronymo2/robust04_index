			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Noble raises further Pounds 32m for Lloyd's insurance market NOBLE &amp; CO, the Edinburgh-based finance house, yesterday completed the placing of shares in its split capital Lloyd's investment trust, Premium Trust and Premium Underwriting, raising a further Pounds 32.3m in funds for the Lloyd's insurance market. Some 25 per cent of the issue is available to the public on a clawback basis via an offer for subscription. Martin Currie Investment Management will manage the investment portfolio, while Wellington Members' Agency has negotiated capacity on 45 syndicates listed in the prospectus. Noble last week increased the size of the offer to accommodate investor interest and Mr Tim Noble, chief executive, said he was 'delighted' with the response from institut-ions. PT will receive Pounds 19.8m of the issue and PU Pounds 13.2m. After deducting issue costs and a reserve for initial expenses, PU will lend Pounds 12.2m to PT interest free for 10 years in return for an undertaking by PT to pledge a total of Pounds 31m to Lloyd's. This in turn will permit PU to support Lloyd's syndicates underwriting up to Pounds 62m in 1994. Shareholders of PU will receive all underwriting profits for seven years, while PT will operate within the guidelines of an investment trust for tax purposes. Shareholders of PT will receive all the income and capital gains for 10 years on an initial portfolio of some Pounds 31m. Shares will be offered as a unit at Pounds 10 apiece and capital raised on a 60/40 basis between PT and PU respectively. The minimum application will be for 300 units, or Pounds 3,000.</p>

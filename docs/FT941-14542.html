			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Political Notebook: Paying for the sins of a predecessor It is in Exodus after the flight from Egypt that the unforgiving God of the Old Testament delivers his warning to the chosen people: 'I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children ..' Mr John Major knows what that means. Buffeted by the political fall-out from Scott inquiry into arms sales to Iraq, the shady dealings by Westminster's Tory council and an aid-and-arms deal with Malaysia, Mr Major is paying for his predecessor's sins. He is furious about Labour's attempt to pin the sleaze label on his government. He is an honest politician. He does not like being branded the leader of a bunch of crooks. But take them aside and many Conservatives will readily acknowledge that after so long in office any party runs the risk of becoming corrupted by the habit of power. That, they judge, is what happened in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's third term of office. The massive mistakes in public policy - over the poll tax and Europe to name but two - after her third election victory in 1987 were mirrored by an arrogant disregard of accepted standards in the private business of government. 'It was corrupt,' admits one minister who served in that administration. That is not to say individuals were making money out of their position in government, but otherwise, 'anything went as far as No 10 was concerned'. Sales of machine tools to Iraqi arms factories and Whitehall's subsequent indifference to the fate in the courts of three directors of Matrix Churchill were typical of the mood. The inquiry by Lord Justice Scott has not uncovered any great conspiracy. Mr Major's exposition on Monday of his distinctly bit-part role in the affair was convincing. Labour understandably want to pin blame directly on him but the effort does not carry great conviction. What the hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of evidence to Scott do reveal is an unapologetic contempt among some - not all - ministers and officials for their own rules and for the institution of parliament. For all the sophistry now being employed to argue that there is no case to answer, it is hard to find anyone in the senior ranks of the government who does not expect Scott to reach some damning conclusions. The decision by the Thatcher government to devote Pounds 300m of Britain's overseas aid budget to an uneconomical hydro-electricity project on the banks of Malaysia's Pergau river is part of the same picture. Ministers deny the scheme was linked explicitly to a Pounds 1bn arms deal negotiated personally by Mrs Thatcher. When Mr Major gave final approval to the project in 1991 he was simply handing over a cheque she had promised. He received the assurance of Whitehall lawyers that there was no illegality. But those familiar with both the aid agreement and the 'coincidental' arms deal say that the denials of a link are accurate in only the strictest terms. The Thatcher government did not promise specifically the Pergau dam in return for the arms contracts. But a few months earlier Mrs Thatcher's office had make a direct link between the arms sales and the aid package from which Pergau was eventually financed. Then there is the alleged gerrymandering by Westminster council. It cannot be laid directly at the government's door. Lady Porter, the colourful then leader of the Tory group, made her own judgments. Nor is there anything particularly new in local authorities seeking to rig election results. The brazen self-confidence behind a scheme that the district auditor estimates cost the people of Westminster more than Pounds 20m reflected the climate of the time, however. No one denies that the leader of what was proclaimed the Tories' flagship council was a frequent and honoured guest at No 10. So what, Mr Major might say. My government is different. It set up the Scott inquiry. It has actually promoted the civil servant who brought the doubts over the Malaysia project into the public domain. If the Westminster charges are proved, it will condemn the guilty. But the prime minister remains unwilling or unable to make a clean break. Apart from the occasional slip that provides a glimpse of his true feelings  -'The golden age that never was' is the best example - Mr Major continues to defend the actions of his predecessor. He should instead disown them. He might even, on occasion, apologise for them. The forgiving God of the New Testament did after all tell us how past sins could be absolved.</p>

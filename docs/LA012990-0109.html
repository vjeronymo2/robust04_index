			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: SENNA MAY BE A NATURAL LAXATIVE, BUT IT IS DANGEROUS  </P> <P> Q. I'm worried about my sister. I'm afraid the herbal laxative she swears by is  ruining her health.  </P> <P> Donna has always insisted that natural remedies are far superior to regular  medicine. The herbalist she consulted told her to use senna regularly to flush  the toxins from her system.  </P> <P> Isn't it dangerous to use any kind of laxative too often?  </P> <P> A. We don't know what toxins your sister thinks she is flushing, but she could  well be doing herself more harm than good.  </P> <P> Senna may be "natural," but that doesn't make it safe. This strong cathartic  can cause cramping and diarrhea. Regular use can interfere with normal bowel  function.  </P> <P> Your sister sounds like a laxative abuser. Experts estimate that anywhere from  5% to 15% of Americans overuse laxatives, often in a misguided attempt at  weight control.  </P> <P> The sooner Donna weans herself from senna, the healthier she will be. Fiber  from bran and whole grains is a far more natural way to maintain regularity.  </P> <P> Q. I was interested in your report about Scandinavian scientists finding that  coffee raised cholesterol.  </P> <P> I have been drinking coffee for about 85 years, since I was a youngster in a  Swedish home. In the old days, we ground the coffee at home, put it in a pot of  cold water and heated it on the wood stove until it came to a boil.  </P> <P> I drink four or five cups a day. It doesn't keep me awake, and I don't worry  about how much cholesterol it contains. I'm glad I was raised long before the  scientists started studying coffee.  </P> <P> A. Coffee itself doesn't contain cholesterol, so no need to worry about that.  </P> <P> But researchers now believe that brewing coffee the old-fashioned way you  describe leads to elevated cholesterol levels. The more boiled coffee a person  drinks, the more of this undesirable blood fat the body makes. Filtered coffee  appears safer, so perhaps the paper filter removes the chemical culprit.  </P> <P> Since you have already survived to a ripe old age, we see no reason for you to  change your coffee drinking habits at this stage.  </P> <P> Q. When I had the flu, I took a liquid cold formula with 1000 mg of  acetaminophen plus three or four Tylenols a day for a headache. I was surprised  at how much better my bad back felt, and I'd like to maintain this relief. How  many Tylenols can I safely take in a day?  </P> <P> A. The acetaminophen label says you should not take more than 4 grams (8 Extra  Strength Tylenols) a day. Daily use over an extended period could increase your  risk of kidney damage, however.  </P></p>

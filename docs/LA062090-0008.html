			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINDEXTER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR ROLE IN IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL  </P> <P> Thank you for your short but succinct editorial on the sentencing of John  Poindexter ("Admiral Was Far Off Course," June 12).  </P> <P> There was hope that this trial would raise the still unanswered questions of  the Iran-Contra scandal and publicize how our institutions failed to get to the  bottom of it.  </P> <P> In the preceding trials of Oliver North, Richard Secord, Albert Hakim and  Joseph Fernandez, claims of national security have been used to cover up  criminal activity. Those who still consider these men as heroes seem to have  forgotten that, as your editorial points out, the very foundation of American  constitutionalism is shaken when the checks and balances are ignored. George  McGovern has called Iran-Contra, "The greatest constitutional crisis since the  Civil War."  </P> <P> Now a little justice has been meted out but it leaves relatively untouched and  unpunished the high-ranking government officials who have put themselves above  the law by hiding from prosecution behind the cloak of national security.  </P> <P> We can only hope that the non-government case still to be tried, the Christic  Institute civil suit, will go forward. Its goal is a worthy one: to insure that  the abuses committed in the Iran-Contra affair will be prevented in the future  and that national security will once again become security for the nation  rather than security from prosecution for those who commit crimes in the name  of patriotism.  </P> <P> PATRICIA S. CARMEL  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Fe  </P></p>

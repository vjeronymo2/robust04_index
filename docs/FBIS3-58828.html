For a multilateral dimension in foreign policy.    In an interview with LE DEVOIR, new Foreign Minister  Andre Ouellet surveys Canadian diplomacy and the important  issues it will have to tackle. In the first of a series of two  articles, he discusses peacekeeping issues and explains the  cardinal pillars of Canadian foreign policy.    It was Canada that invented and introduced to the United  Nations the concept of "peacekeeping," an accomplishment which  earned Lester B. Pearson a Nobel Prize. But today, Canada has  misgivings about following the UN's lead into the field of peace  enforcement and deployment of blue helmets into war-torn  countries.    The brief detention of 11 Canadian soldiers by Serb  militiamen in Bosnia just before Christmas prompted Ottawa to  express its misgivings publicly. In a recent interview with LE  DEVOIR, the newly installed minister of foreign affairs, Mr.  Andre Ouellet, shared his thoughts on the subject.    "Traditionally, the United Nations was invited to send  peacekeeping contingents into regions where the opposing sides  had decided to make peace.... In the last 18 to 24 months, the  United Nations has been led to involve itself in conflicts  (without) the approval of local authorities. This is a  completely new dimension, and Canada must ask itself whether it  has the means to intervene militarily in countries where there  are active conflicts."    Peacekeeping (on the "Cyprus" model) versus imposition of  peace (as in Bosnia): This is not the only tough question with  which Canadian diplomacy is wrestling. There is also debate over  the size of contingents deployed.    Mr. Ouellet assures us that Canada still has the intent and  the means to participate in traditional peacekeeping missions  that do not demand excessively large numbers of troops. "But  2,400-man military missions in the former Yugoslavia, where  maybe there is some hope for peace but not much of an ongoing  peace process: That's very expensive. I am not saying no; I am  not saying we should reject the concept of humanitarian  intervention. But we must be cautious along that path. And we're  going to have to delimit Canadian interventions very precisely."  Mr. Ouellet notes there are some situations where "one can play  an important role with as few as 15 people--technicians,  experts--facilitating deployment of an effective peace force."    For all that, Canada is not turning its back on the UN. To  the contrary, it plans to be "very much present and very active"  in the international organization. "But these are general  concepts. The way these concepts are applied needs to be  reassessed," the minister says.    Amid all the excitement that surrounded the unveiling of a  new government, one small detail might have escaped even the  most attentive observers: Canada's diplomatic establishment is  now called the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having abandoned the  old "External Affairs" tag inherited from its link to the  British Crown.    A simple name change, it ought to have been made when Canada  first assumed full sovereignty in the conduct of its  international relations. "It's just a way of catching up with  reality," says the new chief of Canadian diplomacy.    Catching up with reality, elaborating a policy that conforms  better to the new international situation and to domestic  imperatives: This is a priority objective for Minister Ouellet,  who announced his intention of organizing a forum next March to  discuss Canadian foreign policy and defense issues.    More than ever, a mood of reevaluation is in the air. "We  think it necessary, in the new world context, to have a broad  public debate on all these questions," said Mr. Ouellet. "We  want an open, Canadian-style debate, instead of the old  decisionmaking system based on telephone calls between Ottawa  and Washington."    As an opposition party, the Liberals had criticized the  Conservatives for having clipped the wings of Canadian diplomacy  and made it subservient to the United States, narrowed its focus  to the American continent, and relied excessively on Brian  Mulroney's special ties with the then-tenant of the White House.    Now in power, the Liberals are reaffirming their intention  to  restore the multilateral dimension to Canadian foreign policy.  "We will not be continentalists. We want to concentrate our  efforts and initiatives on the three pillars of Canadian  diplomacy: our relations with the United States, of course, but  really with all the Americas; our transatlantic relations with  an enlarged Europe now building closer ties to the countries of  East Europe; and our Asian and Pacific relations, which have  stayed on the back burner for too long."    In the framework of this "three-dimensional" diplomacy,  Canada places great importance on expanding its relations with  the countries of the former Warsaw Pact. In face of insistent  demands by some of those countries--Hungary, Poland, the Czech  Republic--for entry into the Atlantic Alliance, Canada opposes  undue haste and favors requiring them first to meet the  democratic standards upheld by NATO member countries.    When it comes to the perceived stiffening of Russian foreign  policy in the wake of the ultranationalists' electoral  breakthrough--"a protest vote," according to Mr. Ouellet--the  minister aligns himself with those who believe in standing up to  Moscow. Many European chancelleries reject any thought of  opposing the Russians; they believe that if Moscow "vetoes" the  entry of Poland or Hungary into NATO, its wishes must be honored.    Minister Ouellet is not of that persuasion. He describes  himself as concerned to avoid giving the impression of yielding  to Moscow's opposition. "The Russians are pressing their  objections very energetically, but if we do nothing, we risk  seeing the old hegemonies reestablished. We must take care not  to re-create, by default, a situation which in years past we  deplored and considered regrettable. Inaction on the part of the  Western countries only encourages Russia to reaffirm and  reimpose its hegemony over its neighbors."    On the delicate issue of Macedonia, the former Yugoslav  republic which several European countries recognized this month  even though the United States continues to follow a  "wait-and-see" policy, Mr. Ouellet laconically observes that the  question is "being studied."  <H5>  [4 Jan pp A1, A14] </H5>   [Text] In this second and final installment of his  interview with LE DEVOIR on the future of Canada's foreign  policy, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet shares his thoughts on  the political crisis in Haiti -- a country where Canada plays an  important role -- and the steps that should be taken to resolve  it.    Convinced that the Haitian military leaders who overthrew  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not voluntarily let go  their grip on power, Ottawa proposes tightening the screws to  force their hand.    "At this time, the military leaders are not prepared to  cooperate in resolving the crisis," said Foreign Minister Andre  Ouellet in an interview with LE DEVOIR. "They are deliberately  stalling for time because they know time is on their side. Thus,  concrete new initiatives are required. If we remain passive, we  won't succeed."    Minister Ouellet admits the Haitian crisis is not moving  rapidly toward resolution--indeed, it seems to be worsening. He  says Washington is partly responsible for this state of affairs.    Taking the Americans sharply to task, Mr. Ouellet opines  that  their confused and contradictory policies have strengthened the  military's position. "The fact that statements coming out of the  State Department were being contradicted by the Pentagon may  have contributed to strengthening the (Haitian military's)  conviction the Americans would not intervene."    In December 1990, Canada welcomed the accession to power of  Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's first democratically elected  president. Since the 30 September 1991 military coup that forced  Aristide into exile, Canada has played an important part in  efforts by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the  United Nations to mobilize support for President Aristide and  his restoration through diplomatic means.    Although Minister Ouellet considers a military solution  totally out of the question and relies rather on sanctions to  achieve the objective, he maintains that Canada bears a special  responsibility toward Haiti "because it is very close to us,  because many Haitian nationals live in Canada, because Quebec  religious figures have been working in Haiti for many years,  because there are deep-rooted ties."    After two years with no apparent progress, the foreign  minister suggests it is time for Canada to abandon its passive  stance and "lean on the Americans." "They need to start speaking  with one voice. Because the State Department says one thing,  then the military and the CIA say something else. After that,  they need to be persuaded to act."    High on the list of concrete steps recommended by Mr.  Ouellet  is the formation of a Haitian police force. Canada suggests a  good beginning would be to provide training for police officers  "who could become a counterweight to the military." "As long as  the military exercise complete hegemony over the country,  they're going to impose their own rule," says Mr. Ouellet. "The  balance of power needs to be changed."    The Governor's Island Pact signed last July by President  Aristide and General Cedras, commander in chief of Haiti's Armed  Forces, called for measures to be implemented last fall to  separate the police from the Army.    So far, the Haitian military have blocked this reform.  Minister Ouellet proposes to move ahead now on training of  Haitian policemen--in Canada, if it cannot be done in Haiti. The  core of the police force could be constituted by the  presidential guard that provides protection for President  Aristide in Washington.    All of its neighbors have taken up the call for democracy in  Haiti, but not to the point of strictly enforcing the UN  sanctions against the Haitian military. One of the weakest links  in the pro-Aristide coalition is the Dominican Republic whose  land border with Haiti on the Isle of Hispaniola is used to  circumvent the oil embargo.    Mr. Ouellet thinks that if sanctions against Haiti are to  have any chance of success, the Dominican Republic must be  induced to enforce them to the letter. "We need for everyone to  stand united and severely tighten the screws on the Haitian  military. We would also like to persuade the Dominican Republic  to take an active part in these efforts." Referring to Canada,  France, the United States, and Venezuela--the countries that  compose the group known as the "Four Friends of the UN Secretary  General on Haiti" and serve as advisers on the Haitian  situation--Mr. Ouellet thinks the Dominican Republic should be  persuaded to join the "Four Friends" group.</p>

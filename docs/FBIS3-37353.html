			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Grevtsev report: "Dniester Region Under Threat"] </F>   [Text] Tiraspol -- The Dniester Moldovan Republic [DMR]  Supreme Soviet has adopted an appeal to the UN secretary  general, the CSCE, the worlds' parliaments, and the CIS  countries. As we know, it points out, elections to neighboring  Moldova's parliament are taking place 27 February in which the  DMR is not participating. The DMR's nonparticipation  essentially signals the Dniester Region's de jure separation  from the Republic of Moldova.    The Moldovan authorities are making every effort to ensure  that the elections do actually take place on DMR territory.  Alongside the concentration of Moldovan armed formations on the  border with the DMR, an attempt is being made to assail the  Dniester Region from inside. It is being made first and  foremost by General A. Lebed, commander of the Russian  Federation 14th Army, and M. Bergman, commandant of the Tiraspol  Garrison, around whom the local neobourgeois forces are  grouping. Recently, Lebed more or less openly set out to  overthrow the DMR's leadership by force. The general and his  closest aide, Bergman, are appealing for a "march with  pitchforks" against the organs of power, promising "to provide  material assistance for the funerals" of the republic's  leadership, as well as other such statements.    In its appeal, the republic's parliament requests the United  Nations, the CSCE, the world's parliaments, and the CIS  countries to urgently send observers to the DMR with a view to  "preventing the worsening of the economic blockade and the  outbreak of armed conflict."</p>

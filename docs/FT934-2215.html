			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / N Ireland executives foresee a peace dividend: Jimmy Burns and Tim Coone report on industry leaders' opinions Business leaders in Northern Ireland expect an economic boost to the province's economy if there is peace, and are ready to see concessions made in talks that could later include Sinn Fein. These are the overall findings of a Financial Times survey published today. It is a rare snapshot of the attitudes of Northern Ireland's businessmen and women on the political situation and the paramilitary violence in the province. Since the troubles began 25 years ago, the business community has in the main kept its political views private for the good reason that its factories and offices, or the executives themselves, could become targets of the paramilitaries. A majority of the companies insisted on completing questionnaires anonymously. A handful of those contacted by phone, however, volunteered to expand on their answers. One senior executive said of devolution: 'This is absolutely necessary because without it we will never have the politicians with the calibre we need to lead us.' Another commented: 'If the management of a business had been in conflict with its trade unions for 25 years, that business would have gone under a long time ago. 'My advice to the politicians is that they must sit down together and talk, and talk and talk, because that way you can always find there are ways of moving forward.' Only 4 per cent of executives said they had ever considered relocating to the mainland because of the violence, although the chief executive of one leading employer in the province admitted that relocation had been considered. Virtually all said that the violence had not significantly affected the day-to-day running of their businesses. But they all saw an economic dividend in prospect if there were peace, with 90 per cent anticipating a positive effect on business and entrepreneurial opportunities. They differed more on the precise new structures that would maximise this peace dividend. Only 5 per cent would continue with the present political structure while 57 per cent wanted stronger devolved power structures and 27 per cent wanted stronger north-south links. Only 4 per cent saw the best economic prospects in a united Ireland. On the political level the respondents were divided in assessment of the likelihood of a settlement, with optimists roughly matching pessimists. They also disagreed about the extent of the concessions that should be offered to achieve a settlement. About two-thirds of the executives thought neither the IRA nor the loyalist paramilitaries could be defeated militarily. Yet a third supported acknowledging the aspiration of Irish unity, and 61 per cent would concede enhanced north-south structures for economic co-operation. But only 20 per cent would back such structures for enhancing political co-operation and 14 per cent were against any of these concessions being made. Ninety-five per cent would allow Sinn Fein to the negotiating table: 7 per cent immediately; 29 per cent as soon as the IRA announced it would abandon violence; and 59 per cent after a substantial period of non-violence. Just as encouraging for the nationalist position was the fact that 61 per cent supported the position taken by Dublin that there should be separate referendums for north and south. Only a tiny minority of companies feel Sinn Fein should be indefinitely excluded from the political process. The survey covered most of the leading private-sector employers in Northern Ireland. The respondents together account for almost 25 per cent of the workforce employed in the private sector. It was conducted on the basis of strict confidentiality. Nevertheless, the fear of retribution from paramilitary groups was given as the reason for not participating by 10 companies. Such nervousness - one multi-national authorised its local senior executive to participate in the poll only after a tortuous series of consultations at board level - suggests that the survey may underestimate the extent to which businessmen and women in Northern Ireland consider themselves threatened by terrorism. The chief executives of 80 companies were approached, of which 56 responded. Many said they were taking part in order to contribute to the current political debate. Overall, almost a third of their business is conducted with mainland Britain, almost 40 per cent within Northern Ireland, a quarter overseas, and only 7 per cent with the Irish Republic, broadly reflecting the pattern of trade in the province. The poll was carried out on Thursday and Friday of last week.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The value of peace: Ulster business says it's time to make concessions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fifty-six chief executives of Northern Ireland's leading companies in the manufacturing, construction, financial services and distribution sectors participated in this survey by the Financial Times.

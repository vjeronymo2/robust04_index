			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Last part" of political report delivered by Do Muoi at </F> Midterm National Party Conference in Hanoi on 20 January -- read  by announcer]    [Text] We must continue to thoroughly understand  conceptions and implement lines and measures set forth by the  party third plenum. We must concentrate on political and  ideological work to ensure the political and ideological unity  in the entire party. Cadres and party members must be given  regular training on the party's conceptions and lines to upgrade  their knowledge, confirm their commitment in the socialist path,  and help them to creatively apply and develop the  Maxist-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh thought, and advanced ideas of our  times and grasp new thinkings to correctly resolve problems  arising from real situations.    The ideological work must first must concentrate on pressing  problems that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical  research and review, problems arising from the renovation  process together with measures to solve them must be  scientifically clarified. Mistaken conceptions and vague and  unsure ideologies must be corrected. We must fight against all  opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative  manifestations.    Party cadres and members must strictly observe the party's  resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not  disseminate conceptions contradicting the party's line.    Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles  relating to party organization and activity -- first, the  principle of democratic centralism and the principle of  collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be  implemented. Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must  be drilled to fight against waste, corruption, and illegal  business. We must fight against personalism, indiscipline,  arbitrariness, authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness.    The party protection work and the work to ensure internal  and  national secrecy must be given particular attention. All  conspiracies and tricks to degenerate the party cadres must be  eliminated. The control work on the implementation of the  party's lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened.    The national unity block must be broadened, and the close  relationship between the party and the public must be  consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly  unite all Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause  for national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves  from poverty and backwardness to surge forward for the goal of  rich population, strong nation, and just and civilized society.    We must consider national interests as a common goal. At the  same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as they do not  counter the national interests. We should eliminate obsession  of hatred to look forward to the future. The ideology of great  unity must be manifested in all state guidances, policies, and  laws.    We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and  roles  of the workers, peasants, and intelligent. The forces of women  and youth must be fostered and developed. The party and state's  policies regarding the ethnic and religious people,  industrialists, businessmen, overseas Vietnamese community must  be supplemented and satisfactorily implemented.    The party echelons and party committees must hold study  workshops before implementing party Central Committee and  Political Bureau resolutions on the work relating to fatherland  fronts and mass organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to  coordinate activities between state organs and mass  organizations. The work content, method, and attitude of the  fatherland fronts and mass organizations must be revamped.    We have to reform cadre-related work. First we have to renew  our conceptions and methods of our cadre-related work in  assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying, especially key  cadres. Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed.  We have to create favorable conditions for good people, both  inside and outside the party and inside and outside the country,  to contribute their best efforts to the nation.    The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and  ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight  against narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and  discrimination. The evaluation, choice, and assigning of  leading cadres at all levels must base on fundamental standards  outlined in the Third Central Committee Plenum resolution. We  must pay particular attention to their political knowledge,  determination in the party's goals and ideals, and morality and  life style to ensure that they always exercise diligence,  practice frugality, instill honesty, and uphold righteousness.  They must not be corrupted and determined in fighting against  corruption. They must have consciousness of organization and  discipline, stay close to the masses, and obtain a capacity and  quality in par with their duties.    We will bring about democratization of party member work.  The evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the party  committee directly managing the cadres together with relevant  agencies and must be done in accordance with proper process in a  democratic, conscientious, and fair manner. Every cadre has the  right to be informed and to give opinion on the evaluation by  the party committee and agency leaders on the concerned cadre.    All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the  existing contingent of cadres, and base on this evaluation to  build up plans for party member work from mow until the year  2000, which will correspond to the requirements of quantity,  quality, and structure of cadres.    We will provide training and further training to cadres  according to plans. The training content must be specific for  each task and requirements of each concerned position.  Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying  methods in training, while adequate funds must be provided to  the training provision. Party members, especially the cadres at  all levels, must regularly study, enrich their knowledge,  heighten their understanding level, and improve their  revolutionary characteristics.    We have to urgently prepare the human force for the eighth  party congress and the later years. We have to improve the  policies and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten  the scientific characteristic of the organization task, and  continue to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a  light and effective party mechanism with high efficiency.    We have to boost the research on organization models,  discern  each function, duty, and leadership style of the party at all  sectors and echelons, and from there set up plans to perfect the  organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the party, state,  and other organizations.    We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is  a  ruling party, which sets up policies and lines for the national  construction and protection. The successful implementation of  party's policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the  organization and cadre work. The party leads applying the  democratic centralism principle, and the principle of collective  leadership with individual responsibility. The leadership task  is fulfilled through the party organization, not through the  individual party cadre. The leader executes collective  decisions, follows up and guides the implementation, encourages  good deeds, corrects deviations to develop the role and efficacy  of the state, not to replace it.    We must heighten militant character of the party members  contingent regarding consolidation of grass-roots party  organizations. At present, the political determination and  loyalty to the party's ideals, to working people's interests and  interests of the people as a whole, are essential  characteristics of a party member. The party regulations  clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party member, and  every member must abide by these regulations, be a model in  striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or manager, who  fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to improve  knowledge and work ability, respects organization disciplines,  fosters party unity, and strictly follows state laws.    We have to handle in a timely and strict manner those  degenerated and deviated party members, and those breaching  party disciplines and state laws. We continue to expel from our  party those who do not have membership eligibility any more. We  must perform well the party development task, especially among  youth and women and in organizations where grass-roots party  organizations do not exist or have too few members.    We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of  the party's 65th founding anniversary and other important  festivities in 1994, we will launch education and training  campaigns on party development with prime attention be focused  on youth, in preparation for the eighth party congress.    In front of us is a new era full of promising potentials,  challenges that we determine to overcome, and favorable  opportunities we must exploit. All of our party, army, and  people must stick together, be unified in the struggle to  successfully implement the resolution of the Seventh Party  Congress and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever  greater victories.</p>

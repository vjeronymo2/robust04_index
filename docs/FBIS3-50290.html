			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A new meeting of the Group for Restoring Mutual  Confidence, which consists of representatives of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and the Serbian and Croatian  sides, was held at Sarajevo airport today. After our delegation  returned from the meeting, Emir Brackovic interviewed Haris  Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Begin recording] [Brackovic] Prime Minister, in your  statement yesterday you, in a way, announced today's meeting of  the Group for Restoring Mutual Confidence. This is a new group,  a new form of attempting [words indistinct] in a way.    [Silajdzic] Yes, this group had a meeting today. The  meeting lasted for somewhat shorter time today. Mr. Akmadzic  also attended today's meeting. The meeting dealt with two  groups of topics. They were military and humanitarian topics.  Regarding military topics, those touched upon were direct  telephone lines and (?something) was agreed upon -- soldiers  will (?certainly) be able to tell it better: meetings, regular  meetings of commanders, joint military commissions. Then we  went over to humanitarian issues, that is, the issue of convoys  and the issue of electricity. Regarding electrical power, we  drafted and signed an agreement by which the sides oblige  themselves firstly that they will not destroy power lines, that  they will in no way hamper the flow of electricity, as well as  that the repair of and resumption of work on the following lines  will be undertaken urgently: Jablanica-Kakanj, Travnik-Novi  Travnik-Nova Bila, Visegrad-Gorazde-Foca, as well as Lepenica,  Visegrad-Zvornik, and finally the powerline near (?Zepce).  Therefore, these are the six lines that should be repaired as  soon as possible. There is also the repair that had been agreed  upon, but which has failed five times -- that along the line of  Buca Potok-Reljevo, that is, at Perivoj. We agreed upon this  today, firmly agreed that the repair of that part should begin  immediately. Here, this is a concrete result.    [Brackovic] Is the group going to meet again before 10  February?    [Silajdzic] It should meet on 5 February, but we shall see  at what level.    [Brackovic] Is the Croatian side included in all these  commissions and groups for humanitarian issues?    [Silajdzic] All right, you are obviously well informed.  Yes, the Croatian side is now also included in the commissions  working on humanitarian issues, the issues of cooperation  regarding electricity, gas and so on. So far it was not  included, but as of now it will be.    [Brackovic] Have you had bilateral meetings with [word  indistinct] the Croatian side and can you [words indistinct]?    [Silajdzic] There were bilateral meetings with both sides.  These were mostly political talks about which I can say that  they were not particularly productive. Regarding these issues,  we are obviously turning around in a circle and we are obviously  not going to get out of it in this way, even though all the  sides had good intentions. What is involved are simply  different political options, different military options, so that  there is no result. This does not mean that one should not talk  and, for that very reason, we are talking.    [Brackovic] Thank you very much.    [Silajdzic] Not at all.</p>

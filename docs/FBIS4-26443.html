			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Shaanxi Province in  northwest China has scored marked achievements in environmental  protection and pollution control.    The province has made great efforts to reduce the discharge  of industrial pollutants such as waste gas and water.    Last year the treatment and utilization of waste gas  increased by 28 percent, of waste water by 4.7 percent and of  solid waste by 0.54 percent, according to Zhang Lianjie, head of  the provincial Environmental Protection Bureau.    The provincial government spent over 100 million yuan (about  12 million U.S. dollars) between 1991 and 1992 to complete 503  pollution-control projects.    In 1993 the province built 52 smoke and dust control zones,  covering an area of 236.9 sq km, and 21 noise pollution control  zones, covering 108 sq km.    The provincial government also relies on universities and  scientific research institutes to help reduce pollution in the  cement, textile, metallurgical, power, mineral and chemical  industries.    Meanwhile, the province has built 13 nature reserves with a  total area of over 164,000 ha, and ecological agricultural  demonstration zones in nearly 100 villages.    Some 79 rare animals and plants such as crested ibis, golden  monkey and davidia involucrata baill are now well protected in  the province.</p>

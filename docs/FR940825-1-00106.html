			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, language contained in two other provisions of the CAA, which expressly recognizes Tribal authority over all areas within the exterior boundaries of the reservation provides particularly compelling evidence that Congress intended to adopt this territorial approach. One such provision is in the CAA program governing the amount of incremental air quality deterioration allowed in ``clean air'' areas. Section 164(c) of the CAA provides that ``[l]ands within the exterior boundaries of reservations of federally recognized Indian Tribes may be redesignated [with regard to the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality] only by the appropriate Indian governing body.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 110(o) of the CAA provides that upon approval by EPA, Tribal Implementation Plans (TIPs) ``shall become applicable to all areas *&blank;*&blank;* located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.'' Section 110(o) of the Act recognizes that approved Tribes will exercise authority over all areas within the exterior boundaries of a reservation for purposes of TIPs. TIPs, in turn, are the administrative tools for implementing the requirements under Title I of the CAA necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), one of the central CAA programs. Significant regulatory entanglement and inefficiencies could result if Tribes have jurisdiction over such plans pursuant to section 110(o) of the Act, but are not found to have jurisdiction within reservation boundaries over non-TIP CAA programs. For example, a stationary source located on an area of a reservation over which the Tribe was found to lack inherent authority would be subject to the Tribal Implementation Plan provisions imposing NAAQS-related requirements, but might be determined to be subject to State regulation for some other CAA program. This entanglement could potentially subject a source to differing local regulatory authorities, possibly with conflicting goals and approaches, and potentially duplicative or inconsistent reporting, monitoring and other regulatory requirements. There is no evidence that Congress intended to create such complex jurisdictional entanglements. These entanglements are reasonably avoided by interpreting the CAA as granting to approved Tribes regulatory authority over all air resources within a reservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Further, a grant of authority to Tribes for NAAQS-related purposes alone would conflict with the implementation of the operating permit program called for by Title V of the Act. Title V explicitly prohibits partial State permit programs unless, at a minimum, such a program `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ensures compliance with <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  *&blank;*&blank;* [a]ll requirements of [Title] I *&blank;*&blank;* applicable to sources required to have a permit.'' Section 502(f) (emphasis added); see also section 502(b)(5)(A) (requires permitting authorities ``to have adequate authority to *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> assure compliance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by sources required to have a permit under this title with each applicable standard, regulation, or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> requirement under this Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '') (emphasis added) and section 504(a) (each permit issued under Title V ``shall include *&blank;*&blank;* conditions as are necessary to assure compliance with the applicable requirements of this [Act], including the requirements of the applicable implementation plan''). Since States could not unilaterally ``ensure compliance with *&blank;*&blank;* [a]ll requirements of [Title] I'' within Indian reservations because Tribes are granted authority over implementation plans under section 110(o), it appears that States could not, in fact, submit Title V permit programs for Indian reservations that would conform with section 502(f) or other provisions of Title V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A basic rule of statutory construction is to avoid interpreting a statute in a manner that would nullify or render meaningless a statutory provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because section 110(o) confers on approved Tribes the authority to administer Title I programs on Indian reservations, the provision of Title V requiring that a permit program must at a minimum ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of Title I cannot be met by States seeking authority to implement a Title V program within the boundaries of a reservation. These provisions can reasonably be harmonized by construing the Act as generally granting approved Tribes CAA regulatory authority over all air resources within the exterior boundaries of their reservations. Thus, this statutory structure further supports EPA's proposed interpretation of the CAA as granting approved Tribes authority within reservation boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See U.S. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Nordic Village, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 112 S.Ct. 1011, 1015 (1992) (rejecting an interpretation that ``violates the settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in a fashion that every word has some operative effect'') (citation omitted);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Boise Cascade Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir. 1992) (``[u]nder accepted canons of statutory interpretation, we must interpret statutes as a whole, giving effect to each word and making every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless or superfluous'') (citations omitted).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] British forces in Bosnia were today placed on a  heightened state of alert following the shooting down of four  Serb aircraft by American warplanes.    Military sources described the move as a "sensible  precaution  in the light of current circumstances."    Work was continuing as normal both on the ground and in the  air, officials said.    There were no British warplanes in the area at the time U.S.  F-16 Fighting Falcons shot down four Bosnian Serb Galeb attack  aircraft.    The U.S. aircraft, equipped with Sidewinder air-to-air  missiles, spotted six Galebs in the air close to Banja Luka in  direct contravention of the UN resolution banning all flights  over Bosnia.    The American pilots ordered the Serb planes to land or be  shot down. They ignored the warning and four were destroyed.    Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets, eight Tornado F-3  fighters and 12 Jaguar strike aircraft flying regular patrols  over Bosnia.    But the Ministry of Defence in London said none were in the  immediate area when the attack took place.    A spokesman said: "Operations are continuing today as  normal.  This was a very good example of NATO action in enforcement of a  UN resolution."    Allied aircraft on patrols over Bosnia stay above 10,000ft  to  avoid anti-aircraft artillery.    The Bosnian Serb forces possess a variety of anti-aircraft  missiles, including heat-seeking systems.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nikon not expecting 1992 profit NIKON, the leading Japanese camera maker, expects not to make a profit in the year to March, because of a steep fall in sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. The company blamed the downturn on severe cuts in investment among electronics companies which are facing stagnant demand. About 43 per cent of Nikon's sales come from cameras and 23 per cent from semi-conductor equipment. Nikon expects its sales to reach Y210bn (Dollars 1.74bn), down from its earlier forecast of Y228bn. It had predicted pre-tax profits of Y4.5bn for the year against Y7.2bn profit on sales of Y230bn last year. The company warned that the fall in sales would continue for the rest of the year.</p>

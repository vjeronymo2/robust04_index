			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Royalties help Zenith reduce loss to Dollars 15.2m ZENITH Electronics, the struggling US television manufacturer, reported a second quarter loss of Dollars 15.2m, or 52 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 280m. This is an improvement over the same period last year, when losses were Dollars 26.9m, or 92 cents, on sales of Dollars 275m. Royalty income of Dollars 13m this time helped boost results. Mr Jerry Pearlman, chairman, said the royalties came from colour TV and VCR manufacturers taking licences on Zenith's tuner technology. Zenith holds patents on most of the cable-compatible TVs and VCRs on the US market. The results, however, were affected by delays in shipments of the company's new flat tension mask monitors, or flat screens, due to start up problems and customer requests for upgrades. While consumer electronics shipments increased in the quarter, lower prices on colour televisions hurt margins. Although the company has implemented cost-reduction programmes, it expects another full-year loss. For the first six months, losses were Dollars 43.8m, or Dollars 1.50, compared with losses of Dollars 50.6m, or Dollars 1.77, last year.</p>

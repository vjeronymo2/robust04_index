He was welcomed on arrival at  the airport by Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh. [passage  omitted] The head of state held a private conversation with the  prime minister at the VIP lounge but no statement was made to  the press. We recall that the aircraft carrying the head of  state touched down at the Lome Tokoin International Airport at  exactly 1735 GMT. President Eyadema's trip to Cote d'Ivoire  lasted only a few hours. It was a short but highly significant  trip. The head of state and his peers of the CE went to express  their condolences to the family of their late eldermost  colleague. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (11): Gold bulls stand tall again - The restructure taking place in the mining industry 'GOLD IS the one object which is scarce and indestructible. It is cherished and never cast away. It never diminishes except by outright loss. It can be melted but it never changes its chemistry or loses its weight in the process . . . Man does not waste gold, it is too precious." Thus spoke Mr Anton Rupert, doyen of South African industrialists, at the opening of the new Leeudoorn gold mine on March 1. At the time the gold index stood at 972 and such utterances smacked of one not fully au fait with gold's commodity status in a world of low inflation and derivative instruments for spreading risk. Only three months later the index has risen to around 1860 and gold bulls again stand tall. South Africa's mining houses are understandably delighted. Having endured a flat gold price of roughly R1,000 an ounce from 1988, the rise of more than 20 per cent in recent months will boost industry profits considerably - the March quarter showed operating profit geared about 4.5 times to a price move - while offering a new lease of life to marginal producers. Chamber of Mines estimates indicate that if the dollar gold price averages Dollars 380 for the rest of 1993, then only about 39 tonnes of South Africa's roughly 600 tonnes annual production will be marginal - about half the figure for 1992. Welcome though the recent price rise has been, it has not been the source of unalloyed joy. Some industry figures worry that by re-establishing a 'comfort zone', the rise in the price will deflect attention from continuing the important process of structural reform under way in the industry over the past few years. The remarkable increase in the gold price from R25 an ounce in 1968 to R1,000 an ounce 20 years later both allowed, and obscured, various other trends, not all healthy: large wage increases, unrelated to productivity; the growth of a triple bureaucracy - at mine, mining house and industry level - and the advent of serious competition as buoyant prices brought big international money into gold. Taken together, these developments helped push South Africa from the cheapest producer in the world in 1970 to its most expensive in 1990. The full gravity of this situation only became apparent when the rand gold price flattened out at the end of the Eighties. The industry's response, slow initially, has been well documented. Mines shifted from a focus on mining ore to producing gold at a profit. While the annual gold production has remained unchanged at about 600 tonnes for the past few years, this has been achieved with a labour force that has shrunk by 125,000, or nearly a quarter, over the past five years. This has been a considerable achievement, but many believe the process is not complete. Thus Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, one of the main producers, commented recently: 'The feeling among my general managers is that we haven't scratched the surface yet. We haven't really taken advantage yet of the fact that apartheid has gone. We're a very, very inefficient industry because we haven't used our people properly.' If the first phase of restructuring involved improving the existing system, Mr Maude and his colleagues are now involved in questioning the very parameters of the system - rethinking time honoured working practices. At its most basic, this would involve flattening existing work hierarchies - there can be eight levels between where the gold is mined and the chief executive - and reducing horizontal rigidity; that is, trying to staff mines with generalists, rather than continuing with the existing rigid compartmentalisation of functions. Such innovation, however, is more likely to succeed in a climate of adversity, where all involved see that survival requires it. The concern is that renewed prosperity will reduce the momentum for change, both among managers and workers. Whatever becomes of such innovation, cost-cutting initiatives have not been restricted to the gold industry. Indeed, across the board the response of the mining industry to the recession in commodity prices has been significant rationalisation. This was recently evident in the platinum sector when industry leader Rustenburg Platinum announced it would be closing the loss-making Boschfontein shaft. Already Impala Platinum, the second largest producer, had cut its work force by 17 per cent, while maintaining production, and numerous expansion plans across the industry have been put on hold. Well known, too, are the quota requirements and labour cuts which De Beers has been forced to implement in response to recession in the diamond industry, while there has also been a strong focus on cost-cutting and rationalisation in the coal sector. Although labour cuts in the present climate are extremely unfortunate, belt-tightening has borne some fruits. In the words of one analyst 'it has created innovation and good strategic thinking. This has resulted in better management and better companies.' Hard times also offers a partial explanation for why three important mineral beneficiation projects - The Alusaf aluminium smelter, the Columbus stainless steel expansion and the Namakwa heavy mineral sands project - have received the go-ahead during the past year. The last time there was a trend towards projects which added value to South Africa's minerals was in the Sixties and early Seventies when the gold price was low and industry profit margins tight. During this period operations such as Alusaf, Richards Bay Minerals, Highveld Steel and Vanadium and ferro-alloy operations such as CMI started up. Now, as then, the logic of adding value domestically to the country's minerals rather than exporting them in raw form remains impeccable.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Critchley to Pounds 2.35m Two acquisitions in May helped Critchley Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer, show a 47 per cent jump in pre-tax profits in the half year to September 30. The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2.35m on turnover 25 per cent ahead at Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 13.8m). The share price firmed 15p to close at 459p. Idento, a German manufacturer, and CCA, a UK distributor, contributed Pounds 382,000 to operating profits and Pounds 1.72m to sales. Total operating profits went up 50 per cent to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.55m), with an underlying increase of 26 per cent. The proportion of the group's sales from outside the UK rose to 46 per cent, compared with 38 per cent in the first half of last year. However, Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive, said there was 'still scope for improvement' in UK sales, which rose by 10 per cent. Sales in the core business of identification and cable accessories rose 20 per cent to Pounds 12.1m on the back of strong demand in the US and France. Mr McCallum said margins were improving independently from the acquisition of Idento and that low-margin products continued to be shed. Sales at Critchley Wound Components, which produces transformers and inductors for the telecommunications industry, increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 3.49m. Fully diluted earnings per share were 11.6p (9p) and the interim dividend is 3p (2.6p). Critchley said it proposed to cancel its share premium account and transfer it to a special reserve. Goodwill from the two acquisitions would then be offset against this account rather than the profit and loss account reserve, which had fallen into a Pounds 3.56m deficit as a result of the transactions. The company stressed that this did not affect net assets or trading. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at an EGM in December.</p>

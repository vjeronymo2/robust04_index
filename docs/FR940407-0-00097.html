			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, for EIP's submitted during a time period when any progress plans are required but not yet submitted (e.g., the 15 percent RFP plan and/or the subsequent 3 percent plans), the program baseline shall be based on the lower-of-actual-or-allowable emissions. In such cases, actual emissions shall be taken from the most appropriate inventory, such as the 1990 actual emission inventory (due for submission in November 1992), and allowable emissions are the lower of SIP-allowable emissions or the level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously existing RACT requirements through emissions trading and are submitted in conjunction with, or subsequent to, the submission of an associated RACT rule, a State may exercise flexibility in setting a program baseline provided the program baseline is consistent with and reflected in the associated RACT rule, and any applicable progress plans and attainment demonstrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For EIP's that are designed to implement new and/or previously existing RACT requirements through emissions trading and are submitted prior to the submission of a required RFP plan or attainment demonstration, States also have flexibility in determining the program baseline, provided the following conditions are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For EIP's that implement new RACT requirements for previously unregulated source categories through emissions trading, the new RACT requirements must reflect, to the extent practicable, increased emissions reductions beyond those that would be achieved through a traditional RACT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For EIP's that impose new RACT requirements on previously unregulated sources in a previously regulated source category (e.g., RACT ``catch-up'' programs), the new incentive-based RACT rule shall, in the aggregate, yield reductions in actual emissions at least equivalent to that which would result from source-by-source compliance with the existing RACT limit for that source category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A program baseline for individual sources shall, as appropriate, be contained or incorporated by reference in federally-enforceable operating permits or a federally-enforceable SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) An initial baseline for TCM's shall be calculated by establishing the preexisting conditions in the areas of interest. This may include establishing to what extent TCM's have already been implemented, what average vehicle occupancy (AVO) levels have been achieved during peak and off-peak periods, what types of trips occur in the region, and what mode choices have been made in making these trips. In addition, the extent to which travel options are currently available within the region of interest shall be determined. These travel options may include, but are not limited to, the degree of dispersion of transit services, the current ridership rates, and the availability and usage of parking facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Information used in setting a program baseline shall be of sufficient quality to provide for at least as high a degree of accountability as currently exists for traditional control requirements for the categories of sources affected by the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Replicable emission quantification methods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program element, for programs other than those which are categorized as directionally-sound, shall include credible, workable, and replicable methods for projecting program results from affected sources and, where necessary, for quantifying emissions from individual sources subject to the EIP. Such methods, if used to determine credit taken in attainment, RFP, and maintenance demonstrations, as applicable, shall yield results which can be shown to have a level of certainty comparable to that for source-specific standards and traditional methods of control strategy development. Such methods include, as applicable, the following elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Specification of quantification methods. This element shall specify the approach or the combination or range of approaches that are acceptable for each source category affected by the program. Acceptable approaches may include, but are not limited to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Test methods for the direct measurement of emissions, either continuously or periodically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Calculation equations which are a function of process or control system parameters, ambient conditions, activity levels, and/or throughput or production rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Mass balance calculations which are a function of inventory, usage, and/or disposal records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) EPA-approved emission factors, where appropriate and adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Any combination of these approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Specification of averaging times.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Further dollar weakness helps European sector European government bond markets moved further ahead yesterday, as the more positive tone of recent days continued. Markets were bolstered by investors continuing to switch out of US bonds into European bonds, due to further dollar weakness. The higher-yielding markets, such as the UK and Italy, performed particularly well. German government bonds rose sharply in early trading amid growing confidence about the prospects for low German inflation and expectations that the US will not act to support the dollar by raising short-term interest rates. The market fell back slightly in later, volatile trading but retained its positive tone, finding firm support at lower levels. Analysts reported buying by retail investors and fund managers, with money being switched from the short end to the long end of the yield curve, and some cash activity among small domestic buyers. 'There is the feeling that we have seen the lows for the year,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt. 'The economic fundamentals are good and the strong D-Mark is encouraging to a low-inflation background.' Attention is now on next Wednesday's auction by the Bundesbank of 10-year government bonds. This will test market sentiment after recent auctions were cancelled due to lack of demand. The September bund contract on Liffe was up 0.46 points at 93.78 in late trading. Although sterling weakened further against the D-Mark, UK gilts outperformed their German counterparts, ending about  3/4 points higher. Profit-taking in the afternoon pushed prices off their highs, but traders said this did not dent the market's overall positive mood. 'I am a bit more hopeful, especially because gilts have been going up at a smooth and steady pace,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Greenwell. Traders were also squaring their positions ahead of today's average earnings and inflation data. Most are looking for an unchanged average earnings rate of 3 3/4 per cent, and the retail prices index at 2.7 per cent year on year and 2.6 per cent excluding mortgages. After lagging most of Europe on Monday, Italian bonds yesterday posted the biggest gains in Europe. The September BTP futures contract on Liffe jumped by 1.70 points to 105.00. Most of the gains were futures-driven, with retail investors preferring to stay sidelined until the government publishes its medium-term budget plans. It is expected to announce the outline of its three-year fiscal plan today, with the details likely to be published next Wednesday. There was widespread optimism that the government will offer a solid budget containing no tax give-aways. 'The market wants to see facts, and those are increasingly pointing in the right direction,' said Mr Marco Pianelli, of Nomura Research Institute. After early dollar weakness had overshadowed good inflation news and pushed US Treasury prices lower, the market rebounded yesterday afternoon aided by a rally in the US currency and a weaker than expected retail sales report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 83 3/8 , yielding 7.681 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 5/8 , yielding 6.204 per cent. Prices firmed at the opening after the Labor Department reported that producer prices were flat in June, and that 'core' producer prices - a measure excluding the volatile food and energy components - actually fell 0.1 per cent. Both figures were better than analysts had been expecting. The early gains did not last long, however, as the market reacted to renewed weakness in the dollar, which fell to a new post-1945 low against the yen of Y96.50, and to DM1.516, the lowest level against the D-Mark since November 1992. Investors sold bonds because they feared that - good inflation news notwithstanding - the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates. Later in the day, however, the market rallied, buoyed by a modest rebound in the dollar and a Johnson Redbook report of a decline in US store sales.</p>

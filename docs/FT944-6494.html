			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minister indicates timing of full Renault sell-off Renault, the French state-owned motor group which was floated on the stock market earlier this month, should be privatised in the second half of next year, Mr Jose Rossi, the French industry minister, said yesterday. 'Today, Renault is quoted on the bourse and has stable shareholders. It should prepare itself for a new step, that of privatisation,' Mr Rossi told the Senate, the upper house of the French parliament, while presenting his ministry's budget for 1995. His remarks are the first indication of a timing for the full privatisation of Renault, a sensitive subject given the company's status as a former trade union stronghold. During the flotation of the company, in which the government reduced its holding from 80 per cent to just over 50 per cent, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that privatisation was 'not the order of the day'. The government has previously refused to comment on the possible timing of a full privatisation. Officials sought to play down differences within the government. They said that Renault was on the list of 21 public-sector groups slated for privatisation by the centre-right government, and that its sale was therefore expected. However, some expressed reservations about Mr Rossi's remarks, arguing that it was not advisable to predict such an operation so far in advance. Mr Rossi's comments will, however, reinforce the assumption of most industry observers that the French government will move to reduce its holding to a minority relatively soon after next spring's presidential elections. The partial privatisation, which was completed on November 18, drew strong demand from employees and from institutional investors, who subscribed for more than 15 times the number of shares they were offered. However, the issue was less enthusiastically received by individual investors, resulting in a subscription rate of 1.4 times the shares on offer. Strong institutional interest has pushed Renault's shares above the FFr165 offer price. Yesterday, the shares closed at FFr181. Before a full privatisation, the French government has said Renault must conclude partnerships with other industry groups to secure its future as a private company following the collapse of merger plans with Volvo at the end of last year. Volvo retains just over 11.3 per cent of the shares in its erstwhile merger partner. However, Mr Soren Gyll, the chairman of the Swedish motor group, said yesterday that it planned to sell its remaining holding when market conditions were favourable.</p>

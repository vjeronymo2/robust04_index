			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Poll gives Labour biggest ever lead Mr Tony Blair's new-style Labour party receives a significant boost today with the publication of an opinion poll suggesting that his election as leader last month has propelled the party into its largest ever lead over the Tories. The poll, the first of its kind since Mr Blair's victory on July 21, puts Labour's lead over the Conservatives at 33 1/2 percentage points - 9 percentage points higher than a month ago. According to Gallup, which conducted the poll, this is the biggest lead either of the two biggest parties has ever enjoyed over the other - and by a wide margin. Gallup said that only the Labour government under the then Mr Harold Wilson in May 1968 was in nearly the electoral trouble that Mr John Major's government is in today. The survey, published in today's Daily Telegraph, puts Labour on 56 1/2 per cent - up 5 1/2 percentage points from a month earlier - against 23 per cent (down 3 1/2 ) for the Conservatives and 14 1/2 per cent (down 3) for the Liberal Democrats. It provides a stark warning for the Conservative party, suggesting that Mr Blair's decision to take on the Tories in the centre-ground of British politics may finally make his party electable. There is a strong personal endorsement for Mr Blair, indicating that 45 per cent of voters thought he would make the best prime minister of the three main party leaders. This gives him a 30 percentage-point lead in personal popularity over both Mr Major and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and was a much better result than was ever achieved by John Smith. Questioned about their reaction to the formation of a Labour government under Mr Blair, only 14 per cent say they would be dismayed, against 34 per cent who would be delighted and 52 per cent who would not mind. The personal popularity ratings will come as a particular disappointment to Mr Ashdown, whose party is struggling to find a role for itself in the new political environment. Mr Ashdown's rating has fallen by 7 percentage points since early May. Gallup interviewed 1,161 electors between July 27 and August 1. A much broader survey of more than 10,000 electors interviewed between June 30 and August 2 put Labour's lead over the Tories at 32.7 percentage points  -54.7 per cent to 22 per cent. Liberal Democrat support was significantly higher than in the smaller poll at 17.4 per cent.</p>

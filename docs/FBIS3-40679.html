			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Jan 2--The Chief Minister, Ms. Jayalalitha,  today urged the Centre to seek safeguards against certain  clauses in the Dunkel draft which might adversely affect the  nation's economy.    In a statement, issued in her capacity also as the General  Secretary of the AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra  Kazhagam], she said it would not be in the interest of the  country to reject in toto the Dunkel proposal.  However, some clauses in the draft badly hit the export-import  trade.    In particular, she referred to the patent clause which could  push up the price of imported life-saving and also locally  manufactured drugs. There would be the need for protection  against any such price increase.    Also, the provision for higher royalties on process patents  would affect agriculture and other sectors of the economy,  leading to price rise. Steps should be taken to obtain necessary  safeguards for products manufactured within the country, she  said.    Ms. Jayalalitha pointed out that the prices of agricultural  inputs, including fertilizers and hybrid seeds, might also go up  as the agreement would compel the Centre to cut subsidies.  Necessary remedial measures should be taken to continue the  support extended to poor farmers, she said.    When the countries of the world came together to sign an  agreement particularly in the context of the changing  international economic scenario, it would not be in the interest  of India to live in isolation. At the same time, the Centre  should take the steps to protect the nation against the clauses  which would adversely affect economic growth.</p>

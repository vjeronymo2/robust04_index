			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The other standard relates to the institution's academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising. Under that standard, which is in the nature of consumer protection, the agency must evaluate whether those items are accurate, complete, and consistent with the institution's actual practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(b)(7)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degrees or credentials offered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 496(a)(5)(G) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address program length and tuition and fees in relation to the subject matters taught and the objectives of the degree or credential offered. It is the Secretary's view that one of the purposes of this requirement is to eliminate certain abuses that have been discovered at institutions participating in Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These abusive practices fall into three main categories. One category involves accredited institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational programs and charge an excessive amount of tuition and fees for programs that lead to dead end or very low-paying jobs. In some cases, the tuition and fees for a short-term program to prepare students for a particular job exceeded the annual income that a person employed in that job could expect to earn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another category involves accredited institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education programs and inflate either the clock or credit hours for the program or the length of the program without educational justification, simply to increase the amount of SFA funds these institutions may receive. The third category involves accredited institutions that offer prebaccalaureate vocational education that are simply too short to be able to provide training that has any value in the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to address the statutory requirement for standards related to program length and tuition and fees by requiring an accrediting agency to establish minimum and maximum program lengths for prebaccalaureate vocational programs. In this context, program length means both the number of clock hours or credit hours in a program and the number of weeks that a program is offered. The Secretary invites specific comments with regard to this requirement. The topic of standards for establishing minimum and maximum program lengths was not discussed during the negotiated rulemaking sessions, and the Secretary invites comments on this topic as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the negotiated rulemaking sessions, consensus was reached on various factors that should be considered when an agency establishes its standard for program length in relation to tuition and fees. These factors are listed under &sect;602.26(b)(7) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). The Secretary has reconsidered this matter and now proposes two additional factors. The first concerns any applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Secretary does not believe the addition of a requirement for agencies to take into account applicable statutes and regulations when developing their standards goes beyond the intent of the HEA because it does not require agencies to adopt the Federal policies but simply to take them into account. The second factor concerns the relationship between tuition and fees for a prebaccalaureate vocational program and the remuneration that a graduate of that program can reasonably be expected to receive. The Secretary is concerned about this issue for this type of program because the very purpose of a prebaccalaureate vocational program is to prepare a student for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Moreover, the Secretary is concerned that tuition and fees being charged for prebaccalaureate vocational programs may be excessive given the type of job for which a graduate of the program qualifies. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment regarding standards that address tuition and fee charges for a prebaccalaureate vocational program  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vis-a-vis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the remuneration that graduates of a program may receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary requests comments on the various factors proposed for standards that assess program length and tuition and fees. In calling for comments with regard to this standard, the Secretary wishes to remind commenters that a violation of a standard does not necessarily preclude an agency from accrediting an institution or program. The violation would, however, at least require the institution to justify its tuition and fee charges to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

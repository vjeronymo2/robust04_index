			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: US retailers release encouraging sales figures US retailers yesterday unveiled modestly encouraging sales figures for October. This is the second successive month in which an improvement in high street sales has been evident, suggesting that a small upturn in the US consumer confidence may be emerging. Among the nation's largest retailers, Sears, Roebuck reported a 3.9 per cent increase in domestic store sales. At K mart, the picture was similar - with the general merchandise side in the US showing a 3.3 per cent same-store sales advance, and the specialty retail division posting a 4.2 per cent improvement. Both companies were outstripped by Wal-Mart Stores, the aggressive Arkansas-based group. Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling retailer, posted a 16 per cent increase in same-store sales in October, and has increased same-store sales in the first nine months by 16 per cent. Its total sales in the year so far stand at Dollars 38.4bn, compared with Dollars 30.2bn in the same period of 1991. Among the big department store groups, J. C Penney posted a 7.3 per cent same-store sales gain in its main department store division. Neiman Marcus produced a 5.7 per cent improvement in like-for-like revenues, while Federated Department Stores managed a 7.4 per cent improvement. Some of the specialty store chains appeared to fare less well. The Gap, which has generally weathered the tough retail climate in good shape, posted an increase of only 2 per cent in same-store sales last month, while The Limited managed only 3 per cent. Woolworth fared poorly, with an overall 0.4 per cent decline in domestic same-store sales, but blamed this on heavy promotion of its athletic footwear in the same period of 1991. On Wall Street, The Gap fell heavily losing Dollars 3 at Dollars 30 1/8 , while The Limited fell by Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 23 5/8 . Sears gained 3/8 at Dollars 42 1/2 , although K mart slipped by Dollars 1 to Dollars 27 1/4 and Wal-Mart eased  1/8 at Dollars 61 7/8.</p>

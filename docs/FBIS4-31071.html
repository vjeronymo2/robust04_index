			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 6 (TANJUG) -- U.N. envoy to former  Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said on Monday morning that all  conditions had been created for Bosnia's belligerents to sit  down at the conference table after armed Bosnian Serbs had  withdrawn from the last controversial ridge around the Muslim  enclave of Gorazde in the east.    The latest reports from the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  Command in Gorazde said that Bosnian Serb troops have withdrawn  from the exclusion zone around the town, said Akashi. He  explained that available information seemed to indicate that the  conference might begin on Monday morning.    U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived in Geneva  during the night, in an effort to use his authority to help  surmount controversial issues and finally open the conference on  a general cessation of hostilities in Bosnia.    On Sunday night, Akashi had separate meetings with the  Bosnian Serb and Muslim delegations, and indicated a certain  reconciliation of stands from which it appeared that the  conference might be held after all, after four days of delay.  He said, however, that the Muslim side was still making its  attendance conditional on receiving a report from its observers  confirming that "armed Serb elements" had withdrawn from the  exclusion zone around Gorazde.    In his most recent statement, Akashi said that the three  sides were coming to the talks with different positions, but  were willing that the conference, called at Geneva's Palais des  Nations, should finally begin.</p>

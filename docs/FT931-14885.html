			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Microgen rises 13% to Pounds 8.24m - Cost controls and lower interest charges behind improvement MICROGEN Holdings, the Windsor-based specialist computer services group, yesterday reported a 13 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.24m. The improvement, up from last time's Pounds 7.28m, was helped by cost cutting, price increases and substantially lower interest charges. Turnover for the year to October 31 rose 3 per cent to Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 47.7m). At the previous year-end the group acknowledged that costs and capital expenditure had been allowed to run ahead of income during the recession. Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 13.8p (12.2p). A final dividend of 5.05p (4.8p) makes a 7.25p (7p) total. Mr Douglas Lee, chairman, said he was 'quite pleased' with the overall advance, achieved against a background of 'relatively stable conditions in Germany, but continuing severe recession in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia.' In particular he cited the 'outstanding achievement' of the group's Scandinavian operations. These now accounted for a third of turnover and 29 per cent of pre-tax profits and managed to boost sales despite the recession, although margins on new business were somewhat lower. Mr Lee said three main factors explained the profit gain. Costs in the UK, including personnel, had been reduced to produce Pounds 1m of savings in a full year, a price review of smaller accounts led to prices being raised, producing an additional Pounds 400,000, and the cash position has improved significantly. At the end of October the balance sheet held net cash of Pounds 3m, compared to net borrowings of Pounds 1m a year earlier, after paying Pounds 1.1m in October to acquire a computer output microfilm (Com) and electronic printing business in Denmark. Microgen's core Com business currently accounts for about 70 per cent of turnover, down from 78 per cent a year ago. It is a mature market which is being slowly eroded by new technologies like optical storage. However, Mr Lee said the group was confident that Com 'has a long and secure future.' Specialist services based around electronic printing, like 'demand publishing', are expected to provide most of the growth in the future. t</p>

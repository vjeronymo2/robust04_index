Hosokawa made remarks to this effect in a meeting with a  group of reporters at his official residence.    Asked about his travel plans following his visit to the  United States in February to meet President Bill Clinton,  Hosokawa said he has no alternative but to visit Japan's  "neighboring country," taken to mean China because the premier  visited South Korea last November.    In reply to a question on the timing of his possible visit,  Hosokawa indicated it would be around March 21.</p>

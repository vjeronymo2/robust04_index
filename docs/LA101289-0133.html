			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENSORED ART  </P> <P> House of Representatives leaders refused to display, among their colleagues,  controversial "art work" funded by taxpayers before voting on (Rep. Dana)  Rohrabacher's proposal to eliminate funding for such trash. Yet, these same  lawmakers continue to scream censorship at those of us who feel this type of  filth should not be sponsored and paid for by the government, i.e.: you and me,  Joe Taxpayer. What hypocrisy!  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

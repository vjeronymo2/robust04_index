			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International plant 'genebanks' come under UN auspices An agreement will be signed in Washington today to place some of the world's most important collections of plant genetic resources under the auspices of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation. The collections, known as 'genebanks', are housed in 12 research centres in Africa, Asia and Latin America but are funded by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a network of 43 public and private sector donors. The centres concentrate their research on the world's most important staple foods, including rice, wheat, maize and other cereals. Together they hold 500,000 different samples of plants, which are vital for breeding crops of the future. This accounts for some 35 per cent of all the world's collection. They include 80,000 rice samples at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and 35,000 wheat samples at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre in Mexico. Following the signing of the Biodiversity Convention at the earth summit in Rio in 1992 there has been confusion about the legal status of the genebanks. Countries that donate samples to the genebanks feared that they might not benefit from any breeding improvements to their samples. But the new agreement legally brings the genebanks under the Biodiversity Convention and puts donors of samples in a position where they could benefit. Mr Geoffrey Hawtin, director of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute, said the agreement 'resolves the status of the collections held in the centres' genebanks; it will mean they continue to be freely available for breeding and use.' The agreement allows the 12 research centres to become legal trustees of the collections they house and could pave the way for other international and national collections of plant samples to be placed under a similar arrangement. It will be signed at the annual meeting of the CGIAR, which is being held this week, by the group's chairman, Ismail Serageldin, and Mohamed Zehni, of the FAO. 'These genetic resources will be invaluable in the application of science for the benefit of the world's poor,' said Mr Serageldin.</p>

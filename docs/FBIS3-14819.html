			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb -- Aleksey Kazannik, the Russian  prosecutor general, announced his resignation today. The  statement by the prosecutor general, made public at a news  conference held at the prosecutor's office, says:    "The Russian Federation president has appealed to me to  suspend the amnesty process ordered by the resolution dated 23  February of the Federal Assembly State Duma, entitled `On  Declaring Amnesty for Political and Economic Prisoners.' I  fully agree with the civic attitude and the content of this  appeal by the head of state.    "Many dozens of people were killed and over 1,000 were  crippled in the May and October disturbances. There are widows,  orphaned children, and sorrowing parents. Enormous material  damage has been caused. However, the State Duma is forgiving  all those people who are guilty of this. In accordance with its  will, unrepentant organizers of mass disturbances, their  instigators and perpetrators will be set free. Among them there  are many people whose conscience is burdened with killings,  pogroms, and robberies. The act of `political' amnesty, as the  legislators have called it, will forever remain a black page in  the history of Russian parliamentarism.    "Despite this, as the Russian Federation prosecutor general,  I have to think not only of the spirit but also of the letter of  the law when I make a decision. The prosecutor in Russia does  not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act. Nor does he  have a right to legislative initiative enabling him to appeal to  the State Duma for the resolution to be reconsidered. Therefore  I have no choice: I resign as Russia's prosecutor general.    "I am little concerned about my future. I have always felt  strongly about Russia and its longsuffering people. I believe a  golden age will come when truth will be called truth, a lie will  be called a lie, virtue will be called virtue, and lawlessness  will be called lawlessness. But it will come through the  efforts of neither the patriot-communists, nor the supporters of  Zhirinovskiy, nor yet through those of democrats who have  debased their noble status as members of the Russian  intelligentsia."</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity sector recovers its confidence THE FLOW of trading results from leading British companies continued to provide the highlights in the UK stock market yesterday. The mood in the equity market became more confident, although by no means enthusiastic, ahead of next week's budget speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. The unexpected fund-raising moves on Monday brought some excitement and traders scrutinised the market for other likely candidates for rights issue plans. But although trading volume was boosted by activity in a handful of heavyweight stocks, there was little improvement in business across the broad range of equities. The revived focus on corporate activity was fuelled by market hints of an impending bid for a blue chip stock. On the results front, the market accepted an increased loss from General Accident without much surprise, and was encouraged when Abbey National, the mortgage and banking group, referred to signs that the worst of the recession seemed to have passed. London was also helped in late dealings by improvement in the US leading economic indicators, and by suggestions from Mr Alan Greenspan, chief of the Federal Reserve, of some signs of economic recovery in the US. However, with the Dow Industrial Average up by only 9 points in UK hours, London closed below the day's best. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,565.4 for a net gain of 11.1 points. In early trading, the Index dipped to 2,550, the lower end of the current trading range, but bounced when the stock index futures market opened firmly. At mid-session, the Footsie was 15.4 points ahead with several of the leading components driven higher by shortage of stock. Wellcome, however, continued to fall sharply as the market braced itself for further details of the Wellcome Foundation's plan to reduce its stake from 73.6 per cent to between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. Turnover was modest, however. Abbey National's results stimulated activity among banking stocks. One investment fund upset the market with a clumsy attempt to put funds into the sector, and was obliged to abandon its foray. Overnight business from the US overflowed into London, driving Reuters ahead again and also helping ICI, BP and Shell. But Cadbury Schweppes, often a US-driven stock, gave ground on fears of a rights issue. Seaq volume increased to 523.2m shares from the 438.6m of the previous session, but dealers expressed surprise; 'I don't know where yesterday's business came from,' said one. Retail, or customer, business on Monday was worth Pounds 881.6m, a somewhat neutral figure in terms of market profitability. Equity market volumes remain uncomfortably low from the point of view of the London-based securities houses. Caution ahead of the UK budget, and the general election expected soon after, was underlined by market strategists. Kleinwort Benson Securities sees the Footsie remaining in its 2,500-2,600 range during March, although it believes this may be the last opportunity to buy below 2,600. Nomura Research Institute expects a switch out of the US and into the UK and Japan, but adds that 'no action is yet required.'</p>

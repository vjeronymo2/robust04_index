			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Companies plan to invest more Companies' investment intentions have risen in spite of tax increases, the finance and leasing group Lombard Business Finance said. Many economists see increased corporate investment as vital to re-balance the economic recovery which has so far been fuelled by consumer spending. In June, 63 per cent of companies surveyed planned to purchase a major asset over the next three months, up from 61 per cent in March. Companies are mainly investing to increase efficiency, rather than to expand capacity, according to Lombard, while the proportion of companies saying that the tax changes had caused them to cut investment plans was just 19 per cent in June, down from 27 per cent in March.</p>

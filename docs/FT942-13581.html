			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Agents convicted on house adverts The Property Misdescriptions Act, which aims to stop estate agents from making misleading claims about properties, has resulted in two successful prosecutions and 13 proposed prosecutions in its first year, the Office of Fair Trading said yesterday, Vanessa Houlder writes. The successful prosecutions were against a Norfolk estate agent, who showed an incorrect price for a property in his window, and a West Yorkshire agent who falsely said a property included a garage. One proposed prosecution involves an agent who described a property as 'quiet' when it is alleged to be next to a pub, near a main dual-carriageway and half a mile from a superstore.</p>

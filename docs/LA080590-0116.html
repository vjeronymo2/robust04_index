			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAW OF ECONOMICS PLAYS HAVOC WITH STATE'S MEDI-CAL PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Times certainly has a hard time understanding doctors. In the same issue,  you print Art Silk's eloquent letter explaining the profession's feelings about  the physician discipline problem ("Misdiagnosing a Quackery Cure," July 29) and  a dumb editorial that says that it is "shameful" for doctors and hospitals to  limit their losses in treating Medi-Cal patients.  </P> <P> Dr. Silk always says it better than I could, but let me try. We are not  unwilling to treat the poor, and most of us do. Before Medi-Cal, the poor  received good medical care in doctors' offices and the county hospitals, plus  those nonprofit hospitals which had received federal Hill-Burton funds for  construction. For-profit hospitals are not obligated to care for the poor, but  most do so anyway.  </P> <P> A direct result of the Medi-Cal program was the starving and, in Orange County,  the closing of county hospitals. The poor were supposed to receive "mainstream  care," and so the county hospital wasn't needed.  </P> <P> As usual, the promise hasn't been kept. The program (at least the benefits  part) is underfunded, the arrogant bureaucracy is bloated and the providers  (doctors and hospitals) are treated like felons.  </P> <P> Recently a patient was referred to me for major vascular surgery. She is on  Medi-Cal because of total disability. I accepted her as a patient even after my  office told me that they had been trying for three years to obtain payment from  Medi-Cal for a previous operation (same operation, other side) on this patient.  </P> <P> Will I ever be paid? Who knows? Will I let the world know that I will take all  comers and treat them all for nothing? Not on your life!  </P> <P> Most internists and GPs in my area don't even bill Medi-Cal for office visits  because it costs more to collect than the state will pay for the service. That  is what is "shameful!"  </P> <P> Can you really blame them for not advertising the fact that they all take care  of some of these patients for no charge? We who practice in affluent areas pity  our colleagues who must depend on Medi-Cal for a large share of their practice.  </P> <P> The Times would do better to study the real problems with the Medi-Cal program  and to try to understand that the laws of economics apply to medicine too.  </P> <P> DR. MICHAEL T. KENNEDY  </P> <P> Past President  </P> <P> Orange County Medical Assn.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

Mr Beith, speaking in his Berwick-upon-Tweed constituency, said: 'The cabinet is split over whether Britain should join the ERM and so have delayed the decision but haven't said what their policy is in the meantime. 'This uncertainty will further undermine the pound, and the chancellor is in great danger of allowing the pound to slip so far that interest rate cuts have to be ruled out or reversed because of the inflationary dangers.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Continued Reform Vital to National </F> Stability"]    [Text] Reform is the only way to guarantee a country's  stability and development, government officials and economists  said after reviewing China's economic progress in the first  quarter of this year.    The economy has experienced a high growth rate this year,  the  Chinese Business Times newspaper reported on April 9.    But inflation has worsened.    "The most serious problems we face are inflation and the  recession in the State-owned sector," said Wu Jinglian, an  economist at the State Council's Development Research Centre.    In the first two months of this year, retail prices rose 20  percent over the same period last year, according to the State  Statistics Bureau.    And rising inflation is destabilizing.    For more than 10 years, economic development has been  subject  to central government policy fluctuations, which have in turn  prioritized reform, development and stability.    And the economy has done very well encouraged by a policy of  speeding up reform, which was affirmed during Deng Xiaoping's  South China trip in the spring of 1992.    But economic chaos, particularly in the financial sector,  has  been an unwelcome side effect.    In July 1993 central government had to adopt measures to  cool  down the overheated economy and restore financial order.    And since then the stress has been on stability rather than  development, as was affirmed at the Second Plenary Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this March.    Price control is essential for stability, said the  newspaper.    And the government will do all it can to keep inflation  below  10 percent this year, three percentage points lower than last  year, according to Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.    Administrative measures have been adopted to control  inflation, although the government understands that economic  steps hold the key to solving what are, after all, economic  problems.    Fresh milk has been set at O.9 yuan (10 cents) per kilogram  in Beijing.    And since this price is 0.2 yuan (2 cents) lower than its  real cost, the Beijing Milk Company is providing subsidies of  1.5 million yuan ($170,000) for every 7,500 kilograms produced,  according to Xiao Chunyuan, manager of the company.    The company only earned 10 million yuan ($1.16 million)  profit last year -- 60 percent of which came from its tertiary  operations. And after paying out the subsidies and 8.5 million  yuan ($980,000) of value-added tax, the company actually earned  nothing from its production and sales last year.    And the Beijing Milk Company is relatively healthy as  State-owned enterprises go. Administrative obligations and the  heavy burden of feeding retired and idle employees mean that  many State companies are losing money hand over fist.    And keeping these companies going is part of the State's  stability plan.    And inflation is better than unemployment, according to Li  Yining, an economist at Beijing University.    As long as people are in work, endemic violence and crime  can  be avoided. Social stability is at stake, he said.    And stability does not mean stagnation, according to  economists.    Modification of the State sector would help the enterprises,  said Wu Jinglian.    Economist Du Runsheng said that privatizing State  enterprises  would reduce central government's financial burdens.    Luo Zhaohong, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences, said the nation's funds should not be wasted on  rescuing a sector guided by outworn economic principles.    To ease the State's financial burden, about 100 billion yuan  ($11.5 billion) treasury bonds are to be issued this year.    The bonds are popular with investors because they pay more  than bank savings, and are safer than stock and real estate  investments.    But problems have occurred with non-governmental  fund-raising  the first three months of this year, said the newspaper.    Many companies took advantage of local development policies.  They obtained local authority paper agreements promising  favourable business terms, and then used these documents to lend  credibility to local newspaper advertisements promising  impossible returns.    The government has adopted measures to crack down on these  fraudsters, said the newspaper.</p>

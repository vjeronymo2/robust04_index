			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not passed his  final decision regarding the joint Russian-American exercises  scheduled for this summer on the Totsk test range in the  Orenburg Region. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reported  about this to our Interfax correspondents Wednesday. Grachev  made the statement after the ceremony of placing wreaths at the  Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin Wall by the  leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry, due to the 53rd  anniversary since the beginning of the Great Patriotic War -  WWII.    "If we reject the joint Russian-American exercises on the  Totsk test range, we shall loose from the political point of  view," declared Grachev.    Despite a negative attitude towards these exercises on the  part of the State Duma, Grachev is convinced that "the exercises  should be conducted on the Totsk test range." He reported that  he had sent a letter to State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin  explaining his position. "These are not combined arms exercises  but peace-keeping ones," Grachev emphasized.    He pointed out that the total number of Russian armed forces  participating in peace-making operations, including 3000  peacekeepers in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, is  not more than 20,000 people.    Grachev noted that understaffed detachments of land forces  pose major problems to the Russian army. He explained the lack  of soldiers by a weak legal base for the call up and  inappropriate financing. The main thing what the army needs  from the state is "to give money and to give people," Grachev  said.    "Currently we have not enough funds or forces in order to  create the army about which we dream, however, the might of our  army is growing with every passing day and I think that it will  revive in a year of two," Grachev said.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Union chief to quit early MR LESLIE CHRISTIE, the 53-year-old general secretary of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, is to stand down six years early, his union said yesterday. Mr Christie would have faced re-election within the next 18 months, and most Civil Service union officials believe he would have been successful. He took over as leader of the 100,000-strong NUCPS when the Society of Civil and Public Servants, the mainly lower-management grade Civil Service union which he led, merged in 1987 with the smaller Civil Service Union. The pressures on Mr Christie have been intense in recent months. The union faces radical changes in the Civil Service including devolved pay bargaining and contracting-out. It is also having to restructure itself to accommodate the Civil Service reforms at a time when it is making large losses. In the year to December 1991 it recorded a deficit of more than Pounds 500,000 on income of Pounds 10.8m and this year is expected to be worse. Mr Christie was not available for comment.</p>

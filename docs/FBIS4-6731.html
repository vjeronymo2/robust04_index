			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Ki-pong from Paris] </F>   [Text] David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], said on 21 April that the IAEA is now  meeting with high-level officials of the North Korean mission in  Vienna to concretely discuss the timing and method of additional  inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities.    Spokesman Kyd said that "it is highly possible that North  Korea will accept additional inspections of its nuclear  facilities before the end of April, at the earliest, as wished  by the IAEA," and added that "in preparation for the smooth  progress of discussions with North Korea, the IAEA is ready to  send its inspection team to Pyongyang within next week."    On 20 April, North Korea sent a message to the IAEA  proposing  that IAEA inspectors witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at  its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon.    An IAEA source also said that "in the message North Korea  asked the IAEA to witness the upcoming change of fuel bars at  its nuclear reactor," and that "this is the first concrete  reaction from North Korea to the international community's  request for additional nuclear inspection."</p>

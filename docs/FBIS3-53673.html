			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Movement on All Tracks Is Required"] </F>   [Text] Some time will pass before practical reaction to  the Syrian-U.S. summit can materialize into reality. This is  because a great deal of that reaction and the outcome depend on  the Israeli positions regarding withdrawal from the Golan and  achievement of results on the other Arab negotiating tracks,  particularly the Palestinian and Lebanese tracks.    The Geneva summit put the ball in the Israeli court after  Syria proved to the U.S. sponsor its complete readiness to bear  the consequences of total peace, including the establishment of  normal relations with Israel. Israeli officials, however, still  prefer to ignore this reality and to insist on the Syrian side's  pronouncement of the word "normalization," as if there is a  difference between normalizing relations and establishment of  normal relations.    Certainly, Syria is still committed -- just as the other  Arab  negotiating parties -- to the comprehensiveness and justness of  a peaceful solution and, consequently, to the Arab link in  general, especially the Syrian, with the Palestinian cause.  Realization of the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations  will remain a constant factor despite the momentary differences  in viewpoints between the Arab brothers. The supreme Arab  interest is above any other consideration, especially as all the  Arab parties have chosen the strategy of peace and a negotiated  settlement. Hence, amid the political ambiguity prevailing in  the region now, one fact seems certain: None of the Arab  parties will sign a final and separate peace agreement with  Israel, rather all of them are striving for a comprehensive  peace in the interest of the region's peoples and their future  generations.    In this context, any agreement or settlement with any Arab  party will not be complete unless it coincides with integrated  settlements with the other parties. Hence, the Palestinian  side's approach and conviction is that any concrete negotiating  achievement realized on any negotiating track is, in the larger  sense, in the Arab interest. If the Syrian-U.S. summit has  managed to put the foundation for Israeli withdrawal and  evacuation from the Golan Heights -- this if we assume that  Israel will respond to this just Arab demand, refrains from  placing obstacles to it, and does not pursue the known method of  procrastination -- the signing of a comprehensive peace  agreement will still depend on the realization of withdrawal  from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, south Lebanon, and the 'Arava  Valley within framework of an integrated Arab solution  comprising the Arab parties interested in peace, without  exception.    We are now awaiting the practical Israeli reaction to the  Geneva summit after Syria announced its readiness to bear the  burden of peace as of this moment. That response must not be  confined to the Syrian track alone but, in conformity with the  comprehensive concept of peace, should extend to include the  other negotiating tracks, foremost of all the stalled  negotiations for more than two months with the Palestinian side.  Those negotiations were supposed to end positively several  weeks ago.</p>

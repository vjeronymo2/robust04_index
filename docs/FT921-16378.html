			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / BCCI liquidation ordered by court in Luxembourg THE winding-up of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, closed by regulators six months ago, was finally triggered by a Luxembourg court yesterday, although this is not expected to interfere with talks over a compensation scheme for depositors. The Luxembourg district court ordered the liquidation of BCCI SA, the Luxembourg-based part of the group which controls branches in many parts of the world, including the UK. This is the first step in what is likely to be a chain of similar judgments around the world, bringing the entire group into liquidation in the coming weeks. The High Court in the UK is also due to consider a winding-up order against BCCI SA on January 14, while the Cayman islands-based BCCI Overseas, which controls the other main operations of the group, is expected to be placed into liquidation at the same time. Representatives of Abu Dhabi, the bank's controlling shareholder, had argued before against a winding-up in the UK, and said this might jeopardise a compensation plan being backed by the Gulf emirate. However, talks over compensation between Abu Dhabi and Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross partner acting as administrator of the Luxembourg parts of BCCI, were yesterday said to be on course. Abu Dhabi representatives said the winding-up would not stop a later deal being agreed. Meanwhile, PaineWebber, the US securities house, has told BCCI depositors it believes it could obtain for them a better deal in an alternative liquidation plan. The PaineWebber plan estimates that it would be possible to achieve a final return for depositors of between 52 and 85 cents in the dollar. This compares with the existing forecast by Touche Ross, the provisional liquidators, of 30 to 40 cents in the dollar. The plan envisages the formation of a new investment company to transform debt into equity and to manage out the assets of BCCI in an actively trading company.</p>

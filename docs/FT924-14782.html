			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Campaign to avoid unkindest cut of all: Alan Pike reports on the lengths to which London's teaching hospitals are going to escape closure THE Charity Commission yesterday asked St Thomas' Hospital in London for details on the spending of Pounds 160,000-worth of charitable funds in a campaign to promote the hospital's image. St Thomas' is one of several central London teaching hospitals facing possible closure in a report due to reach Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, next week. As the deadline for submission of the report has approached, London managers have increasingly abandoned the air of professional calm that prevails on their wards in a high-profile struggle for survival. Threatened hospitals have not awaited the findings of Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, before launching campaigns to promote their achievements and try to deflect the closure decisions elsewhere. The Charity Commission said yesterday it had asked the St Thomas' management for more details on the expenditure and would look at the precise arrangements under which its charitable trusts operated. Mr Tim Matthews, the hospital's chief executive, defended the decision to spend Pounds 160,770 on consultancy and publicity work, saying it would be a 'disaster' for healthcare in London if St Thomas' closed. In the City, St Bartholomew's hospital - like St Thomas' a possible candidate for closure - yesterday lost its commander at the crucial stage in the battle. Dr Ken Grant, its chief executive and one of the best-known figures in National Health Service management, resigned saying he wished to develop his career in public health and tropical medicine. North-east Thames Regional Health Authority denied that Dr Grant's decision to leave now was linked to the likely outcome of the Tomlinson report. Many of his colleagues at St Bartholomew's yesterday feared otherwise. All the threatened hospitals can argue individual cases for survival, as their campaigns are proving. St Thomas', which last month ran a 16-page special supplement in a south London local newspaper, stresses its role as the capital's leading accident and emergency centre. St Bartholomew's emphasises its importance as the 'local' hospital to the 300,000 people who commute to the City each weekday. But the wrong battle is being fought as London's hospitals square up to each other. None of the managers, while crusading for the survival of their own institutions, denies that rationalisation is needed. At St George's, a south-west London teaching hospital, concern about the likely implications of the Tomlinson report was yesterday temporarily interrupted by a fire. If London teaching hospitals were private companies, the state of their finances would guarantee that any fire was followed by police and insurance investigations. They have lost out badly in the contract-based system of financing healthcare introduced last year - the government is spending an extra Pounds 50m this year just to keep central London services going while Sir Bernard completes his recommendations. All century, reports have drawn attention to an excess of hospital capacity in central London. The new funding system means action can be delayed no longer. Closures are certain, although the Tomlinson report may come up with other uses for some of the buildings. But many health specialists fear that a losing-battle to save prized institutions is already diverting attention from the more pressing question of the shape of healthcare after the closures have taken place. The British Medical Association has decided, before publication of the Tomlinson report, to focus on these broader issues and not back campaigns to save particular hospitals. While this has not pleased some BMA members in the threatened hospitals, the association believes it must concentrate on ensuring that medical resources released by the closures are transferred to other parts of the country, maintaining a balanced hospital service in London and building up the capital's general practitioner and community health services. Development of non-hospital services in London is a crucial element to any hospital closures. On many measurements, Londoners are poorly served by family doctors compared with people elsewhere in the country. The proportion of GPs above the age of 65 is 130 per cent higher than the English average. Many of these, like some younger GPs, work single-handedly from unsuitable premises. There are more GPs with list-sizes of more than 2,500 patients in London than elsewhere, while only 40 per cent of London GPs are equipped to carry out minor surgery - little more than half the national average. The King's Fund Health Policy Centre, in what was widely regarded as a foretaste of the Tomlinson report, argued in June for a rationalisation programme that would reduce hospital beds in London by up to 25 per cent over the next 15 years, with funds diverted to improving primary and community services. At a time of tight public spending pressures the real test of London's health service campaigners will be to ensure that, even if they fail to save some famous hospitals, the closure process goes hand-in-hand with the extensive renewal of local services.</p>

			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Reichmanns ordered to reveal more details of wealth A TORONTO judge has ordered the Reichmann family to disclose more details about their private wealth in response to creditors' concern that the family should contribute towards the costs of running and restructuring their ailing company, Olympia &amp; York. The order affects companies which the creditors believe may in some way be related to the O&amp;Y group but which fall outside the scope of the court protection order granted last month. The order, issued under Canada's Companies Creditors Arrangements Act, affects 29 companies under the main holding group, Olympia &amp; York Developments. The Reichmanns are expected to contest the order in court on Monday. For the first time since the bankruptcy filing last month, they will be represented, not by O&amp;Y's law firm, Davies Ward Beck of Toronto, but by a personal lawyer. The creditors have succeeded in recent weeks in drawing considerably more information out of the Reichmanns than was disclosed in the original CCAA filing. Mr Gary Goodman, a senior O&amp;Y official, disclosed under private cross-examination last week that the family has bought assets worth several hundred million dollars from O&amp;Y over the past 18 months. An O&amp;Y spokesman said this was done to inject cash into the company as it became more pressed for liquidity. Earlier this week, O&amp;Y disclosed other unencumbered assets worth about CDollars 70m (USDollars 58.3m), including a Gulfstream jet and several parcels of land. A lawyer for one of the creditors said yesterday: 'We want disclosure. If they have a house, I'd like to know they have a house. Once we get the information, we can make a decision on what to do.' Creditors with loans secured by O&amp;Y projects want to reduce their contribution to the company's administrative and restructuring expenses.</p>

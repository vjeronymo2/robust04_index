			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: US set to reclaim chip sales top spot THE US semiconductor industry could reclaim top place in world market share this year for the first time since the Japanese took it over in 1985, industry analysts say. This expected reversal, the first in seven years, is a triumph for US efforts to boost its electronics capability; it comes as the US semiconductor market has grown while Japan's has shrunk. This year, the US chip market is expected to have grown by over 15 per cent, with Japan's likely to have declined 10 per cent, according to Dataquest, the high technology consultancy. Against this background, 'you can easily draw the conclusion that US companies will gain share at the expense of Japanese companies,' Mr Jim Eastlake, associate director of Dataquest in the UK, says. Strong demand for memories and microprocessors from the personal computer market is why the US market has grown this year, he adds. The US companies Dataquest expects to have increased market share are Intel, Motorola and Texas Instruments, numbers three, four and six in the 1991 rankings. . NEC had top spot in 1991, where it has been since 1985, followed by Toshiba. Hitachi was fifth. Intel, which is investing heavily in R&amp;D and capital spending is likely to continue to grow, Mr Eastlake says. It is investing Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.64bn) in combined R&amp;D and capital expenditure, more than the total such spending being undertaken by the top three European chip makers - Philips, Siemens and SGS-Thomson - and more than the entire revenue from semiconductor businesses for Philips or Siemens in 1991. R&amp;D and capital spending by the top 10 Japanese chip companies totalled Dollars 10.5bn this year, against Dollars 2bn for Intel alone. NEC's R&amp;D and capital spending was Dollars 1.5bn, with 1993 Japanese spending expected to be flat.</p>

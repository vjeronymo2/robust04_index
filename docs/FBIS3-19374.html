The State Institute of Statistics (DIE)  disclosed yesterday that Turkish exports rose by 3.4 percent  while imports jumped by 20.2 percent in the fist month of the  year. Exports went up slightly from last year's $1.2 million to  $1.3 billion this year, while imports radically increased from  $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion this January.    The trade deficit, already on a sharp rise since early last  year, climbed by 61.46 percent from $519 million last January to  $838 million in the corresponding period this year, according to  the DIE figures.    The economy's export-import ratio declined from 71.1 percent  last year to 61.1 percent this year in January.    The DIE also revealed that Turkish foreign trade volume in  the same period rose to $3.47 billion from $3.06 billion of last  January.    The Turkish Treasury plans to introduce new export  incentives  this month following a further deterioration in its trade  balance, Treasury officials said on Friday. The new export  incentive package was signed in Thursday's Cabinet meeting. The  package will come into effect after receiving presidential  approval. The new export incentives will include an "export  return" system for agricultural products, research and  development incentives for high-technology sectors, state  participation in the construction of environmental facilities  and measures for on-the-job training.    The Treasury officials also said they had submitted  proposals  for new incentives, including energy subsidies to export  industries, to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition Cabinet.  Manufacturers would pay 25 percent less for natural gas,  liquefied petroleum gas and water. They would also be exempted  from import taxes and customs duties on fuel oil purchases. An  overvalued lira and economic recession in Turkey's main trading  partners have slowed exports since 1990. The 1993 trade deficit  was $14.08 billion, up 72.6 percent from $8.16 billion in 1992.  Exports rose 4.3 percent to $15.35 billion and imports 28.7  percent to $29.43 billion. The export-to-import ratio, a key  indicator of a country's trade performance, fell to 52.1 percent  in 1993, the lowest since 1980.    "Acceleration of the lira depreciation and new measures will  show their effects on our exports in coming months. I expect  exports to hit $17 billion this year," a Treasury official told  Reuters. DIE figures also disclosed that exports grew in the  industrial sectors and the agricultural sectors.    Industrial exports rose by 0.8 percent in January compared  to  last year's corresponding period, while agricultural exports  rose by a higher 17.4 percent.    The largest share in Turkish exports in January again  belonged to the industrial sectors with $1.04 billion, which  represents 79.7 percent of the total Turkish exports.</p>

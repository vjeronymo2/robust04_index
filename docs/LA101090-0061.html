			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 OVERTIME GOALS HELP ROYAL KEEP MARMONTE STREAK ALIVE  </P> <P> Students at Royal High counted down the final 10 seconds. They rose from their  seats to cheer what appeared to be Royal's 42nd consecutive Marmonte League  water polo victory.  </P> <P> But Agoura's Kevin Driscoll threatened to put an end to all that, scoring with  a second to play to tie the score, 5-5, and force the match into overtime. The  celebration, however, was only delayed, not canceled, as Chad Hood and Chad  Templeton scored in overtime to give the Highlanders a 7-5 win.  </P> <P> "After that goal, we said in the huddle, 'Let's find a way to win this thing,'  " Royal Coach Steve Snyder said. "It doesn't matter who it is, we had to do  something because the normal ways weren't working."  </P> <P> Hood's high shot over Agoura goalie Hooshie Broomand in the first overtime  period put Royal ahead to stay. Templeton added an insurance goal in the second  overtime period for the Highlanders (12-3, 3-0 in league play).  </P> <P> "It was a smart shot by Hood," Agoura Coach Mike Mulligan said. "Our goalie  came out of the net and he flicked it over his head. The goalie shouldn't have  come out; Hood took advantage of it."  </P> <P> Added Hood: "The goalies always come out when you get in close. I threw it high  trying to get a shot or a pass and I put it right over his head."  </P> <P> Agoura (10-4, 2-1) got three goals from Driscoll and two from Jason Stelle.  Royal countered with two goals from Hood and Jack Kocur. Templeton, Will  Spencer and Mike Radka also added goals for the Highlanders.  </P></p>

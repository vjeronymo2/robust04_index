This is a major move to change the management mechanism in  the industry.    The guild will be established in the first half of this  year.  It will be a medium organization between the government and  enterprises and undertake administrative affairs of the  non-ferrous metal industry upon the trust by the government.    The China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation,  which used to control both the administrative and economic  affairs of enterprises, will become a holding company to  undertake the tasks of managing the state assets of all the  enterprises in the industry by way of controlling shares or by  participation or by running solely owned enterprises. It will  bear limited liability for the losses or bankruptcy of  enterprises.    The holding company will send directors and supervisors to  enterprises to supervise the management of state assets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- A Tokyo district court  judge rejected again Wednesday [13 April] a request for bail  from former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura to allow him  to vote for a new prime minister.    Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday  on the grounds he might destroy evidence.    Nakamura asked Tuesday to be freed on bail so he can take  part in a Diet vote to pick a successor to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation last  Friday over financial dealings.    No date has been set for the Diet vote yet. [passage  omitted]</p>

Qualified, designated agents of the State would be permitted to perform the IA testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. All testing personnel and laboratories would be required to be qualified using State procedures. It is anticipated this provision will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The State Highway Agency's (SHA) central laboratory would be required to become accredited by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Accreditation Program. It is also anticipated this provision will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable, but the FHWA may issue a final rule at any time after the close of the comment period. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file relevant information in the docket as it becomes available after the comment closing date, and interested persons should continue to examine the docket for new material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The FHWA, at 23 CFR 637, currently has regulations covering sampling and testing. The proposed revisions would merely update these regulations to accommodate contractor-performed sampling and testing and reinforce existing policy. Therefore, it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal and a full regulatory evaluation is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this proposal on small entities. The FHWA concluded that this action would in fact provide some small testing firms with an opportunity to perform more work than was allowed by the previous regulations. Although the regulation would have a positive impact on these testing firms, the number of firms affected would be small and the amount of additional work would be insignificant. Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction.

It does not constitute a major action having a significant effect on the environment, and therefore does not require the preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation Identification Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A regulation identification number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations.

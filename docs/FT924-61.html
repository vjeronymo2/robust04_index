			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: High-style pulp for a holiday mood A FEW GOOD MEN (15) Rob Reiner THE BODYGUARD (15) Mick Jackson When American freedom and democracy are in peril, the red telephone rings in Hollywood. National Security gets straight through to Central Casting and ensures that the right man gets the right job. But this has been the holiday season - no one at the right desks - and for a while it looked dicey for two rival crises. These were the Guantanamo Bay Murder Enquiry and the Save Whitney Houston Project. Regarding the first: Who shall we get to confront the suspected villain in Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men? He is Colonel Jack Nicholson and he might have ordered the covert murder of a young Marine who was privy to a border shooting incident in America's Cuban base. Now the murderers are on trial, the Colonel is involved and we need a handsome, Galahadish lawyer to expose him. Sounds like a job for Kevin Costner, last seen pleading for Western democracy and fresh supplies of glycerine in JFK. But then Costner could be saved for the title job in Mick Jackson's The Bodyguard. Lean, macho, all-American, with that Mogadon whine of a midwest voice, Costner is an ideal co-star for glamorous black singer-turned-actress Whitney Houston, here stretching herself in her first straight role to play a glamorous black singer-turned-actress. Rachel Marron (Houston) is under threat from an assassin who sends hate mail. She will only make it to the climactic Oscar ceremony if a brave man protects her all the way. National Security's first casting thought was Tom Cruise - but this might have meant Nicole Kidman in blackface as the singer. So why not give Cruise the courtroom brief in A Few Good Men (no romance) and Costner the mission to control Houston? Twenty minutes of red telephone work and Washington is satisfied. Whether filmgoers will be is something else. These two movies are high-style pulp from a writer (Lawrence Kasdan on Bodyguard) and a director (Rob Reiner on A Few Good Men) who should know better. Reiner for a while seems to know better. Adapting a play by Aaron Sorkin that ran for so long on Broadway that everyone forgot how close it was to The Caine Mutiny, he freshens it with fleet-footed staging and star acting. Cruise is in fifth gear from the start as the Navy lawyer hero, a playboy-cynic who plea-bargains his way through courts and into female colleagues' beds. Only Lt Commander Demi Moore declines to recline. She wants him to wake up, grow up and take on the case she is investigating about a Marine base shooting. Meanwhile, out there in Cuba, Jack Nicholson's teeth and medals are flashing as if he were the Devil dancing in the pale moonlight. A Few Good Men is potholed with predictability. Are we meant to doubt that Cruise will come good? Or that Cruise and Moore, though they never clinch, will exchange starry-eyed looks at the close? Or that Nicholson, the man with chips on his shoulders to go with the scrambled egg, will be the Fiend Behind It All? Somehow the film still rattles along, taking us with it like onlookers whose coat-tails are caught in the tread of a tank. Cruise and Nicholson perform their pre-fabricated roles as if they thought they were fresh off the drawing-board: the youngster all face-cracking eagerness and wisecracking zeal, the oldster dipping his grins in sulphur and his rage in saltpetre. As for director Rob Reiner, he still has enough loose-change humanism from earlier (better) films like When Harry Met Sally to give this juggernaut the occasional jingle of wit, charm and spontaneity. The Bodyguard is in more serious trouble. For forty minutes it is sleek as a Chandler thriller. Into that existential beyond called Beverly Hills comes ex-White House protection agent Frank Farmer (Costner). Yes, he admits he failed to save Reagan from near-assassination back in 1980-whatever. But he was off-duty at the time and anyway a pop star is not a President. So Costner and Houston meet, put up the barred gates and video cameras and then  -still 90 minutes to go - fall in love. As anyone knows who has been a bodyguard, you cannot guard someone and fall in love. Your eyes will melt into theirs; you will use your samurai sword romantically to slice in two their blue silk scarf as it flutters from the ceiling; you will make passionate love: you will not, in short, be on the qui vive. So the difficulties accumulate. Costner and Houston try to escape being shot by going North to stay with his Dad. But Houston's sister is shot. They escape South to the Oscars, but Debbie Reynolds is nearly shot. Finally it is time for Costner to hurl himself across Houston's body as bullets ping and to perform (almost) the ultimate sacrifice. British director Mick Jackson (LA Story) treats the twenty-year-old screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Body Heat) as a licence to print funny money. The Bank of Hollywood currency is here in full, fearlessly counterfeit circulation. The glutinous close-ups of multi-million-dollar stars; the richly twaddlesome supporting roles sketched in by Gary Kemp (PR person), Thomas Arana (suspect psycho) and Michele Lamar Richards (shot sister); and the satyriastic crane shots that plunge and soar all over the heroine's pink-washed, super-rich mansion. But like A Few Good Men the film is never unwatchable: whenever credibility flags incredulity takes over. These are movies to start the year happily. Things can only get more sensible, but who begrudges a few hours of holiday mood before they do?</p>

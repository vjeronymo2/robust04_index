			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Pakistan calls off talks with donors PAKISTAN last night called off a planned annual meeting with international aid donors as the country's political crisis prompted a review of economic policy-making. The caretaker government appointed on Sunday to replace the dismissed administration of Mr Nawaz Sharif postponed the talks just hours before a delegation was due to leave for Paris to meet representatives of donor organisations, including the World Bank. Mr Sharif's two-year-old government was sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who also dissolved the national assembly and promised elections within three months. The government said the talks were being postponed 'in view of the political change'. It said: 'The compulsion of the economic problems that have been inherited by the caretaker government calls for a full assessment of the present economic situation and the formulation of an appropriate response to restore financial balance. This is expected to create a more conducive environment with the aid-donor community.' Mr Ishaq Khan has accused Mr Sharif's government of economic mismanagement, as well as corruption, over-spending and mishandling an extensive privatisation programme. But it is not clear what changes, if any, the caretaker government will make. In the past, frequent changes of government prevented Pakistan from trying to maintain some continuity in economic policy. The economy in the year to June is expected to grow by just over 5 per cent in line with previous years' perfor-mance. Mr Sharif's government has allowed the budget deficit to grow above its target of 5 per cent of national output and it is likely to be about 7 per cent this year. Mr Sartaj Aziz, Mr Sharif's finance minister, told the FT yesterday that he expected continuity in policy-making. 'I'm sure the new (caretaker) government will carry on talking to donors and trying to attract foreign investors,' he said. Mr Sharif's dismissal came the day after a televised speech in which he accused the president of conspiring to overthrow him. Mr Ishaq Khan's move was the climax to an increasingly acrimonious struggle between the two men about the appointment of a new army chief, over Mr Sharif's attempts to secure the leadership of the Pakistan Moslem League, Pakistan's largest party, and over Mr Sharif's attempt to curb the president's powers. Party leaders yesterday started preparing campaigns for elections. Mr Sharif, who hails from Punjab province, announced he would travel by train from Islamabad to Lahore, the Punjab capital, stopping along the way to campaign. The degree of support the dismissed prime minister can command in his home province is seen as crucial to his political future. Meanwhile, supporters of Ms Benazir Bhutto, leader of the opposition Pakistan People's party, said they were delighted at the opportunity to fight Mr Sharif at the polls.

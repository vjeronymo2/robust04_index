			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Dolphin slips 4% to Pounds 3m Both volumes and margins came under pressure at Dolphin Packaging in the final four months of 1991, according to Mr Moger Woolley, chairman. As a result, pre-tax profits at this plastic packaging manufacturer slipped 4 per cent, from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 3.03m. The company, which moved up to the main market in August, had largely flat sales of Pounds 27.8m (Pounds 28.1m). Earnings were 10.59p (10.89p) per share and the final dividend is maintained at 2.8p for an increased total of 4.5p (4.3p). The company has Pounds 1.3m cash in the bank. Mr Woolley said Dolphin was refuting the claim from DRG Plastics and adequate provision against it had been made above the line.</p>

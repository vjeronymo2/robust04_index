			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Merchant bankers feel pinch as public takeovers dwindle ONLY FIVE merchant banks advised on UK public takeovers worth more than Pounds 1bn in 1992, underlining the slump in the industry, according to figures released by Acquisitions Monthly. This compares with nine financial advisers last year and 17 in 1989, regarded as the vintage year for takeovers. A further five advisers in 1992 worked on deals worth less than Pounds 100m and still made the top 20 ranked by value of transactions. Albert E Sharp, which was placed at number 20 in the table, worked on two deals together worth only Pounds 18m. Last year's number 20, Hambros Bank, worked on five deals, valued at Pounds 167m. For the first time in eight years no US bank made the top 20. Last year Goldman Sachs came third, with two other US banks represented. SG Warburg finished top financial adviser, followed by Schroders, Samuel Montagu, Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild. The value of public bids completed in 1992 fell to Pounds 7.5bn, compared with Pounds 10bn in 1991 and a record Pounds 55bn in 1989. Mr Philip Healey, Acquisitions Monthly editor, estimates that around 200 corporate financiers lost their jobs. 'It is very cold out there for unemployed bankers,' he said. Most companies were unable to launch bids if they could not afford to finance them from cash. There were, however, notable exceptions, such as the Tomkins' recommended Pounds 935m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery group. Mr Healey believes banks can no longer rely on clients to remain automatically loyal to financial advisers. T Cowie, the motor group, replaced its merchant bank, Noble Grossart, in favour of NM Rothschild earlier this month, following its failed Pounds 32m bid for the Henlys Group. However, most heads of corporate finance believe the second half of 1993 will pick up with more mergers and acquisitions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Normal life in Karachi remained affected today.  Reports of sporadic incidents of shooting and arson have been  received from various areas of Karachi East and the central  district. The troublemakers set at least six vehicles on fire,  damaging them. According to PPI, a press note issued in Karachi  says eight people sustained bullet wounds; two of them  subsequently died. Many business centers and industrial  establishments were closed. Traffic was light, particularly in  the central and eastern districts. The press note says the  situation was brought under control with the help of the rangers  and the police. Some arrests have been made, and the police  have registered cases and started investigations.    The district magistrate of Karachi South has enforced  Section  144 [banning assembly of more than five persons] throughout the  district. There have also been some incidents of violence and  disruption of law and order in Hyderabad.    In Karachi, a spokesman of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP]  appealed to the civilian population of the Sindh to resolve the  situation and support the provincial government in its attempts  to eliminate terrorism, so that peace is restored to the Sindh  and hatred eliminated. He said the negative politics of the  Muhajir Qaumi Movement [MQM] has created enmity between itself  and other communities, causing serious damage to the Muhajirs,  besides creating serious economic difficulties for the residents  of Karachi and Hyderabad. The people want to eliminate these  problems.    The spokesman said the Army operation was started not by the  PPP but by the previous government. He said the terrorism to  which MQM leader Altaf Hussain is referring is of his own  creation and he should clear the charges against him in court.  The spokesman added that the Nawaz Sharif government and not  the PPP government is responsible for the excesses mentioned by  Altaf Hussain.</p>

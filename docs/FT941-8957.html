			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Public sector surplus hits low: Pounds 50bn PSBR forecast questioned The public sector had a net surplus of Pounds 1.6bn in January, as the government benefited from seasonal payments of corporation tax. The surplus was the lowest recorded January figure since monthly statistics began to be published in 1979, and was well below the Pounds 2.4bn expected by the market. The total public sector borrowing requirement for the first 10 months of financial year 1993-94 was Pounds 30.2bn, compared with Pounds 21.5bn in the same period for 1992-93. Analysts said the full-year forecast was likely to be lower than the government's forecast of Pounds 50bn. Corporation tax revenues were Pounds 4.94bn in January, compared with Pounds 5.27bn in January 1993 and Pounds 5.61bn in January 1992. Analysts said that social security receipts at Pounds 3.5bn (compared with Pounds 3.67bn in January 1993) and income tax receipts at Pounds 12.6bn (compared with Pounds 12.4bn in January 1993) were lower than expected. One other factor affecting the January figure was a Pounds 1.2bn payment to the European Union, resulting from a change in the timing of member states' contributions. All three components of the public sector - central government, local government and public corporations - had surpluses in January, of Pounds 1.02bn, Pounds 350m and Pounds 268m respectively. Privatisation proceeds were negligible. Central government's January cash receipts were Pounds 22.8bn, and outlays were Pounds 21.7bn. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'Net departmental outlays were very weak. Departments are over Pounds 5bn underspent for this time of year. We should expect a spending surge over the next two months as departments rush to spend allocated money.'</p>

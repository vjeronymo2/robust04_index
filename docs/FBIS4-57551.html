			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Rondan in Mercedes] </F>   [Excerpt] Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella has  announced the establishment of an organization for the  development of our region. CODEFRO [expansion unknown] will be  established as a binational agency within six weeks. The  municipalities on the Uruguay River will join the foreign  ministries.    Foreign Minister Di Tella on 11 May told the Uruguay River  mayors that within six weeks the CODEFRO binational agency will  be established under an agreement with the Argentine Government.    The Argentine and Uruguayan municipalities will play a very  important political and technical role in this organization,  because they, along with the foreign ministries, will be  executive committee members.    The CODEFRO project, sponsored by the Inter-American  Development Bank, will therefore be implemented. It represents  the crowning of two years of work by the Planning and  Negotiations Committee, which represents five Uruguayan  municipalities and seven Argentine municipalities. It also  represents a pilot project in Latin America in the field of  regional integration, and a subsystem within Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] planning. [passage omitted]</p>

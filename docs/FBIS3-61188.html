The Kuban: </F> Typical Characteristics in Typical Circumstances"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Territories </H5>   The broad (about 30 cm wide) and deep (three stories) crack  in the wall of the KUBANSKIY KURYER building has been gaping  there for a month already. The reasons, the objective, and the  perpetrators of the terrorist act are still unknown, but the  result is known: At that time a 20-year-old proofreader at the  newspaper died on the spot under debris falling from above.  Local authorities expressed alarm and sympathy, law enforcement  organs swore to find the perpetrators and punish them, and  democrats added one more item to their list of communist crimes.    The unpoliticized majority of Krasnodar residents recalled  this apotheosis of the election campaign with sarcasm and  cynicism: "Even the Decembrists were unable to blow up the  newspaper properly: For some reason they placed the bomb in the  men's john...."  <H5>  Personalities </H5>   The elections in Kuban were a competition among three  individuals, and they were by no means Gaydar, Zyuganov, and  Zhirinovskiy. Vying for places in the senate were titans of  local significance, each of whom had managed to be the master of  Krasnodar Kray and become a symbol of a certain epoch.    The decades of socialism and kolkhoz construction in the  Kuban--Nikolay Kondratenko, chairman of the kray executive  committee, and then chairman of the kray soviet, who was  overthrown in August 1991 for supporting the State Committee for  the State of Emergency.    The troubled present of "gradual reforms" and quiet  privatization without unnecessary competitions--the present head  of the kray administration, Nikolay Yegorov.    The unrealized romantic dreams of members of Democratic  Russia from the "living circle" of the times of the 1991  putsch--Vasiliy Dyakonov, who became governor after the fall of  Governor Kondratenko but who remained in the post little longer  than a year. Mr. Dyakonov remained in the people's memory  because of his mass farmerization (17 farmers appeared in the  kray and there was stiff resistance to decollectivization on the  part of the rest of the population) and his attempt to maintain  the minimum prices of bread in 1992--by collecting fees from  tobacco and alcohol trade in the Kuban. The management blunders  for which Mr. Dyakonov was removed are a material fact, but it  is no less of a fact that his dismissal was persistently  achieved by the kolkhoz leaders and the tobacco and vodka  directorate.    Nonetheless, according to the assessment of the current head  of the kray soviet, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy (who ran on the  Yabloka ticket), the contest for senate seats included "not so  much ideologists as clans." Once united into a single  party-economic elite, the chiefs now--with the disappearance of  the oblast committee supervision--have recognized the  differences in their branch interests. And they have not yet  been able to achieve an awareness of their common regional  interests which would join the local elite together with a new  glue in a subsidized, slowly privatized Krasnodar Kray.    Nikolay Kondratenko ran in the elections as a representative  of the "agrarian clan" of kolkhoz chiefs. Nikolay Yegorov was  supported by another part of the agrarians, managers, and those  who had their eyes on the ports, borders, and other transit  capabilities of the kray. Among his assets were long-standing  ties with Vladimir Shumeyko and Viktor Chernomyrdin and more  recent ties with Sergey Shakhray. Having gained the sympathy of  the president's administration, the head of a powerful  construction trust Vasiliy Dyakonov competed with the mayor of  Krasnodar, Yevgeniy Samoylenko.  <H5>  The Fight </H5>   Mr. Kondratenko and Mr. Yegorov became members of the  Council  of the Federation.    The first winner was clear long before the elections: The  rating of "Ataman Kondrat," who seemed to have retired from  politics, had not dropped below 40 percent among Kuban residents  during the past year. Mr. Kondratenko contemptuously rejected a  proposal to withdraw in exchange for the position of head of the  tobacco joint venture with the Philip Morris firm: A senator's  position guarantees more magnificent prospects.    The main contest was for the second position--because of it  a  scandal broke out throughout all of Russia when the local  election committee refused to register Mr. Dyakonov as a  candidate, and it ended with the dismissal of the election  committee chief Yuriy Lapkin.    The opposing teams accused one another of gaining signatures  through pressure on their subordinates, direct falsification of  signatures, and forgery when they were being verified....    The position of the local Russia's Choice candidates was  explained most clearly by the activist Lyudmila Belova, who up  to this point was grateful to Vasiliy Dyakonov for the fact that  it was during his governorship that her family was granted its  own farm with 100 hogs: "All leadership is playing dishonestly.  But the higher the leadership, the greater possibilities it has  of doing this. Dyakonov has the least." Indeed, on 12 December  (after campaigning had already been prohibited) at the doors of  the electoral precinct of the kray hospital I encountered only  two placards--of Governor Yegorov and Mayor Samoylenko. On the  other hand, there is also a particle of truth in the words of  the press secretary of the kray soviet, Galina Kravchenko: "If  Dyakonov were from another bloc and not from 'Choice,' would  Moscow really have raised such a stink?"  <H5>  Zhirinovskiy </H5>   Predictions have persistently given the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] second place in Krasnodar Kray. "It  will get no higher: Unlike 'Choice' and the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation, they actually have no organizations  here," the Krasnodar sociologist Viktor Kritskiy assured me. In  the end the party outdid both the Communists (twofold) and the  members of Russia's Choice (fourfold). As discussions with local  residents showed, most of those who voted for the LDPR did it  "out of spite"; before 12 December few people even thought about  the party slates: The elections remained elections from local  families. "I just found out about all of these parties--at the  precinct," a 40-year-old housewife, Tatyana Boyko, confided to  us.    Local journalists doubt that Zhirinovskiy's victory in  points  really means an increase in his influence in the party in the  kray: LDPR activists have nothing to do with the local elite. In  conservative Kuban up to this point--and in the foreseeable  future--things will be decided by the leadership. And up to now  no one political force really has the required reserve.  <H5>  Cossacks </H5>   More than a million of the kray's population of 5 million  consider themselves to be Cossacks. In the Cossack villages (and  essentially more than half of the Kuban residents live in rural  Cossack villages) they still distinguish Cossacks from  "foreigners." "If a person could really rely on the Cossacks he  would undoubtedly become a leader in the Kuban," thinks  Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy.    There is no question of the authority of the current Cossack  structures. Homegrown politicians with Cossack striped trousers,  the majority of whom are city residents ("a real Cossack tills  the soil"), have already managed to split into "red" and "white"  Cossack troops. One group contains several thousand and the  other--several hundred. The "whites" were openly in favor of  Dyakonov, and the "reds" were cautiously in favor of  Kondratenko. But both of them demanded "purging the Kuban of  unwanted guests."    The traditional Kuban anti-Semitism is more of a theoretical  nature: Barely 3,000 Jews live in the kray. The main "foreign  enemy" is from the Caucasian Mountains. Since the beginning of  the war in Transcaucasia the 350,000 local Armenians living here  since Potemkin's times have been augmented by more than 100,000  refugees from Armenia. The Russians, of whom there were twice as  many among the refugees, have somehow been able to blend in with  the local population. Armenians, the majority of whom have set  up successful businesses, constantly feel the hostility of their  neighbors and attacks from politicians. The latter, naturally,  never miss a chance to gratify their supporters loudly and  freely. During the last campaign the triumphant Nikolay  Kondratenko attacked the "outsiders" especially openly.    "In the neighboring Stavropol Kray it has already started:  The Cossacks have been beating up Armenians at the bazaars and  kicking them out of their homes. Let me tell you--the Kuban is  on the brink," a chap standing in front of the main Krasnodar  market admitted. Incidentally, Konstantin Zatulin built his  entire campaign in the south of the kray on the demand to set up  a strong border between the Caucasian republics. In the opinion  of the sociologist Kritskiy he would inevitably have won on this  if the well-known Communist, the cosmonaut Sevastyanov, had not  ended up as his opponent.  <H5>  Prospects </H5>   Head of the kray administration Nikolay Yegorov gives  himself  special credit for "achieving political stability," by which he  means mainly elimination of the conflict with the Council. After  coming to the Council of the Federation Mr. Yegorov still  retains the governor's post, but the prospects for "stability"  are still not so clear.    Elections to the new kray parliament have been scheduled for  6 March. The current leader, Aleksandr Zhdanovskiy thinks that  "the party will be, to put it mildly, much more progressive than  the Council," and Nikolay Kondratenko is sure to occupy the  position of its chairman.    Incidentally, one of Mr. Yegorov's closest advisers, the  head  of the Kuban innovation fund, Konstantin Vlasyuk, states that  this will not mean a change in the politics in the kray:  "Kondratenko's influence was greatly affected by the fact that  he had been out of office for three years."    The administration has no way out other than to localize the  activity of the new local legislators: In the first place, the  openly subsidized Kuban, whose budget "could not be saved even  by a single-channel system," is in no position to spoil  relations with the Kremlin. In the second place, in the words of  Mr. Vlasyuk, "the kray has attracted the attention of serious  investors": for example, the main buyer at the auction in the  Novorossiysk port (with its oil transfer terminal) was the  Lukoyl Company. Many are also attracted by the stand of valuable  redwood in the Caucasian foothills.    "The problem of the agrarians is that their sphere of  influence remains within the kray. Ours is arising anew,"  asserts Konstantin Vlasyuk. "Our current task is somehow to  convince the people close to the president of the Russian  Federation that if Kondratenko and Yegorov win in the elections,  the kray would not become a Russian Vendee. We can agree on  everything to everyone's satisfaction."</p>

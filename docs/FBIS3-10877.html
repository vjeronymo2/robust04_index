This is a demonstration of the armed institution's efforts to  improve civilian-military relations.    General Ernesto Corado Figueroa, former defense minister,  said at the close of the event: "For the first time in El  Salvador's history an education course with civilians has been  established to analyze aspects of security, defense, and  development that will have an important impact within society."  Corado added: "This demonstrates that the Armed Forces can  work together with the people for the nation's well-being,  despite the ideological and partisan differences."    The general explained that this course is part of the  education efforts and restructuring that are taking place in the  armed institution in times of peace. For Corado,  civilian-military relations were significantly marred during the  12-year armed conflict. After the signing of the peace  agreement, however, the need to improve relations was  acknowledged.    In this regard, the changes made by the armed institution  have allowed the promotion of participation -- under equal  opportunities -- of civilian and military personnel in projects  of national interest linked to the nation's development and have  lead to strengthening harmonious coexistence, the general noted.    Alfredo Cristiani, president of the Republic and Armed  Forces  general commander, was present at the graduation ceremony.  Cristiani highlighted the Defense Ministry's effort by providing  a course that sets an example for the overall handling of  national leadership. "The new reality prevailing in the nation  demands top level preparation in all fields; the Armed Forces  are contributing to the consolidation of peace," Cristiani said.    Likewise, the School of Strategic High-Level Studies  yesterday inaugurated the second running which will include 36  students who represent the government, the Armed Forces, the  private sector, universities, political parties, and the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front].    Ferman Cienfuegos, FMLN member said: This course has a  historical transcendency because for the first time after the  war, civilian and soldier are united; this will contribute to  constructing a national consensus. Cienfuegos indicated that  the armed institution is changing because it no longer is  manipulated by the political parties. This is a very important  precedent because the Armed Forces are state institutions  currently at the service of the people.    The first running of Strategic High-Level Studies initiated  in September 1993 falls within the framework of the new Armed  Forces Education System, according to the constitutional reform  passed in April 1992.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Japanese take a walk on the wide side - The new TV format that has taken the industry by surprise One of the hottest items on the shopping list of any self-respecting Tokyo techno-buff is a television set which would seem more at home in the spacious lounges of 1950s Las Vegas than the ascetic apartments of 1990s Omote-Sando - a wide-screen. Wide-screens are conventional TV sets with unusually wide screens: designed in the same proportions as those in cinemas. They might look like throwbacks to the 1950s, but they have taken the Japanese market by storm since their launch two years ago. One in five TVs bought in Japan this year will be wide-screens, according to the Electrical Industry Association. By the end of the century they will be in nearly every Japanese home. The wide-screen is now making its debut in Europe to coincide with the introduction of new-generation TVs made to the Pal-Plus standard that significantly improves picture quality. Nokia has already launched the first wide-screen Pal-Plus set, and Sony, Philips and Grundig are about to follow, in the hope that Europeans will embrace wide-screen as their format for the late 1990s. The speed with which wide-screen has taken off in Japan came as a surprise, not least to the consumer electronics industry. The first wide-screen sets were introduced three years ago, but were seen by Sony, Sanyo, Matsushita, Sharp and other leading manufacturers as little more than an interesting alternative to the popular big-screen sets that might attract a cult market of film buffs. After all, there is nothing special about the technology behind the wide-screens now on sale in Japan. They function like ordinary TVs but will, eventually, be able to relay higher-quality images for broadcast programmes when Japan's new Extended Definition Television (EDTV) service starts next year. In the meantime, the only real advantage for viewers is that, thanks to the wide-screen's special 16:9 dimensions, they can watch movies on video in their original cinematic scale, rather than the cramped version usually used on TV. To the innovation-obsessed Japanese electronics industry, wide-screen seemed far less interesting than a more elaborate and expensive development that came to the market at about the same time: high-definition TV, or HDTV. The industry confidently expected that HDTV would create a lucrative new market by becoming the TV format for the 21st century. In technology terms, HDTV is far superior to wide-screen. However, its development has been dogged by regulatory rows, pricing problems and software shortages. The regulators have yet to decide when it will be launched in the US or Europe. At present it is available only in Japan. The industry, anxious to exploit its exciting new technology, rushed HDTV on to the Japanese market in the early 1990s. Sales have been disappointing. Only 10,000 systems were sold in 1992 and the same number in 1993, according to the EIA. Things have picked up this year, but sales are only expected to total 30,000. This reflects efforts to reduce prices. Matsushita's Panasonic subsidiary has slashed the cost of its HDTV systems from Y2.5m (Dollars 25,500) to Y550,000 - still more expensive than conventional TVs, given that a standard Panasonic 21-inch set costs Y130,000. But the main problem for HDTV is dearth of programming. At present it is restricted to 10 hours of test broadcasts a day. This is not expected to improve significantly until Japan's new HDTV service is introduced in 1997. Most manufacturers are resigned to waiting until then to try to recoup their investment. Some, such as Sanyo, are redirecting their efforts away from the consumer market to selling HDTV as an educational and promotional medium to museums and companies. Meanwhile, wide-screen, originally treated as HDTV's poor relation, has prospered. And there is no shortage of software. For years there has been a cult market among Japanese film-buffs for 16:9 video versions of particular movies, notably Ridley Scott's Bladerunner. Most video stores now stock films in standard and wide-screen format, enabling consumers to get the full benefit of wide-screen when watching movies on video. The market should receive another boost with the launch of EDTV next year, enabling broadcasters to be more inventive with programmes, particularly when filming sport. The number of wide-screens sold in Japan has risen rapidly from 60,000 sets in 1992 to 300,000 last year and to an estimated 1.5m this year. The EIA forecasts continued growth for the rest of the 1990s, with wide-screen becoming Japan's dominant format by 2000. The industry is now waiting to see whether wide-screen catches on in Europe, where HDTV's prospects are still clouded. Earlier this year Sony introduced two wide-screen sets to the European market. Both use the old Pal format, rather than Pal-Plus, yet Sony says sales are well ahead of initial targets, auguring well for the launch of its first Pal-Plus sets in January. 'We see wide-screen as the next big step forward for the European television market,' says Sony Europe. 'But we're also realistic. It's very unusual for a new product to sell as quickly anywhere else as it does in Japan.'</p>

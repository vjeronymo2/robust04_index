			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Sport: Laughter in the rain - Derek Lawrenson on a downpour that washed away the worries of the world's top players / Open Golf THE RAIN that fell in biblical proportions on the eve of the Open saved the tournament from being decided by the luck of the bounce. The waters doused fairways so hard that cruel bounces would have been the rule rather than the exception. When the championship began, an entire flock of mentally scarred golfers suddenly discovered they could think straight again. In some instances, this had not been the case for months. Now the taut facial muscles softened, the smiles returned. The consequence is that the Open goes into its final two rounds with the strong possibility that it could be one to remember. Was there one heart among the 28,000 spectators who risked fractured limbs on Thursday, walking along rolling hills made treacherous underfoot, that did not swell as Severiano Ballesteros remembered how it felt to be young again? And what about Greg Norman, or Fred Couples, or Mark Calcavecchia, or Jack Nicklaus? What a thrilling coincidence that they should all come up with an answer to their indifferent form at the same time. What has made the first half of the event even more of a joy is the contrast it offered to the sense of foreboding that hung over the proceedings on Wednesday afternoon. Players rarely moan in advance about conditions. There is no sense in placing yourself two down mentally before striking a ball in earnest. But the fairways at Royal St George's do not roll gently in front of a player as they do, say, at Muirfield or Birkdale. They are covered in small pimples of turf and when these are baked motorway-hard by months of hot sun then the element of chance rises to unhealthily proportions. Then there are the blind shots. Norman, who stands 6ft 2ins, reckons there are 14. Asking a player to hit a blind approach shot and pitch it 40 yards short to take account of the wind and the scorched earth and then hope for a kind bounce places fate too highly up the list of questions that a prospective Open champion should be required to answer. The wet stuff changed all that, and when yesterday brought a stiff westerly breeze, the correct balance had been restored and the tournament was placed back in the hands of the shot makers. Bernhard Langer and Couples, two players who easily fall within that definition, were the first players to make their presence felt yesterday. This was a tad surprising because on Tuesday, Couples had said he had no chance of winning, and on Wednesday, Langer had said he had little chance either. Couples admitted that sloth had got the better of him. He used to be a couch potato in his college days until his wife, Debbie, gave him the proverbial kick up the backside. But Debbie hitched up her mini-skirts last year and moved on and Fred has been buried ever since in divorce paperwork and re-runs of old American TV sit-coms. 'With everything that's been going on, I've just been a bit lazy,' he said. The Open was to be merely the start of a return to serious competition, but the American possesses a natural talent that borders on the outrageous and so removing the layers of rust is not the problem it might have been for others. Birdies tended to come in pairs for Couples yesterday. At the second and the third, for example, and the 12th and the 13th. At the 16th he had an 8ft birdie putt that brought the course record of 64 within his compass. But he missed it and dropped shots at the 17th and the 18th holes. Still, he finished with a 66, and an eminently useful six-under-par total. Not bad for someone with no chance. Langer arrived at an official function on Tuesday evening looking like someone had strapped a plank of wood to his back. Guardsman straight wasn't in it. He said that his neck was still troubling him and his ball striking was not as he would like, and so naturally everyone who likes a bet and who possessed this inside knowledge put large amounts of money on him. In every great golfer there is the touch of the hypochondriac. Hence the cliche: beware the injured golfer. Mental bruising is far more difficult to cure. Watch Ballesteros and Norman on the practice ground and they hit drives that do not deviate by more than 10 yards either left and right. Contrast that to the play itself. Ballesteros's opening drive in the championship was in the thick rough. His drive to the 17th was almost as wide as it was long. He told a glorious fib afterwards, saying he had only missed three fairways but who cared because his short game provided vivid reminders of the most sublime talent we shall ever see. They even came out of the hospitality units. For the first time in an Open, these have encroached along the 18th fairway. They are still a discreet distance from the action and do not encroach on spectator paths. It is not like a tacky sponsored event. All the same, let us hope this is not the thin end of the wedge. A piece on the Open without a mention of the man who has given new meaning to the words daily papers? That would be a novelty. John Daly's day will come, but not this time. This weekend the more experienced shotmakers will dominate TV screens. The week began with stories about Payne Stewart's enlarged heart. With so many good players in contention, a big heart will be quite an asset tomorrow.</p>

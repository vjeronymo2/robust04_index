			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN TELEVISION SETS STAGE FOR TERRORISTS, EXPERT SAYS  </P> <P> Terrorism isn't a pretty subject. It evokes images that are at once horrendous  and deadly, but also enormously dramatic and compelling.  </P> <P> Indeed, argues Alex Schmid -- an international expert on terrorism who was at  UC Irvine on Wednesday for a lecture -- these hijackings, kidnapings, bombings  and related violence are tailor-made for prime time TV.  </P> <P> This is especially true, he said, for prolonged acts of terrorism, such as the  1985 Shia Muslim hijacking of TWA Flight 847 and the international bargaining  that led to the release of 39 American hostages more than two weeks later.  </P> <P> "This was television (coverage) at its fastest, most exciting and competitive  -- and theatrical in a storytelling sense," said Schmid, a political scientist  at the State University of Leiden in the Netherlands, in an interview at UCI's  Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies.  </P> <P> But, he said, the American television coverage of the Flight 847 drama was  typically too simplified, too keyed to pure emotions and subjected to the needs  of "commercial news values" and high audience ratings.  </P> <P> The Flight 847 incident, said Schmid -- a specialist in international media  coverage of terrorism -- became "a theater of terror" and a series of  "terrorist spectaculars" for American audiences.  </P> <P> This kind of coverage, he said, demonstrates the peculiar relations between the  media and terrorists.  </P> <P> "It's been said the terrorists manipulate the media. But it can also be said  these are examples of mutual manipulation," he added. "I tend to subscribe to  the argument that the media in many cases inspire and encourage terrorism --  that the media can be the oxygen which terrorists need to stay alive."  </P> <P> The 46-year-old, Swiss-born Schmid lectured on "Terrorism and the Media:  Freedom of Information vs. Freedom From Intimidation." It was the latest  segment in the first program of its kind in Orange County -- a nine-lecture  series on the nature and impact of terrorism throughout the world.  </P> <P> Usually the Center for Global Peace and Conflict Studies, a multidiscipline  program formed six years ago at UC Irvine, concerns itself with nuclear  disarmament, Soviet society, American foreign relations and defense policies,  and international peacemaking organizations, said center director Keith Nelson,  a history professor. The center does not have specific studies or research on  terrorism, Nelson said.  </P> <P> "But terrorism, obviously, is an exceptionally timely topic and -- because of  the hostages and other incidents -- a now familiar one for many Americans,"  Nelson said. "The field is also related to another of our center's research  concerns -- public opinion and the role of the media in matters of conflict."  </P> <P> During his visit to UC Irvine, Schmid focused on those he calls "insurgent  terrorists," such as the Shia Muslim militants in the 1985 TWA hijacking.  </P> <P> He said such acts, including bombings in public places, are in effect "war  crimes but committed in times of peace." These are "unprovoked violent attacks  against non-combatants" who are "randomly chosen or who are seen by terrorists  as symbolic or representative targets."  </P> <P> And these terrorists, above all else, need -- and exist on -- media attention.  "In other words, a new kind of violence has come about in the last two decades  -- a kind of violence which is performed in order to be reported," Schmid said.  "If it is not reported, it cannot be successful.  </P> <P> "These terrorists try to conquer space in the papers and on the airwaves. They  are waging a media war," Schmid said. "The attention that a mere handful of  terrorists get through perpetrating atrocities gives them status -- a negative  status in the eyes of many -- but status, nevertheless."  </P> <P> In Schmid's mind, American television often comes across as too eager, at times  even too accommodating, in covering terrorism.  </P> <P> This is particularly true of the commercial networks, where the "marketing  advantages" are obvious, Schmid maintained. "The terrorist stories possess the  kind of highly personalized drama that translates into higher ratings," he  said.  </P> <P> "It has been said -- with some exaggeration -- that terrorism is so ideally  suited to television that the medium would have invented the phenomenon if it  had not already existed."  </P> <P> Under these criteria, the Flight 847 hostage crisis, which dominated the news  for weeks, couldn't have been better for the American networks, Schmid said.  </P> <P> "It became a situation where television itself, including the (network)  anchormen, became participants -- acting as go-betweens for the American  government and the terrorists," he said.  </P> <P> The relentless daily coverage was a crucial factor in pressuring the Reagan  Administration to seek the release of the 39 American hostages, Schmid said.  One American, a serviceman, had already been killed by the hijackers, who had  forced the flight from Athens to Lebanon.  </P> <P> "It was a case of television diplomacy at work," said Schmid of the outcome --  the exchange of the Americans for 700 Shia Muslim militiamen held prisoner in  Israel.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he argued, the television accounts were critically lacking in  depth. Coverage "was much too simplified, keyed almost totally to the most  emotional levels of its viewers," Schmid said. He also noted that fast-breaking  technology of television lends itself to greater pressures for "obtaining  scoops" and to less time for assessing and editing the immense flow of  information.  </P> <P> "It is time we realize that we should not have our minds captivated by messages  of intimidation which are administered to us under the guise of information,"  Schmid said.  </P> <P> "I do not deny that there is a place for reporting violence in our societies,"  Schmid said. "Yet I think that an attempt should be made by the media to  distinguish between genuine violence -- which would have taken place anyway --  and histrionic violence aimed at audience manipulation. Whenever the latter is  suspect, coverage should be minimal."  </P> <P> To this end, Schmid contends that some kind of "code of ethics" could be  adopted by the media that contains "some restraints" on coverage but would not  conflict with the First Amendment.  </P> <P> "Between a total blackout on one hand, and saturation coverage on the other,  there is room," Schmid added, "for reasonable compromise."  </P> <P>  The three remaining lectures in the terrorism series, presented by the Center  for Global Peace and Conflict Studies, are: April 11, Robert Kupperman, Center  for Strategic and International Studies; April 25, Christon Archer, University  of Calgary, and May 23, Richard Falk, Princeton University. All 8 p.m., UCI's  Physical Sciences Lecture Hall. Call (714) 856-6410 or 856-5000 for ticket  information.  </P></p>

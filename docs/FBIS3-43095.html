Sukach, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences </F> Institute of Semiconductors, Kiev, Ukraine]    [Abstract] The effects are examined of neutron irradiation  on changes of the distribution profile of zinc atoms in gallium  lattice points (Zn[.sup]Ga[/]), previously generated by  thermal diffusion. Thus, this work deals with establishing the  relationship between the irradiation dose F and the boundary  shift of previously generated p-n-junction. Light emitting  diodes (LED) based on GaAs[.sup]1-x[/]P[.sub]x[/] (x=0.37  - 0.41), obtained by zinc diffusion were examined. Depth of the  p-n- junction in the initial LED was W[.sup]0[/]=  2.5+/-0.5m. Control of changes in the position of the  p-n-junction with irradiation (F = 10[.sup]10[/] -  5x10[.sup]13[/] cm[.sup]- 2[/]) was performed by analyzing  dC/dV- characteristics. Changes in the zinc distribution profile  and expansion of the compensated region with increased F were  recorded, indicating that the p-n-junction boundary is shifting  into the n-region. Curves were obtained showing the relationship  between the value of the p-n-junction boundary shift as a  function of F. Figures 2, references 7 Russian.</p>

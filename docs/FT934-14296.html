			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Chambers demand substitute for BES THE Business Expansion Scheme should be replaced by 'a scheme more in line with helping small businesses', The British Chambers of Commerce says today in its Budget submission to the government, Alan Pike writes. The chambers accept that the 10-year-old scheme has offered 'little help for potential start-up businesses'. But rather than being abolished with no replacement - as the government intends - there should be new arrangements which help to stimulate interest among small investors. Chambers of commerce representatives will meet Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, tomorrow and stress the need for next month's Budget to demonstrate support for the small business sector. The chambers' other specific proposals include improving the loan guarantee scheme, lowering export guarantee scheme premiums and freezing mortgage tax relief and personal allowances as part of the drive to control public expenditure. Its Budget submission argues that if value added tax is introduced on items currently zero-rated, the change should be phased in.</p>

The  a-boron samples analyzed were metallic boron films,  whisker-like, and fiber prepared by thermal chemical vapor  deposition (CVD),[.sup]1[/] and fine powders deposited at  ambient (room) temperature by a laser-induced dielectric  breakdown (LIDB) reaction.[.sup]2[/] It was found that the  SRO structures as observed on the reduced RDF's,  G(r)[.sub]obs[/]'S, gave similar undulations to those derived  from the _b_-rhombohedral boron structure regardless of the  differences in their appearance and growth conditions.    In the present work, we have studied by using the same  method  the following various types of a-boron different from those  described above:    i) Reddish brown powders of Moissan boron[.sup]3[/]  produced by Mg metallothermic reduction of boron oxide: MTR.    ii) Metallic thin films deposited at 530C at low  pressure as 0.1 Pa (7.5 x 10[.sup]-4[/] torr) of a mixed gas  of B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]+H[.sub]2[/] (30% in  B[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]6[/]) by the electron cyclotron  resonance (ECR) plasma CVD method[.sup]4,5[/]: LPCVD.    iii) Metallic thin films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/]  torr) from sintered Moissan boron by irradiation of electron  beams (acceleration voltage: 4 kV, I[.sub]emis[/]:  110 mA): PVD.    iv) Dark brown films vacuum deposited (10[.sup]-6[/]  torr) by laser ablation of metallic boron (ND:YAG laser, 10 Hz,  pulse energy: 0.1 J, pulse width: 4ns): LPVD.    The SRO structures of a-boron here obtained are almost the  same as those published previously. Thus the SRO structure of  a-boron does not depend on the preparative methods and the boron  sources. These remind the term ``Ideal'' amorphous  state.[.sup]6[/] The SRO structure is  recapitulated[.sup]1[/] that the a-boron has a short range  order in that the B[.sub]12[/] icosahedra are linked along  their pseudo-fivefold axes with a rotation of up to /5 with  respect to each other (out of phase).

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Crystals which have different crystal regularity in two or three main directions are said to be anisotropic. They have a different index of refraction in each of the main directions. When such a crystal is inserted between the crossed polars, the field of view is no longer dark but shows the crystal in color. The color depends on the properties of the crystal. The light acts as if it travels through the crystal along the optical axes. If a crystal optical axis were lined up along one of the polarizing directions (either the polarizer or the analyzer) the light would appear to travel only in that direction, and it would blink out or go dark. The difference in degrees between the fiber direction and the angle at which it blinks out is called the angle of extinction. When this angle can be measured, it is useful in identifying the mineral. The procedure for measuring the angle of extinction is to first identify the polarization direction in the microscope. A commercial alignment slide can be used to establish the polarization directions or use anthophyllite or another suitable mineral. This mineral has a zero degree angle of extinction and will go dark to extinction as it aligns with the polarization directions. When a fiber of anthophyllite has gone to extinction, align the eyepiece reticle or graticule with the fiber so that there is a visual cue as to the direction of polarization in the field of view. Tape or otherwise secure the eyepiece in this position so it will not shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the polarization direction has been identified in the field of view, move the particle of interest to the center of the field of view and align it with the polarization direction. For fibers, align the fiber along this direction. Note the angular reading of the rotating stage. Looking at the particle, rotate the stage until the fiber goes dark or ``blinks out''. Again note the reading of the stage. The difference in the first reading and the second is an angle of extinction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The angle measured may vary as the orientation of the fiber changes about its long axis. Tables of mineralogical data usually report the maximum angle of extinction. Asbestos forming minerals, when they exhibit an angle of extinction, usually do show an angle of extinction close to the reported maximum, or as appropriate depending on the substitution chemistry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4.5.

This is characteristic of birefringent materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The color depends on the difference of the two visible indices of refraction and the thickness of the crystal. The maximum difference available is the difference between the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0024 unknown -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  axes. This maximum difference is usually tabulated as the birefringence of the crystal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this test, align the fiber at 45 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; to the polarization directions in order to maximize the contribution to each of the optical axes. The colors seen are called retardation colors. They arise from the recombination of light which has traveled through the two separate directions of the crystal. One of the rays is retarded behind the other since the light in that direction travels slower. On recombination, some of the colors which make up white light are enhanced by constructive interference and some are suppressed by destructive interference. The result is a color dependent on the difference between the indices and the thickness of the crystal. The proper colors, thicknesses, and retardations are shown on a Michel-Levy chart. The three items, retardation, thickness and birefringence are related by the following relationship:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> R=t(n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=6 f=4 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> _n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=6 f=4 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R=retardation, t=crystal thickness in &mu;m, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> n <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=6 f=4 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> , <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=6 f=4 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =indices of refraction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Examination of the equation for asbestos minerals reveals that the visible colors for almost all common asbestos minerals and fiber sizes are shades of gray and black. The eye is relatively poor at discriminating different shades of gray. It is very good at discriminating different colors. In order to compensate for the low retardation, a compensator is added to the light train between the polarization elements. The compensator used for this test is a gypsum plate of known thickness and birefringence. Such a compensator when oriented at 45 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; to the polarizer direction, provides a retardation of 530 nm of the 530 nm wavelength color. This enhances the red color and gives the background a characteristic red to red-magenta color. If this ``full-wave'' compensator is in place when the asbestos preparation is inserted into the light train, the colors seen on the fibers are quite different. Gypsum, like asbestos has a fast axis and a slow axis. When a fiber is aligned with its fast axis in the same direction as the fast axis of the gypsum plate, the ray vibrating in the slow direction is retarded by both the asbestos and the gypsum. This results in a higher retardation than would be present for either of the two minerals. The color seen is a second order blue. When the fiber is rotated 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; using the rotating stage, the slow direction of the fiber is now aligned with the fast direction of the gypsum and the fast direction of the fiber is aligned with the slow direction of the gypsum. Thus, one ray vibrates faster in the fast direction of the gypsum, and slower in the slow direction of the fiber; the other ray will vibrate slower in the slow direction of the gypsum and faster in the fast direction of the fiber. In this case, the effect is subtractive and the color seen is a first order yellow. As long as the fiber thickness does not add appreciably to the color, the same basic colors will be seen for all asbestos types except crocidolite. In crocidolite the colors will be weaker, may be in the opposite directions, and will be altered by the blue absorption color natural to crocidolite. Hundreds of other materials will give the same colors as asbestos, and therefore, this test is not definitive for asbestos. The test is useful in discriminating against fiberglass or other amorphous fibers such as some synthetic fibers. Certain synthetic fibers will show retardation colors different than asbestos; however, there are some forms of polyethylene and aramid which will show morphology and retardation colors similar to asbestos minerals. This test must be supplemented with a positive identification test when birefringent fibers are present which can not be excluded by morphology. This test is relatively ineffective for use on fibers less than 1 &mu;m in diameter. For positive confirmation TEM or SEM should be used if no larger bundles or fibers are visible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

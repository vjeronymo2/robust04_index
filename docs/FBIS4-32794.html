			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the </F> National Assembly of the People's Government, by PRENSA LATINA  correspondent Javier Rodriguez; place and date not given]    [Text] Havana -- An extensive conversation with Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP] (parliament) of Cuba, gives us the opportunity  to look into the reality of the operations at this unique  organization, which plays an ever more important role in the  country's day-to-day political life.    The issue can be stated simply: How does the island's  congressional apparatus work? Apart from the formal tasks an  entity such as this must carry out, it has other special  characteristics, as a consequence of the political system the  Cubans have adopted.    Addressing this issue inspired both interviewee and  interviewer, especially when one takes into account that  Alarcon, who expresses himself with ease, has an accumulation of  experience as a diplomat, a negotiator for his country in  difficult international situations, and a representative at the  United Nations.    He is now one of the main players in what could be called  the  modernization and recognition of the special role the Caribbean  nation's legislative body plays in such an exceptional moment in  its history. On this, Alarcon outlined the following  conclusions:    In a modern world and for the first time, only socialism can  offer us the opportunity of executing and examining how to  exercise the authority of the people, within the characteristics  of a more complex society.    He adds:    The only way to do this is to develop a system, with new  formulas every day -- an infinite multiplication of the  parliament -- in an effort to enhance the relevance of direct  democracy.    In referring to the ideas of a celebrated Austrian author,  Alarcon cites the theory of making society a part of the  legislative body, as an effective way of involving every citizen  of a nation in the decisionmaking processes, which concern  precisely them.    The way to reach this essential level of participation is to  expand the assembly's activity through collective and continuous  discussion, everywhere, and not by annulling it. There is, he  adds, very recent proof of this theory in the parliaments of the  workplace. These assemblies studied the viability of the latest  measures taken to cleanse the economy.    More than 80,000 meetings at an equal number of workplaces  across the nation took place during the last few months in Cuba.  Workers in the areas of production and services, as well as the  members of student, peasant, and women's associations, discussed  the current national economic situation.    Alarcon explains that the national, provincial, and  municipal  deputies participated in these meetings. This allowed them to  come to the extraordinary session of the ANPP with an impressive  amount of information about the people's opinions regarding such  important issues.    The deputies came to the assembly after having spent many  more hours examining the issues in question than any other  deputy on the face of the earth has ever dedicated to any issue.  Furthermore, millions of people participated in the meetings  and debated something that in other countries is never brought  before the people at all.    For our interviewee the key to this whole matter is to  develop this concept of democracy. This, in the end, will make  the people true participants; a subject of society and not just  a passive object, who is only invited to participate in the  process every once in a while to put a ballot in a ballot box.    In one part of the conversation, Alarcon pauses and  strongly criticizes the so-called Western representative  democracies, which he described as true democratic fiction,  removed from the people's interests.    The tendency among the population of the countries with that  system is electoral shyness characterized by not voting because  it increasingly makes less sense to do so. You can count on the  fingers of one hand the times an elected candidate meets with  those who voted for him so as to be held accountable before  them, he said.    Regarding his country, Alarcon said it has the possibility  of  playing out a true democratic ideal in a society based on human  solidarity and equality, improving the mechanisms for the  effective participation of its citizens.    It is impossible to gather all 11 million Cubans at the same  time, but it is possible to do it throughout a process, a  difficult mechanism, which requires a dose of creativity and  originality. The process preceded the decisions made by our  assembly regarding the strengthening of the national finances.    The method used to implement these types of things is  already  being practiced in the ANPP's daily work, in its various  entities, including the permanent commissions, and Alarcon  explains it by listing specific examples.    As for the education budget problem, the education  commission  did not limit itself to giving its opinions and to approving the  proposals made by the corresponding ministry, but practically  visited all schools in the country, closely observing existing  problems and providing solutions to them.    The services commission paid special attention to matters  related to the tourism industry, which is being completely  expanded in the country, and to self-employment, including  existing regulations and their observance.    The defense commission did its work based on the observance  of the guidelines of the struggle against crime, currently of  great interest to the entire population, as well as based on the  implementation of Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry  instructions for the decrease of budget expenditures on the  military.    The supervision of the food program, in a programmed and  continuous manner, is also part of the work of the parliamentary  commission members, who review the situation during visits to  production centers and participate in the analysis made by the  Agriculture Ministry.    Another important example is that of the legal and  constitutional affairs commission, which is currently working on  the discussion of a citizenship law, for which it is collecting  opinions, not only among the appropriate organizations but even  with representatives of Cubans living abroad.    The work carried out by the commissions has an interesting  ingredient since they were created because each one of the  commissions has representatives of all Cuban provinces, which  gives a national vision to the statements and agreements  submitted to the ANPP plenum.    An important part of the current work has to do with the  process initiated on the control and supervision on the use of  the national budget at the various levels, the results of which  have been a series of ideas and initiatives aimed at reducing  expenditures and increasing state revenues.    According to Alarcon, this activity must contribute to the  strengthening of the country's finances and the elimination of  the budget deficit, an effort carried out with a dose of  creativity by the municipal and provincial assemblies of the  People's Government.    The representativeness claimed by other systems is only  fictitious, and we hope that in Cuba, we can increasingly  develop the exercise of a true and direct democracy, the ANPP  president concluded.</p>

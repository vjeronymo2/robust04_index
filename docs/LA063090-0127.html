			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLUES TO ARSONIST'S IDENTITY SOUGHT;  </P> <P> INQUIRIES: THE DEVICE THAT SPARKED SANTA BARBARA BLAZE WILL BE TESTED FOR  FINGERPRINTS. IN FULLERTON, A PSYCHIATRIC EXAM IS ORDERED FOR A TRANSIENT HELD  IN THE CARBON CANYON FIRE.  </P> <P> An incendiary device used to ignite a fire in Santa Barbara that claimed one  life and more than 500 homes has been shipped to a laboratory for fingerprint  testing, but investigators said Friday they are not "even close" to finding the  arsonist responsible for the most destructive Southern California blaze in at  least three decades.  </P> <P> "We don't have a person or a car we can focus on right now," said Thomas E.  Buckley, a U.S. Forest Service agent participating in a 12-member interagency  task force investigating the blaze on Santa Barbara's western edge.  </P> <P> "We're basically trying to follow up all the leads, but we're not even close,"  he added.  </P> <P> From San Diego to Santa Barbara, investigators were feverishly seeking  witnesses and other clues to this week's wave of disastrous fires in which  arson is suspected in at least nine cases. The state fire marshal's office is  assisting local investigative efforts.  </P> <P> In Fullerton, Peter Diaz Reyes, a 29-year-old transient suspected of starting a  fire in Carbon Canyon on the Orange-San Bernardino County line, was ordered  Friday to undergo psychiatric evaluation.  </P> <P> Reyes, who was arrested Wednesday near the fire, told investigators the blaze  broke out while he was cooking.  </P> <P> Reyes appeared briefly in Municipal Court in Fullerton, where Judge Margaret R.  Anderson continued his arraignment until Monday and appointed a psychologist to  examine him. She set bail at $250,000.  </P> <P> The fire, which damaged or destroyed 14 houses and blackened more than 6,600  acres, was "completely contained and all but out now," Orange County Fire  Department Capt. Dan Young said Friday.  </P> <P> In Santa Barbara meanwhile, authorities said it would take three to 10 days to  receive the lab results on the incendiary device found at the fire's point of  origin at Highway 154 and Old San Marcos Pass Road. They gloomily noted that  fingerprints would be of no use if the arsonist has no arrest record.  </P> <P> Investigators declined to describe the device for fear of jeopardizing the  criminal case. "We want to nail this guy," said Charles Johnson, spokesman for  the county Fire Department.  </P> <P> If the investigation succeeds, police will seek to have the arsonist prosecuted  for murder in the death of Andrea Gurka, 37, whose body was found in a creek  bed behind her home on Old San Marcos Pass Road, Santa Barbara Sheriff's Sgt.  Jan Bullard said.  </P> <P> The Forest Service's Buckley said two arson investigators happened to be nearby  when the blaze erupted Wednesday evening and were quickly able to locate the  fire's point of origin before it could be disturbed. They were also able to jot  down the license plates of about 20 cars in the area, he said.  </P> <P> Rewards totaling $120,000 have been offered for information leading to an  arrest and conviction in the Santa Barbara fire. The Personal Insurance  Federation of California said Friday that it would match a $50,000 reward  offered by Gov. George Deukmejian. At least another $20,000 has been raised by  a local radio station and a crime prevention group. Anyone with a tip can call  1-800-782-7463.  </P> <P> In Glendale -- where fire destroyed at least 46 homes and damaged more than 20  before being controlled Wednesday -- investigators said they had pursued more  than 20 leads without success.  </P> <P> Three two-member teams were checking leads and trying to find owners of several  cars that were reported to have been in the area when the fire began on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> In San Diego, where investigators attributed six out of 11 fires that plagued  the area this week to arson, matchbooks were found at two sites.  </P> <P> Staff writers Bonna M. De La Cruz, Sebastian Rotella and Doug Smith and  correspondent Tom McQueeney contributed to this story.  </P></p>

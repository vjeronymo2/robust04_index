			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Arts: Dedicated to the Great Bore - An exhibition about the 'Channel Tunnel' of its day MARC Isambard Brunel, father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is hardly known except to those familiar with the annals of civil engineering. And yet Marc, a refugee from the French Revolution, was easily his son's equal and rather more successful. His greatest project is commemorated by The Triumphant Bore a modest but interesting exhibition in the basement of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great George Street, London SW1. The Thames Tunnel, 150 years old this year, was a technological feat which was the wonder of Europe. Linking Rotherhithe to Limehouse, it was the Channel Tunnel of its day. Indeed, the Channel Tunnel would be inconceivable without tunnelling machines which derive ultimately from Brunel's discovery of the shield method of driving tunnels. The inspiration behind Brunel's patent of 1818 was the ship-worms he watched boring away at Chatham Dockyards. Like the Channel Tunnel, Brunel's tunnel went way over budget and took far longer than expected, 20 desperately difficult years. It was only achieved because of Brunel's unswerving dedication. Lives were lost (at one point very nearly young Isambard's) whenever water poured into the workings. The Thames was like an open sewer and tunnel sickness caused fatalities or suddenly sent men blind, sometimes permanently. Brunel's struggle to build and finance the tunnel makes an inspiring story, well written up in the catalogue (Pounds 6). In 1837, we find Brunel noting that the shield was moving across the treacherous riverbed 'at the breadth of one halfpenny per day.' He himself worked tirelessly beside his miners amid the stench and constant threat of disaster. Not surprisingly, he suffered a stroke but Queen Victoria rewarded him with a knighthood. The exhibition's drawings and plans are for the more technically minded visitor but I was interested by the tunnel souvenirs. Peeperamas show what an enjoyable venue the tunnel was at first, with its bright lights and stalls selling beer, gin and souvenirs. Among the memorabilia are transformation prints, pottery, engravings, cheroot cases, alabaster peep eggs, needlecases and the like. The opening of the Triumphant Bore was an extraordinary success; in one month it attracted half a million visitors. However, it gradually became the resort of East End lowlife, public interest waned and The Times started to call it the Great Bore. Only with the coming of the railways was Brunel's wonderful achievement at last put to good use. Channel Tunnel shareholders will note with wry amusement the reason for the Thames Tunnel's financial failure. 'Funds were never available to meet the expense of constructing the approaches for carriages and wagons. This derived the tunnel of much of its original purpose . . .' The Triumphant Bore runs until the end of August and is sponsored by James Howden &amp; Company. August is your last chance to see the Firle Van Dyck currently on loan to the National Gallery. (The gallery is open until 8pm every Wednesday evenings through August.) Van Dyck painted this monumental portrait of the Count of Nassau-Siegen, his wife Ernestina de Ligne and their four teenage children in Brussels in 1634. The turncoat Dutch nobleman had defected to the Catholic side and become a great figure at the court of the Spanish archdukes. The count dominates the picture, dressed soberly in black like his wife although Van Dyck's brush brilliantly suggests the sumptuousness of the fabrics. Their children stand before them, pretty in their bright colours. The eldest daughter holds a rose, Venus's flower, in one dainty hand. She wears virginal white and follows her father in looking full face at us, her audience. Perhaps, then, this portrait is a dynastic statement and the young lady is demanding our approbation for her filial obedience. This graceful and important picture is just back from cleaning and conservation which is the reason for its presence in London. It is the first project tackled by the newly formed Heritage Conservation Trust. Under the rules of this charitable trust, grants are made for conserving pre-eminent works of art in privately owned historic houses. The works must then be displayed in a public gallery for a period and thereafter be accessible to the public. For those wishing either to give or receive, the Trust can be contacted at 071-259-5688. Firle Place itself is near Lewes in east Sussex and is open through the summer; it sounds enticing, moreover there is a Connoisseurs Day on the first Wednesday of each month.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS BEGINS WITH THE NATION'S HOMELESS;  </P> <P> COUNT: 15,000 FAN OUT FOR MONUMENTAL OVERNIGHT TASK. MANY MEET DIFFICULTIES.  INCOMPLETE TALLY IS EXPECTED.  </P> <P> The 1990 United States census began Tuesday night on a somber note, as census  takers set out to measure the size of a successful nation's conspicuous failure  -- its population of homeless citizens.  </P> <P> With a budget of $2.7 million and a staff approaching 15,000, the U.S. Census  Bureau attempted to count on one night a population that has been estimated to  number anywhere from 250,000 to more than 3 million. Census takers went to  11,000 shelters and an equal number of outdoor haunts, from heating grates in  New York City to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park; from river banks in Colorado  to "spider holes" -- man-made burrows in Southern California canyons.  </P> <P> In Orange County, more than 200 census takers fanned out for the homeless  tally, checking about 500 different spots that ranged from shelters and  flophouses to freeway underpasses and hillside encampments of migrant workers.  Although no figures were available from the count Tuesday, previous estimates  have placed Orange County's homeless population at 10,000.  </P> <P> The monumental effort marked the first time the census has counted homeless  people separate from the rest of the population, most of whom are to receive  census forms in the mail later this week.  </P> <P> Counting the homeless was not expected to go smoothly, and it didn't.  Throughout the day, there were glitches and missed opportunities by the score.  </P> <P> In Vermont, 22 inches of snow slowed the count. In Detroit, there weren't  nearly enough census takers to take inventory of the army of squatters living  in the city's 10,000 abandoned buildings. There were plenty of people who  refused to be counted, and a few who caused consternation by the answers they  gave to the census.  </P> <P> In New York City, there one man who insisted he was Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> "He was nice and cooperative," said census taker Craig Lebin, "but he kept  telling me he was married to God."  </P> <P> Census officials conceded their count of homeless people was not expected to be  complete.  </P> <P> At a Washington press conference Tuesday, Census Bureau director Barbara Bryant  said that while the homeless count wouldn't be exhaustive, it will "get the  vast majority . . . these numbers will be believable. Is it hundreds of  thousands? Is it millions? We're going to show that kind of scope."  </P> <P> Byrant herself, however, encountered evidence of flaws in the counting. She  toured New York's Port Authority bus terminal, where she found at least 100  homeless persons -- but no census takers to count them. Bryant promised to  dispatch counters Wednesday night  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, John Reeder, head of the Census Bureau's California operations,  said the count would be a "conservative" one.  </P> <P> Reeder said that the bureau was prepared to continue counting homeless every  night this week if it became apparent Tuesday that there were more homeless  people than the census takers could handle.  </P> <P> He made it clear census takers would not take certain risks.  </P> <P> "We are not going on rooftops, looking in abandoned cars or peering into  dumpsters," he said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the novel exercise was shaping up as an all-night, national  spectacle.  </P> <P> In San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the census takers, wary of ambush, planned  to keep to the park's lighted perimeters, calling out for any homeless persons  hiding in the bushes to come forward and be counted.  </P> <P> In the nation's capital, wary homeless advocates were attempting to thwart the  census, refusing to allow counters inside a shelter where more than 1,000  homeless were said to have congregated.  </P> <P> In Detroit, several homeless people telephoned the Census Bureau from the  office of a wrecking company, where they said they had broken in to spend the  night. They invited census takers to come out and count them. Five enumerators  were dispatched, and the survey was completed with the promise that police  would not be informed of the countees' whereabouts.  </P> <P> And in Los Angeles, buses were being hastily arranged to haul homeless from the  rougher streets of South-Central to armories and emergency shelters for  counting.  </P> <P> Reeder said that six units of U.S. Naval Reserves would be patrolling the  streets of Los Angeles to help ensure the safety of census takers.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we are concerned about security. We cannot take police because it  would breach confidentiality," he said. But he added that there would be an  increased police presence on the streets of the city while the homeless census  was in progress.  </P> <P> Security in Orange County was less intense. Census officials briefed police  departments, but there were no unusual measures taken and no problems reported  by late Tuesday.  </P> <P> In big cities, small towns and everywhere else American homeless congregate, it  was clear Tuesday evening that the census takers had their work cut out for  them. Finding the homeless posed one major difficulty, persuading them to  cooperate was another.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of people who won't be counted, and I'm one of them," said  Arthur Young, 34, a resident of the streets and shelters of Orange County since  October. "I don't feel like they need to know a thing about me. They're not  doing anything for me."  </P> <P> Young said he didn't believe the count would be accurate. Walking outside the  YMCA in Santa Ana, he pointed to homeless people sleeping on a ramp around a  building that disappeared into darkness.  </P> <P> "I know they won't be counting there" because of the potential danger, Young  said. "I wouldn't go there myself."  </P> <P> In Houston, a ponytailed young man named James, who declined to reveal his last  name, said the census takers' questions "stunk. A lot of the questions didn't  apply to us -- like 'Are you here on business or vacation.' "  </P> <P> Toni Davis, 32, worried that census questions would probe too deeply into her  past. Davis said that she and her husband were prospering from a methadrine  lab, allowing them and their five children to own a house, "until we were  arrested." She said that the census form asked "whether we had income from this  or this. They didn't ask about illegal activities," she said with a sigh of  relief.  </P> <P> The all-night homeless census took place in three phases. From 6 p.m. to  midnight, census takers went to armories, shelters, missions, church basements,  flop houses and hotels that cost $12 or less a night.  </P> <P> Between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., the effort focused on bus stations, night owl  theaters, subways, bridges, highway underpasses and the myriad outdoor  locations favored by the homeless.  </P> <P> In the final phase, lasting until 8 a.m., the census takers were to station  themselves near dumpsters and abandoned buildings, waiting to interview people  as they emerged in the morning light.  </P> <P> Census Bureau officials said that people found asleep on the streets were not  to be wakened. Instead, census takers were to note their presence and try to  guess sex and race.  </P> <P> California presented a host of challenges to census takers who were responsible  for canvassing streets and parks frequented by gangs and drug dealers as well  as making their way to the river banks, canyons, beaches and orange groves that  provide hide-outs to the rural homeless.  </P> <P> Despite the obstacles, the homeless count was the most ambitious ever  undertaken. To entice the homeless to come in out of the cold and be counted,  emergency shelters were opened around the country. Soup kitchens offered free  dinners and shelters gave away blankets to people who showed up Tuesday.  </P> <P> Traveling in teams, carrying walkie-talkies, wearing uniform vests, census  takers attempted to count people in every city with a population of 50,000 or  more and in smaller cities where local governments provided lists of homeless  habitats.  </P> <P> Cindy Taeuber, who coordinated the nationwide homeless census from the bureau's  Washington headquarters, said she was more confident of the accuracy of  counting in shelters and other indoor locations and somewhat pessimistic about  finding people in the streets.  </P> <P> "We just haven't been able to come up with a reliable means of coming to grips  with the hidden homeless," she said.  </P> <P> As part of the homeless census, the Census Bureau funded monitoring operations  in five cities, including Los Angeles. The monitors were stationed in a number  of outdoor homeless enclaves to check whether census takers actually visited  those locations and to assess how diligent they were when they did visit.  </P> <P> The U.S. census is taken every decade. A decision on whether to count homeless  separately every decade has not been made.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau received widespread cooperation from shelters and homeless  advocates.  </P> <P> For instance, The Homeless Outreach Program in Los Angeles and Los Caballeros,  a businessman's organization, sponsored a dinner for 1,000 homeless people,  served them steak and pudding pie and urged them to take part in the census.  </P> <P> In Orange County, authorities set up temporary shelters in a pair of churches  to lure the homeless out of the cold and make it easier on census takers.  </P> <P> At Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton, counting took place in a  large auditorium-like room. Some of the 44 men who participated were given  sleeping bags as a gift for showing up.  </P> <P> "They are very friendly," said Ed Paul, 49, a revenue manager for the city of  Fullerton who is part of the city's census team. "This is an easier group to  deal with than, say, a lunch crowd if you've got monitor duty at a high  school."  </P> <P> In some cases misinformation about the census caused people to be left out.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica's Memorial Park, census takers arrived to count homeless  congregated at a temporary shelter only to discover that they had forgotten a  crucial tool: their pencils.  </P> <P> There also were protests by people who do not believe that a complete count is  possible and who believe that an undercount will be used to justify spending  cuts for affordable housing and for the social services that many homeless  people rely on.  </P> <P> In Washington, members of the Community for Creative Non-Violence dumped sand  in front of the Commerce Department's Herbert Hoover Building near the White  House and displayed a banner that read "Like grains of sand, the homeless  cannot be counted."  </P> <P> Just before 8 p.m., a contingent of census workers were turned away from a  shelter operated by the Community for Creative Non-Violence, an organization  formed by Mitch Snyder, one of the nation's prominent homeless advocates.  </P> <P> Snyder, who sees the homeless count as a political ploy to understate the  national problem, estimated that there were 1,400 people at the center in  northwest Washington. However, Snyder said that about 80 of the shelter's  residents filled out census forms, and he turned over the completed forms to a  Census Bureau official.  </P> <P> Census workers had mixed reports about the cooperation they were receiving from  the homeless. Mike Roberts, a census worker in Washington, said he encountered  hostility to the census among the city's street people.  </P> <P> "You've got a lot of folks out there -- even though there has been a lot of  attention to the count -- not wanting to cooperate," Roberts said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another census worker, Cheryl Marshall, said she sensed a different  spirit: "I think we're having a real good turnout judging from the phone calls  we've been getting from people saying they need more forms and materials."  </P> <P> In Sacramento, Stephen Switzer, a spokesman for the Sacramento Homeless  Organizing Committee, said he thought the count was likely to find only 15% to  20% of the homeless. Switzer said that many who live in the brush and on the  banks of the Sacramento and American Rivers have been intimidated by recent  police sweeps of their camps and would not emerge to take part in the census.  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Darrell Dawsey, Julio Moran  and Jocelyn Stewart in Los Angeles, Eric Bailey, Len Hall, Greg Hernandez,  Michelle Nicolosi, Tom McQueeney, John Penner, Laura Michaelis, Leon Teeboom in  Orange County, Jenifer Warren in Riverside, Daniel Weintraub in Sacramento,  Miles Corwin in Santa Barbara, Mike Clary in Miami, Lianne Hart in Houston, Jim  Heron Zamora in San Francisco, Louis Sahagun in Denver, Shawn Pogatchnik in New  York City, James Risen in Detroit, and Jason Johnson in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions for the Homeless  </P> <P> Census-takers seeking to count the nation's homeless Tuesday carried a list of  33 questions to ask of those who chose to cooperate. Among the questions were:  </P> <P> When did you come to the United States to stay?  </P> <P> Have you ever been on active duty military service in the armed forces of the  United States?  </P> <P> Do you have a physical, mental or other health condition that has lasted for  six or more months and . . . prevents you from working at a job?  </P> <P> Because of a health condition that has lasted for six or more months, do you  have any difficulty going outside alone (or) taking care of your own personal  needs, such as bathing, dressing or getting around inside the home?  </P> <P> How many babies have you ever had, not counting stillbirths?  </P> <P> When did you last work, even for a few days?  </P></p>

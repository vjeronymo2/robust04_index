For more than two weeks  Britain and Spain have been blocking the admission of Austria,  Sweden, Finland, and Norway because of a difference of opinion  about the size of the so-called blocking minority, that is, the  number of votes necessary to veto decisions in the EU Council  that have been approved by a qualified majority. HOSPODARSKE  NOVINY asked Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana to clarify  Madrid's position on this important issue.    [Sklenka] Ten EU member states are of the opinion that the  number of votes for the so-called blocking minority must be  increased in a corresponding manner from the current 23 to 27  along with the enlargement of the Union. This would de facto  maintain the present system, since, given the increase in the  overall number of votes in the EU Council from 76 to 90, the 27  votes necessary for the minority blocking of decisions would  mean the same as the 30 percent of all votes required until now.  Why, then, are Madrid and London impeding this logical course  of action?    [Solana] A question devised in such a manner does not give a  true picture of the overall problem of voting. Spain, in  essence, agrees with increasing the size of the blocking  minority to 27 votes. Nevertheless, it is necessary to take  into consideration that the number of votes of the individual  countries in the EU Council is determined by the size of their  population. Therefore, at the same time, we are trying to  stipulate that, if two so-called large countries and one small  country join together and these three states reflect the opinion  of at least 110 million people, the system of 23 votes should  apply as it has done until now.    [Sklenka] Spain has been strongly criticized for its  national egoism, in view of its uncompromising stance on  fishing, which twice held up the EU's negotiations with Norway,  and its current unconstructive attitude toward voting rights.  Madrid, along with London, is even being described as an  obstacle to the creation of a new European architecture.    [Solana] Our country has traditionally been one of the main  supporters of a united Europe.    Only a few states have done as much as Madrid for the  formation of the European Union. Our aim is not to slow down  the process of closer European integration; we are merely trying  to ensure that, given it, Spain's national interests are not  neglected.    [Sklenka] Nevertheless, some of the world's media are  saying, in connection with the negotiations on enlargement, that  in order to create a functioning federal Europe, it will be  necessary for the Union to ditch countries such as Spain and  Greece, which are an intolerable burden. They do not contribute  anything to the coffers in Brussels, and they only want greater  support. What is your view of such criticism?    [Solana] It is not true that we do not contribute anything  to the EU budget. Spain is even a net contributor, that is, we  put more into the communal coffers than we get back.    [Sklenka] In the countries of Central and East Europe, which  are interested in becoming fully fledged EU members in the near  future, there are -- nevertheless -- anxieties about Spain's  possible negative stance on expanding the Union eastward.    [Solana] These anxieties are absolutely unfounded. Madrid  generally supports the EU's gradual rapprochement with the East  European states. The countries of this region must realize,  however, that submitting the application itself does not mean  anything. The admission of each country is conditional upon  fulfillment of a whole series of political prerequisites and  macroeconomic indicators. Membership in the Union also means  giving up some national sovereignty and being subject to the  criteria of the political, economic, and monetary union. Since  this requires, among other things, the maximum possible  liberalization of the domestic market and the granting of equal  rights to domestic enterprises and their foreign competitors,  each applicant has to work out in advance what he will gain by  such a step and what he will lose by it. As far as the EU is  concerned, it will be necessary to reform the institutional  structures there further so that, given the larger number of  members, the Union maintains its ability to function and  operate. It is obvious, therefore, that the two sides have to  prepare thoroughly for such a step and time it so that the  actual admission of the East European states to the Union brings  mutual benefits. The EU's premature expansion toward the east  could do the countries there more harm than good.</p>

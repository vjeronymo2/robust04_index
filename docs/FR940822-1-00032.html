			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Guidelines are needed with respect to SSAB staffing and activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) SSABs should not report to licensees or be funded by licensees because this could compromise their effective use;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Membership should be restricted to ``citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest groups'' who reside in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local community; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The membership should include a representative of the site to which wastes are expected to be sent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to the need for additional community involvement, the Commission believes that the noticing requirements and the requirements to establish and use SSABs should be implemented as proposed in the NRC staff draft. The proposed termination of licenses and release of sites under conditions of restricted release involve issues (e.g., land restrictions) which could have unanticipated adverse effects on the local community. The Commission wants to be sure it has considered the views of affected members of the local community on these issues before making a decision on the licensee's request. These proposed provisions will provide an effective means to inform the affected licensees, local and state governments, and the NRC of these views. However, the Commission believes that an extension of the SSAB requirement to apply to cases involving unrestricted release is unnecessary and would impose an undue burden with little or no public benefit on a large number of licensees, many of which are small businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to delimiting the role and responsibilities of SSABs and providing guidance on SSAB staffing and activities, the Commission specifically requests further comment on these issues. After gaining experience with the formation and use of SSABs, it might be appropriate to reconsider the need for this guidance at a later date. Regarding the funding and control of SSABs, the Commission believes that licensees should provide the necessary funding as proposed. The proposed rule contains safeguards to ensure that the SSABs are not subject to licensee control. The licensee would be required to provide reasonable opportunity for all local affected parties to be represented on the SSAB. Meetings of the SSAB must be open to the public. The licensee must provide adequate public notice of the location, time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least two weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB become part of the licensing docket and will be available for public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to restriction of the SSAB membership to the local community, the intent of the provisions in &sect;20.1407(c) is such a restriction. Regarding the proposal to expand memberships of the SSAB to include a representative of the designated offsite disposal site, the Commission believes that the offsite disposal site is not relevant for consideration by the SSAB, because siting of the waste disposal facility involves a separate public process that, in part, recognizes that wastes will be transported to the waste facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Stability and Flexibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Most of those who commented on stability or flexibility provided in the draft rule said that a generic standard should be written to provide enough flexibility to account for actual risks associated with conditions peculiar to specific sites in protecting the public and the environment, and to select appropriate site-specific remediation methods. Some commenters said that the imposition of strict generic standards without flexibility might not provide an optimum protection strategy across the range of categories of licensees. Other commenters noted that the adequacy of flexibility provided under the draft proposed rule cannot be decided without the necessary guidance documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also recognizes the need for flexibility in applying these criteria because of constraints posed by site-specific conditions (e.g., geology, hydrology, meteorology, and radiation background levels) and to provide opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore, the proposed rule provides for site-specific implementation of the generic criteria. The Commission is publishing the NRC staff's working draft regulatory guidance along with the proposed rule which describes methods for site-specific implementation of the criteria. This working draft guidance includes conduct of site characterization and surveys, specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff to meet the 15 mrem/y TEDE limit, and modeling acceptable to the staff to develop more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site-specific values of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. ALARA Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on the ALARA concept were much the same as provided at the earlier workshops. Most public/environmental organization commenters stated that they do not trust licensees to make ALARA determinations. Industry and other commenters stated that they support the NRC's permitting them to make ALARA determinations and urged the NRC to continue to permit licensees to use site specific factors in making these determinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes that ALARA is a fundamental concept of radiation protection and is an important part of its decommissioning criteria. NRC guidance being issued in support of the rulemaking provides for the use of site-specific factors in deciding what levels should be achieved below the stipulated radiological limit. This guidance will be described in NUREG&hyph;1500 ``Working Draft Regulatory Guide on Release Criteria for Decommissioning; Staff Draft for Comment.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Demonstrating Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many submitting written comments urged the NRC to complete its guidance on acceptable methodologies criteria as soon as possible and to publish this guidance for comment before the rulemaking is issued for final public comment. Many commenters questioned the technical ability to demonstrate compliance with the proposed dose goals or limits in the staff's draft, or questioned the technical justification for such requirements, or said that there are no standards for demonstrations of compliance. Several others said that demonstrating compliance to the proposed dose goals or limits is impractical and will unnecessarily increase costs and volumes of low-level wastes generated during decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters said that there must be practical or objective guidance for demonstrating compliance. Some said that this guidance should be issued for review before the rule is promulgated. Some commenters raised questions on who makes the final decisions on demonstrating of compliance and by what means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested that simplified guidance (not requiring the use of modeling or consultants) should be provided for designated licensees who have only low levels of contamination or ``uncomplicated situations'' in their operations. Some commenters said that the public might more easily understand demonstration of compliance if alternative limits to the ones proposed were used. Several commenters said that compliance should be demonstrated by actual measurements and not just by modeling. Some commenters also suggested specific methodologies for demonstrating compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The capabilities for demonstrating compliance are considered in the GEIS and the RA which provide the technical basis for the radiological criteria in the rule. Guidance that is being issued for public comment in conjunction with the publication of the proposed rule will cover acceptable methods for demonstrating compliance, the use of simplified methods or practical derived measurements and measurements units, and verification by practical measurement techniques not necessarily requiring modeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the question concerning who makes the final decisions on whether the licensee has demonstrated compliance with the rule, the NRC or, as appropriate, the Agreement State will make this determination. Where necessary the NRC or Agreement State will conduct independent confirmatory surveys to ensure that the appropriate criteria have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Sites That Cannot Be Released for Unrestricted Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many public/environmental organization commenters stated that licensees should not be permitted to walk away from a contaminated site and that contamination should be removed to the extent that radioactive materials and radiation are indistinguishable from background. Many voiced opposition to any release of sites under restricted use conditions. This opposition was based largely on concern about the long term effectiveness of institutional controls to ensure compliance with the conditions for restricted release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters generally endorsed both the unrestricted and restricted release of sites. With respect to restricted release of sites, commenters:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Stated that the NRC should better define the circumstances which could qualify a site for restricted release;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

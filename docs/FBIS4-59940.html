			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic </F> revolution, in Tehran on 18 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] If the great Islamic ummah  throughout the world accepts that they have been negligent of  Islam, if the world Muslims admit that they have taken the wrong  road in following anti-Islamic powers, that they have erred in  accepting the corrupt and beguiling culture of the west. If  they own up to that, their path will be clear and they will be  able to reform themselves.    Global propaganda seeks to mislead nations so that they will  be unable to understand what is right and what is wrong. You  can see this propaganda, these scintillating global  advertisements, and hear these radio broadcasts, how they try to  publicize political matters, economic ideas, consumer goods, and  other similar things.    The Iranian nation, which succeeded in creating a  resurrection in this world, which succeeded in reawakening a  world, and managed to create a great transformation, this  nation's main secret for achieving this success lies in its  decision to alter its wrong and false route. This nation  realized that pursuing the line of the oppressors and tyrants  and the satanic kings is wrong and it is also wrong to remain  silent before them. This nation changed course from this wrong  path and as a result reached prosperity and salvation. The  Iranian nation has opened a path for other world nations to  follow. This path of yours is today desired, sought and pursued  by all the Muslim intellectuals, and by those who have an alert  conscience in the Islamic world. This is the path to salvation.  The path of salvation means liberating ourselves from imposition  and domination of arrogant powers.    Unfortunately some Islamic countries have not found this  path. Some Muslim nations have not been lucky enough to achieve  this success yet. The traitorous and corrupt leaders have not  allowed the nations to find their way.    About the problems facing the pilgrims in the hajj rituals  this year, what I can say at the moment is: I am very sorry to  see that some individuals are preventing the rise of monotheism  cry in the center of monotheism and next to the house of  monotheism. At the moment I do not wish to say anything about  the behavior of the Hijaz rulers and authorities. We are  waiting to see how they are going to treat our pilgrims.  Thousands of our people are there today and we are following  every minute detail of their problems. We hope that they will  complete their rituals, with the Almighty's help, in full  comfort and health before returning home. The authorities of  that place are dutybound to provide all means of comfort and  health, as well as the means to allow them to perform their  rights and rituals. This is their duty. We are waiting to see  whether they will perform their duty toward the Iranian pilgrims  fully and properly or not.    May Almighty God bless this auspicious occasion in the month  of Dhi al-Hajjah to all Muslims and particularly to our dear  people, our great and faithful nation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the </F> Bank of Russia, by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent Pavel  Lukyanchenko; place and date not given: "The `Artificial' Ruble"]    [Text] Since the beginning of January of this year  the exchange rate of the dollar has soared from 1,250 rubles [R]  to R1,627 and subsequently fallen to R1,565. Many people  attributed this sharp drop in the exchange rate to the collusion  of currency speculators who "are making billions from this  game." However, in reality the intercession, or currency  intervention, of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation was  the actual reason for the drop in the exchange rate. Why is such  currency intervention needed? What is the mechanism used? How  much does it cost us? Our correspondent, Pavel Lukyanchenko,  asked Aleksandr Khandruyev, deputy chairman of the Bank of  Russia, to answer these and other questions.    [Khandruyev] The essence of currency interventions that are  undertaken by the central banks of all countries of the world is  as follows: to keep the exchange rate of the national currency  within certain limits. To this end, the central state bank  either buys foreign currency on the currency exchange, thus  lowering the exchange rate of its national currency, or sells  foreign currency--as a result of which the exchange rate of the  national currency grows. The currency reserves of central banks  are far from always sufficient to support the exchange rate of  the national monetary unit, and in this case a devaluation is  effected, that is, it becomes cheaper compared to the dollar,  the deutsche mark, and so on.    [Lukyanchenko] How large are the currency reserves of the  Central Bank of Russia?    [Khandruyev] As of the end of the year they came to $4.4  billion.    [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific mechanism of currency  intervention?    [Khandruyev] If the demand for dollars on the exchange  exceeds supply, for example, if on a specific day demand comes  to $100 million while only $20 million is for sale, the Central  Bank puts up for sale the lacking $80 million. Therefore, on  this day the exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar does  not change compared to the previous trading session. This is  what artificial support for the ruble is all about; its meaning  is to prevent abrupt changes in the exchange rate, which always  have a detrimental effect on the condition of the economy and  price levels. However, since production continues to slump and  prices to grow in our country, we lower the exchange rate of the  ruble little by little. Of course, for a certain period of time  it is possible to sustain a greatly overstated exchange rate of  the ruble against the dollar. However, more currency needs to be  unloaded on the market in this case. Where does the currency go?  As a rule it is deposited in the accounts of the banks' clients,  and later often moved abroad. This is why your readers should  understand that it is not necessarily bad for the exchange rate  of the ruble to fall.    [Lukyanchenko] What is the specific size of currency  interventions by the Central Bank?    [Khandruyev] We do not divulge this in order not to whet the  appetites of currency speculators.    [Lukyanchenko] As I understand it, the currency reserves of  the Central Bank are virtually a dead weight. Why not make them  work actively for Russia? They say that at present $1 million  can be turned into $1.5 million in our country within one month.    [Khandruyev] Naturally, the currency reserve of the Central  Bank is placed abroad in the accounts of high-class banks, at  3-5 percent annual rates of interest. Only swindlers get 50  percent in our country. I strongly advise citizens against  getting involved with companies engaging in speculative  operations. High rates of profit are always accompanied by the  colossal risk of never recouping the invested funds.    [Lukyanchenko] They say that some Swiss banks exchange our  rubles into [hard] currency.    [Khandruyev] It is possible. There are various interests,  for  example, to maintain our embassy staff in Moscow--it is cheaper  to pay for outlays in rubles. Possibly they need money for  intelligence, too. However, in either case Western banks  exchange money at a rate that is not advantageous for the ruble.    [Lukyanchenko] My final question. Is it true that the  Central  Bank still exchanges even "Pavlov's" R50 bills?    [Khandruyev] It is. If an old woman comes to us and says:  "Boys, yesterday I found three bills in the pocket of the pants  of my late husband, and you know what kind of retirement  benefits I get...." Of course, for an old woman like this we  will exchange both "Pavlov's" and the recently withdrawn Russian  rubles. However, had she come to us with the same words and O.5  million of the old bills, this conversation would not have taken  place.  <H5>  Rumor Has It </H5>   Commercial circles are seriously concerned about leaked  information that a redenomination of the bills currently in use  at a ratio of 1,000:1 will be carried out soon, with the  exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble being  simultaneously set at 1:1, and that all private banks will have  their licenses to perform exchange operations with currency  revoked; these operations will become the prerogative of only  the Central Bank of Russia. A highly placed government official  whom we asked to comment on the rumor answered unambiguously:  "This is quite possible."</p>

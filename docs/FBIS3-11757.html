[Begin Plancher recording, in Creole] In 1991, Aristide's  Commerce and Industry Minister Jean-Francois Chamblain gave his  theoretical consent to the project. This clearly means the first  works should have normally begun, should have been in process.  The communal commission gave its support to the project. On 9  July, there was an authorization regarding the first step. This  means the project could have started. But we can say, despite  all those expenses made in this area by Port Tortuga S.A., there  is not yet any legal document authorizing Port Tortuga to  function properly in this area. So far, I am telling you, there  is no agreement. The Haitian state has not given its  authorization in a definitive manner for the start of the  project. [end recording]    It should be noted that the Port Tortuga S.A. matter was an  oustanding issue during the departure of [Commerce and Industry  Minister] Saidel Laine in August 1993. In his memorandum on the  occasion of his departure, Dr. Laine pointed out that his  successor should contact several officials, such as those of the  National Office [of Tourism], the management of juridical  affairs, and the consultants to the minister's office. We  learned from a source close to the former commerce minister that  no decision was made before Laine's departure.    Furthermore, we learned that the Port Tortuga S.A. issue was  discussed in the Council of Ministers on several occasions and  was rejected each time.</p>

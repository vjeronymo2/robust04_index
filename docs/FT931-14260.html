			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (16): Variety remains the spice of life - Matching consumers with products is the challenge facing corporations THE idea that we are now in a new era of EC-wide consumer homogeneity would please consumer goods' brand managers everywhere - it would make life a lot more simple - but we are far from that. The member states of the European Community still have vastly differing national legislation on just about every facet of consumer life; everything from toy advertising to a legal definition of low alcohol beer has yet to be harmonised. And as bigger fish - such as a common currency, or common taxation policies - have yet to be fully fried, subsidiarity, the principle permitting decisions to be made at the lowest possible level of community life, is likely to be applied with regularity when it comes to consumer matters. All manner of issues affecting not only consumer choice but manufacturing and exporting plans have yet to be determined. While the EC has abandoned plans to compile 'recipe laws' stipulating what a particular product must contain, proposals on minimum standards of food hygiene, labelling and the use of additives have yet to be agreed on. Some barriers have come down; a product legally available in one member state must be allowed into the other 11 - which will pose problems in many areas, not least that of pornography. Other areas of as yet untested freedom of consumer choice include the removal of restrictions on imports of duty and VAT paid goods. In the UK the law may swiftly be rendered absurd. The customs and excise have suggested import limits 'for personal use' of 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer and 800 cigarettes; anything above that may be deemed for 'commercial use' and thus subject to UK imposed duty. The restrictions currently imposed on duty or VAT free goods will continue in place until June 30, 1999. Given the discrepancies between duty levels in the UK and elsewhere in the EC on alcohol and tobacco, the single market's most immediate effect in consumer terms may well be to give a boost to the vehicle rental businesses of south coast ports, as people rent trucks to stock up across the Channel. Some significant consumer legislation will take time to filter through, particularly the EC's product safety directive - which applies from June 1994 - which states that goods must be safe during 'normal or reasonably foreseeable use' and unlike current UK legislation will also apply to second-hand products - threatening severely to dent the popularity of car boot sales, one of the few growth areas of the UK economy in recent times. All EC countries will be required to implement a scheme to withdraw dangerous products from the market. Another consumer-friendly piece of legislation will start to make itself felt in early 1993, an 'eco-label' on domestic electrical products, showing that they meet certain energy and water efficiency criteria. Eventually this labelling is expected to be carried by all manufacturers of such products. Draft EC legislation on food claims in advertising is likely to be adopted by the Commission early this year, and is expected to establish a general principle that claims should not be false or misleading. Claims made in food advertising will have to be substantiated on the label. Responsibility for regulating claims will probably rest with delegated authorities of the member states. But these and other legislative manoeuvres affecting advertisers and consumers, the sub-text of which sometimes appears to be the construction of a standardised consumer rather than a standardised consumable, need to be seen in the context of subterranean changes occuring in the fabric of European society. The differences between the various member states' populations, their habits and preferences are likely to defeat attempts to cajole them into homogeneity. The EC is more complex in its internal divisions and perhaps more resistant to imposed legislative change than its Eurocrats might wish. For one thing, certain member states are likely to show much faster population growth than others; some will contract. According to the marketing research organisation NTC, over the next 30 years the Netherlands' population is expected to increase by more than 13 per cent, while Italy's will shrink by 7.4 per cent. Growth is expected in the UK, Portugal, Greece and France, while Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Germany and Belgium are all likely to follow Italy's downward path. Overlaying that are profound changes already at work in the structure of the family, none of which lend themselves to the positing of a pan-European pattern. While it is estimated that 5 per cent of all families in the EC are now single-parent, 81 per cent of those are located in the north-west of Europe; in Denmark, more than 25 per cent of families with children are headed by a single parent. A north-south divide exists within the EC over the nature of the family, with the traditional family structure holding up in the southern EC members, and crumbling in its northern. Moreover, other evidence suggests that while there exists a superficial appearance of homogeneity of certain important factors - such as personal disposable income - on a national level, regional disparities are cropping up throughout the EC. According to research by the Henley Centre for Forecasting (Frontiers 1991/1992), 'the divergence in prosperity across European regions is often wider within countries than across them. Italians from Lombardy have a personal disposable income twice as high as that as of consumers in Campania or Calabria . . . consumers in the Balearics or Catalonia have 60 per cent more disposable income than consumers from Extremadura or Andalucia.' Such regional disparities inordinately complicate the business plans of companies seeking to market their products from a fixed global viewpoint. While it might make perfect cost sense to forge ahead with a pan-European television advertising campaign for a branded consumer item when looked at purely from intra-national levels, it might be less attractive when it is realised that nationally-calculated figures often disguise considerable regional differences. The EC's own data suggest that average per capita income disparities are widening; in the 25 poorest regions of the EC it fell to 56 per cent (from 57 per cent) of the EC average between 1980-88, while in the 25 richest regions it grew to 137 per cent (from 135 per cent). One of the central objects of Maastricht is the creation of common European citizenship. Large global corporations have been slowly adopting globally-aimed advertising strategies, in the belief that consumers the world over are gradually losing their differences. Up to a point that may be true. But the challenge for corporations within the single market will be highly complicated. First they must understand the developing legislative, economic, social and demographic distinctions within the single market. Then they need to finely tune their marketing decisions for successful communication via the plethora of new, highly fragmented, media outlets  - particularly the continuing explosion of satellite and cable television channels, which, with the imminent technological revolution of digital compression, will mean even more broadcasting possibilities. Somewhere out there is a consumer who perfectly matches your product. The growing problem will be identifying where they live and letting them know you, too, exist.</p>

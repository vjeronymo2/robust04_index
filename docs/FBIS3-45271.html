At the crucial point when the  villagers were ready to light the fuse, local public security  men opened fire to prevent an explosion occurring.    It was learned that on the afternoon of 4 January, villagers  from Chentang village, Xiaojinkou town, and the Huicheng  district of suburban Huizhou had a dispute with personnel from  the Huizhou Administrative Zone government over the issue of the  local government taking over rural land for its use.    Some 20 villagers from Huicheng district armed with hunting  rifles, knives, and two boxes of explosives took a car from the  Huizhou urban area to the Jinji administrative district to ask  the local government for some 10 miilion yuan in compensation.  When three policemen on patrol went to stop them, the angry  villagers beat up the three policemen, one of whom was wounded  in the head and hospitalized for medical treatment.    The 20-odd villagers threatened to return the following day,  and demanded administrative committee personnel get the money  ready, otherwise, they would level the administrative zone with  explosives. Then the villagers left by car.    When the Huicheng Administrative Zone government heard the  report, it promptly organized the police to deal with any  contingencies.    Around 1800 the next day, four of the aforesaid villagers  arrived at the administrative committee office building carrying  hunting rifles and explosives and demanding cash.    The Huicheng district work group for improving the social  order of Xiaojinkou substation immediately sent 14 public  security men to the scene by car.    Seeing this, the villagers got their explosives ready  quickly, lit cigarettes, and were ready to light the fuse, while  threatening to perish together with the public security men in a  very tense atmosphere.    The local public security men ordered the villagers to put  down the explosives, while evacuating citizens; at the same  time, they opened fire as a warning.    Nevertheless, the villagers with explosives had already  pointed their lit cigarettes at the fuse. At this critical  moment, local security men opened fire and wounded the villager  holding the explosives.    At the same time, two other security men dashed up and  seized  the explosives in the villager's hands, thus succeeding in  halting the occurrence of an explosion.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Shipyard faces ballot on staff cuts MANUAL workers at Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilder, are to ballot on strike action over compulsory redundancies. The company, which is suffering from a lack of defence orders, aims to cut its 1,800-strong workforce by about 200 before June. Unions said the company had breached redundancy agreements, and balloting would begin in the next two weeks. The company said most of the redundancies had so far been voluntary but some compulsory ones were necessary to meet targets. It denied that agreements had been broken. Mr John Simmons, local chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said the unions had argued for workers to be laid off under an agreement which allowed for them to continue receiving 75 per cent of normal pay. Mr Chris Girling, the company's finance director, said the difficulties it faced were 'too deep and too long' to be dealt with by lay-offs. Many employees were already engaged in unproductive work, such as maintenance, and others without work were being kept on so core skills were retained. In a similar dispute, workers at a plant owned by GEC-Alsthom, the switchgear company, last month ended a six-week strike over compulsory redundancies. Unions failed to persuade management to reinstate 12 workers. GEC Ferranti, the electronics company, has told its 5,000 employees that it will freeze pay this year because of the depressed defence market.</p>

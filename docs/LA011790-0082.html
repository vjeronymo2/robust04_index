			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUPERSONICS ARE PLEASED WITH THEIR NEW LOOK  </P> <P> The new look has been pleasing to the eye.  </P> <P> Sedale Threatt might never be mistaken for Dale Ellis, but the Seattle  SuperSonics (18-16) enter their 7:30 game Wednesday night against the Los  Angeles Lakers (26-8) in the Forum with a three-game winning streak. And  certainly Threatt, who has averaged 15.3 points during this recent run, has  played a vital role.  </P> <P> "It's a natural move for him," Sonics assistant K.C. Jones said. "Sedale  doesn't have the same range as Dale, but he can shoot off picks, and he's a  natural two-guard, anyway."  </P> <P> Threatt, always the selfless, quiet one when it comes to discussing his role on  the team, won't bite. Ellis, expected to be out for a couple of months with  three broken ribs following a car accident Friday morning, is perhaps his best  friend on the team and misses him terribly.  </P> <P> "It's still a role," Threatt said after starting the past two games in Ellis'  absence. "Now I'm the backup filling in for Dale. I can't replace Dale. Nobody  can. But our defense and offense have opened up. When we pressure more, we're  able to get out on the break and find open shots."  </P> <P> And therein lies the difference. With Ellis in the lineup, the Sonics work  around getting him his shots on offense. With Threatt playing instead, they  lose the individual explosiveness of Ellis, but their defensive pressure is a  lot more consistent and the ballhandling far more effective. Whether it's Avery  Johnson, Dana Barros, or Nate McMillan next to Threatt, there is better  quickness, dribbling and passing than with Ellis.  </P> <P> "We are moving the ball a lot better," Sonics point guard Nate McMillan said.  "When Dale is in there, he's a great shooter, so we concentrate on getting him  shots. Now we don't have the great long-range shooter, so we have to work the  ball better to get our shots. Therefore, we have a guy (Threatt) who can shoot  and penetrate with the ball a lot.  </P> <P> "With Sedale and Avery in there at the same time in the starting lineup, it's  like having two guys who can do the 40 in 4.2 on the floor who can handle the  ball."  </P> <P> Ellis' accident has forced the Sonics to do what Coach Bernie Bickerstaff has  been pleading for them to do all season -- concentrate on defense and ball  movement -- so that the easy shots will come more often.  </P> <P> "Coach has wanted us to move the ball more," McMillan said. "Now we're focused.  We know we have to do those extra things to make up for Dale not being here.  Now it's working."  </P> <P> SuperSonic Notes  </P> <P> Dale Ellis was released from Seattle's Harborview Medical Center Tuesday  afternoon after a CAT scan disclosed no tears in his lower trunk as initially  feared. So he went home. The King County Prosecutor Wednesday is expected to  issue charges against Ellis for reckless driving and perhaps driving under the  influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> Look for Magic Johnson to be playing a lot of forward tonight for the Lakers.  When Larry Drew moves in at point guard, Johnson has been effective at the  small forward. . . . The Sonics have not won in the Forum since the final game  of the 1986-87 season.  </P></p>

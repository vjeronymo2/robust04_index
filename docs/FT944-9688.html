			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / In Angola, a ceasefire may not mean peace: The economic implications of an expected conclusion to the war On a hillside overlooking Luanda's docks, bands of children trawl through rubbish bins near a large, partly finished building, now overgrown. The children are refugees from a civil war which erupted again after a short peace when Unita rebels rejected defeat in UN-sponsored elections in late 1992 and returned to war. The building was started by a Portuguese company as foreign investment flowed into oil- and diamond-rich Angola after peace accords in 1991. It was abandoned when it was discovered that peace had turned sour. Negotiators in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, have initialled another peace agreement which was due to be signed today. But this was last night postponed to November 20 amid reports that Unita had refused to sign while the government intensified the war. In the past fortnight, since initialling of the pact, government forces have overrun the rebel stronghold of Huambo. Leaders of southern African states due to meet in Lusaka today were reported to be drafting a tough statement calling for a stop to the fighting. UN officials said the warring sides had agreed to discuss cessation of hostilities. Uncertainty about peace, however, means that foreigners and Angolans alike are increasingly cautious about the country's prospects. 'A lot of money flowed recklessly into Angola last time,' one economist said. 'People will be careful now.' The civil war, which erupted on independence from Portugal in 1975, has carved Angola into a patchwork of government and rebel control with towns cut off from one another by fighting and landmines. More than a third of Angola's 10.5m people depend on a humanitarian aid operation costing Dollars 250m a year, the main burden of which has been left to foreign organisations while the government has pursued its war. An economic programme launched in March set out to reduce state control of the economy. Central to the plan was the aim to end official exchange rates previously used to subsidise selected sectors of the economy. Mr Severim de Morais, vice-minister of planning and economic co-ordination, said last month Angola would have a fully floating exchange rate by the end of the year. The programme had early successes in reining in spending and reducing annual inflation from 1,800 per cent in January to 930 per cent in July, according to official figures. But Luanda's elite successfully derailed a similar programme last year. The new economic team has failed to get the political support needed to curb spending and bring the budget deficit, last year officially estimated at 29 per cent of gross domestic product, near the programme's target of 4 per cent. The free market exchange rate rose rapidly from around 280,000 kwanza to the dollar in mid-September to 640,000 by mid-October, as dollars became scarce because of demand from the secretive defence sector. Monthly inflation rose from 7 per cent in June to 23 per cent in August and public sector strikes broke out. The volatile kwanza strengthened to 350,000 in mid-month amid signs of a peace agreement, with some business people saying they expected a rush of new lending to Angola which would temper the dollar's scarcity. But little new money has come in to date. Official requests for IMF support have so far been met with polite refusal. Financial institutions are cautious about lending to a country with an external debt approaching Dollars 11bn and one collapsed peace agreement behind it. The disaster of the last accords stirred up new mistrust. Early disarmament and large cuts in defence spending are unlikely as long as there is any chance that war will erupt again. If peace holds, foreigners seeking to invest in Angola's non-mineral economy stand to be frustrated not just by continued political uncertainty but also by bureaucracy, an under-educated workforce and confused property laws. But three sectors of the official economy could grow if a ceasefire holds. First, despite an estimated 10m to 20m landmines scattered across the country, refugees could return to their fields in many parts of the country and April's harvests could increase sharply from an estimated 250,000 tonnes this year. Long-term agricultural potential is large: before independence Angola exported food and was the world's fourth largest coffee producer. Second, if a peace agreement were to hold and Unita, which has been funding its war effort mostly with diamond sales, were persuaded to co-operate in the anarchic north-eastern diamond areas, the government could raise official production from Dollars 2m last year closer to the Dollars 250m reckoned to have leaked out from the Unita areas. Third, Angola's mostly offshore oil industry has largely been unaffected by fighting. Oil production is expected to rise gently from around 550,000 barrels a day to 700,000 in 1996, as new fields come on stream. But Pedro Manuel, an Angolan businessman, echoed a widely held caution about his country's prospects. 'There is so much hatred after what happened last time. A ceasefire may happen but that is not the same as peace.'</p>

He was speaking to Willy Claes, Belgian vice prime minister  and minister of foreign affairs, who visited him today.  Cindoruk pointed out that Turkey's policy toward Europe is  developing positively and that this is partly due to  intergovernmental relations. He explained that if Turkey  overcomes its economic difficulties a little more, then there  will be no obstacle before its membership in the customs union.  The TGNA speaker stressed that the Assembly will support the  efforts to adapt the existing legislation to the customs union.    Willy Claes pointed out that Turkey will join the customs  union in 1995 and that this is a very important step toward full  membership in the EU.</p>

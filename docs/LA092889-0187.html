"They will look at and consider activities, but the commission is advisory  only. They will forward recommendations to the council."  </P> <P> Up to this point, such recommendations have been made by the city's Community  Services and Recreation Department, Morey said. Anyone wishing to become a  member of the commission may contact the city clerk's office for an  application.  </P></p>

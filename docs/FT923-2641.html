			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK business fears another blow LEADING British industrialists reacted with dismay to yesterday's rise in interest rates and expressed fears that if it turned out to be more than a temporary measure it would deal a further blow to consumer demand and deepen the recession. Before last night's suspension of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism and the cancellation of the second - 3-point - rise yesterday in interest rates, most reluctantly accepted that the government had had little choice but to act as it did. 'We need 15 per cent interest rates like we need a hole in the head,' said Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry. 'But if it is a choice between that and devaluation, then I suppose it will have to be'. Some businessmen had feared continued pressure on sterling could make devaluation inevitable. A small minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out of the ERM entirely. 'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue, all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float, we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the troops'. For most businesses, however, the most pressing concern was the outlook for demand. Some industry spokesmen argued that, almost regardless of what happened next, yesterday's events had inflicted a devastating blow to consumer demand. 'People will no longer be buying as of now. They will be stopped in their tracks', said Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry Federation. He also warned that another round of business bankruptcies was inevitable. Others argued that much would depend on how long interest rates remained at crisis levels, and whether they were passed through into mortgage rates. Several believed that it would be politically and economically impossible for the government hold current interest rates for more than a few weeks. Several companies yesterday called on the government to take steps to revive the economy. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said action was needed to help the construction industry. Mortgage lenders were aghast at the prospect of an unprecedentedly sharp increase in interest rates, but said the market was in such disarray that no decision about a new rate could be taken before next week. There were widespread fears, however, that any tentative recovery in the housing market had been killed. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society, summed up the general view: 'There is such turmoil going on that we cannot take any sensible view about the short, medium or longer term. This is potentially bad news for borrowers but when and to what extent one cannot yet foresee'. The rise in interest rates is especially painful for lenders since it comes at the lowest point in the fortunes of the housing market. 'The mortgage market has been virtually dead all this month even before this,' said the chief executive of one of the five largest building societies. Mr Michael Jones, president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said the increases would kill stone dead an already faltering housing market. Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, the seventh largest building society, said repossessions could rise dramatically if rates rose further. If these borrowers are evicted, the market could be even further depressed by a flood of repossessed houses. The Association of British Insurers said that widespread increases in mortgage rates could mean that insurance companies which have provided mortgage indemnity policies could face further huge losses.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Power meters offer breakdown of costs HOUSEHOLDERS in Newcastle upon Tyne can now measure how much it costs to have a bath, thanks to electricity meters which could be in 20m homes by 1998. The meters, which can tell customers exactly how much electricity domestic appliances consume and give them an instant electricity bill, are being tested and promoted by Offer, the electricity industry watchdog. Yesterday it issued a paper urging electricity suppliers to install modern meters as soon as possible. Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer's director-general, said sophisticated meters would be essential in 1998, when the electricity market would be fully deregulated, allowing customers to choose an electricity supplier rather than just buying from their local company. He said: 'I look forward to the day when customers can take out the Yellow Pages and pick an electricity supplier.' Because the new meters monitor exactly when electricity is used, any supplier could easily settle up with the customer's local company. Offer said the regional electricity companies would probably pay for most of the new metering system, which might cost Pounds 1bn nationwide. That would be taken into consideration when regulations governing how much they could charge customers were reviewed in 1994. The meters would also benefit the companies because they would improve cashflows and efficiency. Customer groups, electricity suppliers and other interested bodies have until July to respond to the report.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pilar F. Canales report: "Mendez Proposes Tripartite Grand </F> Pact"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- At his first appearance before the  Senate Labor and Social Security Committee since replacing  Nicolas Redondo, UGT [General Workers Union] Secretary General  Candido Mendez yesterday emphasized the need to conclude a  tripartite grand agreement for employment, provided that the  government reconsiders a labor reform "which is extremely  negative, will not create employment, and will not attract  investments."    He appealed to the senators "not to disappoint workers, the  trade union movement, and the voice of the public" and to  "desist from going ahead with the labor reform" in the form in  which it has has been drafted, although for him the ideal thing  would be for the the bill to be withdrawn or, at least, for its  passage to be stopped.    Asked whether keeping the reform would be an insurmountable  obstacle to securing the agreement, he stated that "it would be  very difficult if the government's labor reform is taken to its  logical conclusion, but we will do our best."    Mendez explained that he held a meeting with Workers  Commissions Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez, and stated that  he fully supports the proposal of a pact for employment. He  added that before making any proposal to the government and the  Spanish Confederation of Employers Organizations, he prefers to  meet first with the king and with the PSV [housing cooperative]  victims.  <H5>  Stances </H5>   The UGT secretary general repeated the same stances already  set out by Nicolas Redondo -- that is:    Economic policy: The reform of the labor market will not in  itself create jobs; in his opinion, a change is needed in the  government's economic policy, envisaging "an industrial recovery  and an improvement of infrastructures."    Will to negotiate: He reiterated the will to negotiate of  the UGT, "which always has its hand outstretched to negotiate  something fair and balanced."    Lack of understanding: He regretted the lack of  understanding between the government, employers, and trade  unions, which, in his opinion, "will create tensions in the 1994  collective bargaining."    Making dismissal cheaper: Candido Mendez believes that it is  "extremely bad" to allow "dismissals in an enterprise with  profits, on the basis of something bad that could happen in the  future."    Apprenticeship contracts: The UGT leader pointed out that  apprenticeship contracts are being made "in breach of the law if  training is not given by employers."    Trade union election rules: He denied that "minority trade  unions will be discriminated against" under the proposed new  trade union election rules, as the Platform for Trade Union  Freedom is asserting.

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar cashcall to fund Pounds 34m buy from Kellogg LOW &amp; BONAR, the packaging and plastics company, yesterday launched a Pounds 50m rights issue to fund the acquisition of a folding carton manufacturer and to reduce debt. The group announced that it had agreed to purchase Manchester-based Cereal Packaging from Kellogg, Europe's leading cereal manufacturer, for Pounds 33.5m cash. Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the deal would create Britain's third largest folding carton company. Traders welcomed the cash call and acquisition and marked the shares up 9p to 344p, in contrast to the declining market. Mr Leng said Low &amp; Bonar expected to benefit from significantly enhanced purchasing power following the acquisition. The group also planned to expand Cereal Packaging's capacity - which to date had been aimed solely at servicing Kellogg's needs. The business would compliment Low's existing Bonar Cooke Carton operation, he said, and give access to the rapidly growing European cereals market. As part of the deal, Kellogg has agreed to a five-year purchasing contract with specified prices. Based on the prices and volumes of this contract agreement, Cereal Packaging would have made profits of roughly Pounds 4.5m last year. Assets are expected to be valued at about Pounds 8m, following evaluation of stocks. The deal will be funded through a 1-for-4 rights issue of 19.5m shares at 265p. This will raise Pounds 50.2m, of which Pounds 16.7m will be used to reduce debt. Low &amp; Bonar, which announced a sharp decline in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 8.1m last month, has net debt of Pounds 36.5m. After the issue, gearing will fall from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Leng said the debt reduction would allow Low to act on other acquisition opportunities. The company, which has reorganised its troubled US operations, aimed to expand in Europe. The group hoped to make an announcement within the next two months.</p>

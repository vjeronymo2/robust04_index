			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Arts: Mark Morris's 'Motorcade' - Ballet The first thing that has to be said is that London Contemporary Dance Theatre is an ensemble of dancers at the peak of their stunningly good form. At the opening of the company's autumn season at Sadler's Wells on Tuesday night, movement had a lightning-flash energy, and a hard-driven rhythmic pulse. For this reason alone, Arnie Zane's pointless Freedom of Information was exciting to watch as the evening began. The dance is incoherent, a cascade of cheap-jack incidents that whip the performers' bodies in every direction, but there must be laurels for Peter Dunleavy, Isobel Mortimer, Andrew Robinson, Isabel Tamen, Sheron Wray, and especially to Kenneth Tharp as the whizz-kid of the karate chop, for the sophistication of their performances, witty, bright-cut, hair-trigger fast. A similar verve - LCDT's artists seem able to rip into a dance phrase, explore its possibilities, and come out on the other side with gleaming ease  -marked the first London showing of Christopher Bruce's Rooster. This uses eight songs by the Rolling Stones for a romp which examines the social and sexual attitudes of the young to whom such stuff is food and drink. (There were quite a few of them in the audience, yipping with delight at what they saw and heard). The opening Little Red Rooster shows four men strutting in barnyard display; later numbers reveal how well Bruce writes for men - from the flashy, knowing show-piece for David Hughes (excellently done), to a more urgently emotional number for Darshan Singh Bhuller, through which he curved and spun in a vivid combination of power and suppleness. The four women are less well served, though Sheron Wray, heroine of the evening in three works, has a mercurial speed and whirlwind temperament that give savour to everything she dances. The major choreographic matter came with Mark Morris's Motorcade, made for the White Oaks project two years ago, and his first piece to be staged by a British troupe. The text is Saint-Saens trumpet septet. It is clearly a score in which Morris finds much to delight him: its exemplary craft, its melodic freshness, its clarity of form, even a certain Ecole Pompier academism. Such felicities have led Morris to what was known in the earliest days of American modern dance as 'music realisation'. Not, though, for Morris any step-for-note trippings. Rather does he find curves of movement, swathes of energy, entrances and poses, balances and counter-weights of activity, which spring out of the music's development, match its devices and decisions, illuminate them. I thought it beguilingly made, modest, elegant in means as Saint-Saens' own procedures. I also thought it could be better danced. To make such choreography live, performance must be as acute and musically witty as Morris's own conceits. LCDT's cast were not uniformly alert, nor as 'inside' the music and dance as Morris's own artists always appear to be. The costuming is depressing: pastel vests and leotards that end fatally at the knee, with dainty shoes: the dancers look like discomforted elves - and some of them rather bulgy elves at that. But it is a notable addition to the repertory, and worth polishing. London Contemporary Dance Theatre continues at Sadler's Wells until December 5: varied repertory.</p>

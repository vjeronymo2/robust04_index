			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The UN Security Council has given itself some time  for reflection before adopting a draft resolution reinforcing  the sanctions against Haiti in order to examine in detail the  technical and political aspects of such a decision, indicated  French Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee. It is a complex  draft resolution and the Council needs some time to examine it,  Mr. Merimee told the press after a Security Council consultative  meeting attended by Dante Caputo.    It should be recalled that on 4 March, the group of four  [France, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States] submitted to  the Security Council, a resolution providing notably for the  imposition of a trade embargo against Haiti and some sanctions  against the military.    Those measures, which would be added to the oil and military  embargo in effect since last year, would constitute a new  attempt from the international community to force the Haitian  military to give back power to President Aristide and to  facilitate his return to Haiti. However, the resolution  requires the effective cooperation of Mr. Aristide in the search  for a political solution before the imposition of new sanctions  against Haiti.</p>

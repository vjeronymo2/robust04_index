			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Index shows widespread declines for year to date Most government bond markets suffered declines in the first four months of 1994, ranging from a 0.15 per cent drop in Italy to a 7.81 per cent decline in the UK gilt market, J. P. Morgan's bond index shows. Much of the negative performance was triggered by the sell-off in the US Treasuries market, where strong economic growth, mounting inflation concerns and Fed tightening combined to drive yields higher and increase volatility. This spilled over into Europe, where signs of stronger-than-expected economic revival added to market jitters, JP . Morgan states. Japan was the only government bond market to post positive returns in April, rising by 0.17 per cent in local currency terms on the back of a stronger yen, low inflation and signs of continued weak economic activity. European government bonds posted further losses last month, in spite of continued easing by the Bundesbank and accompanying rate cuts by other central banks. Total returns in Europe fell by 0.81 per cent, with Sweden, the worst performer, shedding as much as 1.56 per cent. The UK market also performed poorly in April, falling by 1.21 per cent in response to inflation concerns and increasing political uncertainty ahead of forthcoming local and European parliamentary elections. Shedding only 0.03 per cent, Italy was Europe's top performing market, supported by hopes for a stable new government following the victory of the right-wing alliance in the March elections. Spain, Europe's other high-yielder, was the second-best performer, declining by 0.41 per cent. Unhedged US dollar investors benefited from the strength of most major currencies against the dollar last month. In US dollar terms, the index rose by 0.49 per cent. The yen's appreciation contributed to a total return of 1.41 per cent on Japanese government bonds in US dollar terms. Similarly, the lira's strength helped Italian bonds show a 1.16 per cent return.</p>

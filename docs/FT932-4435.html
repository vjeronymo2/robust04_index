			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Price rises help lift Anglian Water by 8% ANGLIAN Water, one of the biggest privatised water companies, yesterday announced profits in line with expectations but said its unregulated businesses lost money due to recession and start- up costs. Pre-tax profits increased 8.2 per cent from Pounds 171.3m to Pounds 185.4m in the year to March 31, helped by price increases and a Pounds 3.3m gain on land sales. Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said the results represented a considerable achievement, especially in Anglian's regulated water and sewage business. Turnover increased 11.5 per cent to Pounds 583.2m, with average price increases at 9.4 per cent. Operating costs grew more quickly, reflecting expansion of the unregulated businesses. Operating profits increased 9.1 per cent to Pounds 211.6m. Unregulated businesses, strengthened in February by the acquisition of the Swedish-based process engineering company Nordic Water, made an operating loss of Pounds 4.4m on sales of Pounds 29m. Mr Alan Smith, managing director, said he hoped the division would make a profit after interest costs this year. Anglian has reacted to criticism of its disconnection policy - the number of customers cut off fell from 1,200 to 236. But bad debt provisions shot up from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 8.4m. Interest costs increased by nearly a third to Pounds 29.5m. Net borrowings rose by a similar amount to Pounds 392.5m as the capital spending programme gathered momentum. Gearing increased from 23 per cent to nearly 29 per cent. Anglian said it had won backing from customers to raise capital spending and prices beyond the legal minimum in the second half of the decade. Ofwat, the water regulator, will next year rule on companies' pricing levels. Most are finding resistance from customers to higher prices. Earnings per share increased 9.1 per cent to 56.4p. The company recommended a final dividend of 14.3p to make a total of 21.2p, a 9.3 per cent increase. Lex, Page 22</p>

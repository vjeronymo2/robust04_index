			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified correspondent: "President Signed </F> Edict on Wage Increase"]    [Text] President of the Republic of Armenia Levon  Ter-Petrosyan signed an edict on 31 March on increasing the  minimum scale of wages of workers of budgetary institutions,  pensions, benefits, and stipends.    According to the edict, starting on 1 April 1994, the  minimum  wage scale in the republic is established at 176 drams, and in  remote and border population centers, established by the  government of the republic, 194 drams. The official salaries of  workers of budgetary institutions that are not paid according to  the multiplier coefficient with respect to the minimum wage,  pensions designated in the event of full length of service, and  the pensions of servicemen are increased by a factor of 1.6.    The edict shows a clearly differentiated approach to the  question of supplementary social support to the low income  elements of the population. Additional monetary supplements,  after indexation, were established for workers of budgetary  institutions who are on a scale of less than 880 drams, for  pensions with full length of service, and for the pensions of  servicemen.    What is also very important for a substantial part of the  population is that, given an incomplete length of service, the  scales of work pensions for age and disability, social pensions  for old age and disability, and also the pensions of servicemen,  and the supplementary payments to them, are determined from a  calculation of the minimum wage with an additional supplement of  191 drams.    Stipends to students of state higher educational  institutions  are established at a scale of 296 drams, for graduation  classes--330 drams, and in the event of outstanding  progress--370 drams. Starting on 1 April, the stipends for  graduate students will be 500 drams, and for doctoral  students--700 drams.    Allowances of various kinds for children are being increased  by a factor of 3 and more.    A supplementary payment of 194 drams is established for  unemployment benefits.    The edict of the president of the Republic of Armenia will  be  published in full in one of the issues of RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in  the near future.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS INJUNCTION AGAINST LUCKY, ALPHA BETA MERGER  </P> <P> A federal appeals court today overturned a judge's order last September that  blocked the consolidation of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains,  ruling that California had no right to undo the merger.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said there is evidence that the  $2.5-billion buyout would lessen competition in the state, creating a chain  that controlled 24% of the supermarket business statewide. Lucky is already the  state's largest market chain, with 340 stores.  </P> <P> But the court said the merger had already won Federal Trade Commission approval  and been completed by the time California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp  challenged it.  </P> <P> "California could have sued several months earlier and attempted to enjoin the  merger before the stock sale was completed," said Judge J. Clifford Wallace in  the 3-0 ruling. "The attorney general chose not to do so. California must  accept the consequences of his choice."  </P> <P> In his suit last September on behalf of the state, Van de Kamp said the merger  could cost California shoppers $400 million by lessening competition and  driving up prices.  </P> <P> Michael Strumwasser, special counsel to Van de Kamp, declined comment, saying  he had not yet read the ruling.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FITNESS CENTER FOR DISABLED IS DEDICATED;  </P> <P> EXERCISE: IT'S THE FIRST CITY-OPERATED FACILITY OF ITS KIND, WITH EQUIPMENT  DESIGNED FOR WHEELCHAIR WORKOUTS.  </P> <P> With a little pomp and a lot of festivity, the first city-operated fitness  facility for the disabled in Los Angeles was dedicated Saturday at the  Chatsworth Park South Recreation Center.  </P> <P> The program included the solemn ceremonial events expected at an official  occasion: presentation of the colors by a local Boy Scout troop, the Pledge of  Allegiance, an invocation, introduction of city officials and a ribbon-cutting  ceremony.  </P> <P> But the formal part of the program was kept to a minimum so the real stars of  the day -- the disabled people served by the new fitness center -- could take  the limelight.  </P> <P> They were featured in demonstrations that showcased their talents in song,  dance, arts, horseback riding and sports such as wheelchair tennis and  basketball for the 250 people who attended the opening.  </P> <P> The fitness center, in a newly built room adjoining the park's main building,  features exercise equipment that is custom-built so that handicapped people can  use it while seated in their wheelchairs.  </P> <P> For example, one machine allows the performance of five different exercises  from electric and manual wheelchairs.  </P> <P> Partially funded by a $1.3-million grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation  of Los Angeles, the center is the first of three for the disabled that will be  installed in city recreation facilities.  </P> <P> "One of my personal dreams is to have places like this where people in  wheelchairs can come to work out throughout the city," said Ce Etta Crayton,  consultant to the city Recreation and Parks Department's Adaptive Sports  Program.  </P> <P> "As far as I know, this is not only the first center of its kind in the city of  Los Angeles but in the entire country. And it will become a model for others.  After all, there aren't a lot of places people in wheelchairs can go to work  out."  </P> <P> A second center will open at Martin Luther King Recreation Center in  South-Central Los Angeles within a year, Crayton said. The third will be  installed at the Elysian Park Recreation Center in late 1992 or in 1993, she  said.  </P> <P> The cost of the fitness center at Chatsworth Park was $224,000. The foundation,  created to manage the surplus from the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,  contributed $124,000. The city -- using state funds earmarked for recreation --  paid the balance. The other two planned centers will each receive $588,000 from  the foundation.  </P> <P> According to statistics compiled by the state Department of Rehabilitation,  about 96,000 disabled people live in the San Fernando Valley, which has one of  the largest disabled populations in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "In recent years, there hasn't been too much to meet their needs," said Eileen  Libbey, recreation therapist in charge of the disabled program at Chatsworth  Park. A survey on recreational needs in the Valley by the Recreation and Parks  Department in 1988 showed that there is a dearth of activities for the  disabled, she said.  </P> <P> Chatsworth Park's year-old recreation program for the disabled offers such  activities as drama, music and wheelchair sports to about 300 disabled people  between the ages of 5 and 93, Libbey said.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Councilman Hal Bernson and other city officials shared the  spotlight with wheelchair-bound Erich Malone of Chatsworth; actor Brad  Silverman, 23, who has Down's syndrome, and the handicapped members of the  Brite Lites Theater Company.  </P> <P> Erich, a 9-year-old who has muscular dystrophy, cut the ribbon dedicating the  facility and was the first to try the equipment. "This is neat," he said,  flexing his arm muscles.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how far we handicapped kids can go," said Silverman, who was  featured in the Feb. 11 segment of the television series "Life Goes On."  </P> <P> The Brite Lites troupe grew out of the Chatsworth center's program for the  handicapped.  </P> <P> "They're just wonderful, aren't they?" beaming music teacher Pat Weistling said  as she watched the members of the company sing and dance their way through  "Oklahoma!" and a medley of other show tunes.  </P> <P> "They've looked forward to this day," Weistling said. "They've been preparing  for it for months. It truly is their day."  </P> <P> The fitness center will be open on a limited schedule: 4 to 8 p.m. Tuesdays, 3  to 6 p.m. Thursdays and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays.  </P></p>

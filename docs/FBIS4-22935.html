On the  Doorstep: A System for Using Technical Information'']    [Text] With respect to coverage of the fields of science  and technology, economic branches and regions, the USSR State  System for Scientific and Technical Information (GSNTI) had no  precedents in world practice. The centralization of the  processing of the principal types of scientific and technical  documents made it possible to avoid multiple duplication in the  purchase and intellectual processing of literature, especially  foreign literature and to reduce expenditures by branch and  territorial systems substantially.    However, the declared objective of exhaustive coverage of  the  world scientific and technical literature was never attained.  About 1,500 of the most important foreign periodicals were not  received in the country and the transactions of important  scientific conferences, foreign reports and dissertations were  received only from time to time.    Now many of the information centers constituting parts of  the  USSR GSNTI are suffering a pitiful existence. The bonds among  them have been weakened or completely broken. The purchases of  foreign scientific and technical literature have been sharply  reduced. The Russian State Library does not receive and  therefore is unable to make many national periodicals available  to readers.    The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian  Federation (RF) is trying to maintain ``fragments'' of the USSR  GSNTI, by tradition more or less uniformly distributing crumbs  from the state budget among them.    Meanwhile commercialization is strongly intruding in the  activity of the scientific and technical information (STI)  services. For example, the State Public Scientific-Technical  Library of Russia has already introduced pay for servicing of  enterprises and organizations with literature on interlibrary  loan, although its funds come exclusively from the state budget.  Thus, there is actual privatization of that which has already  been paid for completely by the taxpayers.    A decree of the RF government, No. 16, dated 6 January 1993,  strengthening the strictly centralized management of the  territorial STI centers in the republics, krays and the oblasts  of the RF, was a questionable attempt at reanimating a part of  the USSR GSNTI. The structures whose principal objective not  long ago was the servicing of the oblast and kray committees of  the CPSU, are continuing to be controlled from Moscow without  participation of the governments of the republics and local  administrations, be it in Yekaterinburg, Kazan or Yakutsk. Among  the great variety of problems to be dealt with the first one was  by far not the most important and it was solved in the spirit of  the old traditions.    It must be stated that there is no clear concept with  respect  to the organization and development of a STI system in the  Russian Federation either in the government or in the Ministry  of Science and Technical Policy.    What should be the state policy of the RF in the STI field  in  order to ensure the most complete and efficient use of the  information resources available in the country and beyond its  borders?    In the process of changeover to a market economy in the RF  the appearance of private (including commercial) STI centers  also was inevitable. However, there should be complete or  partial (50-60%) state financing of STI centers and  scientific-technical libraries servicing economic sectors  vitally important for the country but not yielding a direct  profit.    It is necessary to embody in the law and realistically  ensure  the right of each citizen-taxpayer to free access to any  information: socio-political, scientific, technical, commercial  and other, collected or created using the resources of the state  budget. Payment can be levied only for additional services with  an added cost for covering the actual expenditures for rendering  these services, but without receiving a profit.    The reliability of an information servicing system is  predetermined primarily by the completeness of coverage and  routineness in processing of the world flow of STI. The most  effective means here is the centralization of collection,  systematization, referencing and indexing of all the scientific  and technical information appearing in the world. It is  important to guarantee the receipt in the country, at least in a  single copy, of all publications which may be of interest for  Russian scientists and specialists.    Databases (DB), usually constituting electronic versions of  printed publications, that is, newspapers, journals,  encyclopedias, reference books, etc., are becoming an  increasingly more important type of STI sources. In 1992  throughout the world there were more than six thousand generally  accessible DB with an annual increase in their number by more  than 20%. However, there is not even one well-developed  country  which can be completely reliant on the physical or electronic  supply (importation) of foreign DB because this would put it in  increasing dependence on the supplying countries.    The STI system also must include a service for the rapid  preparation and delivery of copies of original sources to  readers. In order to meet the needs for information with minimum  expenditures it is necessary to have integrated information  systems: they are based on the one-time processing of STI  sources and the input of the corresponding data into a computer  with their subsequent repeated use.    A matter of concern of countries should be the supply of  information to small and intermediate enterprises and companies.  Since such enterprises are usually incapable of maintaining  their own STI services, the state must ensure the preparation of  the information which they require and favorable conditions for  acquiring it.    An increase in the information literacy of scientists and  specialists also is becoming an important prerequisite for the  efficient use of STI.    Taking into account what has been said, it appears that the  STI system in the RF must be organized in the following way. The  state, public and private STI centers, scientific-technical  publishing houses, libraries, intermediary and consultation  companies should form the national network of STI agencies. The  STI centers, libraries and other information structures  servicing spheres vitally important for the country and  therefore financed from the state subject should be combined  into a State STI System (GSNTI RF) whose operations are  organized on a nonprofit basis.    The GSNTI RF should include the following principal types of  information agencies: STI functional institutes and centers,  carrying out the most complete possible collection of  publications and unpublished documents, their intellectual  processing, preparation of DB and information publications (in  electronic or printed form) and their dissemination, thematic  STI centers whose principal function would be the selective  dissemination and retrospective subject-thematic information and  document search--predominantly in a remote dialogue access  mode--on the basis of use of DB made available by licenses or  acquired from those organizing them, a center for the routine  issuance of copies, a translation center and ``brain centers'':  administratively independent scientific research organizations,  preparing under special order predictions of development,  analytic reviews and summaries.    The territorial STI centers, scientific-technical libraries  in the republics making up the RF, and also in the krays and  oblasts, must be established, maintained and controlled by the  governments of these republics, the authorities in the krays and  oblasts.    The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of the Russian  Federation can be seen as the principal coordinator of  development and implementation of state policy in the STI field.  It could rely on an interdepartmental STI committee.</p>

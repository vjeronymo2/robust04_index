			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX DISTRICT;  </P> <P> PROBE OF NON-KOSHER MEAT  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office has charged a Fairfax Avenue butcher shop  with selling non-kosher turkey as kosher.  </P> <P> The civil action, which carries possible penalties of $2,500 or more, alleges  that Bazar Meats also failed to keep the paperwork required for butcher shops  to prove that their stock of fresh meat comes from kosher suppliers.  </P> <P> David Levi, who was named in the complaint, denied the charge, saying he had  just taken over the operation and was not yet in business when county  investigators seized a case of turkeys two months ago.  </P> <P> Bazar Meats is inside Bazar Market, a separate enterprise where Levi worked  before taking over the meat counter on his own, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to go to court, and the landlord will testify that the box wasn't  mine," Levi said.  </P> <P> Senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Herschel Elkins, who filed the complaint after an  investigation by agents of the Los Angeles County Department of Weights and  Measures, said the defendant has 30 days to respond to the complaint.  </P> <P> "We haven't alleged any complaints at this time against Bazar Market," he said.  </P></p>

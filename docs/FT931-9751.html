			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rand Merchant Bank rises RAND Merchant Bank, the financial services group recently involved in a merger with the assurer Momentum Life, reported increased earnings for the six months to end-December. It plans to increase its dividend. Net income after tax and contingency reserve transfers rose to R21.5m (Dollars 6.9m) from R13m. Earnings per share rose by 27 per cent to 30 cents. The dividend is increasing to 10.5 cents from 8.5 cents a share. Minus Momentum Life, the increase in earnings per share would have been 23 per cent. Momentum Life increased premium income by 48 per cent to R420.2m, but this mostly reflected a number of large transactions in single premium income which are unlikely to be repeated. All divisions of Rand Merchant Bank performed satisfactorily.</p>

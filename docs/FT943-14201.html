			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Furniture side helps Hampson to Pounds 4m A surge in sales in the furniture division of Hampson Industries, the West Bromwich-based diversified industrial group, contributed to a 75 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.42m, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 4.23m in the year to March 31 1994. The increase in profits was achieved after charges of Pounds 1.39m, which included a goodwill write-off of Pounds 937,000 following the closure of Clearway Aluminium, the only division in the company involved in the construction industry. Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.39m to Pounds 6.28m with continuing operations up 34 per cent at Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 4.95m). Turnover advanced to Pounds 91.5m (Pounds 79.1m) with Pounds 90m (Pounds 78m) from continuing operations. Gearing at the year end was reduced to 26 per cent (46 per cent). Mr Ray Way, chairman, said the group's financial position continued to strengthen and borrowings were 'well under control'. The furniture division, Ian Walker Furniture, hit by sterling's realignment last year, saw margins restored and sales increase to help push operating profits in the consumer goods division up from Pounds 77,000 to Pounds 1.53m on turnover of Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 33.3m). International demand helped sales at Erlson Engineering, a supplier of turbocharger components, increase by 18 per cent while hardening commodity prices and better customer demand helped trading conditions in the aluminium refining division. Total operating profits for the industrial goods division rose from Pounds 4.59m to Pounds 4.71m on turnover of Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 37.8m). Mr Way said diversification was essential in the precision engineering division where margins continued to be under pressure and order intakes were down because of cuts in defence expenditure. A programme was under way to shift the customer base of Bellhouse Hartwell and BHW (Components) and penetrate the civil sector. A final dividend of 1.5p (1.2p) makes a 2p (1.6p) total. Earnings were 3.06p (0.96p).</p>

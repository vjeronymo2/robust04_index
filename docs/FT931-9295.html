			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Little engine who can't: Rail faces an uphill struggle in boosting its share of the freight market Rail freight is a bit like motherhood and apple pie: everyone agrees it is a good thing, if the alternative is juggernauts thundering through their towns and villages. Everyone, apparently, except Britain's freight carriers. In the last few weeks, there has been an exodus of freight from rail. Hundreds of thousands of tonnes have switched to road in response to price increases imposed by British Rail. Even before that, the UK's rail freight industry was in a parlous state. Now it is shrinking to the point where it seems possible to ask whether it has any future at all. Once the question would have been dismissed as ludicrous. Rail dominated the freight industry for a century until well after the second world war. But since 1955, when cheaper and more flexible road transport first started to outstrip it, rail freight has been in remorseless decline. Today, it accounts for barely 10 per cent of inland tonnage moved. The explanation is straightforward enough. Rail freight is best suited to the movement of large quantities of heavy bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore or steel from one rail-connected point to another. A good example is BR's highly profitable business moving coal from pits to power stations on so-called merry-go-round trains. The decline of rail freight in Britain mirrors the changing structure of British industry. Rail's heyday came at a time when British manufacturing was dominated by heavy industries concentrated in huge industrial plants, each with their own railway siding. Today's manufacturing is lighter and highly dispersed -  and modern management techniques require it to deliver its products in small batches 'just in time', not by the trainload once a week. Even so, it might seem puzzling that rail cannot offer an alternative to the long-distance lorry traffic pounding up the motorway from, say, London to Manchester. Surely it would make sense to put 30 or more lorry loads at a time on to a single train hauled by one engine with one driver? It might, if only the railways went where the freight wanted to go. As it is, the freight has to be taken by road to the nearest railhead, unloaded onto a freight wagon, formed into a train for the long-distance part of the haul, then unloaded on to another lorry for delivery to its final destination. So costly are these transfers between road and rail, and so cheap is the road transport alternative, that the economics only shift in rail's favour for distances of 500 miles or more -  far greater than the average freight haul in a country as small as Britain. The result is that BR nowadays carries an astonishingly narrow range of freight. Most of it is bulk commodities: coal, steel, aggregates and fuel. The rest is mainly container traffic from ports, which can be unloaded directly onto rail without a costly road transfer and transported to regional distribution centres for collection. Now, even these few remaining freight flows are in jeopardy. The biggest - coal -  is threatened by pit closures. On top of that, about 2m tonnes of other freight has been lost to road transport in the past few weeks as a result of price increases imposed by BR. The reason for those is that BR's freight operations are unsubsidised, and BR is under a long-standing government remit to turn them into profit. It is lagging badly behind - they lost Pounds 51m last year. So is this the end of the line for rail freight in Britain? Not quite, perhaps. There are a couple of bright spots on the horizon. One is the opening of the Channel tunnel, which will link Britain's railway system with France's and make rail a more attractive option for long-haul freight traffic to the Continent. More significant for domestic rail freight, however, is the prospect of railway privatisation. Theoretically, if one accepts that private enterprise is more efficient than the public sector, this should bring costs down and make rail more competitive with road. But privatisation also carries a threat -  the current level of BR's freight losses implies that a great deal more traffic will have to be shed before the freight businesses are profitable enough to be sold. There is, however, another wrinkle to privatisation. Last week Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, responded to widespread concern over rail freight's decline by outlining a surprise package of assistance for the industry as part of the privatisation package. Lorries involved in combined transport operations -  that is, switching their loads to rail for the long-distance part of their journey - would be allowed to operate to a maximum weight of 44 tonnes instead of the 38 tonnes now permitted. And a new system of grants would offer freight operators money towards the cost of equipment and track charges if that was what it took to persuade them to use rail in preference to road. The second of these is a bold step. But the government has yet to indicate what its budget for these grants will be. Given the constraints on public spending, is it likely to be able to pay enough to make a significant difference? Under a more modest system of grants already in operation, rail freight operators can claim up to 60 per cent of the cost of certain capital equipment. So if a company spends Pounds 5m on a fleet of 25 rail wagons and two terminals for loading and unloading, it might qualify for Pounds 3m in grant over a 10-year period. In that time, those rail wagons might typically shift 12.5m tonnes of freight. On that basis, the subsidy works out at 24p a tonne. It doesn't sound much. But to put things in perspective, some 1.6bn tonnes of freight was moved by road last year. That suggests that shifting 10 per cent of it to rail would cost Pounds 38.4m a year in subsidies. And with lorry traffic forecast to double by 2025, the bill for halting that growth would soar ever higher. There is, of course, another solution. If rail cannot compete with road on price, an alternative to subsidising rail is to make road transport more expensive. The government already seems to be heading in this direction. Mr MacGregor has announced plans to bring out a green paper this spring paving the way for tolls on trunk roads and motorways, and is sympathetic towards the idea of road pricing in urban areas. But neither road pricing nor subsidies -  nor both combined -  will reverse the roles of rail and road in freight. Most road freight nowadays would not switch to rail at any price because railways cannot provide the same flexibility. Railways will never deliver food to high street stores, nor collect it from the farms where it was produced. They are destined to stay on the margin of freight, doing only what they do best. The only question is how wide that margin is -  and how much society is prepared to pay for it.</p>

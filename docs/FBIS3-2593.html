			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by LIEN HO PAO Group news team: </F> "CPPCC Member Bluntly Says CPC Indulges in Idle Talk"]    [Text] The Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] began its panel discussions yesterday. Many  members launched fierce verbal attacks on the agriculture and  education issues and on fighting corruption and promoting clean  government. Getting worked up, one member blurted out: "What  the CPC is saying is idle talk."    CPPCC members have more complaints about the issue of  fighting corruption and promoting clean government. A member  said: In his report to the preparatory meeting of the CPPCC on  anticorruption work launched last August, Wei Jianxing,  secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, said  that the central authorities had investigated and dealt with  eight major cases. This fully shows the determination of the  central authorities to fight corruption. However, this member  suggested that the central authorities should persist in  fighting and stamping out corruption. Especially as the current  methods of offering and taking bribes are being renewed all the  time and when there is neither a third party present nor a  receipt written in the course of handing over and taking bribe  money, it is difficult to investigate and deal with such cases.  Moreover, since corruption is widespread in economic  departments, it is even more necessary to sternly stamp out  corruption there.</p>

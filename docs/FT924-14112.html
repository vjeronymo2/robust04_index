			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Trafalgar House chairman to give up control SIR Nigel Broackes is to relinquish control of Trafalgar House, the property, construction and shipping group. Sir Nigel, who founded the group more than 30 years ago, is to step down as chairman and become life president. This is expected to be an honorary consultancy post without an automatic seat on the board. The move is part of a series of managerial changes at the group, which has thwarted an attempt by Hongkong Land to increase its stake substantially. Sir Eric Parker is to step down as chief executive in favour of Mr Allan Gormly, head of the engineering division. Mr Alan Clements, the senior of the group's three non-executive directors, has drawn up a list of outside candidates to take over as chairman. Although the non executives, who include Mr David Howell, a senior Conservative MP, and Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA Group, helped draw up the boardroom changes some time ago, they decided against approaching any potential successor to Sir Nigel when Hongkong Land took 14.9 per cent of Trafalgar. The colony's leading property group will today confirm its failure to increase its stake in the tender offer by more than 1 per cent. Nonetheless, one of Trafalgar's financial advisers yesterday said the group would consider a request from Hongkong Land to have boardroom representation. Trafalgar's managerial changes will be discussed with Hongkong Land after Trafalgar's board meeting today. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman of JardineMatheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are keen to discuss Trafalgar's changes. Hongkong Land's agenda includes a significant say in the group's strategy. A senior Trafalgar executive said: 'As long as the Keswicks accept they are a minority shareholder and that the company has to look after the interests of all its shareholders we may look sympathetically on their request for boardroom representation.'</p>

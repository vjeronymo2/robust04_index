			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Letter: Selective briefings 'patently unfair' to the small investor Sir, I fully support the action of the London Stock Exchange in cracking down on selective leaking of price-sensitive information ('Crackdown on private briefings for analysts', May 15/16). As a hobby in my retirement, I am a small investor in the equity of London-listed companies. I believe that all the generally known facts relevant to making investment decisions are reflected in the price of a company's shares and, with this in mind, I have written a simple program in Basic which, when run on my pc, extracts this information and suggests which shares are a good buy. At present I scan 125 listed companies daily. I also use information acquired via the FT's 'Free annual report service' and the 'Directors' share transactions in their own companies' listed in the FT. I supplement this with data from Monday's FT and Extel cards. In each of the years that my program has influenced my share dealings, the increase in the net value (after allowing for actual buying and expected selling costs) of investments has comfortably exceeded the increase in the FT-SE 100 Index. Indeed, I would consider I had failed if it had not done so. It would seem patently unfair if, after I had taken all this trouble, a 'group of analysts and institutions' were handed, on a plate, price sensitive information denied to the rest of us.

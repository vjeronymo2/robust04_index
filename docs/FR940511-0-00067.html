			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> IV. Summary of Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The regulations set forth the boundary of the Sanctuary; prohibit a relatively narrow range of activities; set forth procedures for applying for national marine sanctuary permits to conduct prohibited activities; set forth certification procedures for existing leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations or rights authorizing the conduct of a prohibited activity; set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth notification and review procedures for applications for licenses, permits, or other authorizations to conduct a prohibited activity; set forth the maximum per-day penalties for violating Sanctuary regulations; and set forth procedures for administrative appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations are codified in part 925 of title 15, Code of Federal Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.1 sets forth as the purpose of the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to implement the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sanctuary by regulating activities affecting the Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the terms of that designation in order to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and manage the conservation, ecological, recreational, research,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational, historical and aesthetic resources and qualities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.2 and Appendix A following &sect;925.12 set forth the boundary of the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.3 defines various terms used in the regulations. Other terms appearing in the regulations are defined at 15 CFR 922.2 and/or in the MPRSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.4 allows all activities except those prohibited by &sect;925.5 to be undertaken subject to the requirements of any emergency regulation promulgated pursuant to &sect;925.6, subject to all prohibitions, restrictions and conditions validly imposed by any other authority of competent jurisdiction, and subject to the liability established by Section 312 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 925.5 prohibits a variety of activities and thus makes it unlawful for any person to conduct them or cause them to be conducted. However, any of the prohibited activities except for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The exploration for, development or production of oil, gas or minerals in the Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The discharge of primary-treated sewage within the Sanctuary (except pursuant to certification under &sect;925.10, of a valid authorization in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation and issued by other authorities of competent jurisdiction);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The disposal of dredged material within the Sanctuary other than in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with beach nourishment projects related to harbor maintenance activities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Bombing activities within the Sanctuary could be conducted lawfully if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The activity is necessary to respond to an emergency threatening life, property, or the environment (not applicable to the prohibitions against takings and interference with law enforcement); necessary for valid law enforcement purposes; authorized by a National Marine Sanctuary permit issued under &sect;925.9 (not applicable to the prohibition against interference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with law enforcement); or authorized by a Special Use Permit issued under Section 310 of the Act (not applicable to the prohibition against interference with law enforcement);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) With regard to Department of Defense activities: (A) the activity is an existing military activity including hull integrity tests and other deep water tests; live firing of guns, missiles, torpedoes, and chaff; activities associated with the Quinault Range including the in-water testing of non-explosive torpedoes; and anti-submarine warfare operations, or (B) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity is a new activity and exempted by the Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee after consultation between the Director or designee and the Department of Defense. The regulations require that the Department of Defense carry out its activities in a manner that avoids to the maximum extent practicable any adverse impact on Sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources and qualities and that it, in the event of threatened or actual destruction of, loss of, or injury to a Sanctuary resource or quality resulting from an untoward incident, including but not limited to spills and groundings, caused by it, promptly coordinate with the Director or designee for the purpose of taking appropriate actions to respond to and mitigate the harm and, if possible, restore or replace the Sanctuary resource or quality. The final regulation regarding Department of Defense activities differs from the proposed regulation principally by prohibiting all bombing activities within the Sanctuary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The activity is authorized by a certification by the Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee under &sect;924.10 of a valid lease, permit, license or other authorization issued by any Federal, State or local authority of competent jurisdiction and in existence on (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted pursuant to any valid right of subsistence use or access in existence on) the effective date of this designation, subject to complying with any terms and conditions imposed by the Director or designee as he or she deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated, except that treaty rights of a Federally recognized Indian tribe may be exercised by the tribe without certification by the Director or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The activity is authorized by a valid lease, permit, license, or other authorization issued by any Federal, State or local authority of competent jurisdiction after the effective date of Sanctuary designation, provided that the Director of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee was notified of the application in accordance with the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;925.11, the applicant complies with the requirements of &sect;925.11, the Director or designee notifies the applicant and authorizing agency that he or she does not object to issuance of the authorization, and the applicant complies with any terms and conditions the Director or designee deems necessary to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

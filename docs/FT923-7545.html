			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Management: Will you hold? - With 45,000 of its staff applying for voluntary redundancy, BT has had to be selective On the last Friday in July 19,000 British Telecom employees across the UK cleared their desks, said goodbye to their colleagues and left work for the last time. Over the coming months thousands more will join this exodus: the company calculates 33,000 of its 210,000 workforce will go during this financial year. The sheer scale of the redundancy programme has been unmatched by anything else in British industry in a single year since the coal-field closures of the 1980s. The opportunity to shed staff has been presented by technological advances, stimulated by competitive pressures and the example of US telecommunications companies' lean staffing. However, greatest of all has been pressure on the bottom line: pre-tax profits in the quarter to June fell nearly 30 per cent, and the pressure will continue now that BT has been forced by its regulator to adopt a stricter pricing regime. The job cuts are also set to continue. By 1996 the workforce may well have dropped to 130,000 employees or fewer - a 38 per cent reduction on numbers at the beginning of this financial year. Even more remarkable than the scale of the operation is the fact that all redundancies have been voluntary. Indeed, the exit package offered by BT has been so popular - it was more than 50 per cent oversubscribed - that a new piece of jargon has passed into industrial relations language. Union leaders at BT now complain of 'compulsory retention' where they once spoke of the threat of compulsory redundancies. The main BT union, the National Communications Union, has moved a long way towards accepting the inevitable: in the days when it tried to fight privatisation with industrial action it would certainly also have been manning the barricades over job losses on the current scale. Instead, the NCU speaks with pride about the terms of the package it has negotiated. The NCU's membership will be decimated but its leaders console themselves with having achieved what Tony Young, general secretary, calls a redundancy package that is 'one of the best in the UK'. Release 92, as the package is called, is made up of the following elements: Redundancy compensation of up to three years' pay, depending on age, length of service and which of two pension schemes an individual belongs to. Pension and pension-related lump sum, dependent on the same criteria. Early-leaver bonus of 25 per cent of annual pay for those who left before or during July. Employees leaving before October get bonuses on a sliding scale of between 10 and 20 per cent of pay. Pay in lieu of notice for those who left before the end of July. Counselling and outplacement services to identify skills and training needs, and provide advice on preparing CVs. 'Job shops' provide details of vacancies, word processors and telephones. Retraining costs of up to Pounds 1,000. A tie-up with two employment agencies - Skillbase for managers and professionals, Manpower for engineers, operators and clerical staff - providing opportunities for temporary work within BT and other telecoms companies. Payments to some employees quitting the company will be as high as Pounds 100,000 plus pension entitlement, although pay-offs of around Pounds 30,000 are more common. Overall, BT estimates the deal will cost more than Pounds 1bn. Expensive but successful - that is the official BT verdict on Release 92. However, behind the scenes the company is attempting to answer some awkward questions about whether the package was pitched at the right level. It also has to deal with what it admits are continuing severe morale problems and a complex redistribution of the workforce. Judging from the demand from employees to leave, it appears that in the management's anxiety to recruit enough volunteers, and win union support, the deal was over-generous. The final figures speak for themselves. Some 29,000 employees are being allowed to leave (the balance of job losses will come from natural wastage and the sale of some businesses). However, nearly 45,000 applied to go. Demand was whipped up to some extent by management warnings that the generous terms of Release 92 would never again be available. It was also made clear that more jobs would go over the next two or three years. Poor morale born of constant policy changes and insecurity about future prospects, say the unions, was another factor which inflated demand. It has been claimed that many employees were misled about their chances of being able to collect the redundancy package and start new lives. The NCU is supporting appeals by employees who, for example, took leases on business premises and raised loans in the expectation - allegedly fuelled by their line managers - that they would be able to leave under Release 92. Says Young: 'They created a climate of expectation they couldn't hope to fulfil in the end.' Michael Hepher, group managing director, told staff last month: 'We have said repeatedly . . . that BT could not undertake to release everyone who asked to go, but with hindsight, we should have reinforced this message at every one-to-one interview.' Young claims that, as the cut-off date of July 17 approached, Release 92 'spun out of control'. When it became clear that take-up had been seriously misjudged, managers were given the invidious job of rejecting candidates who showed merit. An internal memo at the time made it clear that certain categories of applicant should be retained. Those whose appraisals had marked them out as sound performers with potential for promotion, for example, were rejected. Those with long service (the most expensive to pay off) were also less likely to get through. Unions complained that employees were being punished for being loyal and capable. It was decided at the last minute to extend Release 92 to 8,500 more employees than had originally been intended. David Scott, BT's industrial relations manager, denies the programme was out of control but concedes there was 'certainly a lot of quick thinking going on'. Now BT is turning its attention from those clearing their desks to those who will remain. The priority is maintaining customer service: last time staff numbers were cut, following privatisation, consumer complaints soared and recruitment had to be increased again. Redeployment to fill some of the worst gaps is now urgent, as is restoring morale among the 16,000 staff who thought they would be attending their own leaving parties this year.</p>

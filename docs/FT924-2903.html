			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / French banks seek government help over bad property loans FRANCE'S leading banks have appealed to the government for help over bad debts estimated at up to FFr80bn (Pounds 9.7bn) among their property loans of around FFr250bn. Mr Michel Freyche, president of the Association Francaise des Banques (AFB), said proposals put to the finance ministry at the beginning of the week were greeted with 'an attentive and understanding ear'. He could not give details, although it is understood that one option tabled by the AFB is for cheap refinancing of troubled loans through the Banque de France. Another is the creation of a state-guaranteed property fund which would provide cheap cash to refinance dud property loans. The move comes after a series of heavy property provisions by French banks, which lent generously to property developers and dealers to undertake speculative commercial property deals in central Paris during the market upturn which went into reverse after 1990. Last week, the UAP insurance group had to provide FFr1.4bn of capital for Banque Worms, its banking unit, to cover losses on its Parisian property portfolio. The banking system needs to write down between FFr70bn and FFr80bn of their FFr250bn of total property loans to reflect the decline in values, estimated Mr Michel Rougier, president of the Paris commercial court, in a recent paper. Mr Philippe Bastien, property analyst at the Paris office of James Capel, estimates that the banks have FFr200bn of loans outstanding to professional developers alone. Of this, he estimates that 20 per cent - FFr40bn - are so doubtful that the banks should make provisions for them. A provision of that size would wipe out many banks' profits if taken in a single year, given that the entire French banking system made a net profit of only FFr11.1bn last year on its domestic business. Insurance companies are understood to have been exchanging property investments between each other recently at high prices to prop up values. A spokeswoman for AGF, the state-owned insurance group which has a FFr7bn property portfolio, denied this, but said that insurance companies did trade properties with each other to register profits on properties held for long periods.</p>

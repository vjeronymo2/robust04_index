			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KID STUFF: SHIFTING SANDS;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR COMPETITION PUTS CASTLE SCULPTING IN THE HANDS OF ARCHITECTS  </P> <P> The august members of the Orange County chapter of the American Institute of  Architects are out to boost their image. And if it takes crawling around in the  sand to do it, well, all the better.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Sept. 30, local architects, landscape architects and affiliated  professionals will scoop, shape and otherwise manipulate the sands of Corona  del Mar State Beach in the second annual AIA/Orange County Invitational  Sandcastle Competition. Spectators can watch the pros at work from 10 a.m. to 3  p.m., then cast their ballots for their favorite entry. An awards ceremony will  follow at 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Twenty-five teams are scheduled to compete, according to event spokeswoman  Loralyn Reif, who called the contest "the last, and hopefully the best, of the  three major sandcastle competitions" in the county. (The United Way and Newport  Seafest sponsored large contests earlier this month.)  </P> <P> "These are professionals in design creating absolutely spectacular sand  sculptures and castles," Reif said. "The end results are amazing; it almost  becomes a mini-Disneyland."  </P> <P> "One of the main goals of the chapter is to increase architectural awareness in  Orange County, and we feel this event is a fun way to do just that," she  continued, adding that more than 2,000 spectators attended last year's event.  </P> <P> Competitors will be working in two major categories, sand sculptures and  sandcastles, said Reif, who expects this year's entries to be evenly split  between the two.  </P> <P> "Sand sculptures tend to be more free form," she explained, "ranging anywhere  from an alligator to a palm tree. For example, last year's grand prize winner,  Joseph Woollett &amp; Associates, interpreted classical Greek ruins. Another  team created this big foot about to step on a figure of a man, and called it  'Under Pressure.' " A sandcastle takes a more traditional form and is generally  outfitted with moats, turrets and drawbridges, she said.  </P> <P> A panel of judges, including Tony DeLap, a sculptor and UCI instructor; Cathy  Curtis, a Times staff writer who covers art for the Orange County edition, and  David Smith of Newport's World Famous Architects, will award three prizes in  each division, as well as an overall Grand Prize. Judges will focus on  originality of design, best use of site, degree of difficulty and detail, and  execution. Onlookers can cast their ballots for a special People's Choice  award.  </P> <P> The decisions won't be easy. When they're not shaping office towers and elegant  homes, many of these professionals work as master sand sculptors, competing in  sandcastle contests around the globe, including the prestigious U.S. Open  Sandcastle Competition, held for the past 12 years at Imperial Beach in San  Diego. Typical of these are the husband-and-wife team of Gregory and Leslie  Lebon, who recently created a 35-foot-high "city of the future," complete with  eight-foot bridges and a walk-through viewer's path, for the Sand Craft  Festival in Kamaishi, Japan.  </P> <P> "To the architects, it's a matter of pride" in their craft, said Reiff. "But  sand sculpting is one of those things that can start out as a hobby, and before  you know it, you're addicted to it."  </P> <P> What  </P> <P> The 1990 AIA/Orange County Invitational Sandcastle Competition.  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Sunday, Sept. 30.

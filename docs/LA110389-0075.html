			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY JUDGE IN MONTOYA CASE BERATES PROSECUTION  </P> <P> Preparing to preside over the political corruption trial of Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya (D-Whittier), an angry federal judge on Thursday berated prosecutors  for waiting until the last minute to amend the charges against the lawmaker and  his former aide, Amiel A. Jaramillo.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Milton L. Schwartz accused the U.S. attorney's office here  of being unfair to both defendants in the case when it asked for and got a  revised grand jury indictment against the defendants last month, less than two  months before their scheduled Dec. 4 trial.  </P> <P> Schwartz pointed out that prosecutors led by U.S. Atty. David F. Levi have had  since August, 1988 -- when federal agents raided the Capitol offices of Montoya  and others -- to file their charges.  </P> <P> "After all this time, we have some new ideas, we want some more," the judge  said, referring to the revised indictment.  </P> <P> "If you think I'm angry, that's such an understatement, it's almost a lie," he  said, adding, "We are playing games, folks, and you're not going to play games  with me."  </P> <P> Because of the amended indictment, Jaramillo's attorney asked for a delay in  the start-up date for the trial. But Montoya and his lawyer have repeatedly  said they want the case settled so that the senator can run for reelection next  year.  </P> <P> Schwartz complained, "I am going to have to try this case twice," before  agreeing to grant Jaramillo a delay and a separate trial. Montoya's case will  stay on a schedule.  </P> <P> Montoya said in a brief interview with The Times that he was anxious to get the  case behind him so he can mount an effective political campaign.  </P> <P> "The people in my district support me," Montoya explained. "But the opinion  makers want to see how this turns out."  </P> <P> Montoya and Jaramillo have been charged with a total of 16 counts of extortion,  racketeering, bribery and conspiracy.  </P> <P> The case against Montoya centers on a $3,000 honorarium he accepted in June,  1988, from undercover FBI agents who were posing as businessmen and seeking  support for special-interest bills that would benefit their phony company. The  undercover agents were part of a 3 1/2-year federal sting operation called  Brispec (for Bribery -- Special Interest).  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: CHILDREN ADVISE THEIR PARENTS TO WISE UP  </P> <P> Listen up!  </P> <P> That might be the best advice anyone could give a parent.  </P> <P> Listen to what your children have to say. They are, after all, real people with  real emotions and real problems.  </P> <P> And, sometimes, surprising wisdom.  </P> <P> A case in point is a bundle of letters Family Life received last week from  members of Linda Yeoman's fifth-grade class at Cloverdale Elementary School in  Irvine. They were responding to a question posed in this column about  allowances and forms of punishment.  </P> <P> They expanded on their views when I visited them in the classroom this week.  </P> <P> About half of the class of 10-year-olds (15 of 33) said their parents spank  them for rules infractions, while the rest receive other forms of punishment --  from losing privileges to being restricted to being yelled at.  </P> <P> To a person, they oppose spanking, not because it hurts but because they see it  as ineffective. They also find shouting ineffective.  </P> <P> And they get confused when Mom and Dad argue in front of them over punishment.  </P> <P> Their preference? About what you and I want out of our relationships, personal  or professional: a little reason.  </P> <P> Leila Attari urges parents to establish "fair rules." She would punish her  child "by talking (the problem) over and then listen to what the child has to  say."  </P> <P> Alysia Atchley endorses her parents' approach and says she would treat her  children the same way. "I am sent to the corner with a chair. I sit there with  nothing to do but think (about what I'm being punished for)."  </P> <P> Sara Ashraf also backs her parents' approach but would add one thing: "My  parents explain to me what I did wrong and say not to do it again." With her  own children, she wrote, she would do the same thing, but "if they did it  again, I would yell at them."  </P> <P> Jenny Bell asks parents to understand that children know when they've done  something wrong and that knowledge is punishment enough. She is punished by  losing television privileges. "That does not bother me," she wrote. "What  bothers me is my guiltiness . . . and if I were a parent, I would try to  understand that they feel guilty."  </P> <P> Johnathon Doan, 10, says he gets "spanked and yelled at at the same time," and  while he admits it works, he would just "yell at them and then tell them what  they should and shouldn't do."  </P> <P> Nana Ito's mother should be happy to hear that she would handle her own  children "by talking to them just like my mom to show her that I learned a lot  from her."  </P> <P> Michael Flowers likes the idea of using what he called "sycology." For example,  "if my child stole something, I would steal something from him, then say, 'Now  you know how it feels.' "  </P> <P> Allison Friedland says children would remember wrongdoing "if they had to write  it down and take it to their room and think about it and then talk it over with  their parents."  </P> <P> These and other children in the Cloverdale class also suggest that parents try  to avoid jumping to conclusions, to take a more judicial approach to a problem  by calmly weighing both the facts and their responses.  </P> <P> Those with brothers and sisters all said they had been punished for things they  had not done (although they also admitted to keeping mum while watching the  same thing happen to their siblings).  </P> <P> In essence, what they ask of their parents is to treat their children as they  would want to be treated themselves.  </P> <P> Pretty sound advice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Making Allowances  </P> <P> Do you give your children an allowance? If so, how much do they get and on what  is the rate based?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spare the Rod  </P> <P> How do you punish your children -- by spanking them or by restricting their  activities? Or do you have some other method? We'd like to know.  </P> <P> Send your comments to Family Life, Orange County Life, The Times, 1375  Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

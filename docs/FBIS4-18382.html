			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, March 31 (AFP) -- Poland and Hungary asked  Thursday [31 March] to be considered for early associate  membership of the Western European Union [WEU].    Poland's ambassador to France, Jerzy Lukaszewski, told a  press conference with his Hungarian counterpart Janos Szavai  that they wanted their countries' membership in the military  alliance to be considered at a WEU ministerial meeting in May.    The two countries are already members of the Partnership for  Peace initiative, which gives former Warsaw Pact members closer  cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,  ultimately with a view to full NATO membership.    Thursday's press conference was called ahead of the two  countries' official applications to join the European Union,  both due to be handed in in early April. They hope to become  members by 2000.    Lukaszewski said EU membership would provide "the best  way...of ensuring a democratic future and security" for his  country, as well as "something useful for the European Union."</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Khmer Rouge leader pays homage to king MR Khieu Samphan, president of the radical Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, yesterday arrived in the capital, Phnom Penh, for talks with King Norodom Sihanouk, writes Iain Simpson in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge is at its lowest ebb for almost three decades, having suffered several military setbacks in the past six weeks. On his arrival, Mr Khieu said he had come to 'pay our respectful homage' to King Sihanouk, and to show Khmer Rouge support for the monarchy and for the new Cambodian constitution. However, he avoided mentioning the new government, which the group has repeatedly attacked via its clandestine radio station. The day before his arrival in the city, the two Cambodian prime ministers wrote to Mr Khieu, laying out the conditions for their holding peace talks with the Khmer Rouge. These included its recognition of what they called the 'royal and legitimate government', and its acceptance that the talks would be between a legal government and a group, not between two equal entities. The Khmer Rouge responded with its own proposal of a ceasefire monitored by an independent commission.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Instead of a truce, the noose is tightening  round the criminals, especially in the capital, where people are  fleeing the fighting en masse and also because they are  expecting a final assault to take place soon after the departure  of all [foreign] nationals and UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda] Blue Berets.

In this regard, those who were involved in  organizing the events have cleared off with their families. For  instance, reports say that 200 people are stuck at Bujumbura  international airport waiting to be evacuated to France. They  have asked France to grant them asylum. Burundi gave them 36  hours to allow France to decide their case. [passage omitted]</p>

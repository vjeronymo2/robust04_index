			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs unsettled A firm start to the day by the recently strongly performing drugs sector was sharply reversed just before the close of trading as the market picked up the scent of news of imminent price cuts about to be instigated by one of the leading drugs suppliers. Rhone Poulenc was said to be about to cut prices in a move expected to be followed by other drug firms. Glaxo, especially, was said to be exposed by price cutting moves and the shares fell heavily in late trading to close a net 12 1/2 off at 516 1/2 p, not too far from the stocks' 1993 low of 509p. Turnover was a hefty 2.3m. SmithKline Beecham also suffered, the shares drifting back from an opening 450p to close a net 11 off at 438p on 935,000 shares traded, while Wellcome dropped 22 to 654p.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden 46% ahead to Pounds 16.5m - Housebuilder cautions on August sales / Repair and DIY market still in doldrums Pre-tax profits of Wilson Bowden jumped 46 per cent to Pounds 16.5m during the first six months of this year - after discounting a 'one-off Pounds 5.5m pension fund surplus' in the first half of 1993. However, Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive, struck a cautious note following reports last week that new house sales had recovered sharply during August from disappointing levels in June and July. He said: 'Our sales are slightly higher than in August last year, but no-where near the margin suggested by other builders.' Persimmon, the country's eighth largest housebuilder, had said that its August sales were a quarter higher than last year. Mr Wilson said his company traditionally did better in September and October, but there were signs that the market was beginning to improve. Its sales in southern England last week were double those of the corresponding week last year, although sales in the Midlands were only slightly higher. The company is increasing its interim dividend by 7.5 per cent to 2.85p after earnings per share rose by a fifth to 11.8p, excluding last year's pension fund surplus and reflecting last November's Pounds 57m rights issue. Housebuilding profits rose by 56 per cent to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 8.7m). The number of houses sold increased by 17 to 965, while operating margins increased from 13.4 per cent to 15.5 per cent, which Mr Wilson claimed was the best in the sector. Margins were boosted by a 15.3 per cent rise in the average price from Pounds 78,900 to Pounds 91,000. Of this about 3 per cent represented a genuine price rise and removal of discounts; the remainder reflected a change in product to more expensive, higher-margin properties. Increased volumes for the same fixed overheads also helped enhance margins. Mr Wilson said the company had used up most of the more expensive land bought in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He remained concerned about government environmental policies stifling the supply of land for house-building, although the big increases in prices paid for land had slowed since the beginning of the year. COMMENT It is difficult to find areas to improve when you are already top of the class. Less well managed competitors, which have more to gain from a housing recovery, receive buy recommendations for their shares while most of Wilson Bowden's virtues are already in its price. One area of gain may be commercial property where profits, in spite of a slip to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4m) at the half year, are likely to be comfortably above last year's Pounds 6m. The company has reported an upsurge in demand for industrial units. The balance sheet remains strong in spite of recent land purchases. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 37m this year and Pounds 47m next place the shares on prospective multiples of approaching 16 and almost 13 respectively - high enough at this stage of the recovery.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (8): A tale of mutual suspicion - William Dawkins probes the complexities of Franco-Japan relations IF ASKED to name the prickliest industrialised western power, many Japanese would probably cite France. Paris's attitude to Tokyo has been sensitive ever since General de Gaulle insultingly described a visiting Japanese prime minister as a transistor salesman. Former French prime minister Edith Cresson's description of Japan as a nation of ants shows that some circles at least still recently held serious anxieties over a Japanese threat. However, Mrs Cresson's anti-Japanese gibes were made two years ago. Since then, the Paris government has staged a sustained diplomatic charm offensive and its complexes about Japan have begun to melt. NEC, the electronics company, has been allowed to take a stake in Bull, the French state-owned computer maker formerly seen as an exclusive national asset, while the Paris government hardly turned a hair when state-owned Renault's Swedish partner Volvo, formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi. The two countries' bilateral relationship is of secondary value to both, since their diplomacy centres on bigger partners with whom they also have occasionally uneasy relationships; Germany in France's case and the US in Japan's. Yet this odd couple is important because revealing parallels lie just under their differences. This will surprise most people, for whom Japan and France could not be more of a contrast. On the diplomatic front, both are grappling with the changes caused by the break up of the Soviet Union, and producing very different responses. France uneasily faces a stronger Germany but vigorously defends its position as a top European power, while Japan has yet to carve out a role for itself in a confused and potentially volatile south-east Asia as its security links with the US become less important. Meanwhile, Tokyo's traditional reluctance to assert itself - never a French problem - faces an unprecedented test in the face of the Clinton administration's demands for better access for US exports. On the domestic front, one factor that successive French and Japanese governments have in common is that they have for decades believed that the state should take a hand in valuable national industries. While the results of intervention have been dramatically different in Japan and France, the assumptions are similar. There are differences in approach, in that the Japanese state's guiding hand is traditionally subtle and appears to follow or anticipate the market's natural direction, rather than try to shape it, while France is well known for the heavy industrial interventionism it has practised through its extensive public sector. Yet their approaches have converged slightly in recent years. France's new centre-right government has accelerated the reduction in industrial intervention cautiously begun by the Socialists. Meanwhile, Japan's conservative government has returned to intervention to soften the economic downturn. The bureaucracies that carry out and help shape these policies also have similarities. Both are controlled by a tiny civil service elite, that carries enormous weight in their finance and industry ministries. The members of these public administration elites are both drawn from a meritocratic and demanding state education system. In France's case, the inner circle will often consist of graduates of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (Ena), a prestigious civil service college set up after the second world war to help rebuild the shattered public administration. The nearest Japanese equivalent is Tokyo University law department, whose brilliant young graduates took a prominent part in targeting key sectors for development in Japan's high-speed post war economic growth. One key contrast is that Ena graduates move between the civil service and politics much more often than the top people in Japan's public administration, though in both countries there is a steady flow of senior public servants into business. The aims and the structure of the two public administrations are, however, very different. France, for example, has no equivalent of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), the powerful department which has co-ordinated industrial policy since before the second world war. THE Paris government did once flirt with the idea of creating a French Miti, when Mrs Cresson tried to create a super-ministry, embracing industry, telecommunications, trade and part of the finance ministry - perhaps a sign that her attitude to Japan concealed some admiration. But the finance minister of the time, the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy, managed to sink the scheme, a grave threat to his own ministry's traditional dominance. Japan has responded calmly to French complexes over its economic power and intentions. Its government has delivered no verbal counterblasts. Nevertheless, Nissan and Toyota quietly shunned France in their first wave of plant investment in Europe, despite France's geographical advantage at the heart of the European single market. This continues to be an irritant, as France has emerged with Italy as a leader in attempts to curb exports from UK-based Japanese car plants, described by Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot, as a Japanese aircraft carrier moored off the coast of Europe. By contrast, some French politicians, such as Mr Roger Fauroux, former industry minister, sincerely regret missing out on these prestige investments. French investment in Japan is unsurprisingly minimal, yet France has not done too badly in attracting Japanese investment, despite missing the car plants. Datar, the French regional development agency, recently counted 122 Japanese companies in France, the second best European score after Britain's 187, though the gap is much wider in cash terms. All this has done nothing to diminish Japanese consumers' love affair with French culture of all kinds. Japanese consumers still continue to represent one of the biggest markets for French luxury goods as well as an increasingly substantial slice of tourist income, as the yen's strength reduces the price of a Parisian holiday for Japanese travellers. Japan continues to be one of the largest markets for French art, as can be seen by the paintings that continue to hang in the Tokyo head offices of banks and industrial companies, despite the economic slowdown. On both sides, the relationship is complex, mingled with admiration and apprehension.</p>

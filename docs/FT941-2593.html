			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: What the experts say . . . PETER SMITH, of financial adviser Hill Martin, believes the total return theory is suitable only for those with a large portfolio. Others could easily run the risk of simply eroding their capital, especially in a falling market. His favourite recommendations for income-seekers are the income shares of split-capital investment trusts. Exeter High Income is a unit trust which invests in these and has a yield of about 8.5 per cent gross. 'You can still take 5-6 per cent net from insurance bonds if you are a nervous equity investor and European bonds are paying 6.5-7 per cent gross,' Smith says. Smith advises those who still keep a large amount of money in the bank to transfer it into a building society postal account, at least. 'There is not much wrong with cash at the moment. If inflation was high, it would be a different matter.' To those approaching retirement, he says: 'People tell you not to buy an annuity at the moment on the basis that interest rates are supposed to shoot up again. I just don't believe this will happen. You can choose an escalating annuity which will guarantee your income and pay an increasing amount each year.' ROBERT NOBLE WARREN, of financial adviser Murray Noble, believes that since most funds cannot beat the average stock market indices, an index fund, which aims simply to track the indices is a good idea, particularly since charges are lower than on other funds. His advice to income-seekers? 'Buy index funds with low annual charges, such as Morgan Grenfell's UK Tracker; pay attention to tax-favoured investments and tax-saving arrangements so as to use all personal allowances (you can save 1 per cent a year by doing so); and consider spreading the income risk into other European countries such as French Eurobonds, yielding 6 per cent or more, and Spanish deposits. Fidelity Money Funds (Bermuda) Spanish Peseta has a yield of over 7.5 per cent.' He adds: 'We still favour split-level investment trusts if you really have to seek out a high income, at the risk of capital. The M&amp;G Dual yields 28.8 per cent with capital depreciation, while New Throgmorton is on 10.4 per cent. 'We don't expect dividends to increase much, so we don't think there is any way round taking the gains from the portfolio to make up income. So, if you have to get over 5 per cent income, you are going to have to take some of it from capital.'</p>

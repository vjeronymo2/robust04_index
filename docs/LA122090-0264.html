			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BERTOLUCCI CLEAR FOR BUDDHA FILM  </P> <P> Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci can go ahead with a movie on the life  of Buddha. A London court Wednesday rejected a Hong Kong company's bid for an  injunction stopping the director.  </P> <P> Waco Productions Ltd. of Hong Kong announced plans in September to make a film  based on the life of Buddha to be directed by Bertolucci, whose previous films  include "The Last Emperor," "Last Tango in Paris" and his newest, "The  Sheltering Sky."  </P> <P> But negotiations broke down, and the director announced that he was seeking  financial backers for an independent project on the same theme.  </P> <P> The film company claimed the idea for the film and a historical synopsis shown  to Bertolucci were original and confidential and sought an injunction to stop  him from exploiting the material.  </P> <P> The court agreed that Waco Productions Ltd. Chairman Richard Colson had spent  time and $1.4 million on planning for the film.  </P> <P> But the judge said that no injunction could be granted in such broad terms and  that there was no evidence that Bertolucci was in any way threatening to use  any original or confidential ideas from Waco.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Party member Abel Matutes by </F> Victorino R. de Azua in Madrid; date not given: "Matutes:  `Today We Represent Modernity and Convergence With Europe'"]    [Text] Madrid -- He earned his first million kicking a  soccer ball around for Espanol de Barcelona [soccer club]; at  the same time he was studying law and economic science. He is  proud to have created "about 4,000 jobs" with his companies.  Abel Matutes, a 52-year-old Ibizan, married with four children,  left his job as European commissioner for transport and energy  on Wednesday [27 April] after handing in his resignation to  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Since yesterday, he is now  merely the People's Party "number one" for the European  Parliament [EP] elections. He returns from Brussels with some  40 decorations of the highest order, awarded to him, as he  explains with satisfaction, by many other countries for his  contribution to international cooperation and the defense of  democracy in countries as far away as Chile and the Philippines.    [de Azua] Are these elections bound to focus on the  corruption scandals?    [Matutes] That is not my wish, and I hope they will not. The  People's Party can win them outright through its own programs  and by the fact that the best men and women are on our side,  although the corruption issue will inevitably have an effect and  will form a backcloth to the elections.    [de Azua] Will the People's Party win the elections because  it is better than ever, or because the Spanish Socialist  Workers' Party [PSOE] is at its lowest-ever ebb?    [Matutes] The result of any election can always be put down  to a little of both, and always combines the merits of one party  with the faults of the other. It is true that, at the moment,  the PSOE has reached rock bottom, but it is also true that the  People's Party is putting itself forward as a reliable and  coherent alternative, with modern programs and in obvious  harmony with the actions of neighboring governments. All this  is being done under the clear and brilliant leadership of  [People's Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar who currently enjoys  undoubted popular support.    [de Azua] Could the apparent paralysis of the European plan  not increase the abstention rate? How do you intend getting  more people to vote?    [Matutes] The process of European construction has always  slowed down in times of recession. Economic crisis always leads  to "Europessimism" and "Eurosclerosis." The idea I am going to  defend vigorously is that we need a strong Spain and a strong  Europe. The People's Party today represents modernity and  convergence with Europe. For as long as we contribute actively  to European construction, we will be able to defend Spain's  vital interests without any complexes. People must come to vote  because, if they do not, they will have no right to complain  about the representatives they find themselves lumbered with.    [de Azua] What sets you apart from the Socialists when it  comes to representing the interests of the Spanish people?    [Matutes] There are basic aspects of European construction  that are subject to state policy, and in this respect there are  no major differences. However, the current government's policy  is not bringing us into line with the rest of Europe -- quite  the reverse: It is increasing the distance between us and  Europe. As a party from the same political family that is in  government in most European countries, we are the best placed to  bring about this convergence and to defend Spain's vital  interests.    [de Azua] But there has been a great deal of consensus where  European construction is concerned, and perhaps the voter can  see no clear difference between the People's Party's project and  that of the PSOE.    [Matutes] I must stress that we cannot base our action  solely  on a romantic idea of European construction. We must take  Spain's interests into account and defend them. In this way, in  the long term, we can prevent the Spanish people from feeling  overly frustrated.    [de Azua] Is the appointment of Celia Villalobos as your  number two an attempt to compensate for your lack of popularity?    [Matutes] Naturally, I do not claim to be able to compete in  the beauty stakes with the lovely Celia, and her appointment  seems to me to have been very well received. However, even  before it was known that she was to occupy such a high position,  I was very high in the personality polls, with an especially  good rating for my political profile and several points ahead of  the Socialist Party. If Celia and the other candidates score  highly in the popularity ratings, so much the better.</p>

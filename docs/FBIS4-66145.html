			<p>BFN     [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana is in Paris  for the Conference on Stability in Europe, where representatives  of 57 countries -- most of them foreign ministers of the  European Union [EU], Russia, and Canada -- are meeting. The aim  of this conference is to avoid new border and minority problems  in Central and East European countries that plan to join the EU.    [Begin recording] [Solana] What means do we have at our  disposal? We have the idea that, ultimately these countries  will become EU members. That is a good incentive. We can also  help them financially so some of these problems can be solved.  This is the aim of this conference, all of it in the framework  of the CSCE. We hope that in a year's time, that is to say in  1995, the situation will be stable. [end recording]</p>

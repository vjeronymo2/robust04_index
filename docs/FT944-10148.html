			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a slower day, but levels of volume remained encouraging and there was steady two-way business for most of the session, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading, the FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,107, down 8 points and standing at a premium to the cash market of 4 points. Fair value was around 6.5. Turnover came to 11,592 lots traded, down from 15,363 on Wednesday. There was no great weight of selling, and for much of the morning the premium to the cash market hovered around 20 points. Traders were encouraged by what they saw as broad resilience after the previous day's fireworks which ended with a 44-point gain on the back of a strong early Wall Street. Yesterday afternoon's proceedings were mostly left to the local, independent traders, with the bigger trading houses retiring to the sidelines once Wall Street showed signs of becoming more volatile. In late, screen based trading, the December contract dipped below 3,100, with contracts numbers rising to more than 13,500. Traded options volume was 24,636 lots, down from 35,998 on Wednesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading acounted for just under 13,000 contracts. Ladbroke, at 2,000 lots, was the most active individual stock option.</p>

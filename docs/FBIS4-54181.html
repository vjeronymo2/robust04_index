			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade  ministry official said Thursday Japan will basically respond  favorably to the latest U.S. request for including five  additional trade areas in priority sectors under the so-called  bilateral "framework" talks.    U.S. negotiators seem interested in discussing a wide range  of trade sectors with Japan in line with the framework's three  priority fields of government procurement, insurance services  and trade in auto and auto parts, said Hideaki Kumano, vice  international trade and industry minister, at a news conference.    The five areas cited by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor as new priority fields are financial services, sheet  glass, forestry products, intellectual property rights and  deregulation for supporting competition policy, according to  reports in Washington.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is prepared  to discuss the areas with Washington while working out a  timetable for talks, Kumano said.    Negotiations to establish a new framework on the original  three sectors were to have been concluded by last February's  summit between the two countries. But the talks became  deadlocked when neither Tokyo nor Washington yielded in the  summit over their definitions of "objective criteria" for  measuring American access to the Japanese market.    Following Thursday's accord to restart the framework talks,  both parties are expected to soon return to the negotiation  table on the three priority fields.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Czech Environment  Minister Frantisek Benda told journalists today that his  ministry might submit its own mining bill which would put an  emphasis on environmental protection. He said the Environment  Ministry's idea of the bill differed considerably from that of  the Ministry of the Economy. Both ministries had been charged  with the joint preparation of the principles for the bill.    At the beginning of the year Benda pointed out that the  Environment Ministry would seek to include all important aspects  concerning the protection of the mining environment in the  initial bill drawn up by the Economy Ministry. He said today  that the two bills have just joined together, whereas he had  expected that a single bill would be drafted. A completely  unacceptable situation arose in which about "ten diametrically  opposed views" stand against each other.    Disputes between the ministries concerned, for example, the  definition of public interest which had been defined very  liberally and on a low level as regards the protection of  owners' rights or the protection of the environment or mining  site, Benda said. The two ministries are using the same words  but their notions are different, he said.</p>

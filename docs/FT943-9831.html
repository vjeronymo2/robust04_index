			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Victims of the past: France's strategy over Algeria is perilous In a disused army barracks in the village of Folembray, north-east of Paris, 17 Moslem fundamentalists are being detained by the French government. The targets of a French crackdown on Algerian militants following the deaths of five French citizens in Algiers last week, the suspected militants have been served with expulsion orders. Mr Charles Pasqua, France's hardline interior minister, says the 17 are free to leave as soon as they find a host country willing to take them. But so far, there have been no offers and French government officials said yesterday they had not sought to identify countries which would grant them political asylum. If the inmates of Folembray find themselves trapped, their detention also symbolises the snare in which French policy towards Algeria is tangled. France's unyielding stance towards Algerian fundamentalists, and its reluctance to deal with moderate Moslems in its former colony, reveals a policy rift with its western partners. More worrying, the latest crackdown has raised threats of reprisals from Algerian radicals, which some fear could drag France into the bitter and bloody conflict between the military-led regime in Algiers and its Moslem fundamentalist opponents. The conflict has claimed the lives of at least 4,000 Algerians and 56 foreigners over the past two years. The possibility that France may be drawn ever closer to the crisis was clearly demonstrated at the weekend in a message from the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), a militant grouping which is linked to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The FIS was poised to win general elections in 1992, before they were cancelled by the Algerian government. The Front is now outlawed. The AIS is demanding the immediate release of the 17 detainees. 'The arrest and detention of these brothers means that France has declared war on the FIS and on Algerian Moslems,' the statement said. 'France should renounce this policy of belligerence or it will assume responsibility for what will happen.' The warning is the first issued to France by Algerian radicals, and the French government is taking it seriously. 'There will be no neglect of the threat,' said the interior ministry, which responded at the weekend with a tightening of security measures at railway stations, airports and embassies and with high-profile police operations to check the identity papers of motorists. The response reflects the risks involved. France is anxious to avoid an eruption of violence among its Algerian community, which has so far remained aloof from the conflict in the former French colony. An estimated 1m Algerians live legally in France, with the number pushed higher by illegal immigrants. One academic Algerian expert believes it is 'certainly possible' that fundamentalist guerrilla networks exist and could mount attacks within France. But France's tough reaction to last week's attack in Algiers also reflects its broader, relatively uncompromising policy over the Algerian crisis. Such a stance has drawn criticism from opponents of France's centre-right government. The Socialist party has urged dialogue with Moslem moderates in Algeria, and has criticised Mr Pasqua's high-handed approach. So far, however, the government's stance appears to have public backing, although some newspapers, such as Le Monde, argue economic aid to Algeria should increasingly be linked to political reforms. France's strategy has highlighted differences with its western partners, who are more willing to develop contacts with Moslem moderates. One senior US state department official said last week's killings 'only reinforce the concern we have that the Algerian government should broaden its political dialogue' to opposition groups that reject violence. By contrast, Mr Pasqua stated that the only choice is between the existing, if flawed, regime and a radical Islamic government. He dismisses as 'rubbish' the idea of a moderate Islamic government taking power in Algiers. The rift has become clearer since the attack on the French embassy building in Algiers. Mr Pasqua accused the UK, the US and Germany of being too lenient towards Moslem fundamentalists on their soil, a charge rejected by France's partners. One French foreign ministry official argued that the US is 'still traumatised' by its experience in Iran and is keen to cultivate ties with moderate Islamic leaders. For France, the prospect of a radical Islamic government in Algiers is of acute concern. In addition to fears shared by other nations of a domino effect across the Maghreb, France is anxious to avoid an influx of thousands of immigrants from its former colony should a radical government come to power. With unemployment at 12.7 per cent and with anti-immigration parties such as the Front National winning about 10 per cent of the vote in most regional and national elections, a big influx of refugees from Algeria could exacerbate social tensions in France. 'It must be a great concern,' says one western diplomat in Paris, 'particularly if one considers the localised effects in areas such as Marseilles, where there is already a large Algerian and North African community.' France's gamble is that, by providing qualified political support for the existing regime in Algeria and supplying finance to ease its economic plight, this possibility can be avoided. Earlier this year, France agreed to the rescheduling of Dollars 5bn of the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt to the Paris Club creditor nations. The stakes of the gamble, however, are rising ever higher. An upsurge in violence in Algeria since the lull this spring supports the admission of Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, that 'the status quo is no longer tenable'. In terms of French policy, last week's attack has made the status quo still harder to maintain. But by treating the Algerian crisis as a security issue, as demonstrated by the latest clampdown, the French government risks creating the instability at home that it is so anxious to avoid.</p>

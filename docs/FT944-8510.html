			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Perpetual surges to Pounds 35.4m and sees similar this year On turnover almost doubled at Pounds 1.52bn for the year to September 30, against Pounds 842m, Perpetual, the unit trust management group, reported a strong advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 35.4m. The result also reflected an increase in management fees and other operating income from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 37.7m. Mr Martyn Arbib, chairman, said that unless circumstances deteriorated significantly, 'it would be disappointing if we did not match the reported results in the current trading year'. He expected management fee income to exceed comfortably this year's figure but feared that sales revenue might decline. During the year funds under management increased from Pounds 2.03bn to Pounds 3.5bn with Pounds 1.32bn of net new money. Mr Arbib said the company had again won a number of awards enabling it to increase its share of the market. 'According to the latest industry figures we have become the largest unit trust provider, measured by sales, in the retail market.' Personal equity plans accounted for 39 per cent of sales and over the last six months Perpetual said it had the greatest share of the market. It now has 200,000 clients with Pounds 1bn of funds under management. Earnings per share came out at 92.38p (39.11p) or 83.48p fully diluted. A final dividend of 25p (13.2p) is proposed for a total of 35p (15p).</p>

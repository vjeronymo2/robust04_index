			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: LPA Inds declines to Pounds 0.07m LPA Industries, the industrial electrical components company, suffered a fall from Pounds 477,000 to Pounds 66,000 in pre-tax profits for the year to September 30. Mr Michael Rusch, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said demand for general industrial products remained extremely depressed and all group companies experienced reduced sales and pre-tax profits. The company is seeking to sell its Acrokool drinking water fountain manufacturing subsidiary. Mr Rusch said that LPA was not equipped to the give the company the input required. 'We learned that the refrigeration industry operates very differently to our main core business and that Acrokool's future would be much better served with a more suitable partner.' He added that talks were being held with a potential purchaser. Turnover fell 16 per cent to Pounds 5.22m (Pounds 6.24m). Earnings per share declined from 3.53p to 0.44p and the proposed final dividend is cut to 0.8p for a total of 2.45p (3.52p).</p>

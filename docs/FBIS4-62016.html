			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Bonn May 11 TASS--"I am satisfied with the results  of today's talks with President Richard von Weizsaecker and  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The talks were held in a sincere,  friendly atmosphere. This has already become a good tradition  and reflects the particularly genial relations that have  developed between our states over the past few years", Russian  President Boris Yeltsin told a joint news conference here on  Wednesday.    According to Yeltsin, the talks demonstrated once more that  the two sides were unanimous in their assessment of the current  state of Russian-German relations. "The federal chancellor and I  agreed that our two countries had proceeded far along the way  towards each other. We have managed to solve most of the thorny  problems inherited from the war and the post-war period. The  agreements reached during our talks have begun working", the  Russian president stressed.    Yeltsin reported that he had discussed today in details with  Chancellor Kohl arrangements for the farewell ceremony to mark  the complete withdrawal of Russia's West Army Group from  Germany, scheduled for this coming August. The sides agreed  that the ceremony should be held in style. This event, the  Russian leader went on to say, "is designed to symbolize the  completion of a certain historic stage and to mark the beginning  of a new era of relations our states, and Europe on the whole,  are to enter". The planned actions will become a sort of  prologue to next year's celebration of the 50th anniversary of  the victory in World War II, Yeltsin stressed.    According to him, Russia and Germany would like these  celebrations to acquire an all-European scale. "We suggest that  a political declaration to be passed at this December's CSCE  summit in Budapest include special provisions concerning the  50th anniversary of the end of World War II. They should  reflect the principles of world order and international  relations to be brought by CSCE member-countries into the 3rd  millennium", the Russian president pointed out.    Yeltsin said the talks had also touched upon the issues of  human rights and democracy. "Life has brought us to these  objectives in different ways. Russia is presently at the stage  of democratic consolidation, and this process cannot be called  entirely smooth. The pace, methods and instruments of democratic  reforms may change depending on the state of society", the  Russian leader noted. But this process is irreversible, he  stressed, which has been proved by the course of developments  following last December's parliamentary elections and the  passage of the new constitution by people's vote. The memorandum  on civil accord recently signed by Russia's major political and  public forces is another evidence of the fact that the  overwhelming majority of the Russians favour further peaceful  democratic reforms, Yeltsin said.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Central bankers wounded by words CENTRAL bankers are not normally thought of as sensitive souls, but the Bundesbank's reaction to the onslaught of political and press criticism it has received over sterling's floating devaluation shows it can be upset by words as well as deeds. Yesterday, in a highly unusual step, the German central bank's four-page defence of its statements and actions was released to UK newspapers through the German embassy in London. Although Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, will have another chance to put his and the bank's case when he holds a press conference tomorrow after the regular council meeting, he is unlikely to unveil any surprises. Despite some speculation about possible cuts in interest rates, the general expectation is that the Bundesbank will leave them unchanged. It lowered its Lombard rate by 0.25 percentage points to 9.5 per cent two weeks ago, with the discount rate moving down half a point to 8.25 per cent. But this was in response to the currency pressures which led to the lira's devaluation. Most economists are not betting on any further action on Friday. There will be a press conference after the meeting in Schwerin, northern Germany - a usual occurrence after the council meetings held annually outside Frankfurt. Mr Lothar Weniger, economist with Salomon Brothers in Frankfurt, said the Bundesbank was prepared to cut interest rates further, but not yet. 'I don't think they want to do anything to loosen their underlying stance,' he said. With money supply rising well above target - M3, the broad monetary aggregate, grew at an annualised rate of 9 per cent in August - the Bundesbank will want to wait until expansion slows down sharply. September's M3 growth figure is likely to be at least 10 per cent in the wake of the heavy intervention to prop up European currencies. The Bundesbank said its foreign exchange reserves soared by DM44bn (Pounds 17.3bn) in the week to September 23 as a result of support operations. It has been acting to mop up liquidity in the money markets and thus alleviate the impact on money supply, but will want to see subsequent monthly M3 expansion figures on a clear downward trend before relaxing policy further. Nikko Europe, the London branch of the Japanese securities house, also expects no rate movement on Friday. The next cuts would have to be justified by domestic fundamentals 'and money supply growth and inflation militate against this'. West German inflation figures for September showed a 0.3 per cent rise over August and one of 3.6 per cent over last year; the annual rate in August was 3.5 per cent. While the D-Mark's revaluation against several European currencies will help dampen inflation, Berliner Bank notes that important areas like services and rents are not affected by this. Mr Dietrich Beier, the bank's chief economist, said Germany would only cut rates further if there was a realignment in the European Monetary System. But without such external pressures, he saw no chance of rate cuts yet. 'I see no scope for further easing'. Not only had inflation shown a slight rise this month, but the Bundesbank was also concerned about the possible impact on prices of the planned rise in value-added tax in January.</p>

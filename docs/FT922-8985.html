			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pittencrief steps up US mobile phone presence PITTENCRIEF, the rapidly-growing communications and natural resource group, is stepping up its presence in the US mobile phone sector, in anticipation of a demerger of oil and gas assets next year. The group yesterday announced a Pounds 10m two-for-seven rights issue to fund the purchase of five US communications businesses and future investment in telecoms and natural resources. The shares rose 12p on the news to 239p, a 26 per cent premium on the offer price of 190p. Mr Terry Heneaghan, chief executive, said the five south western-based purchases would increase Pittencrief's telecoms sales by 50 per cent. This would bring it into the top five US Specialised Mobile Radio Controlled communications groups. The acquisitions, which total Dollars 8.4m, are Comtronix, Advanced Communications Systems, A-Com Communication, Mustang Communications and J&amp;J Systems.</p>

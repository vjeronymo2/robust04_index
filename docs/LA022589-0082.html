			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWING DOUBTS DOOMED TOWER, DEMOCRAT SAYS  </P> <P> Richard C. Shelby, a freshman senator from Alabama who joined 10 other  Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday night in voting  against Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, has never had any trouble  crossing party lines to vote his own conservative conscience.  </P> <P> As a four-term member of the House of Representatives, Shelby regularly  defected from the Democratic ranks, voting for aid to Nicaragua's Contras and  Angolan rebels, for the MX missile and against limits on "Star Wars"  anti-missile research funding.  </P> <P> Even when early reports of Tower's heavy drinking and alleged sexual  improprieties began reaching the committee, Shelby believed that he would join  most Republicans -- and some fellow Southern Democrats -- in voting to confirm  the feisty former senator from Texas.  </P> <P> But, three weeks later, as fresh allegations of Tower's misconduct continued to  surface, Shelby's ideological kinship with Tower finally was overwhelmed by  growing doubts about the nominee's fitness for the Pentagon's top job.  </P> <P> "Sen. Tower and I share a lot of ideological beliefs and views . . . . If it  were strictly ideological, I would certainly have voted for him," Shelby told  The Times on Friday. "But the cumulative effect of all these allegations  bothered me, and they never went away. It was a very wrenching decision."  </P> <P> Although Shelby is the Armed Services Committee's most junior Democrat, his  vote against Tower may be second in significance only to that of the panel's  chairman, Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn.  </P> <P> If the White House had hoped to obtain a favorable recommendation on Tower from  the committee, it needed the backing of such Southern conservatives as Nunn,  Shelby and Tennessee Democrat Albert Gore Jr.  </P> <P> And, if the President hopes to pull Tower's nomination out of the fire on the  Senate floor, Shelby said, he will need the support of other Southern  Democrats.  </P> <P> "But he lost us," Shelby said, and the White House's task will be doubly hard  as a result. The committee Thursday night voted down the nomination, 11 to 9,  along party lines.  </P> <P> It became apparent to Shelby by Tuesday night that Nunn was turning against  Tower and that his confirmation prospects had suffered a major blow.  </P> <P> "Nunn's position makes a lot of difference," Shelby said.  </P> <P> Shelby did not come under any pressure from the White House. Although his  defection from the Democratic camp might have been the crucial break in the  otherwise party-line vote, no one in President Bush's Administration ever  contacted him, he said.  </P> <P> Shelby said he had received no clear signals from his mostly conservative  Alabama constituents either. In a recent round of town meetings in Alabama,  Shelby said, only five constituents had approached him on the Tower nomination,  all urging him to oppose it.  </P> <P> Shelby's reaction to continuing new allegations was echoed by other Democrats,  including Nunn.  </P> <P> "I closed in on it gradually," said Nunn, who said he had believed that he  would support Tower "not only at the beginning, but through the first few  hearings." Nunn said the cumulative effect of the allegations began to take  hold after a hearing at which conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich testified  that Tower lacked the "moral character" to lead the Pentagon.  </P></p>

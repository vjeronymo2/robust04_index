			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / US and France seek early G7 talks: Western leaders stress Russia's urgent need for aid PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand yesterday called for greater urgency in helping Russia with western aid. Both men acknowledged Japan's opposition to the idea of holding an emergency summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations before the regular summit to be held in Tokyo in July, but said the G7 must move before that. 'I don't believe we can wait until July,' President Clinton said after a morning meeting with Mr Mitterrand in Washington. An emergency G7 meeting would probably be useful but might not be possible in the face of Japan's objections. Nevertheless, the west must move 'aggressively' to help Russia, which might otherwise be forced to look increasingly to arms sales as the only way of earning hard currency, Mr Clinton said. Mr Mitterrand, who had advocated an emergency G7 meeting, added that Japan appeared to misunderstand the urgency of the problems facing eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. White House officials later said a summit of heads of state and government might not be the only way to address the pressing needs of Russia and the other former Soviet republics, and suggested a meeting of G7 foreign or finance ministers might be called. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has added his voice to the campaign to aid Russia, according to diplomats, by writing to fellow G7 leaders urging their support for Mr Yeltsin in his constitutional struggle. In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin asking for confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce emergency measures in Russia. The letter reports Mr Yeltsin's confidence that the Russian military will support him if he seeks emergency powers, the diplomats said. It also spells out Mr Yeltsin's determination to make one final effort at reaching agreement with the Russian parliament, while expressing some doubt about the likelihood of such a deal. Mr Clinton and Mr Mitterrand agreed on a cautious approach to the idea of committing more troops to Bosnia. Both said they were willing to increase their forces only after a peace deal along lines proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen had been reached. It was announced in Paris yesterday that Mr Mitterrand is to host talks tomorrow between the peace negotiators and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Trade issues, which have set France and the US at loggerheads recently, were reserved for later discussion over lunch, but both presidents struck a conciliatory note, with Mr Clinton suggesting his recent aggressive comments about European subsidies to the Airbus consortium might have been misinterpreted. Mr Mitterrand said agreement on the Uruguay Round of talks on updating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was important, but could not be achieved by piecemeal negotiations.

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): Risk-taking is his business  -Profile of Julian Simmonds TUESDAY, mid-morning; Citibank's London foreign exchange dealing room is humming. Smart, young traders bark instructions to each other from opposite sides of the room, others gaze at flickering green screens, pensively twirling their telephone handsets. Presiding over the hubbub from a dealing post bang in the middle of the spot-desk, is Mr Julian Simmonds, Citibank's energetic managing director of foreign exchange and money markets in Europe. After almost 20 years in foreign exchange trading and sales, Mr Simmonds still approaches his job with the zeal of a newcomer. 'At the end of the day, I actually enjoy my job and I enjoy the people I work with. If I didn't, I wouldn't bother to get up in the mornings,' he says. Responsible for all of Citibank's foreign exchange and funding activities in Europe, Mr Simmonds' presence in the dealing room and the fact that he continues to take a position on currencies, is testimony to his love of risk-taking and ability to avoid, as far as possible, the administrative side of management. 'Like any other large organisation there is a real risk at senior levels of management of getting dragged away from your desk,' he says. 'One of my key challenges is to not allow myself to become engulfed in a sea of papers and meetings. You can't watch the market if you are stuck in meetings.' The approach means that he can stay in touch with his workforce and with Citibank's customers. Understanding customers' needs has become a key part of Simmonds' approach to forex trading. 'I don't believe the business of banking is any different from other service industries,' says Mr Simmonds. 'The product we are trying to sell is foreign exchange. I approach the challenge by thinking, what is it I want when I go into a mojor store to make a big acquisition?' One initiative has been to survey customers' needs through a questionnaire. Mr Simmonds reads every single return, tackling weak areas directly with the sales, trading and administrative teams. All this makes him a busy man. He is into the office by 7.45am and tries to be home by 6.15pm. When away from his desk, he regularly glances at a portable Reuters screen that he carries with him everywhere. At night he is frequently woken by traders keeping him in touch with his position. Two things help - he claims not to need much sleep and he has an understanding wife. Certainly Mr Simmonds, a vigorous 41, shows no sign of the 'burn-out' often associated with the frantic life of forex risk-takers. 'Burn-out comes from excessive alcohol and entertainment, not from the work,' he says. 'I am only prepared to entertain in the evenings where it is important, and wherever possible I try to involve my wife.' Family life is important. 'When the kids tell me about their latest crisis at school, it puts the job in perspective.' The only downside of the job to which Mr Simmonds is devoted, he says, is failure. 'But it's a risk business, and failing is something you have to learn to live with. 'You have to do what you think best in the business. If I buy dollars because I think the dollar is going up, and I make a mistake, then I can live with it. I am disappointed, but I can live with it,' he says.</p>

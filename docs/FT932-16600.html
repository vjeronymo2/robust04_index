			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Leading Article: Latin risks AFTER a decade in which it was relentlessly snubbed, Latin America is once again in the enthusiastic embrace of the world's financiers. The last time this happened, the relationship ended in tears. Will the renewed affair enjoy a happier conclusion? There are many reasons why it should. Most Latin governments, with the exception of Brazil, are managing their economies more effectively than in the early 1970s: budget deficits are down and countries such as Mexico are in surplus. Governments have cut tariffs and ended import quotas; they have privatised state industry and held to tight monetary and fiscal policies. These have been important steps to improving economic efficiency and have resulted in renewed capital flows which have been encouraged by low returns in more established markets. In most countries, these inflows are smaller in comparison with the size of the economies than they were in the 1970s. They are also more varied than the predominantly bank-financed foreign currency flows of the 1970s. A significant component is invested in equity and an important part of that is direct investment, yielding results in technology transfer and enhancing labour skills. Yet while growth has picked up, only in one country, Chile, has there been a true breakthrough. Its economy expanded 10.4 per cent last year while inflation fell to 12 per cent. For years the country in Latin America with the lowest savings, it now boasts a domestic savings rate of over 20 per cent of GDP. This is in large part thanks to ambitious pension fund reform, now being copied elsewhere in the region. Chile is otherwise well positioned for future strong and stable growth yet this has required a decade or more of economic reforms. Most Latin American countries have been reforming for a shorter period. In Mexico, where economic reform is otherwise furthest advanced, growth is still sluggish as old industrial capacity closes down in the face of tough foreign competition. A big current account deficit is being financed in part by large inflows of short-term capital, a significant reversal of which could have severe long-term consequences. Argentina has cured hyperinflation but at the cost of an exchange rate which is torturing domestic industry. In Venezuela, economic reform meets social protest; in Brazil, it has hardly been tried. Where reform is advancing, a new order of economic legislation is being embarked upon. Governments will also have to focus on longer term issues such as education, health care, poverty and taxation. Renewed optimism about the region must therefore be mixed with caution.</p>

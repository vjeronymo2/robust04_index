			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Observer: Everton in play The vultures have been circling Liverpool for a couple of years awaiting the passing of Sir John Moores, inventor of football pools and founder of the privately-owned Littlewoods retailing empire. Now the patriarch is gone, and the City eyes Littlewoods as a juicy flotation candidate. But first up for grabs is likely to be Everton Football Club, Sir John's great love, where the few Everton shares outside the family's control have turned to gold-dust in anticipation of a scramble. One senior Liverpool partner of a leading national accountancy practice recently surprised fellow diners with his efforts to buy some shares from a new acquaintance seated across the table, while a well-known academic and Everton supporter is coyly waiting in the wings with a consortium which he says will bid soon. Everton would not come cheap. On top of the Pounds 4m or so that would be needed to buy the Moores family interests, there is an estimated Pounds 3m to clear debts and up to another Pounds 4m to buy some better players. Favourite to enter the bidding is Peter Johnson, chairman of Park Foods, the Wirral-based Christmas hamper company, and owner of the swimming pool where former Merseyside assistant chief constable Alison Halford had her famous dip. Johnson already owns Tranmere Rovers, the Birkenhead first division side, which he would have to unload. So far he's still denying any such plans.</p>

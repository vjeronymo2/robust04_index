			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Liberation movement lifts Latin America - The region has been one of the main beneficiaries of free capital There have been many liberation movements over the last 30 years. But while women and some national minorities may still be battling for their freedom, there is one constituency which has been remarkably successful in liberating itself - capital. Before the breakdown of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in the early 1970s, it was time-consuming, expensive and difficult for citizens of most industrialised countries to buy foreign assets. Now, after two decades of liberalisation and deregulation, freedom to own capital abroad has extended beyond the industrialised countries to include the 'emerging markets' of Asia and Latin America. Figures from the Bank for International Settlements' annual report, published last week, show the sheer scale of today's international capital markets. In the first half of the 1980s, gross capital outflows from the larger industrial countries (excluding official and short-term banking transactions) were around Dollars 100bn a year. By 1993, flows reached Dollars 850bn. While the recent falls in world bond and equities markets may have slowed the relentless acceleration of such flows, it seems likely that growth will resume. Institutional portfolios in the UK may be internationally diversified, but there is still plenty of scope for overseas purchases by US and continental European funds. In the 1990s, the emerging markets have been the fashionable home for international investments. According to the BIS, net inflows into the developing world rose to around Dollars 160bn in 1993, from an average of Dollars 37bn a year in the period from 1986 to 1990. The BIS said that capital has been particularly directed to Latin America (where inflows amounted to almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product last year) and to lower wage Asian developing countries (about 4 per cent). These capital inflows have been broadly welcomed as a return to the 'correct' flow of capital between developed and developing countries - a trend which was interrupted by the debt crisis of the 1980s. But the BIS warns that there were important differences in the nature of the inflows to the two regions - differences that, they say, might create problems for Latin America in later years. According to the BIS report: 'A large proportion of Asian capital inflows has been closely linked to increased domestic investment and imports of investment goods. This has contributed to real exchange rate stability in the region and has also helped to prevent excessive increases in domestic liquidity. 'In Latin America, by contrast, the influx of foreign capital - dominated by portfolio and short-term financial flows - was less directly associated with increased imports of investment goods and there was a greater degree of upward pressure on real exchange rates.' One reason why so much short-term capital flowed in to Latin America was high real interest rates. Combined with the liberalisation measures taken by local governments, this encouraged the repatriation of some of the flight capital which left the region during the 1980s. Many currencies in the Latin American region failed to depreciate against the dollar as quickly as inflation differentials suggested. As the BIS comments, 'this made investing in short-term assets denominated in local currency attractive at a time when US short-term interest rates were unusually low.' The real appreciation of the Latin American currencies was probably boosted by the scale of the continent's economic and financial reforms. The Asian countries had been much better at controlling inflation and restraining their fiscal deficits. In Latin America, however, policies in both areas had been lax, and accordingly the change in sentiment, which followed the implementation of reform programmes, created sharp upward pressure on the region's currencies. But the impact of an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate, according to the BIS, is likely to be a deterioration in the competitiveness of an economy's tradable sector and therefore a deteriorating current account deficit. Investment in Asia has been much higher than in Latin America, helped by high domestic savings rates. By investing in the export-creating manufacturing sectors, some (but not all) Asian countries have been able to offset pressure on their current accounts. Latin American countries, by contrast, have experienced a marked rise in their current account deficits. The BIS says further reforms are needed in Latin America if the region is to hold on to the benefits achieved through recent stabilisation programmes. The report says infrastructures need to be improved in many countries; the problem of poverty needs to be tackled, to prevent social unrest undermining the reform climate; and domestic financial markets need to be reformed to help countries cope with the effects of the massive capital inflows they have received. Furthermore, the inflows have increased Latin America's vulnerability to external shocks, such as higher international interest rates. This problem has already been seen this year in the sharp fall in Latin American debt markets, which followed the US Federal Reserve's decision to push up short-term interest rates. To date, the developing countries have mostly seen the positive side of the expansion of the international capital markets. The strength of their financial systems (and their commitment to liberalisation) may be tested when the flows start to reverse. In this regard, Latin America may be more vulnerable than Asia.</p>

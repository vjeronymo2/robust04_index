			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;397]</RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NFP&hyph;21 issued to Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the Nuclear Project No. 2 (WNP&hyph;2) plant, located in Benton County, Washington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment would (1) revise TS 3/4.4.2 and 3/4.5.1 to require main stream system and automatic depressurization system safety/relief valve (SRV) surveillance testing within 12 hours after steam pressure and flow are adequate to do the testing; and (2) revise TS Table 4.3.7.5&hyph;1 to require SRV position indicator surveillance testing within 12 hours after steam pressure and flow are adequate to do the testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the change is to clarify when the 12-hour time period begins. The licensee is also making a change to the TS SRV basis to clarify that testing SRVs at low power means testing them when there is adequate steam pressure and flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Supply System has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standards as required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and concluded that the change does not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential delay in confirming safety relief valve (SRV), SRV position indication (acoustic monitor, valve stem position indicators, and tailpipe temperature instruments), and ADS operability during plant startup should not result in any change to the expected satisfactory completion of the required surveillance tests. Surveillance testing that is conducted during the plant shutdown sequence, and during shutdown, provides reasonable assurance that the SRVs will function when required. Under the proposed change, plant test conditions would not be different than in the past since testing was not begun until adequate pressure for the duration of the test was achieved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve a design change nor do they involve changes outside the scope of the existing test requirements. No new failure modes are introduced as a result of the proposed changes. The acoustic monitors merely provide indication that an SRV is open. They do not provide an actuation signal. Alternate mechanisms of SRV position indication exist, i.e., reactor water level changes, reactor pressure changes, main turbine bypass valve position, SRV tail pipe temperature, suppression pool level, and suppression pool temperature. The time delay prior to operability verification will not affect Technical Specification requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes have no impact on the operability or performance requirements of the SRVs, including the ADS function, as they do not change the lift setpoints or minimum number of valves required to be operable. The effect of delaying the starting point of the time clock is not expected to affect completion of the required tests. ADS/SRV position indication availability will not be significantly affected by the proposed change since the additional 48 hours per refueling cycle of not verifying SRV, SRV position indication, and ADS SRV operability occurs at low power with the High Pressure Core Spray and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling systems available. Additionally, there is a high probability that the SRVs would perform their intended function if required even though they have not been declared operable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 30-day notice period expires. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

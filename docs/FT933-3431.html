			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Birth rights and wrongs It was alarming to read last week that the use of caesarean operations to deliver British babies has nearly trebled over the past two decades. It would not have happened if the hospitals and senior doctors had not wrested the delivery business away from perfectly competent midwives. As we shall see in a moment, the government is preparing to help the midwives win back their lost customer base. It will be a struggle, but even we males must cheer from the sidelines. The disturbing news comes in 'Caesarean Birth in Britain', whose authors include Professor Wendy Savage. Remember her? A celebrated campaigner for the right to natural childbirth, she is still consultant obstetrician at the Royal London hospital. Her fellow-writers are Helen Lewison, chairman of the National Childbirth Trust, and two academics. The four of them note that in 1973 the proportion of deliveries by caesarean in England and Wales was an estimated 5.3 per cent. By last year, their research suggests, this figure had risen to 13 per cent. The book contains a table of hospitals self-confident enough to allow their data to be published. It shows that the caesarean operation was used in 7.9 per cent of deliveries at St John's hospital, Chelmsford, and 21.5 per cent in Hammersmith, with all the numbers you can think of in between. Even if you take account of the careful note that 'hospitals with high rates may well have specialist units and so receive pregnancies which are at greater risk' this variation is too wide to be explicable to lay observers. The inescapable conclusion is that some caesareans may be medically necessary, but that many are probably not. This is clearly true in the US where in 1991 nearly a quarter of all babies were delivered by caesarean, at a cost of Dollars 7.7bn. That is the highest caesar-rate bar Brazil's, at doubtless the highest cost per delivery bar none, yet the US infant mortality record is worse than that of Japan, Sweden, Holland or Britain. Fear of being sued is one reason, but the self-interest of the surgeon must surely be another. The use of the obstetrician's knife has increased in most developed countries, in concert, I suspect, with a growth in the sales of Jaguars, Mercedes and Cadillac cars to successful consultants. The process is not otherwise comprehensible. According to a US study, within a team of obstetricians caring for 1,553 affluent low-risk women at a community hospital, one practitioner operated in 19.1 per cent of births, another at a rate of 42.3 per cent. Talk to almost any new mother and you will be deluged with anecdotal evidence suggesting that the convenience of the hospital, or its consultants, has a lot to do with the growth in the use of technological interventions. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK secretary for health, should arrange for league tables to be published annually, showing which maternity units use the most forceps deliveries, which the most caesareans, which induce labour most often - and which produce the highest proportions of healthy infants. Explanations and excuses could accompany the lists. She should, however, be warned. The consultants, presumably excluding Professor Savage, will squeal. The West Midlands Regional Health Authority published league tables showing how long patients must wait for an operation with each of its 2,000 consultant surgeons. The British Medical Association was outraged. We may place our lives in the hands of this or that medical specialist, but doctors acting in a collective cannot be trusted with our wallets. Their trade unions, like the BMA, are among the most astute in the business; the higher up the professional scale their associations go, the more wily they become. This is being demonstrated once again in the argument about midwives. A few weeks ago the government published a report on the maternity services drawn up by an expert committee under the chairmanship of Baroness Cumberlege. It noted the current department of health view that births should take place in hospital, since 'unforeseen complications can occur in any birth', and set against it last year's pronouncement from the House of Commons select committee on health that 'encouraging all women to give birth in hospitals cannot be justified on grounds of safety'. The Cumberlege report puts into moderate, semi-official language the deepest wishes of the National Childbirth Trust, aspirations that were once regarded as cranky nonsense. It calls for 'woman-centred care', meaning that the prospective mother should be in control. She should be able to choose who takes her case, be it midwife, general practitioner or obstetrician. She should be able to arrange for a home birth, although she should then be given a health warning about the risks. She might reasonably expect that the same person, or the same small group of professionals, should manage the whole of her pregnancy. She should be fully informed of the options at all times, and have the right to take possession of her own case-notes. The simple idea is that most confinements are straightforward, and thus capable of being brought to a happy conclusion at home or by the woman's personal midwife admitted (heavens]) to hospital with her. There have been tragedies in non-hospital births, but the same applies to births within high-tech maternity units. The report questions the assumption that 'experienced personnel are already readily available within a general hospital'. You might think that the consultants would embrace it enthusiastically, since releasing non-complicated births to the midwives would leave them more time in which to concentrate on the awkward cases. Not so. The Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists says that it is 'genuinely concerned' that some of the proposals in the Cumberlege report 'may endanger the wellbeing of women and their babies'. It insists that 'review of every pregnancy by a medically qualified person is essential' - surely right - but insists that 'the doctor best qualified to conduct that review is the obstetrician'. Probably. Have they seen the dingy queues, sat for the long hours, waiting for a few moments with a consultant? As to home confinements, 'the college's view is that this is not a safe alternative to delivery in properly equipped surroundings'. So far as my lay mind can discover, that view is strongly disputed, although you have to believe in last-minute ambulance rides for cases that go life-threateningly wrong. There is one necessary caveat. Nobody, so far as I can tell, has produced a profit and loss table. In-hospital confinements, particularly when operations ensue, sound more expensive than outpatient work by lowly paid midwives. Mrs Bottomley is still mulling the Cumberlege report. Under pressure from the obstetricians, she released it as a discussion document, without fully endorsing it. If she decides to accept it, she should accompany the good news with figures to show that the best possible midwifery service is to be created, and that the exercise is not motivated by cost-cutting alone. That little matter aside, the government would be wise to brave the wrath of the Royal College. Some women may prefer caesareans; some may long for natural births. Many will want their confinements to be in hospital, under an obstetrician's care; others will be more comfortable at home with a midwife. All should be given the necessary medical guidance with which to make an informed choice. What could be more 1990s Conservative than that?</p>

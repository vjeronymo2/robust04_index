			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OCC PLAY PUTS FACES ON CHERNOBYL'S FATALITIES  </P> <P> Vladimir Gubaryev, a science editor for Pravda, the Soviet Union's state-run  newspaper, was reportedly so disturbed by the Chernobyl nuclear accident that  he wrote "Sarcophagus" in a fury of emotion and ambition. His play seems to  have two worthy, far-reaching objectives: to dramatize the human pain of the  worst nuclear catastrophe ever and to examine the specifics of misfeasance and  malfeasance that led up to it.  </P> <P> These twin concerns don't always link gracefully in "Sarcophagus," but the work  has an impact. It holds our attention by putting men's faces on the fatality  figures as we watch plant workers and firefighters after the reactor explosion,  slowly succumbing to radiation sickness in an isolated hospital ward. Forgiving  "Sarcophagus" its often-confusing and talky investigative side does not require  too much generosity.  </P> <P> At Orange Coast College, a cast of students and more experienced actors,  including OCC instructors, tap into the play's humanist element while  maintaining a naturalistic balance. Director Joan McGillis keeps everything  reined in, although she does let Steven Lee Shults take too many liberties with  Bessmertny, a young patient who is on the ward before the reactor explodes.  </P> <P> Shults and McGillis both seem to see the wry Bessmertny, who has survived  longer than expected after passing out drunk in a lab during a radiation  experiment, as a symbol of hope, the manifestation of will. Shults plays him  with compassion, but the depth of the character prompts Shults to reach further  than he should.  </P> <P> "Sarcophagus" opens with Bessmertny's reflections on the uniqueness of his  experience: At this point, he's a lone victim, and the threat of radiation  seems to have limited scope. But with the reactor explosion, the danger expands  and seems to take on the entire globe. Bessmertny realizes this, and the  audience is expected to follow his lead.  </P> <P> Soon the ward is crowded with victims, each assigned to a tiny cubicle, where  his vital signs are monitored. There's a red light above the room: When it  blinks, the nurses rush in; when it goes out, another man has died. The  patients talk about the accident and their lives, most of them brave in their  understanding that even bone marrow transplants are unlikely to save them.  </P> <P> Later, Gubaryev turns reporter, bringing in an investigator assigned to find  out what happened. We hear accusations concerning lax safety conditions at the  plant, no protective gear for firefighters, incompetent training. There's a  blurry contention that there was pressure to open Chernobyl ahead of schedule,  possibly when it wasn't ready. These points are intriguing, but "Sarcophagus"  presents them in a scattered way.  </P> <P> And then there's the introduction of an American surgeon (obviously based on  Robert Gale, who flew to Chernobyl shortly after the accident), giving Gubaryev  the opportunity to make a plea for more superpower cooperation. You can't fault  that, but it seems forced and preachy in this context.  </P> <P> Except for Bessmertny, there are no major roles. Within the ensemble, there are  decent performances, including Eric Person's as a courageous technician; Sharr  White's as a naive, romantic fireman; Bryan S. Luterman's as a plant physicist,  and Joyce Eriksen and Alex Golson's as Soviet surgeons.  </P> <P> The production is aided by David Scaglione's deliberately indifferent-looking  set of the icy-white ward, and by Ponzer Berkman and F.H. Furness' provocative  lighting.  </P> <P> 'SARCOPHAGUS'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College production of Vladimir Gubaryev's drama. Directed by  Joan McGillis.

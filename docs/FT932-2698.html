			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: More shares in Hollinger to be floated MR Conrad Black and his associates are making more shares in Hollinger, the Canadian holding company for Mr Black's international publishing interests, available to the public. Argus Corporation, a company controlled by Mr Black, plans to sell up to 2.5m Hollinger common shares to the public, starting on June 22. The shares, 4.6 per cent of Hollinger's 54.5m outstanding shares, will be sold through BBN James Capel of Toronto. Argus is controlled by Ravelston Corp, a private company owned by Mr Black and a handful of business associates. Ravelston presently owns 47.5 per cent of Hollinger. Mr Black and other Hollinger employees have separately converted options in the form of preferred shares into 1.1m Hollinger common shares. The bulk of these shares are expected to be sold into the market. At Hollinger's current share price of CDollars 13.13, Argus will raise about CDollars 33m (USDollars 25.9m) from its share sale. It said the proceeds would be used to repay debt 'in furtherance of the objective of both Argus and Hollinger to reduce debt'. Moody's Investors Services has confirmed its ratings of Seagram's USDollars 3bn senior and subordinated debt at single A2 and A3 following the group's purchase of 5.7 per cent of Time Warner for Dollars 700m. While Seagram carries its 24 per cent holding in Du Pont, the chemicals and energy giant, at Dollars 3.3bn, the market value is Dollars 8.4bn and well above 'the Dollars 5bn debt Seagram might have to carry if it raised its Time Warner holding to 15 per cent'. said Moody's. Seagram has the liquidity to provide ample financial flexibility to carry the cost of an expanded Time Warner position despite the minimal dividends likely to be received, Moody's added.</p>

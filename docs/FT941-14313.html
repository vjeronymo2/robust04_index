			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (46): Price war rages as clients cut costs - As Europe struggles during an economic downturn, times are becoming increasingly tough for the auditors. The scope for spin-off services such as consulting has narrowed / Top Accountants Behind nearly every large European company is a very substantial accountancy firm providing auditing and other business advisory services. The six largest firms dominate client work across the continent, but are coming under increasing competitive pressure from each other, from their rivals and from regulators. In the UK, the historical home of most of the firms and of accountancy as a modern profession, there is an enormous gap in fee income between the top six and the rest. Coopers &amp; Lybrand alone billed Pounds 553m in the UK last year. In descending order, the five other largest firms were KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Andersen, Price Waterhouse and Touche Ross. Even Touche, at Pounds 346m, billed more than three times the amount of its next largest rival. Coopers also emerged as the leading firm of auditors to the top 100 companies in the UK500 with 25 clients, including one jointly held with second-placed rival, Price Waterhouse (24). Third place went to KPMG Peat Marwick, with 22 of the top companies, and fourth to Ernst &amp; Young. The UK firms do not operate in isolation, however. They also dominate in all the other European countries. According to a study paid for by the European Commission and published in April 1992, the same firms have a stranglehold across the rest of the continent. The study, produced by National Economic Research Associates (Nera), a consultancy firm, showed that they audit nearly 100 per cent of the top 200 companies in Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, and more than 50 per cent in Germany and Portugal, for instance. But as much of Europe struggles during an era of economic downturn, times are becoming increasingly tough for the accountants. The scope for spin-off services such as consulting - never as developed elsewhere as in the UK - has narrowed fast. More importantly, there is a fierce price war now raging, as increasingly aggressive marketing and shrewder clients play the firms off against each other to keep audit fees to a minimum. Concerns linger that 'lowballing' or 'predatory pricing' threatens to damage the quality of auditing, although the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales recently concluded no evidence for any such deterioration existed. However, accountants privately admit that it is clearly more tempting for them to win new work at a discount than to have to sack staff and reduce partner numbers. New pressures are coming from legal action. For example, in Italy, racked by recent corruption scandals and restructuring crises across the business sector, the cry of 'where were the auditors?' is becoming common. Price Waterhouse was the most prominent firm to be threatened with legal action following the near collapse of Ferruzzi, which it audited. Elsewhere, Sweden has been one of several countries to begin threatening litigation following the crisis in the Scandinavian financial sector. A response taken by some firms has been to create more closely integrated international structures. Arthur Andersen has always had the advantage of being a single firm worldwide. Other firms, notably Price Waterhouse, have attempted recently to develop a single European business which shares resources, and establish a common methodology for its work. But, as one accountant puts it, 'it's one thing to share the profits, but people don't want to share the costs'. This is at no time more relevant than when the writs arrive alleging negligent auditing. The regulatory position in different countries across Europe varies widely. Some, such as Italy and Spain, have compulsory rotation of auditors in an effort to prevent ties becoming too close and jeopardising independence. This creates the automatic need for competition, but the period of audit appointment may be longer lasting than in countries such as the UK, where annual audit reappointment approved by shareholders opens up the frequent prospect of tendering among the firms. A number of countries still limit the non-audit work an audit firm can carry out, or attempt to restrict international firms entering the domestic market. All of these issues affect competition and the structure of the profession, although the Nera study showed how effectively the firms have circumvented restrictions. For example, in France the stock exchange regulator recently insisted that its requirement for public companies to be scrutinised by two auditors should be interpreted as two separate audit firms and not - as had become widespread - two auditors from the same firm. At the European Union-level, a new directive on procurement will require utilities and other public sector organisations to put their audits out to tender. However, the work plan for the next two years shows no hard-line attempts to change the regulation of the auditing profession, other than an emphasis on clarifying auditor liability. Most of the most powerful pressures during the coming months will not be governmental but rather harshly commercial.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Accountants to the top 100 UK companies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Telecommunications Glaxo Holdings BAT Industries Marks &amp; Spencer Smithkline Beecham* Unilever The RTZ Corporation The Great Universal Stores Abbey National Kingfisher Rothmans International PowerGen Commercial Union Scottish Power Sun Alliance Group The BOC Group Pearson Inchcape The Royal Bank of Scotland Group British Steel Thames Water Royal Insurance Holdings Arje Wiggins Appleton Schroders RMC Group  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Joint audit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRICE WATERHOUSE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Gas Smithkline Beecham* Guiness Barclays Lloyds Bank Reuters Holdings Prudential Corporation Reed International Tesco Land Securities Redland Legal &amp; General Group Reckitt &amp; Colman Rentokil Group Courtaulds Forte Severn Trent North West Water Group Guardian Royal Exchange Wolseley Sears TI Group Anglian Water Eastern Electricity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * joint audit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- KPMG PEAT MARWICK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HSBC Holdings Cable and Wireless Grand Metropolitan National Westminster Bank Zeneca Group Imperial Chemical Industries Allied-Lyons National Power The Boots Company TSB Group General Accident Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigator Co.

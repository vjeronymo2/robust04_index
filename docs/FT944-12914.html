			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The oyster's in the post - Cooking Today's brightest shopkeepers do not wait for customers to come to the high street - they go out and knock at their doors. They have discovered that sending catalogues and offering a mail order home delivery service can be a most effective way of increasing business. Kitchenware merchant David Mellor is one of the latest recruits to this way of thinking. He has always been happy to send items to customers by post, but this month sees the launch of his first mail order catalogue for cooks. Very enticing it is, too. Others keeping up with the times include Franco and Alberto Camisa. Having sold specialist foods in Soho, central London, since 1929, they now aim to sell nationwide via Camisa Direct. Their first catalogue sports some obvious gift items and some very un-Italian oddities, but it also includes goodies worth putting in the larder for winter comfort. There are, for instance, whole San Felino salami and little nibbly cacciatori salami; stuffed pigs' trotters; capers packed in salt; baskets of dried porcini; arborio, carnaroli and vialone nano rice; soft amaretti from Alba; and dried figs from Calabria, stuffed with walnuts and dipped in chocolate. For those without a fishmonger in miles - a problem that seems to afflict vast tracts of Britain these days - Carew Oysters of Pembrokeshire, Wales, is one of several companies now farming and dispatching the Pacific variety to private customers and restaurants all over the country. So far as I know, however, Carew is alone in offering a 'deliver and open service' where, if you plan a large party and want to splash out, a professional will bring the shellfish and open them personally. Many people hate the thought of eating beef from cattle stuffed full of growth hormones or other indiscriminate medication. But farmers growing cattle the slow, traditional way on grass and hay only are on the increase. Newest to me is Richard Vines, of Wild Beef. He raises his animals - mainly Welsh Black and South Devon, occasionally Aberdeen Angus, Hereford and Galloway - on Devon moorland and has them slaughtered locally by appointment for minimum stress. They are hung properly and well-butchered. Since Wild Beef is essentially a one-man operation, Vines' service can be more personal than most. Sometimes, he will deliver the meat direct to the individual customer, depending on whether this works in with his timetable for restaurant deliveries in the same area. Otherwise, it arrives by overnight courier. Wild Beef sells not only prime cuts and mince but also skirt, shin, oxtail, tongue, kidneys, liver and heart - items offered only rarely by outlets of this sort. Those with a sense of adventure will relish news of the Cool Chile Company. Owner Dodie Miller is dedicated to promoting chillies as more than just volcanic spices - and she is quietly persuasive. Mexico State University recognises more than 1,000 varieties and Miller sells a splendid selection, each variety dried and labelled with a heat scale warning. They are accompanied by enthusiastic notes about uses and suggested recipe ideas. Under her tuition, I tried a few choice samples, ranging from fruity mild to positively breathtaking. But even those cooks afraid to experiment with chillies will delight in the colours and shapes of some of them. If you fancy becoming a food producer - albeit just for your own needs  - you might like to consider buying a do-it-yourself shitake mushroom grower's kit imported from Finland by ESC. This consists of a small, spore-impregnated log packed in its own little Perspex greenhouse environment. Expected yield is a kilo of shitake mushrooms spread over four crops. No green fingers are needed. J. Sainsbury, meanwhile, has just started to sell fresh wild girolles and grey chanterelles. Ceps (porcini), pieds de mouton and trompettes des morts will follow shortly, and morels will be introduced in the spring. The bad news is that - initially, at least - just seven stores in London (Camden, Chiswick, Cromwell Road, Dulwich, Fulham, Ladbroke Grove and Hampton St Claires) and one in Southampton (Hedge End) are to stock them.

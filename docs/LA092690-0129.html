			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH SCHOOL DISTRICT;  </P> <P> HARD-FOUGHT BOARD RACES CAP AN ACRIMONIOUS YEAR  </P> <P> After a year that has seen a worsening budget crisis, the controversial  departure of the superintendent and an exodus of other administrators and  teachers, the Huntington Beach City School District is set for what promises to  be a vigorously contested school board race.  </P> <P> Seven candidates -- three incumbents and four challengers -- are vying for  three seats in the Nov. 6 election. The victors will be faced with the task of  restoring harmony to a board that has been torn by frequent infighting among  members, a lengthy teachers' labor dispute and the dismissal of Supt. Diana  Peters.  </P> <P> Board President Sherry Barlow and Trustee Patricia Cohen, both nine-year  members of the board, are each making third reelection bids largely on the  promise to continue the district's goals and direction of the past decade.  </P> <P> In the other corner is Trustee Robert Mann, an independent voice of dissent on  the board since his election in 1987. Mann argues that the status quo is  misdirected and is calling for greater communication both within the district  and with parents, while favoring more power for teachers and the channeling of  more money into educational programs.  </P> <P> The challengers, representing a divergent range of viewpoints, are also  clamoring for changes in the district, particularly stressing the need to  enhance communication and bridge the divisions on the board.  </P> <P> Shirley Carey, a health consultant and active community volunteer, and Brian  Garland, a former board member and current principal at Edison High School,  both support many of the viewpoints Mann has advocated. Both, for example,  favor giving teachers a greater voice in district decisions and spending more  money on programs and, if possible, teachers' salaries.  </P> <P> Not coincidentally, Carey, Garland and Mann are endorsed by the Huntington  Beach Elementary Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, challengers Michael Cassidy, a lawyer and former police officer, and  Brian Rechsteiner, an oil company executive, take a more conservative approach  to proposing change. Both, for example, say they support teachers' issues but  question whether the union leadership accurately represents those concerns.  </P> <P> Because of the problems facing the board, many observers -- including the  candidates on the Nov. 6 ballot other than Barlow and Cohen -- view the  district as being in disarray.  </P> <P> Trustees were compelled this year to withdraw $200,000 from district reserves  to balance the budget. Last year's teachers' contract negotiations were bitter  and prolonged, marked by teachers who picketed, denounced trustees, threatened  to strike and boycotted many school activities.  </P> <P> But the issue that perhaps most threatens to further divide the district is the  board's decision in July to buy out Peters' contract three years before it was  scheduled to expire.  </P> <P> The board paid Peters more than $140,000 in exchange for her resignation.  However, under a gag order included in the buyout agreement, neither the board  nor Peters has elaborated on the "philosophical differences" they say led to  her departure.  </P> <P> All of the candidates say they hope to put the issue behind them, but Peters'  dismissal will inevitably be a focal point of the campaign.  </P> <P> Carey, for example, recently issued a news release attempting to dispel rumors  that she is endorsed by Peters.  </P> <P> Both Barlow and Cohen have to wrestle with the legally binding gag order, while  trying to explain why they joined the board majority in giving Peters a pay  raise and contract extension through 1993 -- less than a year before paying her  to leave.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Mann, who opposed Peters' raise and contract extension, and the  challengers also must field questions about Peters' administration and her  departure. Since the new board will be appointing her successor, its views on  Peters' managerial style, which will weigh heavily into that decision, must be  addressed during the campaign.  </P> <P> Among the challengers, Cassidy has perhaps stated the most defined viewpoint on  the Peters issue. "I think she did a heckuva job," he said of the former  superintendent. "I don't know why (trustees) did what they did."  </P> <P> Rechsteiner said he believes that the district's educational programs reflect  well on Peters, but he considers the teachers union's two votes of no  confidence in Peters a significant strike against her administration.  </P></p>

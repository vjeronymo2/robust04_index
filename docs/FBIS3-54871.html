			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel O. Slyusarev: "The Members of Ukraine's </F> Officers' Union Have Something To Think About"]    [Text] What has the Officers' Trade Union  Organization achieved over the period of its existence?    1. Transferred approximately 1,000 officers serving outside  Ukraine, those whom Ukraine's Ministry of Defense did not want  to accept (General Ihnatenko) into Ukraine's Armed Forces.    2. Forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to provide us with  12  Il-76 aircraft for transferring 500 officers, members of their  families, and household effects from Azerbaijan to Ukraine, as  well as automobiles for transporting their belongings from  airports to their residences in Ukraine.    3. Forced the government of the defense minister of  Azerbaijan to pay increased monetary compensation for the living  quarters rented in Azerbaijan by members of the organization at  the rate of 5,000 Russian rubles [R] per one square meter of  total area and not R3,000 per one square meters of useful area.  In comparison with other servicemen, members of the  organization obtained an additional R250,000-300,000 in  September 1992 prices.    4. By the organization's actions and with the help of the  Supreme Council, forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to cancel  Order No. 194 on introducing the notorious contract system for  the continuation of service in Ukraine's Armed Forces.    5. In March 1993, won the court case against the Darnytsya  housing office as a result of which an apartment in Kiev became  the property of Captain Yermakov and his family. The court took  the side of the trade union, even though, in accordance with the  law, Yermakov had not been entitled to that apartment because  neither he nor the members of his family were registered in that  apartment. It was the serviceman's father who had lived there  before he died. The organization maintained the empty apartment  for five months until Yermakov was transferred from the  Transbaykal region to Ukraine's Armed Forces.    6. In August 1993, won the court case against Major General  Gvozdev, chief of the Air Defense Academy, who demanded the  eviction of the family of Lieutenant Colonel Avramenko, a  graduate of the academy, from the official apartment and for  that reason ordered not to issue a payment book to him.  Avramenko and his family continue to live in the same apartment  and the payment book is in his pocket.    7. In October 1993, forced the Council of People's Deputies  of Bila Tserkva to put an end to the procrastination and  allocate plots of land for building to the housing construction  society "Hayok" -- our cell in Bila Tserkva. The chairman of  the local council, Shulypa, resolved this question positively.    8. Protected member of the organization Major of the Guard  Lalak from being dismissed into the reserve before reaching the  length of service entitling him to benefits, despite the fact  that two assessment commissions in the regiment and the division  unanimously decided that it was "expedient to dismiss him into  the reserve." The organization conducted explanatory work with  the command, and the latter adopted the only correct decision --  to allow him to continue his service.    9. Forced head of the Zaliznychnyy District Military  Committee to renounce its illegal action -- an attempt to  dismiss member of the organization Major Melnykov into the  reserve without providing him with housing. An additional  session on legal training sufficed.    10. Instituted court proceedings against Defense Minister  Colonel General K. Morozov in order to protect the honor and  dignity of the Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen and its right  to existence. However, after Morozov was dismissed from his  post, the Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen  dropped the case.    All of the above is quite sufficient to prove that the  Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen, which unites  within its ranks the most conscious, best organized, and honored  Ukrainian officers, is the only organization of servicemen  capable of protecting its members and contributing to the honor,  dignity, and significance of officers, as well as making our  army one of the most advanced armies in the world.    What can the Ukrainian Officers' Union say to this to  justify  itself?</p>

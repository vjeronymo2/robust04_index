			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Atlantic dialogue In December 1989, a month after the wall was breached, US Secretary of State James Baker made a speech in Berlin in which, as well as calling for German reunification within Nato, he proposed 'a strengthened set of institutional and consultative links' between the European Community (as it then was) and the US. It was a thoughtful and imaginative speech, which foreshadowed almost uncannily what has become the Clinton administration's policy towards Europe. Yesterday President Clinton was himself in Berlin, for a visit full of symbolism. As the first US president to visit a reunited Berlin, and the last to review a US garrison there, he inevitably struck a triumphal note. But he also held a US-EU summit in Berlin with Mr Helmut Kohl, as chairman of the European Council, and Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. This meeting was deliberately staged as the climax of Mr Clinton's third visit to Europe this year. He and his advisers have been working hard to demonstrate that they do have a European policy as well as a Russian policy, and that the two are not completely disconnected. They talk, in a conscious echo of the EU's own phraseology, about 'deepening and widening the transatlantic community', sometimes even about the need to build a new one rather than prop up the old. They believe, moreover, that this must involve a strong bilateral relationship between the US and an EU expanding eastward under German leadership. That was very much Mr Baker's theme. He saw that Nato, even if still essential in an adapted form, could never provide a satisfactory institutional framework for this new transatlantic community. Nato puts too much emphasis on military forces, at a time when military aspects of security are no longer the most immediate or most decisive; and Nato casts the US in more of a dominant role in Europe than it now needs or is willing to play. Europe as such is not represented in Nato. Yet nearly five years after Mr Baker spoke, work on building this new community has hardly begun. For that the main responsibility lies with Europe. US presidential visits are still treated as a kind of beauty contest, with each European country striving to demonstrate that its relationship with the US is the most 'special'; and yet EU members seem to find it easier to agree on free trade with Russia than with the US. In spite of all the sound and fury surrounding Maastricht, Europe has still not endowed itself with the capacity to manage collectively, in a coherent and integrated manner, what is surely its most important external relationship.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / BMA says some hospitals allow fundholder patients to jump queues More than four in 10 hospitals allow patients of GP fundholders to jump queues for treatment, says a survey of 247 hospitals by the British Medical Association. In the Wessex health region, 67 per cent of hospitals admitted giving priority to patients of fundholders, whereas less than one in five hospitals in north-west England entered special arrangements. Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA's central consultants and specialists committee, said: 'Doctors throughout the country are committed to NHS treatment on the basis of need - and this survey raises serious issues about whether the present arrangements are making this top priority.' The survey shows 42 per cent of 'fast-tracking' hospitals gave priority to GP fundholder patients routinely as part of contract negotiations.</p>

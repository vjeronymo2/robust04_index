			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: GPG escapes a second share suspension GPG, the London-registered investment vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, narrowly escaped having its shares suspended on the New Zealand Stock Exchange when it met a second deadline to file an annual report. The company, whose shares remain suspended in London, was given a warning on January 31 for failing to supply accounts, and set the new deadline. Sir Ron Brierley, chairman, blamed the delay on the company's adoption of new British accounting standards. In December, GPG reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 4.7m) for the year to September 30. Earnings per share rose from 1.49p to 3.38p. No dividend is declared. This is the first set of annual results after the formation of the company from a rump of the Guinness Peat financial services group. GPG, which started as a shell company with Dollars 115m in cash a year ago, now holds 25 stocks. GPG lifted its investment in listed companies to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23m). Its Australian listed holdings had a market value of Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 9.7m) invested in the rest of the world. The market valuations compared with a purchase price of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 7.63m).</p>

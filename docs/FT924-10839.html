			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Australia reconsiders ABB bid THE State Energy Commission of Western Australia said yesterday it would consider a revised proposal from Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss/Swedish engineering group, to develop a ADollars 2bn (Pounds 840m) power station. ABB was commissioned in June to build and operate Australia's first privately owned and funded power station at Collie, near a coalfield in south-west Western Australia. However, the project appeared close to collapse two weeks ago after the state government indicated that it would not accept ABB's proposed electricity prices, or its attempts to win state-government financial support. The group is believed to have reapproached the commission last week in a bid to retain its sole-bidder status for the project. The commission said the revised bid would be considered by a special board meeting next week. However, it was not clear whether prices had been reduced to a level acceptable to the state government.</p>

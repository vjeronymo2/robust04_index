			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat  ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani Wednesday said the Iranian people's  enmity with the U.S. is a historical, revolutionary, ideological  and religious matter.    "Washington's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is  childish, immature, and unripe," Rowhani said in an interview  published by the periodical "MAJLES AND RESEARCH".    He said "the U.S. is hostile to Iran and it does not make  its  hostility a secret...our people have always suffered blows and  seen violence on the part of the U.S."    "The task of determining the basic policies of the country  and the system initially rests with the leader (Ayatollah 'Ali  Khamene'i) and he has explicitly reaffirmed that we have no  interest in relations with the U.S. and that such relations are  detrimental to us," he said.    "Not all countries of the world are friends of the U.S. but  their tones may differ from ours. They may speak in a  diplomatic tone or hide their real intentions. But the Islamic  Republic's positions are clear and obvious," the vice-speaker  said.    He added that despite attempts of enemies to misportray Iran  as a country wishing to launch aggression on or intervene in the  internal affairs of other countries what has happened over the  past few years proved that such rumors were nothing but  unfounded and baseless propaganda.    The parliamentarian maintained that the Islamic Republic has  managed to show its Islamic and human face to the world  particularly during the past few years.    But, he added, it is natural for a country like Iran which  intends to live independently in the Third World and in such a  sensitive region as the Middle East to be threatened by its  enemies.    "Whether wanted or not, the Islamic Republic of Iran is  shouldering the leadership of many communities of the world.  But Iran's leadership is different from America's domineering  leadership... Iran governs hearts of millions of people  throughout the world," Rowhani reiterated.    Iran has been identified as a powerful and independent  country, as a country whose religion and politics, its people  and officials are in harmony, a country opposed to aggression, a  peace-loving country and a country which is truly loyal to its  slogans and causes, he said.    The Majles vice-speaker also blasted the U.S.-sponsored new  world order and said not only the number of conflicts between  countries has increased but also a country is occupied by  another country under the so-called new world order.</p>

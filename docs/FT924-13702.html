			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy September's producer price figures already show some impact of devaluation on input costs. Two thirds of the 0.6 per cent monthly rise was accounted for by higher prices for petroleum products and the 'other imported materials' category. No doubt the increases will accelerate in coming months. But the consolation is that the output price figures show how little inflation was in the pipeline when the sterling crisis struck. The underlying year-on-year rate of output inflation, which excludes food, drink and tobacco, is only 2.6 per cent. The monthly rate has been stuck at 0.1 per cent since May. More encouraging still, the divergence between output inflation and input prices, which have fallen 0.4 per cent over the past year, suggests manufacturers have room to absorb higher import costs in their margins - particularly so given the decline in unit labour costs. After yesterday's mortgage cut by Abbey National there is ample ground to expect retail inflation to remain subdued for the time being. Whether that translates into an early cut in interest rates is another matter. A poor set of unemployment figures on Thursday would be an obvious opportunity. But if the Birmingham summit turned out to be a fiasco, the authorities could then almost immediately find that sterling was again in sharp decline. They must also be aware that industry will move to recoup any loss in margins at the first sign of recovery.</p>

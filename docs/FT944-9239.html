			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCI quiet as Ambroveneto deadline passes Banca Commerciale Italiana, the Milan-based bank, appears formally to have abandoned its attempt to gain control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, its quoted competitor. BCI had hoped to acquire a 15 per cent stake by yesterday, as the basis for a formal L7,000-a-share offer for a 50.1 per cent stake in Ambroveneto. But the self-imposed deadline passed yesterday without comment from BCI. Ambroveneto announced that its main shareholders - controlling a majority of the shares - had rallied to its defence on November 5, only three days after BCI revealed its intention to bid for control. Crediop, a subsidiary of the Turin-based San Paolo banking group, and Credit Agricole, the French bank, agreed to buy the 13.52 per cent stake offered to them by a group of small Veneto banks, and renew the shareholder syndicate of which they are members. BCI had hoped to buy the Veneto banks' stake. Ambroveneto's shares closed yesterday at L4,354, up slightly on the opening price of L4,314. BCI, which would have paid about L1,750bn (Dollars 1.1bn) for half of Ambroveneto, raised about L1,575bn with an issue of shares and warrants earlier this year. Conversion of the warrants before the end of next year would bring in a further L787bn. There is speculation the bank will use these funds on alternative expansion plans. BCI's neighbour and rival, Credito Italiano (Credit), is still awaiting a decision from the Bank of Italy on whether it can go ahead with its planned bid for control of Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo (Rolo). The central bank last week approved Rolo's proposal for a defensive merger with the group which controls the savings bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna. Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is watching the situation in case the merger does not go ahead.</p>

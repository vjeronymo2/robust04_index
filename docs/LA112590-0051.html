			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUREAUCRATIC BLOCK  </P> <P> We visited Ellis Island by ferry from New Jersey on Sept. 25 and found the  following:  </P> <P> Ellis Island is part of New York state, but is located about 1,000 feet from  the New Jersey shore. While the main building was being remodeled, they built a  temporary bridge to New Jersey, but now the bureaucrats have decided it must be  removed.  </P> <P> The bridge would permit visitors to walk the short distance from the mainland  to the museum, rather than stand in line and pay $6 for the few-minute boat  ride.  </P> <P> One official said if people could walk to Ellis Island, they would lose the  feeling of isolation the immigrants felt while they were on this island. More  likely his brother owns the ferry boat company!  </P> <P> JAMES T. HUMBERD, La Quinta  </P></p>

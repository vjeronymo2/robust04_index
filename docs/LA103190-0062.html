			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRETZKY DELIVERS PAYBACK;  </P> <P> HOCKEY: HE POWERS THE KINGS TO A 4-1 VICTORY OVER THE LAST-PLACE ISLANDERS  AFTER BEING KNOCKED DOWN BY PILON.  </P> <P> A decade ago, they were the kings and Nassau Coliseum was their castle.  </P> <P> The New York Islanders ruled the NHL, drinking out of the Stanley Cup four  consecutive years at the start of the 1980s. Teams would tiptoe in here,  already intimidated, and stumble out, having been dominated.  </P> <P> But no more.  </P> <P> The new Kings on the block, the Smythe Division leaders from L.A., showed no  respect for that tradition of excellence Tuesday night, beating the Islanders,  4-1, before 12,760.  </P> <P> Everybody seems to be doing that lately to the Islanders. These are teams  streaking in opposite directions.  </P> <P> It was the Kings' seventh victory in their last eight games and their third in  four road games. In eight of their 12 games, the Kings (9-2-1) have given up  two or fewer goals, and have won all eight.  </P> <P> The Islanders (3-9), last in the Patrick Division, have lost six of their last  seven, giving up 28 goals in their last four losses.  </P> <P> Asked what the Islanders' problems are, Coach Al Arbour replied, "From  goaltending right on out."  </P> <P> Winning goalie Kelly Hrudey, who continues to alternate with Daniel Berthiaume,  faced 33 shots.  </P> <P> "We are fortunate that Kelly Hrudey stood on his head to stop some of those  shots," teammate Wayne Gretzky said. "The score was not indicative of how close  the game was."  </P> <P> Actually, the game seemed close only until Gretzky was flattened in a corner by  New York's Rich Pilon.  </P> <P> King defenseman Rod Buskas had begun the scoring at 7:35 of the first period,  putting the puck between the pads of goalie Danny Lorenz for his first goal as  a King.  </P> <P> Lorenz, getting his first NHL start, didn't fold, however.  </P> <P> With the Islanders taking 11 of the first 12 shots on goal, Buskas' goal being  the exception, it appeared the Kings might be letting their minds wander,  perhaps to tonight's showdown across the river with the Rangers.  </P> <P> Then, the Kings got their wakeup call, a ringing in Gretzky's ears.  </P> <P> Showing uncharacteristic emotion, Gretzky fired a few spoken shots at the  Islanders.  </P> <P> And the puck into the net.  </P> <P> His goal, coming on a power play, was set up by an excellent pass from  defenseman Rob Blake. Blake, on the right side, faked a slap shot, but instead  whipped the puck to Gretzky, facing an open net near the right post.  </P> <P> Gretzky flipped the puck in for his eighth goal and 24th point, tying Tomas  Sandstrom for the team lead in the former category and extending his own team  high in the latter.  </P> <P> It was the 14th point for Blake, tops among all rookies.  </P> <P> Even after he had scored, Gretzky continued to shout at the Islanders.  </P> <P> "That probably got me into the game," Gretzky said of the blow he took. "The  team seemed to get going after that. Sometimes it takes something like that.  You realize that if you stand around, you are going to get hit. You've got to  keep skating."  </P> <P> That the Kings did, adding Tony Granato's sixth goal and Luc Robitaille's  seventh in the second period to put the game away.  </P> <P> New York's only goal was scored by Gary Nylund, his first.  </P> <P> The Islanders held the Kings to 25 shots, but couldn't produce enough offense.  </P> <P> Lorenz is expected to be replaced in the net by former King Glenn Healy, who  has missed seven games because of a leg injury. Fellow goalie Mark Fitzpatrick  has sidelined all season because of a disease that causes swelling of muscles  and tissues. Also injured are goalie Jeff Hackett and forward Alan Kerr.  </P> <P> High up in the rafters, the faded NHL championship banners still hang -- mute  testimony to an era that has passed.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NERVES, NORTH HOLLYWOOD FAIL TO STOP VAN NUYS GIRLS  </P> <P> The Van Nuys High girls' basketball team on Wednesday fired more errant  missiles than are launched from Cape Canaveral, missing its first 15 shots.  </P> <P> Call it nervous tension.  </P> <P> In a game matching undefeated Mid-Valley League teams, the Wolves felt  uncomfortable playing for a possible championship at North Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I was so nervous because this game meant so much to me," said Van Nuys center  Stacie Toon, who missed her first six shots. "We're playing for first place and  I was scared."  </P> <P> Toon settled down to register 26 points and 16 rebounds as the Wolves overcame  a 12-point deficit to beat North Hollywood, 70-58.  </P> <P> The Wolves (16-3, 6-0 in league play) have not won a league championship since  1983, the year they lost to Granada Hills in the City Section 3-A Division  title game. And just last season, North Hollywood (9-6, 5-1) whipped them twice  by 20 points.  </P> <P> But Van Nuys is a different team with a more mature Toon in the lineup. The  Wolves, who trailed, 16-4, in the first quarter, got their first break early in  the second when North Hollywood point guard Suzi Shimoyama picked up her fourth  foul.  </P> <P> Van Nuys outscored North Hollywood, 23-8, in the pivotal second quarter and  held a 32-24 halftime lead. That margin grew to 18 points as Toon scored 13  points in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Jacinda Sweet had 36 points to pace North Hollywood.  </P></p>

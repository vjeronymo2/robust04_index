			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Boost from Laidlaw helps Quicks advance to Pounds 3m Quicks Group, the Manchester-based motor distributor, reported a 48 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.04m yesterday, up from Pounds 2.06m the previous year. Turnover grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 253m (Pounds 199m) almost entirely reflecting a Pounds 52m contribution from the Laidlaw group of five Ford main dealerships, which were acquired in July last year. Earnings per share from the enlarged group, which now consists of 18 car dealerships, 10 of which are Ford, increased by 22 per cent to 9.5p (7.8p) and the final dividend is being raised to 3p (2.75p) making a 5p (4.5p) total for the year. Operating profits grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 3.66m) including a Pounds 336,000 contribution from Laidlaw, while net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 1.6m). The group noted that the recovery apparent in the first half continued into the second half with pre-tax profits, on an equivalent basis, at Pounds 1.61m compared with Pounds 950,000 for the 1992 period. Mr Alec Murray, managing director, said that this near doubling of second-half profits reflected the continuance of strict management controls following the installation of the new management team in late 1991, and in particular the profit impact of the run-down of the group's leasing activities. Quicks' overall new car registrations had exceeded manufacturers' targets and the sales of used vehicles had been higher than the previous year's total. Despite difficult market conditions the group's service, bodywork and parts distribution business also continued to be profitable. Mr Murray stated that 'margins in every part of our business have remained under pressure for the whole year', but added that 'management action to further reduce the cost base has helped offset margin erosion.' So far this year trading conditions had improved with registrations of both cars and commercial vehicles ahead of last year. 'The market remains highly competitive, but it is encouraging that Ford has begun to strengthen its position', Mr Murray said.</p>

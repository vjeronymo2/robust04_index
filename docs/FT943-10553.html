			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Strains in the new South Africa Convention usually allows new governments 100 days before critically appraising their performance. But South Africa's wave of strikes, together with signs of tensions in the government of national unity, suggest that President Nelson Mandela's post-inauguration honeymoon is over before this traditional period of grace has expired. Ironically, his most serious challenge is orchestrated by the African National Congress's long-standing ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu). More than 100,000 workers have gone on strike for higher wages, with Cosatu's blessing. Many of its most experienced leaders, whose pragmatism contributed greatly to South Africa's remarkable transition, are now in the national or provincial governments, or hold jobs in the private sector. Their successors in the union movement have yet to be persuaded that South Africa needs a social compact which will put job creation before higher wages that erode its ability to compete in international markets. The workers' impatience to see the benefits of the post-apartheid era are understandable. In their view, Mr Mandela has done more to set at rest whites' fears than he has done to meet black expectations since he was sworn in on May 10. Fiscal discipline was the watchword in the June budget, which left many blacks disappointed and dashed trade unions' hopes that zero-rating on VAT would be extended to a wider range of staples. Yet it brought a sigh of relief from whites, who regarded a 5 per cent surcharge on income tax a small price to pay for the successful transition. Inexperienced team Since then the government has appeared immobilised, moving painfully slowly to implement key pledges in its election manifesto. An inexperienced team of ANC ministers and officials is short of expertise, while the civil service's middle and upper echelons are dominated by whites who for the most part support the National party. An ambitious housing programme with the aim of building 1m units in five years has yet to get under way, as the government weighs the merits of build-it-yourself schemes against fully developed housing estates. The former are quickly delivered, but can easily become urban slums; the latter are more costly but more likely to meet black expectations. Reform is proceeding painfully slowly in a second area critical to the ANC's popularity. Promises to redress inequalities in land distribution, whereby 87 per cent of land remains in white hands, are constrained by provisions in the bill of rights and by concern not to disrupt commercial agriculture. Power centres The government also faces potential problems from an unexpected quarter. Although seven of the nine provincial governments are controlled by ANC delegates, they are becoming power centres in their own right. The list of Mr Mandela's difficulties does not end there. Natal has yet to find peace, while a proposed investigation into human rights abuses during the apartheid era - the so-called 'truth commission' - could easily add to the strains. Meanwhile the National party, led by deputy president FW de Klerk, is showing signs of dissatisfaction with the coalition, wondering whether its chances in the next election might be better served in opposition. Although a junior partner, its co-operation is essential to the success of the country's Reconstruction and Development Plan. These problems need be no more than teething troubles, and they must be placed alongside what has already been achieved. This is easy to underestimate. The threat from the right that once appeared capable of destabilising the entire transition has been defused if not destroyed. Hundreds of millions of dollars of aid have been promised, and a sensible plan exists for spending them on tangible improvements in the quality of life of millions of impoverished blacks. Meanwhile, all over the country the transformation quietly continues, as residents of white suburbs and black townships find ways to co-operate in local government and to integrate state-owned schools and hospitals. The imperative that brought South Africa through its election holds good in its new era: better a slow start than a false start.</p>

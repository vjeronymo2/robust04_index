			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Left seeks to lead Revenue union The broad left is mounting a serious challenge to capture the top job in the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, the 57,000-strong tax officers' union. As a postal ballot for the post of general secretary began yesterday, the present leader Mr Clive Brooke is coming under attack from Mr John Ellis, a tax official from Crewe, Cheshire, who sits on the executive. Mr Ellis is calling for 'an immediate change of direction' in the union by launching a campaign of lawful industrial action against the government's plans to market-test and privatise Inland Revenue services. 'The purpose of such a campaign is to force our bosses around a real negotiating table,' said Mr Ellis, who also wants a shorter working week for tax officers, increased annual leave, and job security through redeployment. Mr Ellis is calling for a 'pro-active agenda rather than one where the union does nothing more than react and accommodate the Inland Revenue's agenda'. He wants a leadership that 'can relate to members' fears, anger and aspirations'. Although Mr Brooke also opposes the government's plans, he argues that industrial action is 'only one' of many weapons the union can use to defend its members. He says disruption 'should never be taken for its own sake' because there is 'no point in winning a glorious defeat'. 'I stand for practical steps to defend members rather than to expose them to real risks to their jobs,' said Mr Brooke. He added that the union had taken industrial action over market-testing under his leadership, but had also sought to persuade the government to change direction. He said no Revenue staff had suffered compulsory redundancy, national pay bargaining had been maintained and there had been pay rises, not freezes, for staff during the past five years.</p>

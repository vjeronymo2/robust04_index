			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel safety assessed Travelling through the Channel tunnel should be at least 30 times safer than travelling by train above ground, says a safety manual prepared for the Pounds 10bn project. Eurotunnel, which will run trains through the tunnel, yesterday unveiled a 1,000-page analysis of the risks and the procedures it has adopted to reduce them. The tunnel 'safety case' is due to be published within the next two weeks. It identifies more than 50 possible hazards including fires, derailments, obstructions on the line and earthquakes. After four months of testing of the tunnel procedures, including round-the-clock operation of a full train service, Eurotunnel hopes to obtain safety clearance to start freight services early next week. Eurotunnel initially set itself a risk factor for foot passengers of no more than 4.7 deaths per 100m journeys, while for passengers with their cars the risk of death should not exceed 5.6 per 100m journeys. But the risk to passengers without cars is 50 times lower than the criteria set, and those with cars 30 times lower because of the safety measures adopted. Rail link decision, Page 10</p>

Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki  Kumano  told a press conference that it is possible that some parts of  the four-point package, originally planned for release by the  end of March, will be unveiled toward the July summit of the  Group of Seven industrial nations in Naples.    Kumano was referring to remarks earlier in the day by Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura indicating a possible delay  in the market-opening measures beyond the end of fiscal 1993.    Market-opening steps in four areas are being worked out by  the government following the breakdown in February of the trade  "framework" talks with the United States. The areas are  deregulation, import and investment promotion, government  procurement systems and competition policy.    The Naples summit could become a new deadline for some of  the  four measures, Kumano said. He declined to comment on which  sectors might be delayed.</p>

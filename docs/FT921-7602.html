			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Bell strikes a minor chord for owners - Why production prospects for the mine have been downgraded EXASPERATED MINERS who have tried to make money out of the Big Bell mine in Western Australia discovered too late that it has an ore body so perverse, unpredictable and unique that they never should have tried to extract its gold. Placer Pacific, the mine operator, believes it has solved most of the problems but admits that Big Bell is unlikely to recover the ADollars 145m invested in it at the end of the 1980s. Big Bell is testimony to the old adage: 'Mining is a risky business and nothing can be proven until it is mined.' Sportingly, Placer Dome, Canada's biggest gold mining group which owns 75.8 per cent of Placer Pacific, has described Big Bell's horrors in its latest in-house magazine Prospect. The mine is located 540 km (335 miles) north-east of Perth and 28 km north-west of Cue in the Murchison Goldfields. Joint venturers, Placer and ACM Gold, started mining in February 1989 in an orthodox open pit operation, the type familiar to mining engineers the world over. Exploration drilling in the usual way had determined the grade (the amount by mass of metal or mineral in an ore) and limits of the ore body and a mining plan was developed. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we should have analysed not only the ore body but the waste as well to see what we were up against,' Prospect quotes Mr Peter Neilans as saying. He was the mine superintendent at Big Bell, but recently transferred to the group's Gibraltar mine in British Columbia. Big Bell's waste proved to be extremely hard and abrasive and drill penetration was too low to keep up with the expected mining rate. Another nasty surprise was that the contact between waste and ore was sudden, erratic and unpredictable. In many ore bodies the grade varies by gradual increments from lower to higher values. At Big Bell ore and waste are mixed in an inconsistent jumble. Placer says it is difficult to get reliable assays, which reveal the gold content, because of the irregular way the gold is disseminated through the rock. From the moment mining started at Big Bell grades were disappointingly below those predicted and the conventional solution - changing the cut-off grade (the lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic) - was attempted. But that did not work. And as Mr Neilans recalls: 'We found we were stockpiling economic ore. There was no mineable cut-off between economic and sub-economic ore. 'We have found that we have to mill sub-economic ore to avoid throwing out the economic ore with it. There is material that contains grades ranging between the geological and economic cut-off that is inseparable.' All this meant that costs soared to unacceptable levels. In 1990 Big Bell produced more than 111,000 troy ounces of gold - but at an average cost of USDollars 504 an ounce. The gold price averaged Dollars 385 that year. Placer went back to square one and developed a new 'life of mine' plan. This will involve reducing the planned depth of the open pit from 315 to 240 metres so that not so much waste will have to be shifted. For the life of the open pit, to early 1994, Big Bell is predicted to produced about 115,000 ounces a year. At that stage the joint venture will be wound up unless the partners decide to start underground mining. That would not be worthwhile unless the gold price was likely to stay much higher than it is today. The new life of mine plan resulted in Placer writing down its investment in Big Bell by nearly ADollars 30m net. (That was after accounting for the sale of surplus equipment, such as five 170-tonne haul trucks.) About 50 of the 250 jobs at the mine were also lost in 1990. Among other things, the new plan involves the Big Bell pit walls being anchored with stabilisers of cable bolts driven as much as 30 metres deep into them. Although this is not a new method of preventing walls from falling into a pit, Placer points out that the method has never before been tried in a pit with such steep walls. In the first half of last year Big Bell's cash cost of production had fallen to Dollars 364 an ounce, still only marginally below the average gold price of Dollars 366 - and the cash cost does not include financing and other charges. Meanwhile, the mining problems are not yet over. Big Bell used to be an underground mine. Between 1937 and 1955 about 5.6m tonnes of ore was mined, yielding 643,000 ounces of gold and 219,000 ounces of silver. Mining the open pit has exposed the old workings. Placer's huge mechanical shovels have been biting into old iron, rails and support timbers. This necessitated another costly step unnecessary in a conventional mine: probe drilling to ensure the ground over which the giant shovels and haul trucks in the pit are travelling is safe. 'Otherwise the heavy machines might collapse catastrophically into a cavern of old workings,' Placer points out. Undaunted by the Big Bell experience, Placer says: 'Every cloud has a silver lining. From Placer Dome's point of view the knowledge gained from this unique mine is like money in the bank'. That must surely remind us of another peculiarity of this business: mining is indeed very risky - but it is an industry which attracts incurable optimists.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 18 January (MTI) -- Russia is prepared to  deliver S-300 type anti-aircraft missile systems in repayment of  its $800 million debt to Hungary, Ferenc Toth, head of the  Hungarian Defence Ministry's Department of Procurement,  confirmed in the Tuesday [18 January] issue of MAGYAR HIRLAP.    The Russian position seems to have modified, he said. When  Moscow repaid the first half of its debt through the delivery of  MiG-29 fighters last year, it was still unwilling to sell  anti-aircraft missile systems to Hungary. S-300 is a long-range  anti-aircraft missile system with parameters corresponding to  those of the U.S. Patriots used in the Gulf War, Toth said.    Now it is up to the Hungarian Government and Parliament to  decide whether they accept the Russian offer, he said.    Should they accept it, it is not yet clear how many systems  Hungary would purchase. Nor does the Russian offer mention  figures, Toth said. He added that the Hungarian Army was not  thinking in terms of missiles but those of systems that include  launching pads and other units as well.    Reacting to the information carried in THE WASHINGTON POST  that the "Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary) have been allowed to purchase US weapons  and military equipment," Toth said he supposed the U.S. had  lifted its ban on the sale of "offensive-killing" weapons. This  category is rather broad and comprises even guns and tanks, the  Hungarian Defence Ministry official said.</p>

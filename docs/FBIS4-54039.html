			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to the  United States Takakazu Kuriyama said Wednesday [25 May] Japan  needs to take steps to significantly reduce its current account  surplus and implement a market-opening package to successfully  conclude the trade framework talks with the U.S.    Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the  upcoming U.S. visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, made  the remarks at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry.    He said Japan and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to get the  deadlocked framework talks back on track because both sides  shared the view that it is undesirable to keep tense economic  and trade relations "drifting" since that would hurt overall  bilateral relations.    Tokyo and Washington also reached the accord because it  deepened understanding about each other's positions on the trade  negotiations, he said.    Kuriyama said the greatest problem regarding economic and  trade relations between Japan and the U.S. is that there is a  lack of mutual trust.    Japan fears the U.S. will try to apply numerical targets to  measure the openness of Japan's market and threaten sanctions if  that target is not met, while the U.S. mistrusts Japan as a  country always vowing to do something and then not, he said.    Opinion polls in both countries also show that trust and  respect toward each others' nations are waning, Kuriyama said,  attributing the reason to the failure of the framework  negotiations in February.    The trade framework talks is aimed at boosting mutual  understanding, he said.    Kuriyama, who is in Japan from Monday through Saturday, said  he carried a message to Emperor Akihito from U.S. President Bill  Clinton welcoming the imperial visit to the U.S.    Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko are scheduled to visit  the U.S. from June 10 to 25.    Touching on concerns abroad that Japan may come to possess  nuclear weapons, Kuriyama said he tries to sweep away such  concern by explaining Japan's nonnuclear position and the  Japanese people's feeling on the matter.    The ambassador said it is impossible for Japan to possess  nuclear weapons because an overwhelming majority of the people  are against it and because Japan is a member of the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and, therefore, has an  international obligation not to possess nuclear weapons.    Also, not a single country among Japan's neighbors support  Japan possessing nuclear weapons, he said.</p>

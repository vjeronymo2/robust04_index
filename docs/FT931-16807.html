			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Gunfire greets Boutros Ghali in Ethiopia THE TROUBLED Somalia peace mission of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary general, took another turn for the worse yesterday as Ethiopian forces fired on students protesting against UN policy on Eritrea. Four Somali factions boycotted his opening remarks to the Somali peace conference. The incidents in the Ethiopian capital came a day after an angry mob of demonstrators in Mogadishu prevented Mr Boutros Ghali from visiting the UN headquarters in the Somali capital, pelted the building with rocks and chanted 'Boutros Ghali go home'. According to witnesses in Addis Ababa, Ethiopian security forces opened fire directly into a large crowd of students trying to make their way to the conference venue. At least one student was killed, at least a dozen suffered serious gunshot wounds and scores more were later treated for minor injuries. There were unconfirmed reports of a further six fatalities. Student leaders later said they were trying to protest against the UN chief's proposed visit to Eritrea, the northern secessionist province which will vote on independence from Ethiopia in a referendum in April, and petition him on the 'dictatorship' of the Ethiopian government. The UN has sent a mission to Eritrea and agreed to send observers to the referendum - a move deeply resented by some southerners who want to preserve the territorial unity of their country. The shootings occurred an hour before Mr Boutros Ghali opened the Somali peace conference which brings together 14 factions. An alliance of four groups from the southern Darod clans refused to take their seats to hear the UN chief, in protest against the exclusion of three other allied groups. 'Boutros Ghali does not have the right to decide who shall take part in a Somali peace conference,' said Mr Mohammed Hashi, an official of the United Somali Party. However Mr Yusuf Omar Al-Azhari, an official of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, which controls a large swathe of northern Somalia and also joined the boycott, said the alliance was also protesting against the participation of warlords who they allege have massacred their clansmen. The SSDF, he said, was calling for the establishment of a human rights court to try Somali war criminals. 'How could the UN allow people who have denied food and medicine to their own people and perpetrated genocide sit down to talk about peace and decide the future of Somalia?' he asked. UN officials were yesterday playing down expectations of any big achievement from the conference and said at best they hope for agreement on the agenda, venue and list of participants in a future political reconciliation conference. In his conference address Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'The process of national reconciliation will be long difficult. It will take months, and perhaps years. . . We are here today to begin this process. What begins well can end well.' In a much tougher speech, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi castigated the Somali leaders for allowing clan rivalries to destroy their country. 'Because your judgments have been clouded by. . . clan sentiments and animosity you stand now before the Somali people, the international community and history as the principal engineers of the tragedy in Somalia,' he said. The US will begin removing some troops from Somalia this month, but most will remain beyond January, Mr Dick Cheney, defence secretary, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

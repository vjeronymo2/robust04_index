			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Kong Xiangying </F> (1313 4382 6601)]    [Text] Hefei, 26 May (XINHUA) -- An on-the-spot meeting  sponsored by the State Council Environmental Protection  Committee on reviewing the law enforcement of environmental  protection in the Huai He basin concluded in Bangbu, Anhui,  today. During the meeting, a plan for controlling water  pollution in the Huai He basin was adopted, ushering in a  massive effort to control pollution there.    State Councillor Song Jian, who is also in charge of the  State Council Environmental Protection Committee, said that it  is necessary to take economic, administrative, and legal  measures to control the Huai He's pollution within a set time so  as to achieve the goal of making the Huai He clean by the end of  this century.    During the meeting, leaders from four riparian provinces  along the Huai He -- Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong -- as  well as responsible people of relevant state ministries and  commissions adopted a plan for pollution control in the Huai He  basin after carefully analyzing the river's pollution and  control situation. To control Huai He pollution, the following  efforts will be made: The State Council Environmental  Protection Committee and the Water Resources Ministry will take  the lead in forming a Huai He water quality control  organization, with the participation of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu,  and Shandong and relevant State Council departments. The  organization will be responsible for coordinating and planning  the overall control of the Huai He's pollution. A Huai He water  quality pollution control monitoring network will be established  and improved to conduct dynamic monitoring of the river's  mainstream and all major tributaries and carry out a target and  comprehensive control of pollution in all of its sections. A  group of enterprises along the Huai He whose pollution is severe  and hard to control will be closed down, suspended, merged with  other enterprises, or their product lines changed in three  years. The first batch of enterprises whose pollution is severe  and whose economic performance is poor will be closed down,  suspended, merged with other enterprises, or product lines  changed this year. In addition, 200 control projects will be  accomplished in three years. By 2000, all riparian cities and  counties along the river must build water pollution treatment  facilities suitable to local conditions. It is necessary to  formulate relevant laws and regulations concerning the control  of the Huai He's pollution to put the control work on a legal  track. The meeting urged the four riparian provinces to carry  out and accomplish the control plan included in the "Eighth  Five-Year program." Any construction projects that might cause  severe pollution will be banned in the future.    State Councillor Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai  He's pollution, it is necessary to have a resolute attitude and  action and carry out the work in a planned and systematic way.  In this way, we can achieve practical results. We will never  leave the polluted Huai He to the next century. Riparian local  governments at all levels should conscientiously strengthen  their leadership and supervision and inspection. They must  carry out the water pollution control plan. They must clearly  define their responsibility and achieve their goals within the  set time. Any units that are slack in carrying out pollution  control measures or shift their responsibility onto others and  cause bad consequences will be criticized in circulars. If a  case is serious, their leaders shall be investigated and affixed  the responsibility for it.    Song Jian said: In controlling the Huai He's pollution, it  is necessary to adhere to the principle that "polluters are  responsible for cleaning up." Through the cleaning-up process,  it is imperative to help cadres and people living along the Huai  He foster a sense of importance to protect the environment. We  should establish a new norm of social behavior that is  beneficial to the environmental protection. The drive to  control the Huai He's pollution is China's first attempt to  clean up the whole basin of a river that flows through several  provinces. This will be a giant project involving a wide  stretch of areas and many people. Under the leadership of the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council, we should mobilize  leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people to  actively participate in the work. We should launch a joint  effort to control pollution in the Huai He. We must make the  Huai He clean again in this century and provide experiences and  methods for the drive to clean up other transregional rivers in  China.</p>

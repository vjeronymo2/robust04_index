			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Step by step on insolvency harmonisation - Moves to draw a framework for insolvency to facilitate mutual recognition and co-operation Accountants do not often get shot in the line of business. It took the Byzantine collapse of Polly Peck to add this particular danger to the many facing accountants. The accountant concerned, David Adams of Cooper's &amp; Lybrand, was attacked while leaving the firm's Istanbul offices in August. He was, apparently, mistaken for Chris Howell, one of the executives handling the administration of the now bankrupt fruits-to-electronics conglomerate. The gunman later claimed he was offered Pounds 5,000 for the shooting. Meanwhile, the administrators have been subjected to abusive telephone calls, gun-waving farmers, and super-glued locks. Both cases of intimidation, while one more extreme than the other, are depressingly familiar. Two legal systems, two sets of insolvency law, and the disputed recognition of the status of the administrators and courts conspiring to keep the creditors waiting. Chris Barlow, the Coopers' administrator to Polly Peck in London, says that a range of cross-border issues in insolvency present an 'ever increasing problem' as the network linking multinational company assets becomes more complex. In recent years several major corporate collapses have involved complicated administrations across several jurisdictions: the Maxwell empire, Lancer Boss, Leyland Daf, and BCCI, the global ramifications of which cover 69 jurisdictions and are currently holding up the second attempt to reach an acceptable offer to creditors. One creditor has applied to the London-based administrators from British Antartica. One of the organisations trying to solve some of the problems is Insol International, the London-based organisation which represents accountants, lawyers, bankers, and government officials involved in cross-border insolvency and rescue. It has 6,000 members in 56 countries, 1,000 of whom have joined in the last year. Founded in 1982 at a conference at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the organisation grew through the recession of the late 1980s. Insol is considering applications for membership from Nigeria, and the recently-formed Russian insolvency practitioners association. The expansion of international investment, particularly into the former Eastern Bloc, has highlighted the need for a framework for insolvency. Investors are looking for sound insolvency procedures before they move across borders. 'You will not get inward investment unless you can get an equitable system for dealing with insolvency. Although laws on cross-border insolvency relate only to a limited aspect of international trade law, these laws are a crucial element in developing a legal environment that facilitates cross-border finance,' says Stephen Adamson, president of Insol. Earlier this year Insol began working with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. Prompted by the failure of efforts to establish 'utopian' international laws, it was decided at a meeting in Vienna to try and solve some of the problems by step-by-step harmonisation. 'There was a mood among delegates that rather than wait for a world-wide model to provide the ideal solution, which could take hundreds of years to achieve, we should take the initiative and progress harmonisation step by step,' says Mr Adamson, a partner with Ernst &amp; Young. After the conference Gerold Herrmann, Uncitral secretary, said: 'It is in every nation's interest to assist in the reconciliation of insolvency law.' While the delegates backed specific recommendations, such as the establishment of specialised courts in all countries to deal with international insolvency, care was taken not to seek a specific framework for new laws.' Two initiatives, backed by Uncitral, are under way. A panel of judges working in insolvency from around the world is to meet in Toronto in March next year to put together a 'highway code' for the judiciary, to promote 'comity' between jurisdictions - the principal of mutual recognition and co-operation. Meanwhile, an Insol working group is preparing a 'menu' of bolt-on pre-prepared legislative measures that could be added to national law to improve the procedures for the recognition of administrators and their access to courts. Adoption of these legal 'kits' would bring about gradual harmonisation. Both reports will be presented to Uncitral in New York in the summer of 1995. But the Insol-Uncitral initiatives face fundamental problems. The insolvency codes of, for example, the US, Britain and France, all measure success in insolvency differently: in terms of helping the debtors, the creditors and the employees. 'No one is wrong,' admits Mr Adamson, 'we just want to recognise the differences.' The success of Insol in at least prompting debate can be measured by two recent requests. Earlier this month the Russian Federal Agency on Insolvency called on Insol, along with the World Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, to help in the overhaul of inadequate insolvency laws. And Ellen Seidman, special assistant on economic policy to US president Bill Clinton, asked Insol to give evidence to the Interagency Working Group of Bankruptcy Reform. Insol executive members gave their views on the US bankruptcy code and urged the need to consider multinational problems in proposed reform. Mark Homan, senior partner at Price Waterhouse, supports progress towards harmonisation but questions if such 'soft law' is rigorous enough to cope with a major corporate collapse. Christopher Morris, senior liquidation partner at Touche Ross, also asks whether any agreements can withstand the pressures of 'locals first' when it comes to a multinational corporate collapse. While some insolvency law, notably the UK's, does seek to protect the interests of those from other jurisdictions there are wide international variations. Mr Homan says Insol should stress the need for a framework within which investors can measure risk before undertaking a transaction. As part of that framework he suggests some form of code, preferably consolidated into international treaty with the force of law, which would make it clear in which country a company would be wound up in the case of failure. The legislation could pin-point the 'principal centre of management' of the company and this could be declared in its accounts. In the case of corporate failure the administration would take place primarily in the country indicated. Mr Homan suggests that the country of choice could be changed only after notification in subsequent annual accounts. Some critics of Insol take the view that cross-border insolvency problems only affect the big corporate collapses and therefore, only the big firms. But increasing numbers of practitioners are becoming enmeshed in work which takes them into other jurisdictions. Malcolm London, of the UK's Insolvency Practitioners Association, estimates that about a third of licenced practitioners are involved in such work. Insol estimates that 30 per cent of so-called insolvency work across borders is in fact rescue work: involving restructuring and reorganisation. Despite the criticisms of Insol's initiatives with the UN, many professionals will be waiting impatiently for some form of progress on harmonisation.</p>

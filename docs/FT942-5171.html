			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: US Steel accuses NKK of poaching A legal wrangle has broken out between US Steel and NKK, the Japanese steel group, over NKK's success in poaching a group of top managers to run its 76 per cent-owned US subsidiary, National Steel, writes Richard Waters in New York. Among other things, US Steel has sought an injunction to prevent the five managers who defected to National Steel last week from divulging trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information. The five were all poached from US Steel's plant at Gary, Indiana, the largest steel mill in the US. The group is led by Mr John Goodwin who is widely respected in the industry for turning the Gary works into one of the US's most efficient plants. Mr Goodwin was last week named president and chief operating officer of National Steel. On Friday, US Steel said it had filed a complaint in Lake County Superior Court in Hammond, Indiana, seeking the injunction against the five and damages from NKK and National. It said it had asked for a temporary restraining order to prevent NKK and National from approaching any of its employees.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / US to host talks on new Bosnia state: Ceasefire prompts west to act quickly on Moslem-Croat confederation Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem leaders will meet in Washington at the weekend for US-sponsored talks aimed at forging a bi-national state in part of war-torn Bosnia, a top State Department official said last night. The Zagreb-based Croatian government will also join in the talks, which spring from US determination to play a pivotal role in the search for peace in Bosnia. The move comes as a ceasefire signed by Bosnian Croats and Bosnia Moslem army commanders is due to come into effect today. The truce mainly affects central Bosnia but could be expanded to other areas. Bosnian prime minister Haris Silajdzic had talks with US secretary of state Warren Christopher in Washington yesterday. Mr Silajdzic said the US was being 'helpful'. Under the plans being discussed, Bosnian Croats and the Moslem-led Bosnian government would incorporate territory westwards and northwards of Sarajevo into the new entity. The status of Serb-held territories in eastern Bosnia is being left to separate negotiations. One of the strengths of the plan is that it gives Croatia and the Moslems a (face-saving) reason for ending their conflict in part of the republic. At the same time, the US will be able to support the plan - and the Bosnian government - providing a pretext for Washington not to commit ground troops once a peace settlement is signed. 'If both sides agree to the confederation, the peace settlement could be more benign and require fewer peacekeepers,' one western diplomat said. But another diplomat disagreed: 'Any ceasefire and peace will require tens of thousands of peacekeepers.' The plan could entail transfers of population. 'Each side hates the other so much. I cannot envisage Moslems and Croats living side by side, for instance, in Mostar, in the near future,' a diplomat said. The idea of a confederation has re-emerged for several reasons. First, Croatia longs for peace, even though President Franjo Tudjman still harks after his Greater Croatia. The threat of sanctions against Zagreb by the US and some EU countries has played a role. Second, the Bosnian prime minister believes the confederation could give the Moslems access to the sea, and viability as a state. Third, the plan could be sold to the US as, theoretically, it is seen as preserving some of Bosnia's territorial integrity and has not been forced on the Moslems. The pitfalls are many. Above all, it depends on how the plan is perceived by President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who holds the key to peace. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman indicated in Zagreb yesterday that if a Moslem-Croat federation was formed in Bosnia it could become part of a confederation with Croatia. In a speech to the central committee of his HDZ party, Mr Tudjman said: 'The thing would be to have a sort of federation of Croats and Moslems (in Bosnia) which would be in a confederation with Croatia.' He went on: 'An alliance with the Moslems would protect the interests of the West. Moslems would be directed towards Western civilisation, eliminating the elements who would create a fundamentalist Islamic state in Bosnia.'</p>

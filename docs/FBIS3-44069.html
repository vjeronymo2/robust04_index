He said a new government  would have to pay urgent attention to this.    Dr Stals was speaking at a conference in London organised by  the United Nations anti-apartheid committee and the London  School for Economics.    He said foreign capital of R[Rand]10,000 million had left  the  country in the second half of last year, despite the lifting of  sanctions. This was almost double the net outflow of capital in  the first six months of last year.</p>

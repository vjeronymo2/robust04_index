			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue and Portals discontinue bid talks  -Close relationship expected to continue De La Rue, the banknote printer, and Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, yesterday ended merger talks saying they had been 'unable to reach agreement on the terms of an offer'. The announcement that negotiations had been 'terminated' sent Portal's share price tumbling to close 112p lower at 653p, eliminating most of the gains made since the talks were revealed two weeks ago. Shares in De La Rue closed 14p higher at 843p. De La Rue is expected to reveal strong profit growth and a further increase in its cash reserves, perhaps to around Pounds 250m, when its full year results are announced on Tuesday. In their brief joint statement yesterday the two companies said they had 'long enjoyed an exceptionally close commercial relationship, which is expected to continue'. They added that 'when suitable opportunities exist, they expect to collaborate, for mutual benefit'. On the basis of this relationship De la Rue said it has 'no present intention of making an offer for Portals without the recommendation of the Portal's board'. The statement ended uncertainty surrounding the discussions, which are understood to have begun some time ago on a friendly basis and to have been initiated by De La Rue. Portals' shares jumped two weeks ago when the group was forced by market rumours to confirm that it had received an unsolicited approach from an unidentified suitor which might lead to a bid. A few days later De La Rue, one of Portals' largest customers, confirmed that it was the unidentified potential bidder. The banknote printer is understood to have been keen to acquire Portal's technology and acknowledged expertise in developing banknote security features. Although the two companies hold regular discussions about commercial issues, including security features, news of the talks came as a surprise to analysts, who immediately expressed doubts about the industrial logic of a takeover. In particular they voiced concerns that Portals' other customers would balk at purchasing paper supplies from a company owned by a rival. In addition they argued that if De La Rue took all of Portals' paper production it would lose the flexibility to pick and choose its suppliers. Analysts also calculated that De La Rue might have to pay up to Pounds 10 a share - or about Pounds 650m - to win endorsement from Portals' board. Such a figure was clearly more than De La Rue was prepared to spend. In any event, negotiations between the two companies appear to have soured over the past few weeks after news of the discussions leaked out and allegations of 'mud-slinging' began to circulate. The announcement therefore that the two companies had abandoned negotiations is expected to be greeted with relief by the Portals management and a degree of satisfaction by the City. Indeed the negotiations may have served to throw a spotlight on Portals' niche security and specialist paper making business which was once viewed as 'slow but steady', but more recently has been growing at between 4 and 5 per cent a year in real terms. The outcome appears less satisfactory for De La Rue which has quadrupled its profits since Mr Jeremy Marshall, the ex-Hanson man, became chief executive in 1989 following a tough programme of disposals and efficiency improvements. Mr Marshall will now have to consider other options for his growing cash pile.</p>

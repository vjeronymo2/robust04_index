			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading CONTINUING uncertainty over the outlook for equities again unsettled trading in derivatives, causing the September contract on the FT-SE 100 to bounce between a discount and a good premium to cash, Christine Buckley writes. Market confusion was compounded by pre-Maastricht vote nerves as some investors sought to steer clear of the uncertainty. Others, however, happily waded into the trading quagmire to pick up bargains. That toing and froing was a feature of afternoon trading when one investment house played a strong role as a seller; another responded with active buying and the independent traders formed a purchasing chorus. The contract had opened at 2,824, a little ahead of its previous day's close. It started on an upwards course and reached its high of the session - at 2,828 - in the first half-hour. Its low of the day came in the early afternoon before Wall Street opened when the contract dipped to 2,810. The volume was down from the previous day's at 9,270, although the September contract mustered a stronger showing against the cash market at the close of 2,828, 6 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. In traded options, stocks showed more active trade than in recent sessions, with TSB, which broke off talks on one disposal but succeeded with another, at the top, having seen 2,766 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / CBI attacks government for lack of London traffic plan THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday attacked the government for failing to draw up a co-ordinated strategy for tackling London's transport. It said responsibility for transport in the capital was divided between 60 organisations, and a single body was needed to co-ordinate their efforts. Mr Ian Reeves, chairman of the CBI's London region transport task force, said: 'Congestion is seen as London's biggest problem, costing business Pounds 10bn a year.' It could not be solved by a fragmented approach. Mr Reeves was speaking at the launch of a 32-page report that sharply criticises the Treasury and Department of Transport for their handling of the capital's transport. The report suggests: A single organisation, working with government departments, should pull together the capital's transport, land use and environmental policies into a co-ordinated plan. The government should explore new ways of involving the private sector in funding transport projects. Patterns of demand should be changed - say, by smoothing out rush-hour peaks and rationalising goods deliveries. Society's dependency on cars should be reduced by making public transport alternatives more attractive. Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said the capital already had as coherent a transport strategy as any big city in the world. 'The report tells us nothing we don't already know and asks us to do nothing we are not already doing,' he said. Interim Report, CBI London Region Transport Task Force.

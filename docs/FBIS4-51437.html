			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By N. C. Renoir in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] A nationwide disobedience campaign appears to be  gathering steam among China's underground Christian churches in  the wake of new religion laws passed in January. A renewed  order to register all unauthorised places of worship has been  ignored by virtually every one of the underground "house  churches", according to the Reverend Samuel Lamb Xiangao, the  head of the Damazhan house church in Guangzhou. "On the surface  the new laws say we can control ourselves. But we hear that  every locality has its own laws so nobody wants to register,"  Lamb, 69, said at his cramped two-floor church in central  Guangzhou.    House church leaders from Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and  northern  China who visited the Damazhan church this month told Lamb they  knew of no churches which have registered. Beijing's best known  house church leader, the Reverend Yuan Xiangchen, who has spent  time in jail for refusing government controls on his church,  also pledged defiance, according to Lamb.    But with Beijing apparently determined to control the  mushrooming underground churches--which have an estimated 30 to  60 million regular members compared to only 7 million for the  official "Three Self" Protestant Christian church--Lamb believes  it may only be a matter of time before a crackdown comes. The  local Three Self church in Guangzhou began handing out copies of  the new law on the street last week, an ominous sign in Lamb's  view. "I have heard the local PSB (public security bureau) is  planning another attack on our church," he says. "But if it  comes, it won't be until after the June decision," he said,  referring to the US government decision on renewing trade  benefits for China due to be announced on June 3.    Sixty PSB officers raided the Damazhan church in February  1990, confiscating all bibles and setting up a 24hour  encirclement to prevent further services. The church was not  silent for long though. Two months after the raid it was again  serving a weekly complement of about 800 worshippers.    Damazhan, where Lamb has lived since 1930, is perhaps the  best-known house church in China. The narrow, rickety building  has seen a steady stream of foreign worshippers, diplomats and  reporters since gaining prominence after the 1990 shutdown. The  US assistant secretary of state for human rights, John Shattuck,  squeezed into a wooden pew for a half-hour chat with Lamb last  October. The church has faced a standing threat of demolition  of the Damazhan Lane buildings since 1991. But Lamb says this  is unlikely for a year or more, and he has already began  scouting future sites. He said the congregation now numbers  about 1,400.    While defiance reigns with respect to the new registration  order, it also appears that the new law governing the religious  activities of foreigners in China has won veiled but widespread  support among the underground Christian movement. "It's not so  good for foreigners to preach. If a Chinese can preach, then we  should do it ourselves," said Lamb. Lamb said the recent case  of an American, Dennis Balcombe--who was expelled from Henan  province in February along with six other members of his Hong  Kong-based church--"had an effect around the world. Foreigners  should not be so active. If everyone were as active as  Balcombe, then the police would not allow us to continue," he  said.    But as the underground movement operates mainly without  foreign involvement, Lamb says the issue of foreign preachers  does not pose a great threat. "The government always accuses us  of relying on foreigners. But we say this is not true," he  said. "One of the Three Selfs (doctrines) is self-preaching,  and that is what we do. We are a Three Selfs church, but an  unregistered one."</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Fall in pound eases non-EC trade gap IMPROVED competitiveness linked to sterling's devaluation pushed the UK's trade deficit with countries outside the European Community to its lowest level for nearly three years, government figures showed yesterday. The value in non-EC exports last month rose to a record high, while the value of imports was the lowest since January. The figures strengthen the probability that the trade deficit with the whole world for 1993 will be substantially lower than the Pounds 21bn estimated by the Treasury in March. Last year the whole-world trade deficit was Pounds 13.4bn. Monthly trade figures for the EC will not be available until later this year because of the introduction of a new statistical system. Non-EC trade accounts for about 40 per cent of all UK exports and imports. The excess of UK imports over exports in August for non-EC nations came to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 570m, after Pounds 698m in July. The value of exports last month was Pounds 4.87bn, 1.5 per cent up on July, while imports fell 1 per cent on the month to Pounds 5.44bn. In underlying volume terms, exports in the three months to the end of August rose 4 per cent on the previous three months. Over the same period, underlying import volumes were flat. These underlying measures strip out price movements and also exclude trade in oil and erratic items such as ships, aircraft and gems. The figures suggest that the pound's downward movement since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago has aided exporters. It appears imports have been kept down by a combination of weak domestic demand and increased consumption of UK-made goods. Yesterday's Central Statistical Office data follow an improved trend for the trade deficit since the end of last year. The difference between non-EC import and export values, excluding oil and erratics, has come down to Pounds 1.74bn in the three months to August from Pounds 2.54bn in the final quarter of last year and Pounds 2.31bn in the first quarter of 1993. In the latest three month period, unit values for non-EC exports rose 11 per cent on the corresponding time last year, reflecting the ability of UK companies to push through price increases even in the face of relatively weak world demand. Import values rose somewhat faster, by 14 per cent over the comparable period, mainly because of the 11 per cent depreciation in sterling since it left the ERM. However the effect of increased import prices in widening the trade deficit appears to have been more than offset by expanded export volumes resulting from UK goods being competitively priced against comparable products. The UK continued to run a trade surplus with the US and Canada in August, as it has done every month since March. The Pounds 212m surplus for trade with this part of the world in the three months to Au-gust was the highest three-monthly figure since early 1989. Recent trade trends have particularly benefited manufactured goods, for which the August trade deficit of Pounds 123m was the lowest monthly figure since July 1991. Between June and August, the trade deficit for manufactured goods was Pounds 594m, roughly half the Pounds 1.19bn recorded in the previous three months. The trade deficit for food, drink and tobacco was Pounds 205m in the latest three months, compared with Pounds 243m in the March-to-May period.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES       Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (poundsm)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               ex oil and erratics*             Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991         44,477    53,883    -9,406    38,289    45,250    -6,961 1992         46,682    56,431    -9,749    40,624    48,097    -7,473 1992 Q1      11,306    13,605    -2,299     9,853    11,535    -1,682 Q2           11,665    13,856    -2,191    10,128    11,776    -1,648 Q3           11,577    13,675    -2,098    10,069    11,667    -1,598 Q4           12,134    15,295    -3,161    10,574    13,119    -2,545 1993 Q1      13,664    16,770    -3,106    11,756    14,070    -2,314 Q2           14,160    16,525    -2,365    11,989    14,252    -2,263 Apr           4,663     5,558      -895     3,959     4,746      -787 May           4,649     5,469      -820     3,909     4,808      -899 June          4,848     5,498      -650     4,121     4,698      -577 July          4,795     5,493      -698     4,123     4,762      -639 August        4,873     5,443      -570     4,172     4,702      -530  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

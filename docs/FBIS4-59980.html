			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, New York, May 19, IRNA -- Iran  Wednesday [18 May] categorically denied allegations by an  American newspaper on the dispatch of arms and ammunitions to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Iran's deputy permanent representative at  the United Nations Gholam 'Ali Khoshrow made the remark in a  letter to Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg, chairman of the Security  Council committee established pursuant to Resolution 724  concerning Yugoslavia.    The `WASHINGTON POST' in an article on May 13, 1994 made a  baseless claim that an Iranian 747 Boeing airliner which landed  at Zagreb Airport, carried 60 tons of explosives and other  materials used in manufacturing ammuniton for Bosnian Muslims.  Sardenberg, in separate letters had asked Iran and Croatia to  comment on the allegations of `WASHINGTON POST'.    Khoshrow stressed Iran's commitment to comply with the  decisions of the Security Council concerning the situation in  former Yugoslavia including Resolution 713. "The plane referred  to in the said article was involved in the delivery of  humanitarian assistance in continuation of the policy of the  Iranian Government to provide humanitarian assistance to Bosnia  and Herzegovina," he said.    Khoshrow reminded the chairman that upon the publication of  the WASHINGTON POST's article, the Iranian Embassy in Zagreb  officially denied the allegations and stated that the plane in  question carried only humanitarian assistance.</p>

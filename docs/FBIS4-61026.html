			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius 2 May TASS--"The negotiation process with  Russia, which has slightly slowed down lately, continues and we  hope that sooner or later we will reach an agreement with  Moscow," Lithuanian Ambassador at Large Virgilius Bulovas, head  of the Lithuanian delegation to the talks with CIS states, said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Bulovas  said that "it was not Lithuania's fault that the agreement  signed by the prime ministers of the two countries in Vilnius on  18 November 1993 on most favoured nation trading status never  came into force. The agreement is of great importance for  Lithuania because Russia is our major economic partner," he  added.    Moscow sets forth more and more new conditions, including  guarantees for the economy of the Kaliningrad region, Russia's  westernmost enclave, its military and transit through Lithuania,  Bulovas said.    He stressed that "we want it (transit) to be based on the  republic's legislation and properly drawn documents, that's all.  Lithuania will not take any steps which may damage the region's  economy."    "However, if Russia continues the policy of `delays' with  regard to the enactment of the aforementioned agreement on  trade, thus pushing us, intentionally or not, towards the West,  Lithuania will undertake adequate measures," Bulovas said.</p>

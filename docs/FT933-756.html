			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Toyota engine plant for Canada TOYOTA, Japan's largest carmaker, is to build a Y2.5bn (Pounds 15.7m) engine plant in Canada next spring, to raise the local content of cars assembled there, write William Dawkins in Tokyo and Bernard Simon in Toronto. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, due to take effect next year, duties will be charged on cars assembled from imported components. The aim of the new plant was to avoid such duties, company officials said. Toyota's Canadian subsidiary currently imports 1.6 and 1.8 litre engines from Japan for use in Corolla models made at its assembly line near Cambridge, in south-west Ontario. The new engine factory will be close to the car plant. The move also forms part of Toyota's strategy of increasing production outside Japan to reduce the damage to price competitiveness inflicted by the yen's long-term rise. Foreign output, which was 5.8 per cent of the total in 1988, rose to 16.3 per cent last year and is estimated to hit 19 per cent this year. Toyota has even started to import foreign-made parts for use in its Japanese-manufactured cars. Engines and engine components were imported from the US last year, followed by crankshafts and cylinder blocks from Britain this month. The Canadian plant, due to open in late 1995, will make 80,000 engines a year, which almost matches the current production of cars.</p>

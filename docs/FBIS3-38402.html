According to the trade union, over  54,000 persons in 137 enterprises participated in the labor  action. Zwickel, the chairman of the metalworking trade union,  pointed out that the first working day after the end of the  commitment to maintain industrial peace has shown how "angry"  the employees in the metalworking and electrical industry are  about the employers' calls for wage reductions. At the same  time, he called on the regional employers to offer immediate new  negotiations. The other side must now show flexibility. So  far, only the metalworkers trade union has submitted substantive  proposals at the negotiating table, Zwickel stressed. The trade  union has presented proposals on the length and organization of  working hours and suggested various models within the framework  of area wage agreements. IG Metall has announced that it will  spread its token strikes on Tuesday [1 February].    Gottschol, president of the employers' association in the  metalworking industry, stated: "We are ready to hold  constructive talks with IG Metall at every level and at any  place." The competitiveness of German enterprises can only be  increased by lowering costs in the companies. Gottschol spoke  in favor of a collective agreement that grants the enterprises  great flexibility. He again stressed that 600,000 jobs have  disappeared in the metal working industry since the spring of  1991. Kirchner, the manager of the employers' association,  appealed to IG Metall to assume its share of responsiblity for  safeguarding jobs. A strike would be "socially irresponsible,"  Kirchner pointed out.    On Monday [31 January] officials from the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] and Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] warned the parties to the collective agreements against  industrial action. SPD Chairman Scharping called for more  flexibility on the part of the employers. He also pleaded in  favor of longer machine times that might be linked to shorter  working hours. Full wage compensation is naturally not  possible. SPD Deputy Chairman Lafontaine stated that strikes  are not compatible with the current economic landscape. FDP  Chairman Kinkel considers threatening industrial action as the  "most dangerous and unfortuante development" imaginable. The  wage settlement must be designed to create new jobs. Kinkel  praised the agreement achieved in the chemical industry as a  model, providing for wage increases of 1.5 percent and allowing  the enterprises great flexibility over working hours.    On Monday morning, workers in Mainz, Ludwigshafen, Berlin,  Neckarsulm, and a number of other towns went on strike for  several hours. According to IG Metall, the strikes were most  widespread in Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, and  West Berlin.</p>

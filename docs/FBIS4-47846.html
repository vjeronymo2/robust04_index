			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- Intimidation was the main  basis of complaints made to the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] during last week's elections, according to figures  released on Wednesday [4 May]. An IEC statement said a total of  3,586 complaints had been made to it up to Friday with the  highest number, 1,011, claiming intimidation.    The complaints included 540 involving problems with voting  procedures, 168 involving violence "against people in electoral  process" and 147 of violence against property. There were also  146 complaints about the public holiday on April 27.    Of the 3,586 complaints, investigations were continuing into  776 and 2,810 were regarded as closed.    Of the closed cases, 177 had been referred to the police, 52  referred to courts, 594 were regarded as without substance and  273 had been referred to mediation. Of these, 170 had been  successfully mediated, in 26 cases mediation had failed and  mediation was continuing in 77 instances.

The highest number of complaints was 1,721 made by  individuals. The IEC said this number, 48 per cent of the total,  was "significant as an indicator of the involvement of the  general public in the electoral process".</p>

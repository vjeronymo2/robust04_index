			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> POLICE GET HELICOPTER FUNDS  </P> <P> The Pasadena Police Department received $100,000 this week to help pay for  helicopter surveillance by the San Gabriel Valley Narcotics Enforcement Team.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich presented the check Monday to  Pasadena Police Chief Jim Robenson, recalling that the city was home to Gen.  George S. Patton, who successfully led Allied troops to victory in World War  II.  </P> <P> "Now we are involved in another deadly war," Antonovich said. "This war is  against an enemy which also threatens our democracy: the international drug  cartel, dealing with drugs that kill and drug pushers who kill.  </P> <P> "This $100,000 check will help provide our needed resources by helping to pay  for the operation of a helicopter."  </P> <P> The money is part of the supervisors' gang intervention funds and will be used  to provide air support for the team.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: COCAINE AND HEART ATTACKS  </P> <P> The mystery of how cocaine triggers heart attacks may have been partly solved  by scientists who found that the drug can induce spasms in dog and rabbit  arteries.  </P> <P> "There's now overwhelming evidence cocaine may cause spasm of vascular smooth  muscle, the principal component of the normal artery," said Dr. Jeffrey Isner,  a cardiovascular medicine professor at Boston's Tufts University.  </P> <P> Studies presented last week at the American College of Cardiology's annual  meeting in Anaheim indicated that cocaine can kill by narrowing arteries and  that it also impairs the heart's electrical system.  </P> <P> Smoked crack cocaine is more dangerous because it is absorbed into blood more  quickly, but inhaled powder cocaine "is clearly enough to achieve blood levels  that can cause these cardiac complications," Isner said.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Kloner, heart research director at Hospital of the Good Samaritan in  Los Angeles, said his study found that high dosages of cocaine given rapidly  cause narrowing of coronary arteries and depression of the function of the  heart.  </P> <P> "Recreational doses also have been shown to have effects," he said. "You don't  need to be on a binge to have a heart attack."  </P></p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Libya threatens foreign payment delays LIBYA is threatening delays in its foreign payments as a weapon to deter further economic sanctions, diplomats and Libyan officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tunis. The Central Bank of Libya, commenting on Wednesday on the routine renewal of US sanctions, said the restrictions could make it impossible for Libya to pay foreign companies and workers or contribute to international organisations. But foreign businessmen in Tripoli said the Libyan government had given no sign that payments would be held up. According to the representative of one European company: 'Contracts are being carried out normally and I don't expect that there will be any disruption immediately.' A Libyan banker, who asked not to be named, said the US decision last week to extend sanctions for six months was no different from extensions Washington has announced at six-monthly intervals since 1986. The sanctions freeze Libyan assets in US banks and ban trade with or travel to Libya by US companies or individuals. The central bank, however, portrayed the renewal as an escalation in the dispute between Tripoli and Washington over the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. The US and Britain have accused two Libyan agents of planting explosives aboard the aircraft and have demanded that Libya extradite the men to stand trial in the west. Washington is considering further measures against Libya, not excluding military action, if the men are not extradited. Diplomats said that as a precaution Libya had transferred billions of dollars from banks in Europe to banks in the Middle East. Libyan officials have said privately that contracts with European companies could be used as to deter Europe from following the US lead in applying new sanctions. The main European countries targeted are Italy, France, Belgium and Germany. South Korean and Turkish companies also have large contracts with Libya.</p>

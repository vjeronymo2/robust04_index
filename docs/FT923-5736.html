			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Tough times to keep on trucking: Europe's commercial vehicle makers are restructuring, with the weakest players being swallowed up In 1950 there were 55 independent commercial vehicle makers in west Europe. By the late 1980s the number was down to 11 and falling. In the latest move in this ruthless war of attrition, DAF, the troubled Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, admitted yesterday that it had been forced to enter discussions on 'a strategic alliance'. DAF is refusing as yet to identify publicly the hoped-for saviour. It appears, however, that it is seeking shelter under the giant shadow of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial group, although the two companies seemed confused yesterday about each other's intentions. Mercedes-Benz, the German group's automotive subsidiary, denied it intended taking an equity stake in DAF, but admitted that discussions on a less far-reaching collaboration were under way, after an approach from DAF. As DAF's finances have weakened, so speculation about a predator has grown. Until the disclosure of the present talks with Mercedes-Benz, an approach has always appeared most likely to come from Japanese truck makers, which have, until now, established a negligible presence in Europe. DAF's well-developed pan-European distribution network and its expertise in particular in heavy trucks would provide a highly attractive way into Europe for one of the leading Japanese producers, Isuzu, Hino (Toyota), Mitsubishi or Nissan Diesel. The leading European truck makers are keen to discourage such an entry into an arena where they feel competition is already sufficiently fierce, however. A pre-emptive move to keep DAF out of Japanese hands could be welcomed by rival truck makers in Turin, Paris and Gothenburg, although any equity deal with Mercedes-Benz would come under severe scrutiny by the European Commission's competition authorities in Brussels. Mercedes-Benz is the world's biggest truck maker. It has made no secret of the fact that it expects concentration in the European truck industry to proceed apace to the end of the decade. And it is determined not to relinquish its leadership. 'By the end of the 1990s we will have three supranational strategic alliances in Europe, each with one major company at its core,' says Mr Helmut Werner, who has led the Mercedes-Benz truck operations in recent years and takes over as chief executive of the combined Mercedes-Benz car and commercial vehicle operations next May. The restructuring process in Europe is well-advanced, with the weakest players either being swallowed up or falling by the wayside. They are under pressure from falling sales, but just as important they are confronting spiralling product development costs and rising expenditure to meet tougher environmental regulations. DAF, now in its third year of heavy losses, admitted yesterday that it was seeking an alliance where the new partner would provide fresh equity to bolster its battered balance sheet, as well as a collaboration where it could share products, new product development costs and plant capacities. Much larger producers than DAF have concluded that times are becoming too tough to go it alone. In the most significant realignment of forces, Volvo of Sweden and Renault of France have embarked on a far-reaching alliance which includes 45 per cent cross-shareholdings in each other's truck operations. This combination is the world's biggest maker of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) and has overtaken Mercedes-Benz in this sector. The Franco-Swedish alliance has made its play to be among the survivors at the end of the decade. The other member of the European premier league is Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, originally formed from the merger of smaller Italian, French and German truck makers. In the second half of the 1980s it took over management control of Ford's UK-based truck operations, and in its most recent move it has acquired control of Spain's loss-making Enasa, the formerly state-owned maker of Pegaso trucks. MAN of Germany, which itself has links with Mercedes-Benz with a cross-flow of components, has swallowed up Steyr's truck operations in Austria. While the big groups consolidate, the minnows continue to disappear. This summer the small, privately owned UK truck maker, AWD, has been forced to admit defeat and has called in the receiver after failing to make a go of of General Motors' former Bedford truck operations. For DAF, the present talks with Mercedes-Benz are a cruel reminder of how quickly the hunter can become the prey. In the late 1980s it moved into high gear in a drive to acquire the critical size that might have promoted it into the top league of European truck makers. In 1987 it took over the then British Leyland truck and van operations in a move that transformed it from being essentially a heavy truck and bus maker into a commercial vehicle producer. Buoyed by the record sales and profits of 1989 it then tried successively to take over both Enasa in Spain and Steyr in Austria, but each time it was thwarted as bigger rivals stepped in. It successfully chose the peak of the wildly fluctuating truck market cycle to float itself on the Amsterdam and London stock exchanges in 1989, but it was not long before the ambitious rush for growth was knocked off course by the gathering clouds of recession in the UK. Among today's surviving European truck makers, DAF is exposed by having the breadth of product range of the biggest players without their production and sales volumes. It has entered a collaboration with Renault to develop a new van range for the mid-1990s, but until it started its present negotiations with Mercedes-Benz, it had failed to find a partner to share the much more onerous product development burden on its truck side. At the same time it has lacked the depth of financial resources to allow it to emerge unscathed from the horrors that have beset its sales operations in the UK, which became its single biggest market after the merger with Leyland. In 1989 the UK was still Europe's biggest truck market, but by the first half of 1992 the heavy toll taken by recession had pushed it into fourth place behind Germany, France and Italy. DAF has tried to reduce its dependence on the UK by pushing hard to build up its dealer network and sales, particularly in Germany and in France. Its endeavours are beginning to bear some fruit in those markets, but in 1991 the UK still accounted for 29.4 per cent of group turnover. It was little consolation that DAF actually became the truck market leader in the UK last year, narrowly overhauling its bitter local rival Iveco Ford, when at the same time overall UK truck sales were suffering their steepest slide since the second world war with demand at its lowest level since the early 1950s. UK truck sales have fallen by 60 per cent in the past three years. DAF's fortunes have changed with alarming speed, reflecting the dramatic volatility of the European truck market. It fell into net losses of Fl 228m in 1990 and Fl 394m in 1991 - and failed to pay dividends - after achieving a record net profit of Fl 172m in 1989. It was forced to raise new equity with a Fl 250m (Dollars 135m) issue of convertible preference shares last autumn to strengthen its balance sheet, and is currently in negotiation with both the Dutch and Belgian governments about further capital injections. It is understood to be close to agreement on taking a Fl 100m subordinated loan from the Netherlands Investment Bank, while at the same time it is hopeful that the Belgian government will guarantee a Fl 110m long-term commercial bank loan. Since the onset of the UK recession DAF has optimistically forecast that the next six months would bring some relief to its profit and loss account. But with no help from its markets it is now having to rely on its own tough remedial measures to staunch the losses. With the release yesterday of figures for DAF's financial performance in the first half of 1992, Mr Cor Baan, chairman of DAF's management board, could at least point to a considerable reduction in the scale of the group's first-half losses to Fl 97.4m (including Fl 18.5m of one-off restructuring costs) from Fl 179.1m in the corresponding period a year ago. The company's earlier forecast - conditional on various favourable market developments - of a break-even for 1992 after a loss in the first half, was modified yesterday to a break-even only in the second half of 1992. The 'delayed market recovery' in the UK and the 'continuous deterioration of the other west European markets' mean that DAF will again have to lower its production during the second half of 1992, after a modest upturn in the first six months of 1991. Mr Baan maintains that between the end of 1991 and the end of 1993 restructuring measures will have taken costs of about Fl 500m a year out of the business. With manufacturing operations in the Netherlands, Belgium and in the UK, the company will have cut its workforce to less than 12,000 by the end of 1993 from 16,782 in 1989. The statements made yesterday by DAF and Mercedes-Benz about the state of their negotiations suggest that, for the moment, the two companies have rather different aspirations. DAF has constructed fairly elaborate takeover defences to ward off any unwelcome bid, but its best protection in the short term will come from the success of its own restructuring measures. Volvo, its much bigger rival, provided little comfort yesterday with the announcement that its truck operations had also plunged into loss in the first half of 1992 in the face of a 7 per cent drop in the European heavy truck market. It blamed lower capacity utilisation at its European components and assembly plants and substantially higher product development costs. Mr Sten Langenius, president and chief executive of Volvo Truck, warned last year that 'the outlook for the truck industry is very dark, if we continue in the same old tracks as in the 1980s'. Volvo has sought its salvation in alliance with Renault, and it appears now that DAF would value some similar help from Daimler-Benz. It remains to be seen what the world's leading truck maker is ready to offer.  ------------------------------------         1991 WEST EUROPEAN            TRUCK MARKET*  ------------------------------------                 Volume   (percent)  ------------------------------------ Mercedes-Benz                 103,994    (32.8)  ------------------------------------ Renault/Volvo                  57,896    (18.3) of which Renault          31,481     (9.9) Volvo            26,415     (8.3)  ------------------------------------ Iveco-Fiat                  56,321    (17.8) (Includes Pegaso &amp; Seddon Atkinson)  ------------------------------------ MAN (includes Steyr)                  31,132    (12.0)  ------------------------------------ DAF (includes Leyland DAF)                  22,815     (7.2)  ------------------------------------ Scania           18,963     (6.0)  ------------------------------------ Others           19,055     (6.0)  ------------------------------------ Total           316,891   (100.0)  ------------------------------------ *Includes East Germany Source: DAF  ------------------------------------</p>

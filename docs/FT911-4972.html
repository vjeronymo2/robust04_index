			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / FT Law Report: 'Defectively designed' implies negligence HITCHINS (HATFIELD) LTD v THE PRUDENTIAL ASSURANCE CO LTD Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Lord Justice Mann): March 27 1991 INSURERS WHO cover building contractors for loss arising out of 'defect in design' subject to a proviso excluding the redesigning costs of 'defectively designed' property cannot raise a defence of defective design to a claim for redesigning costs without proving negligence or the contractors' personal failure, in that 'defectively designed' is not merely descriptive of the inanimate property, but indicates personal activity on the designer's part. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiff insured, Hitchins (Hatfield) Ltd, from Mr Justice Evan's decision on a preliminary issue on its claim against the defendant insurer, the Prudential Assurance Co Ltd. LORD JUSTICE PARKER said that Hitchins were building contractors. During September 1984 they were working on the development of a residential housing site at Filsham Valley, St Leonards on Sea. The development was on a nine-degree slope. To build the houses Hitchins terraced the site to provide four level benches. That involved increasing the slope between the terraces to about 22 degrees. After some of the houses had been built there was a series of landslips due to the presence of discrete shear surfaces within the clay. The houses were not damaged but the slopes between the terraces had to be reinstated. Hitchins were insured by the Prudential under a Contractors' Combined Policy covering February 1 1984 to June 30 1985. By section 1 of the policy they were covered for all risks to the works and the property. By clause 3 of an endorsement to section 1, the insurance covered loss arising out of 'any fault, defect, error or omission in design' subject to provisos: '(i) the property insured . . . shall not be deemed damaged solely by virtue of any such fault, defect, error or omission . . . (iv) no amount shall be admitted in respect of any increased costs due to re-designing the property insured or any part thereof which is defectively designed'. Hitchins claimed Pounds 860,306 under the policy for the cost of reinstating the works, including the costs of shoring up and propping by piling. By writ dated March 2 1988 it was alleged that although the Prudential had paid Pounds 304,877 under the policy it had wrongfully refused to pay the remainder. In paragraph 5 of its points of defence the Prudential alleged that the land slip occurred due to design defects in the works. It said that the slope as constructed was unstable, and that proper design required the installation of piling and drainage to stabilise the slope. In paragraph 7 the Prudential alleged that installation of piling and drainage was necessary to rectify the original defective design and it was not liable for such costs and expenses. A preliminary issue was tried as to whether on the true construction of the policy (a) the facts alleged in paragraphs 5 and 7 were capable of constituting a good defence in law to Hitchins's claim; and (b) if so, whether the Prudential must further prove that the design of the works was negligent or arrived at with some element of personal failure or non-compliance by Hitchins. Mr Justice Evans answered (a) yes and (b) no. Hitchins now appealed. The question was whether it was necessary, in order to be able to justify refusal to admit any increased costs due to redesigning, to prove that the original defect in design was negligent or arrived at with some element of personal failure or non-compliance by Hitchins. Clause 3 of section 1 specifically included loss arising out of any fault, defect, error or omission in design subject to the provisos. It was common ground that, subject to the provisos, that wording was apt to cover loss due to faults, defect, errors or omissions, whether or not they were negligent or involved an element of personal blame for non-compliance. Proviso (i) contained a form of definition by limiting the meaning of damage so as not to include loss due solely to the existence of 'any such fault, defect' etc. There was a clear reference back to the general words, 'loss . . . arising out of any fault, defect . . . in design', and there was thus no question of distinguishing between negligent and non-negligent errors or omissions. Proviso (iv) was markedly different in content from proviso (i). Unlike proviso (i) it did not on its face refer back to the general words, it was clearly an exception rather than a definition; it dealt with increased costs due to redesigning; it did not refer to fault, error or omission; it did not use 'defect in design', but 'defectively designed'. Hitchins contended that the change in wording was significant, that 'defect in design' covered any defect which in fact existed in the design whether or not the defect was due to negligence, but that use of the adverb 'defectively' to qualify the verb 'designed' connoted a measure of blame on the part of the designer. Hitchins relied on Mr Justice Windeyer's judgment in the High Court of Australia in Queensland Government Railways and Electric Power Transmission v Manufacturers Mutual Insurance (1969) 1 Lloyd's Rep 215. In that case the plaintiffs claimed under a construction all risks policy which provided that the insurance should not include loss or damage arising from 'faulty design'. The difference between 'faulty design' and 'faulty designing' was considered at length in Windeyer J's judgment. He said the court was concerned with 'faulty' not as importing blame, but as descriptive of an inanimate thing. He said in that sense 'fault' and 'faulty' did not connote a falling short in conduct, but designated an objective quality of a thing - 'It is faulty because it has defects, flaws or deficiencies.' He said faulty workmanship was a reference to the manner in which something was done, to fault on the part of a workman, but a faulty design on the other hand, was a reference to a thing. Proviso (iv) was directed to costs due to redesigning what had been defectively designed. 'Redesigning' appeared to point to personal activity or conduct, and there was no reason to hold that the following words, 'defectively designed', should be construed differently. Both 'designing' and 'designed' were part of a verb referring to the designer's activity rather than the inanimate product of his work. In his judgment Mr Justice Evans said that the question was whether the draftsman had used the words 'which is defectively designed' as a form of reference back to the words of cover which appeared to be 'defect in design'. Or had he intended not merely to refer back to the cover but to introduce the further qualification that the proviso was only to apply when there had been negligence in the design with the resulting defect in design. The judge had no doubt that 'defectively designed' was intended as a reference back and that the intention was that the insurers should not be liable for increased costs due to 'defect in design', which was covered by the words 'which is defectively designed'. He held he was not compelled by the Australian judgments to draw the distinction to which they pointed. There was no basis for concluding that the words were intended as a reference back to the opening words. The differences between the wording of proviso (iv) on the one hand and proviso (i) and the general words on the other, were too great to justify any such conclusion. No tenable explanation of such differences was advanced. Nor was it demonstrated that unless so construed the commercial purpose of the insurance would be defeated. There was no reason in the light of the changed wording of proviso (iv), which referred to the activity of design, to conclude that the intention was to exclude any increased costs due to redesigning even when the original fault in design was not negligent. There was at least some reason to conclude that the insurers' intention was to exclude such costs where the original fault in design was negligent. On the basis of the wording used, the judge erred. The appeal should be allowed. Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Lord Justice Mann agreed. For Hitchins: Giles Wingate-Saul QC and Digby Jess (Peter Rickson &amp; Partners). For the insurers: Richard Aikens QC and Jonathan Hirst QC (Clyde &amp; Co).</p>

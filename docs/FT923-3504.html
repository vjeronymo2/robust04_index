			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reece tumbles Pounds 183,000 into red Reece, the cycle manufacturer which also has interests in glass and brick making machinery, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 183,000 in the half year to June 30. That compared with profits of Pounds 540,000 last time and came from turnover down from Pounds 6.93m to Pounds 6.56m. The company said that were it not for the acquisition of the distribution depots from Harding Group in the second half of last year, turnover would have fallen further still. Cost-cutting measures resulted in a reduction in staffing levels from 259 to 218. Working capital was also being reduced with particular emphasis on stock reduction. Losses per share came out at 0.14p (0.33p earnings). The interim dividend is passed - 0.1p was paid last time.</p>

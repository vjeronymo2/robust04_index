He told Interfax on Tuesday that he was against the use of  military aircraft in civil wars.    "Bombs cannot be used without the civilian population's  preparations for warfare. The use of air bombs in ethnic  conflicts and in the war in Yugoslavia will be inhuman," he  said.    He pointed out that Bosnia was not ready for bomb attacks.  Neither civilians nor children are being evacuated, he said.</p>

The aggressor has been pounding (?Pjeskovita Kosa) and  (?Bejici) with artillery and launching infantry attacks and has  refused to halt his efforts to take control of the Doboj-Teslic  road; however, all has been in vain. [passage omitted]    The chetniks continue to mobilize Muslims and Croats, even  those under age, in Doboj and Teslic and to send them to the  front lines.</p>

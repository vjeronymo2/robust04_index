			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel by </F> Maksim Bekhar in Prague; date not given: "They Told Me in 1968:  `You Must Become President'"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bekhar] You will be  visiting Sofia for only a few hours. This could be interpreted  as underestimating Bulgaria, a country with which the Czech  Republic has very close relations.    [Havel] President Zhelev has already visited here, and I  visited Sofia in the days of Czechoslovakia. We were not able  to accomplish everything we had hoped to, despite the fact that  President Zhelev and I have known each other since our days as  dissidents. My brief visit is not meant to underestimate  Bulgaria--precisely the opposite. Because I will be visiting  Romania, a country where I have never been, I said to myself  that I cannot be so close to Sofia and not stop over for a while  to meet with President Zhelev again. In addition, there is a  relatively substantial Czech community in Bulgaria, and a very  strong Czech-Slovak club has been active there for many years.  I am really very sorry because I always say that I am going to  find time for my compatriots in your country, and I never could  until now.    [Bekhar] Is this the only thing bringing you to Bulgaria?    [Havel] We are two countries that, willingly or unwillingly,  have many common concerns. We did away with communism at about  the same time, and now we are struggling with its consequences.  You and we alike want to construct a real democracy and join  the European structures. Both you and we have no guarantees  that one day we will not make any mistakes. Therefore, the more  frequently we exchange experiences and talk to each other, the  greater our chances will be to eliminate the shadow of communism  as soon as possible.    [Bekhar] Experience also used to be exchanged in the  past....    [Havel] Oh my God, you know I mean something else. In the  past, we had a strange, imposed friendship, in which everything  was clear and precise. Afterwards, when CEMA and the Warsaw  Pact collapsed like a house of cards and it became clear that  this entire market was an artificial creation, it appeared that  we would have to construct something new.    [Bekhar] And what is that?    [Havel] I can tell you in one word: democracy.    [Bekhar] This is clear, but you know that the love for  democracy passes through the stomach. Therefore, don't you  think we could help each other a lot more if there were a free  and custom-free market between Bulgaria and the Czech Republic?  There are traditions in this sphere....    [Havel] The Czech Republic, in principle, adheres to the  maximal liberalizing of trade. I plan to discuss this subject  in Romania, and, obviously, we will talk about this in Bulgaria,  but everything requires time. A group of experts is studying  whether it is possible to intensify trade between our countries.  By the way, the same applies to Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.    [Bekhar] All this could be a lot simpler if Bulgaria were a  member of the Visegrad Four. Will you support Bulgaria's  admission into this group?    [Havel] It is not that simple. [passage omitted]    [Bekhar] Then you think that no state has the chance of  joining this alliance, regardless of its goals and structure?    [Havel] I think that expanding the group now is pointless.  Personally, I support small regional communities. This is the  case of the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, and now the  Visegrad Four. However, this does not mean that we consider  ourselves superior to the Balkan states. It is just that you  are in the south and we are in Central Europe. This hardly  gives us any advantage, but it nevertheless remains a historical  and geographical fact. The small communities can always react  rapidly and practically. In addition, they have common  interests and could protect them more successfully.    [Bekhar] Do you think we should create a Balkan federation?    [Havel] God forbid! I do not want to give any advice. At  least I have not been authorized to do so. Actually, why should  you not create such an entity? A new organization would emerge,  and, as was the case was with the Visegrad Four, everyone will  want to join. This is, to a certain degree, characteristic of  our time. We are all nervous and are watching each other to see  that no one gains an advantage over the rest by integrating with  someone else. Everyone wants to join every possible  organization, which is impossible. You have so many common  interests with Greece and Romania. It makes no difference  whether it is a postcommunist state or not. Greece is a member  of both NATO and the European Union. It could be very useful as  a member of a Balkan community or alliance; it makes no  difference what it is going to be called. If one day the  nightmare in Yugoslavia is over, perhaps some of its former  republics will also join. Albania also is doing whatever it can  in order to become a democratic state. You and Turkey belong to  the Black Sea Cooperation Zone. The Czech Republic is not a  member of this organization. It has no business there....  [passage omitted]    [Bekhar] The former communists in Eastern Europe began to  return in a rather triumphant manner. This time they are armed  with rightist economic programs. Are you not afraid that the  same could happen in the Czech Republic?    [Havel] For several reasons, I think it would be impossible.  First, Prague used to have the most conservative communists  among the Warsaw Pact countries. That regime was so rotten and  compromised that I do not envy its heirs. This is why they  quarrel so much among themselves. In addition, there is no  serious leftist force in the Czech Republic that proposes  anything serious. The leftist forces that exist in Slovakia,  Poland, and Hungary simply do not exist in the Czech Republic.  There is a rather hard-core communist party, whose members are  those who do not want to part with the illusions of their life.  In addition, there are two smaller communist parties, with  which it is possible to conduct a discussion of sorts, but they  do not represent any electoral force or threat to anyone.  Finally, there is another factor: The most capable and smart  communists in the Czech Republic long ago became capitalists and  vote for the most rightist parties simply because, for them,  capitalism is better than communism.</p>

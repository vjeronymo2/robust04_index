			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Furrowed brows greet E German land reform - A traumatic transition from socialist command structure to market economy UNTIL 1990, Rudolf Voss worked on the giant 3,000-hectare collective farm that cut through five small villages near Teterow in the eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Today, he is on a government-financed job creation scheme, helping to renovate a dairy in Gross Wustenwalde, a hamlet set deep in what was, before the second world war, one of Germany's most fertile lands. 'I'll never be able to work the land around here again,' says 50-year-old Mr Voss, who spent a quarter of a century on the collective farm. 'There's no work here now that the big farms have been broken up.' Local unemployment is widespread. Of the 720 people in the five villages who used to work on the collective farm, a fifth are officially unemployed. Others, like Mr Voss, are on temporary job creation schemes. Further along the cobble-stoned road, no wider than a country lane, Wilhelm Etringer, 65, helps his son harvest sugar beet by hand. 'Our 16 hectares used to be part of the collective farm until 1990. We were allowed to take it out and farm it ourselves,' he explains. 'Its all very well farming outside the old system, but we have no money for machinery. I don't know for how much longer we can make a living on this patch of land.' In a nearby village, Mrs Brigitta Schroder, 48, can hardly contain her anger at the European Community. 'We have 450 hectares,' she says. 'We have already set aside 15 per cent of the land. Now we are told we have to set aside another 15 per cent next year. And we will not receive compensation.' She is just as critical of the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising 1.1m hectares of former state farm land through a system of leasing. Many farmers have the right to lease land for 12 years from the agency, followed by an option to buy. But Mrs Schroder complains: 'We got a contract for only four years. It expires next year. This is not fair. Rich west Germans, who had land before 1949, can come back and get leases for 12 years, and then they snap up the land. Its very dispiriting. The bureaucrats in Brussels haven't a clue about what is happening here.' These voices of discontent show how difficult the transition from a socialist command structure to a market economy is for eastern German agriculture, as for every other sector in the region. They illustrate the complexities of introducing radical land reform simultaneously with adjustment to EC regulations on production levels. In late 1990, the German government passed reforms aimed at dissolving the state farms. Anyone who had 100 hectares expropriated between 1945 and 1949, when eastern Germany was under Soviet control, was allowed to reclaim the property. And any farmer whose small plot had been forcibly integrated into the collective farms was allowed take it out or even merge with other plot owners to make farming economically viable. Mr Otto Bammell, a senior official at the federal ministry of agriculture, admits the re-privatisation of land has thrown up many unforeseen problems. 'Many people have got their 100 hectares back. But then they soon discover they have a giant silo stuck in the middle of their land, or huge barns which once belonged to the collective farm, or a corner of land which is recorded in the land registry,' he says. 'There are now disputes about who owns these buildings and who should remove them. It's a mess.' Apart from property disputes, the government is faced with very high unemployment in states such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg, where entire communities depended for their livelihood on the state, or collective farms. 'Under the old system, there were 850,000 people working on the land, or about 14 people per 100 hectares. That's at least three times the level in western Germany,' says Mr Bammell. Since 1990, about 200,000 people have lost their jobs as a result of land reform, he estimates. 'The reforms have been successful to the extent that farming is now more efficient. But in some villages about 60 per cent of the population has no work. There is no industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern into which people can move. Politically, and socially, it is extremely dangerous.' To compound these social problems, the government is locked in a dispute with the European Community over the amount of land farmers must set aside in order to cut cereal production. 'When we started the reform of agriculture, we also had to reconcile levels of production with EC regulations, which meant putting aside 15 per cent of arable land,' explains Mr Bammell. 'This meant limiting crop production here in eastern Germany to 3.6m hectares. This is the base area which would make us eligible for EC price support.' In the process, German officials have discovered that Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's farmers have planted 17 per cent above permitted levels, and those in the states of Saxony and Thuringia have overshot by 10 per cent. In total, eastern Germany has exceeded the base area by 350,000 hectares. The result is that Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will be asked to set aside a total of one-third of its land, without compensation, as the penalty for over-production. Mr Bammell says the farmers themselves are not to blame for over-stepping the base area. 'The original statistics which were used to calculate the limit we could farm were wrong. Under the former system, acreage was kept low so that production would be high in order to given the impression that higher yields could be obtained from lower acreage. It was ideological - to show how efficient they were,' he says. 'There was a margin of error of between 4 and 5 per cent in the statistics.' The German government now believes its original calculations of 3.6m ha failed to include 180,000 ha of land devoted to maize. In short, German officials say they may be prepared to accept penalties for only half of the 350,000 ha overshoot. 'Germany would accept the penalty that next year, and in 1995, we will have to set aside 17 per cent of the acreage in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern - in addition to the current 15 per cent,' says Mr Bammell. 'But we cannot ask our farmers to put aside one-third of their land without payment. It would be catastrophic. We have enough problems without adding to the upheaval in east German agriculture.' The dispute between Bonn and Brussels is confusing and often upsetting for the small farmers in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. 'I am fed up with the bureaucrats in Brussels,' said Mrs Schroder. 'We just want to get on with our farming. We want things to get better. But everywhere we turn, there is a problem.'</p>

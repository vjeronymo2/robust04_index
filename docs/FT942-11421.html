			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (1): Spring tide for US capital abroad - The search for higher returns has taken pension and mutual funds overseas, into areas unknown to them. This has become the driving force of the international corporate finance business US capital has become the lubricant that oils the wheels of corporate transactions around the world. The privatisation of a telephone company in Europe, the construction of a new power plant in China, or the completion of a multibillion-dollar takeover in the US itself, all have come to depend on the ready supply of US finance. And the country's investment bankers, acting as the handmaidens to this flow of capital, have become familiar figures in the offices of finance directors and treasury ministers alike in most corners of the world. The outflow of US investment has been a much-remarked phenomenon of the 1990s. The search for higher returns has led the country's pension and mutual funds overseas, into areas previously unknown to them. This has become the main driving force of the international corporate finance business. Companies around the world have taken the ready supply of cash and moulded it into a thousand creative uses. The most public aspect of the corporate finance business - takeovers and mergers - has so far failed to rise back to levels seen in the late 1980s. Then, cheap finance and buoyant economies in most of the developed world fuelled corporate ambitions on a grand scale. Many cross-border acquisitions in the late 1980s were prompted by the approach of the European Union's deregulated internal market. European companies huddled together to get the economies of scale they thought they would need to survive in the new Europe: US companies rushed to buy before the supposed lowering of barriers that would create a Fortress Europe. The process ran out of steam along with the European economy. Largely as a result, cross-border merger and acquisition activity has sagged. The value of transatlantic deals - takeovers of European companies by US companies, or vice versa - recovered a little last year, to Dollars 26bn, but was still well below the peak of Dollars 47bn hit in 1989, according to figures from Securities Data. The value of cross-border acquisitions of European companies by other European companies dropped to Dollars 38bn, from a peak of Dollars 57bn in 1990. While such international transactions have declined, the US takeover market has roared back to life. The Dollars 10bn acquisition of Paramount Communications, completed earlier this year, is the most obvious sign to date that the inhibitions brought on by the perceived abuses of the 1980s - over-paying and over-borrowing by acquisitive companies - have receded. Cheap finance and a growing economy - two of the factors which fuelled the 1980s takeover boom - have a lot to do with the rebound in the US M &amp; A business. Leaping share prices provided the springboard for many acquisitions in 1992 and 1993. At the same time, falling bond yields enabled many companies to refinance their debt at lower rates, reinvigorating their internal cash flow. Along with the resurgence of the US economy after two years of fitful recovery, these factors have spurred a rebound in corporate confidence and fuelled the takeover business. There are other forces at work, though, that make it different this time around. Most of the activity has been concentrated in domestic industries which are in the throes of technological or regulatory change. Banking and healthcare are the clearest examples of the latter, communications and entertainment the former. These forces promise to reshape many US industries, prompting a restructuring of some of the country's biggest companies. The resurgence of the takeover as a weapon of corporate strategy is likely to spread once Europe's economies come out of recession. The exaggerated expectations generated by Europe's single market programme - that the European market would begin to resemble the US one in its openness and homogeneity - may not recur. Nevertheless, European acquisitions seem likely to follow the US pattern. Cheap finance created by low bond rates and high share prices are likely to combine with a perception of rising economic activity and a strengthening of corporate cash flow to spark renewed interest in takeovers. In the meantime, the European corporate finance business has been more concerned with clearing out the debris created by an earlier era of corporate expansionism than embarking on a new one. Restructuring is the buzz word of the moment: the process of stripping down struggling corporate giants to their essentials, enabling them to focus management and financial resources on rebuilding their core activities. Often, such actions are accompanied by some form of recapitalisation. Here, again, the US is some two years ahead. Having gone into recession earlier, companies on that side of the Atlantic were the first to discover that conglomerates assembled in the 1980s were often not resilient to the harsher business climate of the 1990s. At the same time, many big companies, ranging from IBM to American Express, made the painful discovery that they had failed to adapt to fundamental changes in their 'core' markets. The sale or spin-off of businesses no longer considered central to a company's future has provided a constant supply of transactions for the deal makers and opportunities for cash-rich companies looking to expand. American Express, for instance, sold off three substantial businesses last year - Shearson, a broking firm, the Boston Company, and First Data. Within weeks, it plans to spin off Lehman, its investment banking arm. Like many, American Express has decided to refocus its energies on a core business it neglected for too long. The first wave of restructuring at many US companies is over - though most company bosses now preach the mantra of constant restructuring and change. According to this view, the pace of technological change and the openness of most markets to worldwide competition mean that big companies will henceforth be in a constant state of flux, regularly adapting their organisational structures and business profiles to changing conditions. If restructuring has been one of the most notable themes of the international corporate finance business, capital-raising has been the other. Domestic sources of capital, whether in Europe or in the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia, have been unable to keep pace with the demand. The result: a growing proportion of capital-raising transactions now either takes place outside a company's home market, or is structured to include an international (usually US) element. In Europe, the main demand for capital has come from privatisations. Labouring under high social security costs and burdened by debt, many European governments have turned to privatisation as a way to raise cash while at the same time reduce demands on the public purse from under-performing corporations. If the UK served as the model in the 1980s, France and Italy have become the main proponents in the 1990s. Elsewhere in the world, US capital is in demand to back the sort of infrastructure projects - telecommunications networks, power plants - on which emerging economies depend if they are to fulfil the optimistic growth expected of them. In the 1970s, such projects were backed by bank lending, much of which fell into default in the 1980s and was subsequently restructured. In the 1990s, the capital markets have become the conduit. The rising tide of international corporate finance activity has lifted the fortunes of investment bankers - particularly those based in the US. Five of the US's biggest investment banks which disclose figures (Merrill Lynch, Salomon, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Paine Webber) generated Dollars 5bn of investment banking revenues between them last year, up from Dollars 3.9bn the year before. Much of this came from underwriting the flood of equity and debt issued in the US markets. This year, as new issue activity has receded in the face of turbulent financial markets, advisory business of all kinds will be a more important source of income. Additional reporting by Tim Burt</p>

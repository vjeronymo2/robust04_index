			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREPS;  </P> <P> BANNING GOES BACK TO BASICS, GUNNING FOR ANOTHER SHOT AT CARSON IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The way Banning High's football team has dominated recent opponents is  reminiscent of the Pilots' glory days, says a longtime coach.  </P> <P> "This is how it used to be when I first started coaching here," said defensive  coordinator Rocky Garibay, a member of the staff during Banning's run of six  consecutive L.A. City titles from 1976-81. "We have to call off the boys in the  third quarter."  </P> <P> A resurgence? Could be.  </P> <P> Banning has put teams away early since losing to Carson, 41-14, Oct. 12.  Sparked by a punishing ground game and suffocating defense, the Pilots have  outscored their past four opponents, 166-33, allowing only six points in the  last three games combined.  </P> <P> "I think if we face (Carson) again, they're going to have their hands full,"  Garibay said.  </P> <P> A rematch between the rivals is a distinct possibility. Carson (8-1) has been  seeded first and Banning (6-3) second for the 4-A playoffs, meaning the teams  could meet in the championship game. The playoffs begin Wednesday, but Carson  and Banning have first-round byes.  </P> <P> Traditionally a running team, Banning seems to be emphasizing its ground game  even more since the loss to Carson. The Pilots did not attempt a pass two weeks  ago in a 49-0 victory over Gardena, instead relying on a deep and talented  stable of runners led by senior tailback Travis Davis.  </P> <P> "We finally decided that's what we do best, so let's get good at it," Coach Joe  Dominguez said. "Our last few games really haven't justified us throwing the  ball; they got out of hand early. We're going to keep throwing the ball, but  only when we want to."  </P> <P> In Davis, the Pilot coaches believe they have a running back who compares  favorably to the Banning greats.  </P> <P> "I compare him to Freeman McNeil in high school because of his power and  speed," Garibay said. "I think he's the best runner in California right now."  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 180-pound senior has rushed for more than 200 yards in three  consecutive games. Only in the season opener has Davis failed to reach 100  yards in a game.  </P> <P> But Dominguez points out that Davis isn't doing it all on his own.  </P> <P> "The offensive line has just played super," he said. "Any kid who goes over 200  yards three straight weeks has to be a great back, but the guys up front have  to be doing something."  </P> <P> Early in the season, Banning consistently ran to the right side, anchored by  guard Eric Battle (6-3, 265), tackle Art Donnell (6-2, 290) and tight end Lino  Quintana (6-2, 225). But recently, Dominguez said, the Pilots have been  "running left, too."  </P> <P> Most encouraging, Dominguez said, has been the team's steady improvement.  </P> <P> "We're a completely different team than we were a month ago," he said. "When we  watch a video from six or seven games ago, we say, 'Huh, that was us?' We  played poorly against Carson. The kids realize that. I think they're looking  forward to the playoffs more than us."  </P> <P> Three of the South Bay's top basketball players are expected to sign national  letters of intent with colleges during the early one-week signing period, which  began Wednesday.  </P> <P> Wyking Jones, a 6-7 forward for St. Bernard, will sign with Loyola Marymount;  Frank Willis, a 6-8 forward for Leuzinger, will sign with New Mexico, and Roger  Hendrix, a 6-6 forward for Rolling Hills, will sign with Utah State, according  to their coaches.  </P> <P> St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said Jones is the first Viking basketball player  in recent memory to sign directly out of high school with Loyola, which is  about a mile from St. Bernard. Corey Gaines, a St. Bernard alumnus, played at  Loyola after transferring from UCLA.  </P> <P> Jones also visited UCLA, Oregon, Oregon State and UC Santa Barbara, McClune  said.  </P> <P> Willis, who averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds a game last season, gave an oral  commitment to New Mexico during a recruiting visit last weekend. He also took  trips to Drake, San Diego State, Cal State Fullerton and Pepperdine, Leuzinger  Coach Phil Sherman said.  </P> <P> Mira Costa Coach Glenn Marx said Chris Davis, the Mustangs' highly touted 6-8  forward, will wait until after the season to sign.  </P> <P> Jones, Willis and Davis were all second-team selections on the Long Beach  Press-Telegram's Best of the West squad, which is chosen based on a national  poll of college recruiters and scouts.  </P> <P> Morningside guard Princess Murray fulfilled an oral commitment Wednesday by  signing to play for the Loyola Marymount women's basketball team. She is the  first Morningside player, male or female, to sign during the early one-week  period, Morningside girls' Coach Ron Randle said.  </P> <P> The 5-10 Murray, who averaged 12 points and nine assists a game last year,  chose the Lions over USC, Colorado, Washington and San Diego State.  </P> <P> "I like the academic program they have," Murray said of Loyola. "Plus, the  basketball team is developing. They're starting to get good players."  </P> <P> Murray is the second South Bay standout signed by Loyola in the past year. Lisa  Humphries, an All-CIF guard from Palos Verdes, is a Loyola freshman.  </P> <P> If you're wondering how many yards Serra running back Jerald Henry has rushed  for this season, forget it.  </P> <P> Coach Leo Hand said Wednesday that he has not kept individual statistics. Last  year, Hand established a policy of not revealing individual stats until after  the season.  </P> <P> This year, though, he decided to junk the common practice of keeping track of  players' performances.  </P> <P> While Hand does this with Serra's best interest in mind -- he feels it helps  maintain team unity -- it should be pointed out that without statistics it will  be more difficult to select Serra's top players to the various all-star teams  that are chosen after the season.  </P> <P> Players named to all-star teams sometimes increase their chances of being  recruited by colleges.  </P> <P> With that in mind, Hand might be doing his players a disservice.  </P> <P> Charlie Lane, a senior receiver-defensive back for Bishop Montgomery, ended his  high school career in style Friday night in the Knights' 14-3 victory over  Chaminade.  </P> <P> Lane scored on a 65-yard option pass from receiver Anthony Milanes, returned a  kickoff 70 yards, intercepted a pass, recovered a fumble and knocked down three  passes.  </P> <P> Although Bishop Montgomery struggled to a 3-7 record (1-5 in the Mission  League), Coach Steve Carroll is looking forward to next year, when the Knights  return 13 starters. Included in that group is junior Joe McEwen, a speedy  running back who emerged as the team's top offensive threat.  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Israel Pose of Torrance will head a strong field of South Bay runners Saturday  in the Southern Section cross-country finals at Mt. San Antonio College in  Walnut. Races start at noon. Pose recorded the best time (16 minutes, 10  seconds) last week in the Division II-AA prelims. Other area runners expected  to do well include Shawn Page of Redondo (II-A, 16:06), Joe Reinisch of Bishop  Montgomery (II-A, 16:19) and Kala Parker of Chadwick (girls' IV-A, 22:20). The  Palos Verdes girls, meanwhile, will be going after their sixth consecutive  Southern Section title in the I-A finals. However, the Sea Kings are going up  against Agoura, the top-ranked team in the state. Agoura has beaten Palos  Verdes twice this season in invitationals. The Palos Verdes boys are in a  similar situation in the III-AA finals, where they are rated second behind  Laguna Hills. . . . The top-seeded Palos Verdes girls' tennis team, led by  freshman Nicole London, will travel to face Capistrano Valley at 2 p.m. today  in the Southern Section 4-A semifinals.  </P> <P> South Bay's  </P> <P> Football Top 10  </P> <P> Selected by Times Sportswriters  </P> <P> Rank, School, League: Record  </P> <P> 1 Serra (Camino Real): 8-0  </P> <P> 2 Carson (Pacific): 8-1  </P> <P> 3 Banning (Pacific): 6-3  </P> <P> 4 Hawthorne (Bay): 8-2  </P> <P> 5 Morningside (Ocean): 8-2  </P> <P> 6 Leuzinger (Bay): 7-3  </P> <P> 7 Torrance (Pioneer): 7-3  </P> <P> 8 West Torrance (Pioneer): 8-2  </P> <P> 9 Mary Star (Santa Fe): 7-3  </P> <P> 10 Mira Costa (Ocean): 5-4-1  </P></p>

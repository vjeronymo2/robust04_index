			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Appointments: Ward to former client Clive Ward, one of a number of recent senior defections from Shandwick, has re-emerged on the board of business services company Capita Group, a one-time client of his. Ward, who is 46, readily concedes that his move two years ago to Shandwick and into the then newly created position of corporate development director was ill-timed. It soon became clear that there was not much of a job to do - the world's largest public relations company was entering a distinctly rocky period. He resigned last November. Meanwhile, Capita was known to him from his days at accountants Ernst and Young when he advised on the group's USM flotation in 1989. He had refreshed the acquaintance when Shandwick purchased a small pr company in Northern Ireland from Capita last year. As managing director of the corporate finance arm of Capita, one of his briefs will be to raise the company's profile in the private sector. Capita, which was once part of Cipfa, the public sector's professional accountancy institute, is the largest provider of management services to the public sector. But Ward is hoping that, despite the recession, there is plenty of scope for the provision of specialist advice to small and medium-sized businesses in the private sector. ***** Alan Pink, a chemical engineer, is to take over from Alan Hayes as chief executive of ICI Agrochemicals and Seeds, one of ICI's seven main divisions with annual sales of Pounds 1.4bn a year and profits of over Pounds 100m. Pink, aged 53, joined ICI in Billingham in 1962 and spent the early part of his career on the heavy chemical side of the business. After a stint in the US with ICI Americas, he was appointed general manager-planning at ICI's Millbank headquarters in July 1985. Since 1989 he has headed ICI Advanced Materials. He takes over his new post in April following the retirement of Hayes who, at 61, has been with ICI for 46 years. ***** POLYGRAM, the London-based music company, has appointed Allen Davis to run its operations in continental Europe. The company also announces that Norman Cheng will become president of PolyGram Far East. The two appointments form part of a worldwide restructuring of the company's management, initiated by Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, who also continues to act as chairman and chief executive of PolyGram USA. Until his retirement in 1990, Davis, 61, worked for CBS Records, now part of Sony of Japan. He held senior positions in the US, UK, France and the Netherlands. Cheng, 45, will be based in Hong Kong and will be responsible for PolyGram's operations in Japan and South East Asia.</p>

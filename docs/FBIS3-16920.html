For a New Putsch?', published in the 11th issue of the  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA here last Friday," says a statement by the  first vice-premier's press secretary, forwarded to ITAR-TASS  today. (The article said that Soskovets was a member of an  allegedly existing "group of state leaders" wishing to remove  Boris Yeltsin from power -- ITAR-TASS).    "In principle, he has no intention of reacting in any way to  such publications," the statement says.    "At the same time, I must express concern on behalf of the  first vice-premier in connection with attempts to split our  society asunder, to sow discord within the state-governing  structures, among prominent politicians and public leaders.  Such attempts directly contradict the tendency towards concord,  gaining strength in our society, which was created by President  Yeltsin's recent initiatives," the document stresses.    "Oleg Soskovets believes that the consolidation of civil  peace will be promoted also by the government-planned measures  to stabilise the economy and increase the social character of  the ongoing reforms," the press secretary says in his official  document. "The way to consolidate and develop Russia lies  through the cooperation of all the organs of power, all the  political parties, public movements and social groups. The  first vice-premier, just as other members of the government,  regards our president as the guarantor of peace, tranquility and  stability in the country."</p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE JUDICIAL PANEL DROPS CASE AGAINST OC JUDGE  </P> <P> The state Commission on Judicial Performance announced today it will drop  formal proceedings against Harbor Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter when his  resignation becomes effective next month, on the condition that he not seek  judicial office again or accept any appointment or assignment to the bench.  </P> <P> Carter's decision to resign in mid-February was disclosed Monday. It follows  four years of investigations of Carter and Harbor Municipal Judge Calvin P.  Schmidt, first by Newport Beach police and the district attorney's office, and  then by the state judicial commission.  </P> <P> The investigations reportedly have centered on allegations that Carter and  Schmidt misused their positions to help friends and to curry favor with  prostitutes.  </P> <P> Carter's decision to resign came three weeks after the Commission on Judicial  Performance sent the judge a list of the formal charges against him, commission  spokesman Peter Gubbins said today.  </P> <P> Gubbins would not reveal the details of those charges. Evidence would have been  presented at the hearing by two officers from the attorney general's office,  Gubbins said.  </P> <P> Although such hearings have always been held secretly in the past, a voter  initiative passed in November forced the commission to consider whether the  Carter and Schmidt hearings should be held before the public, Gubbins said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Schmidt Hearing Not Set  </P> <P> Gubbins said no decision had been made about when Schmidt's hearing will be  held, or whether it will be public. Schmidt could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Carter told former Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom on Monday that his  resignation would be effective Feb. 19.  </P> <P> Gubbins said commission members believed it was pointless to go ahead with the  hearing on Carter in light of his decision to resign.  </P> <P> "Because commission hearings are lengthy and expensive to the state of  California, the commission has determined that this disposition is in the  public interest," Gubbins said.  </P> <P> Had it found any of the allegations against Carter to be true after a formal  hearing, the commission could have done no more than recommend to the state  Supreme Court that he be censured, severely censured, suspended or removed from  office.  </P> <P> A source close to Carter told The Times that Carter sent a letter to Gov.  George Deukmejian on Friday tendering his resignation. The day before, in an  interview with a Times reporter, Carter vehemently denied reports that he would  resign before his commission hearing.  </P> <P> In fact, he vowed to fight the allegations against him at the hearings. He had  hired a noted Orange County trial lawyer and former judge, Byron K. McMillan,  to represent him.  </P></p>

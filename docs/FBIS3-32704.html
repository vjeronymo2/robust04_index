			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 10 Feb (EFE) -- Venezuelan Omar Baralt,  head of the Presidential Commission on Border Affairs currently  negotiating with Colombia, today reported that more than 80,000  Colombian guerrillas are operating along the vast Colombian  border region.    The official pointed out that the worst infiltration in  Venezuela lies in and around the northwestern town of Sierra de  Perija, where authorities have neglected some 400 km in which 37  fronts of the Colombian guerrillas operate. Baralt said that  while only 2 million Venezuelans live in this area, it is  inhabited by some 7 million Colombians. According to Baralt,  "between fighters and members of the logistical apparatus, the  guerrillas have 80,000 men in the area."    Baralt stressed that the Venezuelan Government has to  persuade the Colombian Government to open a dialogue with the  guerrillas because the Colombian Army cannot be deployed across  the border. Baralt added that Venezuela cannot get directly  involved in this problem, but that it must seek a diplomatic  solution because belligerent actions could mean the destruction  of the country's main agricultural centers.    The Venezuelan official said that migrant workers represent  another border problem, because Colombians provide most of the  manual labor in the agricultural and cattle zones. He believes  this problem must be resolved by issuing identification cards to  illegal immigrants to integrate them into the country's  production process.    Baralt pointed out that one of the positive aspects of the  two countries' bilateral relations is the 70 percent decrease in  smuggling activities because of the creation of a free trade  zone between Colombia and Venezuela. He added, however, that  Colombia's Maicao zone has become the foremost international  trade center in the Caribbean Basin, with imports amounting to  $1.5 billion in 1993. He recommended the signing of a bilateral  agreement to regulate trade in this zone.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Cheque clearance system explained - In a Nutshell A Barclays Bank pamphlet aims to explain the mysteries of the cheque clearing system for business customers. The bank says 44 per cent of small businesses do not know how long it takes their bank to clear a cheque. The answer is five days for cheques paid in at the account holder's Barclays branch and six for cheques paid in elsewhere. British banks are governed by the 1882 Bills Exchange Act which means more than 8m cheques travel British roads every day. The act calls for cheques to be returned to the banks on which they were issued. Bankers are hoping a move to truncate this antiquated process will be included in the Queen's Speech in November.</p>

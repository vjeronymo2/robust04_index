			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Management: No need to reward good performance - How to manage intrinsic motivation Some jobs and tasks are intrinsically satisfying. By their very nature they are interesting and pleasant to do. How they are enjoyable depends on the preference, predilections and propensities of individuals. Intrinsic satisfaction implies that merely doing the job is, in itself, its own reward. Therefore, for such activities no reward and no management should be required. But the naive manager might unwillingly extinguish this ideal state of affairs. Take the case of the academic writer scribbling at home on a research report. The local children had for three days played extremely noisily in a small park near his study. The noise was highly stressful because it was simultaneously loud, uncontrollable and unpredictable. What should be done? (a) Ask (politely) that they quieten down or go away; (b) call the police or the parents if you know them; (c) threaten them with force if they do not comply; (d) all of the above in that order. The wise don used none of the above. Unwordly maybe, but someone whose job depended on intrinsic motivation, he applied another principle. He went to the children on the fourth morning and said that he was so delighted with their games that he was prepared to pay them each Pounds 1 a day if they carried on. The youngsters were naturally surprised but delighted. For two days the don dispensed the cash. But on the third day he explained that because of a 'cash-flow' problem he could only give them 50p each. The next day he claimed to be 'cash-light' and only handed out 10p. True to his prediction the children complained and refused to continue. They all left in a huff promising never to return to play in the park. Totally successful in his endeavour, the don retired to his study luxuriating in the silence. This parable illustrates a problem for the manager. If a person is happy doing a task but is also 'managed' through explicit rewards (usually money), the individual will tend to focus on these rewards, which then inevitably have to be escalated to maintain satisfaction. There is considerable research on the types of job which give the most satisfaction. Contrary to popular belief, it is not merchant bankers or high-flying company executives who report most satisfaction. Many in fact yearn for early but 'comfortable' retirement. Nor is it social workers, nurses or others in the care business. It turns out that craftsmen and women report most job satisfaction. The 'crafts' vary: mathematicians are very job satisfied, as are furniture makers. Goldsmiths, stone-wall builders, and other craftspeople report the highest intrinsic satisfaction. Craftspeople have intrinsic job satisfaction partly because of the pace, timing and control they have in their work but also because of their identification with the final product. However, once a fine furniture builder becomes a successful businessman he may lose his thrill in design and curving. That is why the best craftspeople have 'agents' who deal with money matters. This is not only because craftspeople are frequently inexperienced at running a business, but also because many do not like it, despite the obvious monetary rewards. Intrinsic motivation in part explains why some people continue at poorly paid employment. They do not need motivating in the usual way - through an astute mixture of carrot and stick - because they are intrinsically motivated. But, like all of us, they still respond to praise for the product or service that they supply. For those limited few who enjoy doing what they do, working (like virtue) is its own reward.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Sport: The sheer beauty of violence - Thai Boxing WHAT BEGINS as ballet finishes as all-out war. I am sitting a few feet from the ring at the Ratchadamnoen stadium as the main bout, listed sixth on the evening's programme, begins. The two boxers, stick-lean and muscle-sculpted, enter their respective corners, red and blue. Their pants are baggy. Around their heads are mongkol  -lucky charms. They walk around the ropes, touching them and pushing their heads against the four posts in prayer. Then they kneel on the canvas and offer further supplications. In particular, respect is given to their trainer-managers, and to their ancestors; in general, to the Lord Buddha. Then they rehearse their moves. Before withdrawing to their corners they pirouette slowly and with the utmost grace. The referee reminds them of the rules. Thus the bout begins, signalled by the sudden onset of music: a live orchestra of drums, tambourines and wailing pipes sets up a pulsating clamour, though this is apt to be drowned by the migraine-inducing cheers and jeers of a crowd 6,000-strong. In the early stages of the contest there is much prancing and little else. By tradition the first round is for show only, as the two men size each other up. Of the two, Red, a Hat Yai man, is the more cocky and prances more menacingly, although both tap the canvas with their bare feet in rapid bursts. Blue is from the North-East, I-San, and is, I am told by the man seated next to me, a specialist in elbow-work. He bides his time, lets Red advance a little, even lets him offer two jabs with his fists and three with his knees. 'You wait,' says my companion, Somchai Thanavong, editor of Thailand's leading Thai boxing magazine, but better known to his readers as Khun Lek. 'Blue is preparing some beautiful moves.' Yet just as the pugilists begin to show a serious interest in each other, the bell goes. The second round of five, commencing after a three-minute interval, is full of close clenches and vicious knee-jerks to the rib cage and stomach as each struggles to contain the other's acknowledged advantages. Red won't let Blue use his elbows, and Blue is suspicious of the length of Red's southern leg. Meanwhile, the crowd becomes hysterical. It is hungry for beautiful - and violent - moves. One minute into Round 3, Blue obliges. He eludes Red's hugging arms and delivers two cracking elbow cuts to his opponent's jowl. Red reels back and Blue seizes the moment, smothering Red's face with blows. Red looks out of it. Briefly the referee holds Blue back to study his features. But Red's eyebrows are still knitted in ferocious concentration, and the fight restarts. For as long as it continues to be a fight, neither man will once take his eyes off the other. Blue resumes the onslaught, now bringing in his knees and feet, crunching Red's hips with dreadful side-swipes. With the crowd now ready for the kill, the most awesome counter-attack I have ever witnessed in any sport, Red holds his ground and unleashes one huge kick to Blue's neck, cleaving the air in a terrible arc. Blue has no time time to register surprise or shock. He simply drops to the floor - and that is the end of the evening's principal bout. There are three more fights, all of them a little scrappy but still bloody enough. One fighter is even disqualified for 'not showing enough heart', or, as Khun Lek puts it, for 'fighting like a Chinese opera.' Thai boxing, which supposedly originated as a form of weaponless self-defence, claims to be the king of manly arts. Conventional boxers can do little against its ferocious combination of fists, elbows, knees, thighs and feet. In Bangkok alone there are 300-odd boxing camps, in the country at large, several thousand. The sport is a national obsession, as well as big business. A key element of the entertainment is to observe the frantic placing of bets among the crowd. A complex code of hand signals makes for an atmosphere redolent of the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the climax of a bear market. In a few seconds many thousands of dollars can be staked by several hundred spectators, even though it is common knowledge that fights are regularly fixed. It is this conjunction of aggression, skill, money and sheer noise that makes Ratchadamnoen, built on land belonging to the royal family but run by a private consortium, the place to be of a Bangkok night. Casinos and other forms of gambling are outlawed in Thailand, but ringside betting is tolerated. Hence, in part, the sport's gigantic popularity. But there are other reasons, too. There is the blatant physical arousal of the human cock-fight, although style and even looks are valued by the spectators far above mere strength. At school, every boy is expected to learn Thai boxing, so there is a built-in universality, reinforced by the pre-fight ritual. There is also, in a country primed on nationalism, an awareness that Thai boxing is something the Thais themselves have created, and is thus to be specially savoured. At Kiat Baan Chong camp, deep in the city's north-western suburbs, I watched a score of young males, 13 to 23, working out in an open-air gym. The temperature was in the low 30s, and humid with it. They are expected to put in two three-hour sessions per day seven days a week, and it is two years before they enter a competitive ring. First they must hone their physiques, and co-ordinate their punches with their kicks. Girlfriends are discouraged: as Khun Lek told me: 'Too many girlfriends destroy the legs.' The rewards, though, are rich. Boxing is a respectable way out of poverty. At Ratchadamnoen Stadium the minimum fee is around Dollars 400. But extra, off-the-record purses are also offered. These can amount to Dollars 10,000, much more for championship contests. In Thailand this is enough to live on comfortably for a year at least, even after a 40 per cent cut has gone to the sponsoring camp. Provided he is not injured, a boxer can fight once a fortnight. They are in it for the money, of course; but there is another motive as well  -animal pride, you might call it, or vanity, or male chauvinism in its purest form, or even the pursuit of a particular kind of excellence. 'You see', says Khun Lek, 'in Thai boxing there is no distinction between amateur and professional. To the Thai mind the idea of being an amateur at anything is an anathema. Nor is there any room for anger, however fierce the boxers may appear in the fourth or fifth round. If he loses control of his emotions, a boxer is useless. And avarice is one of the emotions.' Correction Last Saturday, John Hopkins wrote about Dudley Wood, secretary of the Rugby Football Union. During editing, the word 'English' was prefixed to the RFU's name. This was incorrect.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Lukewarm reply to pension plans Small to medium-sized companies are lukewarm about the government's plans for occupational pension reform, expected to be announced in the Queen's Speech on Wednesday, a survey has found. The survey, by Bain Hogg Financial Services, found that less than half of all employers welcomed the introduction of compulsory member trustees. Roughly 60 per cent of all members of the National Association of Pension Funds members already have member trustees and say they are happy with them. About a third of respondents thought the minimum solvency proposals would increase the short-term cost of running a scheme, while 40 per cent said it would cause them to review their investment strategy. Only 11 per cent said the solvency requirements would undermine their commitment to running a scheme. Meanwhile, small to medium-sized employers overwhelmingly felt that they should not have to contribute towards an industry-wide compensation scheme to cover fraud losses. Nearly half felt compensation should be met from taxes. The survey did not ask whether respondents were prepared to see tax increases to cover the costs. It says: 'The inevitable conclusion is that many firms would prefer no compensation scheme at all.' The survey obtained responses from more than 500 companies with pension schemes that had an average membership of just below 400.</p>

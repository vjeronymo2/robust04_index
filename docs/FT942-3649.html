			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: PM avoids need to fall on sword Conservative backbenchers were divided as to how far you had to go back to find the party doing as badly in terms of national vote as it did in the European elections. The three most popular dates were 1966, 1906 and 1832. If the Tories were divided on history there was a rare unanimity on the result's implications. The prime minister had avoided an immediate challenge to his leadership. While the share of the vote for the Tories - at 28 per cent - was at the lower end of expectations, the 18 seats gained were somewhere in the middle. A senior MP on the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers said: 'It could have been a lot worse without a first-past-the-post system. If we had been reduced to single figures there may have been a deputation to the prime minister suggesting he fall on his sword.' Most backbenchers responding to questions yesterday said Mr John Major had until November to turn things around or face a serious challenge to his leadership. He was not without his critics, however. Mr William Powell, Tory MP for Corby, called on him to quit in order to flush out those against him. 'He would then be saying to all his critics: 'Stand up and fight if you're going to,' ' Mr Powell told BBC Radio 4. 'You would get out of the way this question of who is the leader of the Conservative party without months and months of debilitating speculation.' Mr David Nicholson, chairman of the Tory group of west-country MPs, said: 'The whole of the government has got to pull itself together and the prime minister must take the lead and show strength in dealing with disloyalty and incompetent ministers.' Another backbencher said he feared the Tory conference would be turned into an 'unseemly leadership contest similar to the one in 1963', which led to Harold Macmillan being replaced as prime minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home (now Lord Home). By averting an immediate challenge, some backbenchers believe Mr Major will be in a stronger position to defend his job in November, when the party rules allow for a contest. Mr Major yesterday stressed: 'I will be leading the party at the next election. 'I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish to challenge me in the autumn. That is a matter for them. I don't expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I will beat it and I shall be here . . . until the general election.' Mr Teddy Taylor, a leading Eurosceptic, said he thought the prime minister would now survive any challenge. 'It was clear from the campaign that people believe John Major has integrity and honesty, unlike his prospective challengers and the government as a whole. The Conservatives performance was bad, but still better than expected.'</p>

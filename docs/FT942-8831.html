			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hanson payment pleases Turnover in Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson jumped to 24m shares, making it the day's most actively traded FT-SE 100 constituent, after it surprised the market with an increase in the dividend. The stock gained 6 at 269p. The hefty volume included a single block of 6.9m traded at 259p, thought to have been part of a tax-related deal. News on the dividend accompanied interim figures which revealed headline profits of Pounds 683m - against Pounds 507m a year earlier - a figure which disappointed several analysts. The dividend was raised from 2.85p to 3p. Mr Geoff Allum at NatWest Securities was among those disappointed by the profits figure but conceded: 'As a yield stock the increase in the dividend overshadows the less than expected profits.'</p>

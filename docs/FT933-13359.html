			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Railways may use private security PRIVATE security firms could be employed to assist British Transport Police with counter-terrorist operations on railways after privatisation, the Earl of Caithness, transport minister, indicated last night. Similar arrangements already applied at Britain's ports and airports, he told the Lords during the line-by-line committee stage debate on the Railways Bill. He was speaking before peers backed government amendments aimed at ensuring existing British Rail procedures for combating terrorism were retained. Ministers could require railway companies to 'employ specified numbers of suitably trained staff for the purpose of preventing the occurrence of acts of violence'.</p>

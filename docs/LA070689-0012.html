			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> I appreciate Roberta Weintraub's statement that Los Angeles School District  supports "fair share" funding for all school districts (letter, June 22).  </P> <P> I have made many appeals to my colleagues on the boards of large urban  districts to join in supporting the small districts' fight for equalization of  funding. Officials of large districts seem to think that for small districts to  win, large districts have to lose. That is simply not the case. Everyone will  gain under the current proposal.  </P> <P> According to the chart published by The Times, Los Angeles Unified is receiving  $1,045 per pupil in additional funding known as categorical funding. By  contrast San Marino is receiving $111 per pupil. Under the proposal, both  districts would receive increases but the gap would begin to close. San Marino  would be raised an additional $184, bringing it to about 26% of the proposed  Los Angeles funding. That is certainly not equal and certainly not fair.  </P> <P> The primary category which is unfairly disbursed is Urban Impact Aid. These  funds are not earmarked for specificed needs. Suburban children also have great  needs which are denied because they receive no aid to fix the problems best  identified at the local level.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that San Marino has a 40% foreign-born student population, it  has been able to maintain excellence. However, in order to stay afloat, the  district has had to eliminate all librarians, elementary fine arts, field  trips, much of the public support for athletics and the facilities are  downright depressing.  </P> <P> Suburban teachers are also victims of unequal funding. No legislation should  ever be passed which sends unrestricted aid, potentially for salaries, to urban  districts at the cost of further impoverishing the suburban teacher where the  district does not have such discretionary funds. That is not equal, not fair  and not moral.  </P> <P> MARY SNAER  </P> <P> Member  </P> <P> San Marino School Board  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edward Chen] </F>   [Text] Managua, May 5 (CNA) -- Jose Evenor Taboada,  governor of the Nicaraguan Central Bank said Thursday [5 May]  that the Taiwan experience serves as a strong model for  Nicaragua to follow. Evenor made the comment after meeting with  Central Bank of China Governor Samuel Shieh.    During the meeting, Shieh briefed Evenor and other  Nicaraguan  officials on Taiwan's economic development over the past four  decades.    Shieh said Taiwan has developed from an agricultural economy  with a per capita income of US$100 to a high-tech, export  oriented economy with per capita income topping US$10,000. He  added that Taiwan performed its "economic miracle" by  concentrating on the development of labor-intensive light  industry, and switching to technology-intensive industries once  a strong industrial base had been built.    Shieh advised Evenor to take economic development slowly and  stressed the importance of education in making the transition  from an agricultural to industrial economy.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: A discreet lifting of the skirt - The Professionals / Joanna Slaughter visits Cazenove in a series on private client investment managers Discretion is of prime importance in the private client department of stockbroker Cazenove &amp; Co, so much so that the firm's partners decline to be quoted by name in the press. As a spokesman says: 'We have never advertised. But we must occasionally raise our profile.' Cazenove's most public piece of profile-raising was probably the launch of its unit trust subsidiary seven years ago, which one partner described as 'Cazenove lifting its skirts a little'. The skirt-lifting was designed to provide the firm with a shop-window. The holdings in the core trust, the Cazenove Portfolio Fund, which has a minimum investment of Pounds 5,000, replicate those of a typical private client portfolio. The private client division of Cazenove Fund Management uses unit trusts where appropriate - a spokesman reckons a portfolio needs to be worth some Pounds 1m before it justifies a direct investment in individual overseas stocks - but its fund managers will not necessarily choose the house collective funds for clients. Cazenove &amp; Co is an independent partnership, wholly-owned by its 60 partners, and Cazenove Private Client Portfolio Management acts in an agency capacity on behalf of its clients. Four partners oversee the private client department, and 15 managers look after clients' portfolios, assisted by nine deputies. All new clients are interviewed by a partner, who assesses their investment requirements, and places them with the fund manager most suited to them. Private clients come from partners' families and friends, from the families of companies that Cazenove has brought to the public, and from personal introductions from solicitors and other advisers. Cazenove accepts new clients only on a discretionary basis and they must use the firm's safe custody arrangements. There are no fixed fees. Clients pay a sliding scale of commission and a 0.1 per cent safe custody fee. Cazenove robustly defends its adherence to traditional charging practices, arguing that a fixed annual fee 'encourages you to do nothing for a client. We think commission is fairer to clients.' Portfolio valuations that are sent to private clients, show the performance on the first page; every transaction is itemised; and the client is provided with an income audit trail. The house investment style is described as 'international and equity-orientated, tending to the conservative, with a little spice here and there'. The private client fund managers aim to create strong diversified equity portfolios, and they have access to the research and resources of the whole firm. The Cazenove UK investment research department follows some 350 companies, and Cazenove's position as a corporate broker provides a ring-side seat for new and smaller companies. Cazenove is broker to 51 companies in the FT-SE 100 share index, thus providing private client managers with opportunities to meet these managements. The firm has offices in North America, Europe, Japan, South East Asia, Australia and South Africa, which feed macro-economic and corporate information to the UK fund managers. The managers looking after private clients have a daily briefing from Cazenove &amp; Co, whose research department provides a list of recommended stocks, but there is no compulsion to buy these. The conclusions of the asset allocation committee, which meets every three months, are tailored for each portfolio, in line with client requirements. Currently the recommended private client portfolio weighting is 51 per cent in UK equities, 6 per cent in Europe, 5 per cent in Japan, 5 per cent in the Far East, 3 per cent in the US and 1 per cent in emerging markets. The remaining 29 per cent is in cash and index-linked gilts. The figure for cash is historically high but Cazenove has been cautious for some time, partly due to uncertainties surrounding US interest rates and the expectation that UK interest rates have bottomed out. Cazenove is uncommon is imposing no minimum investment, and there is a huge variation in the size of the private client portfolios. Sums of less than Pounds 100,000 are likely to be directed to the unit trust subsidiary but the spokesman says: 'We think it is quite inappropriate to have a minimum investment written in stone. A young member of a family is not going to be turned away, if he has only Pounds 50,000.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- INVESTMENT MANAGERS: FACTFILE 6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cazenove  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Cazenove Fund Management) Established: 1823  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: SFA Number of offices in UK: Three (London, Salisbury, Jersey) Number of offices worldwide: 9 Funds under management: Pounds 3bn (private clients); Pounds 8bn (total) Number of UK private clients: 3,000 Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 150 Minimum investment for private clients: No rigid rules Current asset allocation for UK private clients: UK equities, 51%; overseas equities, 20%; fixed-interest (cash, index-linked)29% Average annual portfolio turnover: 30% Fees: Discretionary clients, sliding commission plus 0.1% safe custody charge  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

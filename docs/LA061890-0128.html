			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOT GIANTS CRACKING JUNE SWOON THEORY  </P> <P> How hot are the San Francisco Giants? Let us count the ways after a 9-7 victory  Sunday.  </P> <P> * The Giants have won eight in a row, their longest winning streak since they  won 10 straight from Aug. 3 to 11, 1982.  </P> <P> * They are 15-1 this month, their hottest streak since the 1965 powerhouse of  Willie Mays and Willie McCovey went 17-1 from Sept. 4 to 20. That club won 14  in a row and finished second with a 95-67 record.  </P> <P> * Convincingly destroying the myth of the June Swoon, the Giants are heading  for their best month in San Francisco. The record is an 18-5 April in 1971. The  June standard is 19-11 in 1964.  </P> <P> * They have won nine straight at home, their best streak at Candlestick Park  since the 1982 club also won nine in a row from July 28 to Aug. 11. The 1990  Giants lost their first eight at home.  </P> <P> * The Giants are averaging 12.4 hits and 7.6 runs with a .328 batting average  this month. They have collected 10 or more hits 12 times in 16 June games,  including 15 Sunday.  </P> <P> * The hitting frenzy has overshadowed a recent stretch of sturdy pitching. The  Giants have posted a 2.65 earned run average over the last 19 games.  </P> <P> * The team leads the National League with 626 hits and 328 runs. No team is  playing better against the West.  </P> <P> Things are going so well, in fact, that the giddy Giants are starting to  believe they might have a better ballclub than the one that reached the World  Series with a 92-70 record and a blitz of the Chicago Cubs in the 1989  playoffs.  </P> <P> The major difference from last year's team is the rise of third baseman Matt  Williams, who extended his career-high hitting streak to 14 games Sunday with  two doubles and a single. His two RBI gave him the NL lead with 55.  </P> <P> "I'm in a pretty good groove," Williams said. "I'm getting some bloopers to  fall in, too. It's not like I'm scorching everything."  </P> <P> Nobody expected such lusty hitting from Williams, basically a hit-or-miss  slugger in the past. He is batting .474 (27 for 57) during the 14-game binge,  with four home runs and 20 RBI.  </P> <P> "I'm having a lot of opportunities with guys on base," he said. "The most  important thing to me is driving in runs."  </P></p>

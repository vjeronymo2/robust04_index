			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Power shift in Austria The sharp drop in support for Austria's long-lived coalition of conservatives and socialists in Sunday's general election illustrates a Europe-wide trend. Five years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the effects of political and economic transition are making life difficult for incumbent parties nearly everywhere, with consequent benefit for the electoral fringes. The Social Democratic party and the conservative People's party will remain in power, but both recorded their lowest election scores since 1945. Elsewhere in Europe, government parties have suffered setbacks in elections this year in Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. At the German elections on Sunday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will probably hold on to power, yet the conservative Bonn parties appear likely to register their lowest share of a general election vote since 1949. The main winner in Sunday's Austrian poll was the far-right Freedom party, whose leader Mr Jorg Haider combines a xenophobic stance on social and immigration policies with liberal economic views. He has edged closer to power, conceivably in a coalition with the People's party at the next election in 1998 or sooner. However, it would be mistaken to see Sunday's result exclusively as a swing to the far right. In terms of their proportionate increase in seats, the left-leaning Greens and the centrist Liberal Forum did as well as the Freedom party. Final parliamentary assent for Austria to join the European Union in January is not in doubt. Many voters have deserted the government parties, but they are far from expressing blind faith in Mr Haider's doctrines. Rather, the electorate has shown its frustration at the grand coalition's octopus-like grip on Austria's political and economic life. If the coalition's buffeting results in genuine moves to loosen Austria's inbred corporatism, the shift will be greatly welcome. The coalition's reduced majority will none the less add to policy-making difficulties. Stern fiscal action will be necessary to keep the budget deficit from rising beyond 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product next year, when expenditure is due to rise because of additional payments to farmers and to the EU budget. In relations with the rest of Europe, the fraying of the coalition may make Austria a less comfortable partner. Integrating Austria with the rest of Europe was supported by two-thirds of voters in the June referendum, but it could cause pain for protected sectors of the economy. The impact of Mr Haider's rise should not be over-stated, but it indicates the reservations of some Austrian voters about moving towards the more federal Europe envisaged under the Maastricht treaty. Austria is one of the countries closest to fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union. However, on the evidence of Sunday's poll, Austrian scepticism about tightening integration further may, in future, become more overt.</p>

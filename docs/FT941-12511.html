			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rallies in London on reform deal Investors remained inactive ahead of Saturday's deadline for political reform, and share prices gave up further ground on profit-taking by corporate investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. However, the decline was reversed in London after hours after the Japanese prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa won a face-saving deal. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell 133.91 to 18,757.88, for a week's decline of nearly 3 per cent, as overseas investors and dealers, who have been the leading buyers recently, were absent. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.68 to 1,527.82. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 41.60 higher at 1,306.43. This reversed the pattern of the previous Friday, when the reform bill's upper house defeat took Japanese stocks down nearly 3 per cent in London after a 1.8 per cent gain in the domestic market - where the Nikkei followed London, with a 4.8 per cent drop last Monday. Ahead of the deal, Japanese domestic institutions said that they were reluctant to increase their weightings at current levels since the recent rise did not reflect an improvement in underlying economic fundamentals. However, Nippon Life, the largest life insurer, said that many investors were looking to increase exposure at lower levels. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 18,869.59 and fell to a low of 18,657.17 in the afternoon. Volume was 250m shares against 431m. Losers led gainers by 718 to 262 with 178 unchanged. Electronics stocks were lower on profit-taking. NEC fell Y17 to Y966 and Sony declined Y20 to Y5,830. Arbitrage selling depressed bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,100 and Mitsubishi Bank declined Y50 to Y2,860. Brokers were also lower with Nomura Securities down Y10 to Y2,070. Overseas investors bought steel stocks. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y6 to Y329 and Kawasaki Steel gained Y8 to Y340. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 145.48 to 20,609.16 in volume of 83m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y6,430. Roundup The region's markets reacted to domestic issues yesterday. HONG KONG ended weaker after a day of volatile trading on reports that banks were trying to dampen down speculation in the property sector by lifting mortgage rates. The Hang Seng index lost 92.59 to 11,377.83, after an initial gain of more than 170 points, for a week's fall of 0.7 per cent. Turnover was some HKDollars 8bn. The reports forced heavy selling among property stocks and the sub-index shed 1.8 per cent in value. KUALA LUMPUR saw institutional buying of selected blue-chips push the composite index up 15.82 or 1.5 per cent to 1,090.06. However, brokers remained cautious and forecast further profit-taking next week. The index has gained 3.4 per cent over the week. SINGAPORE benefited from the gains in Malaysia, and the Straits Times Industrials index advanced 13.79 to 2,300.07, a week's rise of 0.8 per cent.

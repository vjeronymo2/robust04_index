Spokesman General Pruoch Bunthol said around 250 government  soldiers had been dispatched as reinforcements to help in what  he called "mopping up" operations around Pailin, located on the  Thai border 350 kilometers (210 miles) from Phnom Penh.    "About 30" of the rebel faction have been killed since the  offensive was launched on Friday, he said. One of them was  executed on Saturday for having refused to reveal where mines  and traps had been laid, he said.    "There is still fighting, but not much," the general, who is  the headquarters' spokesman, said, adding that he was still  awaiting a detailed report from the front that would give  precise casualty figures.    Khmer Rouge radio, monitored in Bangkok, also went off the  air, an apparent sign that the guerrillas had decided to abandon  the jungle-clad transmission site rather than risk losing its  equipment to government attacks from the air.    But western experts were skeptical about the government's  ability to maintain position long-term in Pailin, a timber and  mining centre whose rubies have provided the Khmer Rouge with a  fat war chest.    "The battle for Pailin is far from over," one expert said,  speaking on condition he was not identified.    He drew a parallel with the combat earlier this year for  Anlung Veng, a Khmer Rouge base in the north of Cambodia, where  the guerrillas melted away into the jungle in order to avoid a  pitched battle.    Government leaders said at the time they had inflicted a  major blow on the rebels -- but were then staggered, three weeks  later, when the Khmer Rouge counter-attacked and routed the  government troops.    The expert noted that "Pailin is in a basin, and the  government's men do not control either the heights, to the  north, or access from the south."    The heights, 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) high, give a massive  strategic advantage. If they fell into the guerrillas' hands,  "that would put the Cambodian troops in an untenable position."    In addition, by digging in, the government's forces would be  increasing their logistical problems, "which are already their  weak point," the expert said.    The spokesman said that between 6,000 and 10,000 troops had  been deployed in the battle for Pailin, out of the army's total  complement of 140,000 men.    But 60 percent of the armed forces comprises officers,  leaving a "core" of fighters of only 60,000. The command  structure is generally considered to be poor.    "The Khmer Rouge have a far sharper sense of tactics, and  it's sure that they haven't said their final word," an expert  said.    Phnom Penh has named the capture of Pailin as a body blow to  the guerrillas, depriving them of their last bastion, as well as  vital revenue from ruby mining and timber.    The Khmer Rouge became notorious for their four-year tenure  in power in the 1970s, when they engaged in an orgy of killing,  slaughtering anyone deemed contrary to their ultra-left, ultra-  nationalist cause.    More than a million were left dead in the so-called "killing  fields."    The guerrillas refused to take part in UN-organised  elections  last year, and have maintained armed combat against the  government that emerged.    At least 10,000 people, mainly Khmer Rouge families, have  fled into Thailand to escape the fighting.</p>

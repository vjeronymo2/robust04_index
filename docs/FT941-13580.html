			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Yeltsin criticises Chernomyrdin for 'mistakes' over government Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday reproached Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, his prime minister, for 'mistakes' in forming his government and rejected the resignation of Mr Boris Fyodorov as finance minister. Mr Fyodorov, who had been asked at the weekend to stay on by an apparently chastened Mr Chernomyrdin, was holding out for the dismissal of Mr Victor Gerashchenko as central bank chairman before he would agree to remain in the cabinet. While Mr Yeltsin wants to keep his reputation as a reformist intact, Mr Chernomyrdin, stung by the international outcry over his plans to 'correct' reforms and let Mr Fyodorov go, has dismissed the backlash as being whipped up against him. Mr Alexander Shokhin, his new economics minister, went further, saying a press campaign aimed to topple Mr Chernomyrdin by the spring. Meanwhile, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the most vocal foreign adviser to the Russian government until his resignation last week, blamed the International Monetary Fund for not disbursing enough funds to support reformers. He said the Fund's chief, Mr Michel Camdessus, should quit. In Washington, Mr Strobe Talbott, special adviser on the former Soviet Union to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the new Russian government that foreign aid would remain closely linked to economic reform. 'Gradual reform is a prescription for hyperinflation and economic collapse,' Mr Talbott added, while warning that the US must not expect results overnight. Although the Russian president did not see Mr Fyodorov as expected yesterday, Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, said the two men might meet today. Mr Fyodorov instead met Mr Vladimir Shcherbakov, the man who is being considered by Mr Chernomyrdin as his replacement at the finance ministry. Mr Shcherbakov, who now runs a Russian investment fund, belonged to the last Soviet government which tried to depose President Mikhail Gorbachev. 'He will accept any spending decisions. He will be a decoration,' said Mr Alexashenko. Mr Yeltsin's spokesman gave no details of the 'mistakes' for which the president had berated his premier. But one possible compromise is that Mr Fyodorov might be offered a vacant post as a first deputy prime minister. But the position of number two or three in the government would still leave unsatisfied Mr Fyodorov's demand for what he calls 'the scalp' of Mr Gerashchenko, whom he has accused of 'provocations' at the central bank to undermine his attempts to stabilise Russia's finances. In response to a plea from Mr Anatoly Chubais, the other senior reformer in the Russian government, for the sacking of the central bank governor, Mr Yeltsin is said to have replied yesterday that the time was not right. 'Let him make another mistake,' Mr Yeltsin was quoted as saying.</p>

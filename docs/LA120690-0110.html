San Diego State, which defeated the Broncos, 76-65, in their last meeting in  1987, started the week at 0-2.  </P> <P> The Broncos may benefit from the return of All-California Collegiate Athletic  Assn. forward Terry Ross, who has yet to play after suffering a broken hand  before the season. Ross, who averaged 21.1 points and 11.5 rebounds last  season, was listed among the top 25 small college players in the nation by The  Sporting News.  </P> <P> In his absence, the Broncos have been led by 6-foot-1 guard D.

Lee, a senior who played at  Loyola Marymount last season, scored 15 points.  </P> <P> The Broncos will meet a San Diego State squad that is led by 6-2 senior guard  Arthur Massey, who averages 20.5 points, and 7-1 senior center Marty Dow, who  averages 7.5 rebounds.  </P> <P> After splitting two games in Northern California last week, the Cal Poly Pomona  women's basketball team returns home for a pair of difficult nonconference  games Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who are 3-2 after losing to Sonoma State and defeating San  Francisco State, play host to National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics power  Wayland Baptist of Texas at 7:30 p.m. Friday and NCAA Division I team St.  Mary's at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Pomona, ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division II in a preseason poll, has been led  by 5-10 senior forward Stephanie Coons. Coons, a former Wilson High of Hacienda  Heights standout, is averaging 15 points and 8.2 rebounds. In a 105-70 victory  over San Francisco State, she scored a season-high 26 points and had 12  rebounds.  </P> <P> Two other top players for the Broncos are 5-11 sophomore forward Tami Chick and  5-6 senior guard Debbie Wagner. Chick is averaging 13 points and Wagner, a  transfer from Northern Arizona, is averaging 10 points.  </P> <P> The Azusa Pacific men's basketball team, having finished third in the  eight-team Cougar Classic tournament last week, will take to the road for  nonconference games tonight and Saturday.  </P> <P> The Cougars, who are 4-3 after going 2-1 in the tournament, will meet La Verne  at 7:30 tonight and Christian Heritage at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. La Verne finished  in a three-way tie for first in the Southern California Intercollegiate  Athletic Conference last season and Christian Heritage reached the National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 final.  </P> <P> Azusa has been led by 6-8 junior center Patrick McMann, who was selected to the  all-tournament team at the Cougar Classic for the second consecutive season.

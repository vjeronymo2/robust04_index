			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Philippine-IMF negotiations to resume in January The Philippines' stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a new economic programme will resume in January, Mr Howard Handey, the fund's representative in Manila, said yesterday. Mr Handey added that Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, had agreed to visit the Philippines early next year to review progress in the negotiations and the country's economic performance. Mr Camdessus yesterday met Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, in Washington at the end of Mr Ramos's two-week trip to the US. Manila's negotiations with the IMF have been deadlocked over the government's inability to get its Congress to approve new tax measures aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit. The Philippines' last economic stabilisation programme with IMF support ended in March. Negotiators failed to secure the funds for a successor scheme. The negotiators had been aiming for a three-year, Dollars 800m (Pounds 543m) exit programme, which would end IMF monitoring of the Philippine economy. However, local officials have recently scaled down expectations to another short-term credit facility instead. The Philippines has been under pressure from its official donors to conclude a new programme with the IMF on which further assistance could be pegged.</p>

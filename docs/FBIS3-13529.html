			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Samir Ja'ja', leader of the </F> Lebanese Forces, in Ghidras by unidentified correspondent in  Beirut on 11 March]    [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] How is the situation today?    [Ja'ja'] Instead of quoting our sources, come to us and see  for yourself, then you can write about what you are going to see  all the way to my residence in Ghidras.    [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that there are roadblocks?    [Ja'ja'] The issue is not the number of roadblocks or the  troops, but the manner in which they are deployed along the  roads leading to Ghidras. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Have you contacted His Excellency President Ilyas  al-Hirawi?    [Ja'ja'] No, I have not contacted him so far. He was busy  yesterday with the breakfast banquet he gave in B'abda Palace.    [AL-HAYAH] And why have you not contacted him today  (yesterday) [11 March]?    [Ja'ja'] We do not want to disturb his excellency with this  issue. We are leaving him to concentrate on the main issue,  that is the Middle East negotiations.    [AL-HAYAH] And with the Army command?    [Ja'ja'] There are no contacts with the command. The  contacts are made with some authoritative officers in the area.  They reply that this presence lies within security deployments  in the provinces. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] The Army has been deployed in Ghidras for a long  time.    [Ja'ja'] The nearest point to Ghidras was less than a  kilometer away. This point was concealed and not on the main  road. We asked the Army command at the time about this point's  task. We were told that its job was to supervise the valley.    [AL-HAYAH] And what is happening now?    [Ja'ja'] The Army is deployed in five directions: a point  is set up in each direction. There is a point on the road  leading to here.    [AL-HAYAH] It is said that the measures include all areas,  and that security units have lists of suspects involved in the  bombing incidents.    [Ja'ja'] Fine. Let them come and tell us who they are, and  I am prepared to hand them over. Why overtake events when the  investigation is under way? [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] It is reported that they have lists of suspects  involved in security incidents, including an attempt on the  president's life, and that the accusation is leveled at Raji  'Abdu, nicknamed the "captain."    [Ja'ja'] Raji 'Abdu is not accused in the case concerning  his excellency the president. He was accused of bombing the  Rumyah barracks. Anyhow, his case is now in the hands of the  Lebanese judiciary. When a verdict is passed and it becomes  clear whether he has any link, they will see whether or not we  are going to hand him over.

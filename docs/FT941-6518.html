			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Federated Stores advances 39% Federated Department Stores, US owner of Bloomingdale's and several other department store chains, yesterday reported that net income before extraordinary items had risen by 39 per cent to Dollars 146m for the fourth quarter to January. This was in spite of a fall in gross margins. Federated, like other US store groups, has been forced to cut prices in the intensely competitive retailing environment. But the group has increased profits by selling more goods and cutting costs. It is trying to secure profits growth for the longer term through its attempt to gain control of the rival R H Macy department store group, in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Federated's fourth-quarter turnover rose by 3.8 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn, with same-store sales rising 2.1 per cent. Helped by a gain of Dollars 24m from the favourable settlement of disputed bankruptcy claims, the company increased operating profits by 29 per cent to Dollars 287.6m. Net income of Dollars 146m, compared with Dollars 105.1m or Dollars 99m after extraordinary items. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.16 against 83 cents, or 78 cents after extraordinary items. Full-year turnover rose by 2.1 per cent to Dollars 7.23bn while net income before extraordinary items rose by 48 per cent to Dollars 196.8m. After extraordinary items it rose to Dollars 193.2m from Dollars 113m. Mr Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive, said this year's emphasis would be on accelerating sales growth and continued cost-cutting.</p>

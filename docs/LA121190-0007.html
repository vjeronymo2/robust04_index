Water had to be brought in by truck.  </P> <P> There was no estimate of damage, but fire officials said there were many 17th-  and 18th-Century antiques inside the house. Also on the property was a 1965  Buick, which had recently been restored. The car was destroyed. GERRY BRAILO  SPENCER  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Carrington denies that he is intending to resign: Leader of EC peace conference says effort goes on LORD CARRINGTON, the British chairman of the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, yesterday denied reports that he intended to resign from his post. The reports had been fuelled both by a declaration adopted by last week's Group of Seven summit suggesting that a broader international peace conference might be desirable, and a statement last Sunday by Sir John Nott, a former British defence secretary, that Lord Carrington's mission had outlived its usefulness. 'I was asked by the European Community whether I would do this and I don't think you give up because things have gone very badly, unless those who appointed you want to,' Lord Carrington said. If the EC peace mission were to be wound up and the whole process were to start again under the United Nations or another authority, it would not make any difference, he added. 'The problem is that they (the warring parties in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia) do not want peace at the moment,' he said. Lord Carrington has invited the leaders to a meeting in London tomorrow, though they have yet to respond. The leaders of the G7 industrial nations and those of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) who met in Helsinki shortly afterwards fully supported the EC conference as the right framework for reaching a durable political solution in the former Yugoslavia. However, their statement on the subject clearly hinted at growing dissatisfaction with the EC forum. France has been particularly active in canvassing an international peace conference, to the irritation of the British government, which has remained loyal to Lord Carrington's mission. Sir John Nott added grist to the mill when he said that a single country such as the US or France, with its historical links with the region, or possibly the United Nations, would do better at brokering peace negotiations, when the time was ripe. There is little consensus about the usefulness of the Community peace conference among the governments of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic, while supporting the Community's efforts, has rejected the plan drawn up in March by Portugal - at that time holding the EC presidency - to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into cantons. The Moslem community, which makes up 44 per cent of Bosnia's 4.3m population, and which is concentrated in the urban areas, argues that this scheme is a prelude to dividing Bosnia along ethnic lines. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has welcomed the EC's efforts largely because his republic has now been recognised and the peace conference has not yet come to terms with tackling Croatia's involvement in the war in Bosnia, or its treatment of its Serb minority. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, believes the EC peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina will eventually lead to the annexation by Serbia of eastern Bosnia. Slovenia, for its part, supports the EC conference on the grounds that it could help resolve disputes over the share of the internal and unallocated debt accumulated by the former Yugoslav federation. The Macedonian minister of information, Mr Martin Trenevski, said in London yesterday that 'the longer the EC puts off recognising the republic of Macedonia, the greater the risk of instability.' The EC recently met Greece's demands that it would recognise the republic only if it did not call itself 'Macedonia.'</p>

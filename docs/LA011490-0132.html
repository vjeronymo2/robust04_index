			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BAND MEMBER TURNED IN TROMBONE FOR PULPIT  </P> <P> You can't really blame the organist at St. Mary's for chasing after Msgr. John  Sanders to get up there in the choir loft with his valve trombone.  </P> <P> If the monsignor could lift the congregation the way those cats were lifted out  of their chairs and into the aisles, stomping and screaming, at 2 a.m. in that  unforgettable climax to the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival, there would be no need  for a sermon and hardly anybody would be ducking out before the second  collection.  </P> <P> A couple of decades ago, when the Big Band era was in its final full cry, John  Sanders held down the middle chair in Duke Ellington's trombone section.  </P> <P> Birdland. The Blue Note in Chicago. Boston's Storyville and Ritz Carlton Roof.  Carnegie Hall. The Savoy Ballroom and the Apollo Theater up in Harlem. The  Paramount and Loew's State on Broadway. London's Royal Festival Hall.  </P> <P> John Sanders was up there on the bandstand in white tie and tails sending out  sensuous solos and melding joy and sighs into melodic arrangements of "Mood  Indigo," "I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good," "Take the A Train," "I'm Beginning  to See The Light," "Don't Mean a Thing If You Ain't Got That Swing," "I Let a  Song Go Out of My Heart" and other Ellington classics.  </P> <P> But coming out of Salt Lake City one night, the reading light came on over the  right front row seat in the band bus. That meant Duke had an inspiration and  was composing again.  </P> <P> Then the reading light came on over the seat just behind. John Sanders, who  served as Ellington's copyist on the road, was beginning to see the light, a  different light. He was absorbed in pamphlets about delayed vocations to the  Roman Catholic priesthood.  </P> <P> "I was past 30 and really thought it was too late, but the idea was always on  my mind," said this son of a New York Harlem postal clerk. "So I dropped in for  a chat with a priest in Salt Lake City. He urged me to look into what I was  going to do with the rest of my life."  </P> <P> Sanders also received encouragement from the Rev. Norman O'Connor, a Paulist  priest who had a radio jazz show in Boston and was master of ceremonies at that  Newport Jazz Festival when the Ellington band made the police nervous by  igniting the crowd to a dancing frenzy with a scorching rendition of  "Diminuendo in Blue."  </P> <P> It seems like only yesterday the world was John Sanders' bandstand: Hollywood,  London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. But now, he does his solo turns from the pulpit  and confessional of an inner-city parish in Norwalk, a decaying factory town  trying to make a comeback as a historic seaport.  </P> <P> Soul has a deeper meaning for this dedicated man with a horn who at the  Christmas midnight Mass retreated into the past from his usual pastoral duties  to lift his trombone toward the altar for a triumphant rendition of "Once in  Royal David's City."  </P> <P> "Do I miss the old days?" He ponders the question he sometimes asks himself on  his knees in his nightly examination of conscience. "Yes, I really do. But not  in the sense of longing to go back. I treasure those memories. Duke made dreams  come true of everything I wanted to do or be as a musician."  </P> <P> Those memories began with a sixth-grader at St. Mark's parochial school in  Harlem investing 25 cents of the dollar he got for his 11th birthday in a  balcony seat at the Apollo Theater on New York's 125th Street.  </P> <P> "I was always an Ellington fan, before, during and after," confesses the  monsignor, who still rummages through record stores and garage sales for  additions to his collection of Duke albums.  </P> <P> Sanders took the A-train to the High School of Commerce, where Lincoln Center  now stands. He played trombone in the school band, which won him assignment to  "those fine Navy bands at Great Lakes and San Diego" at the close of World War  II.  </P> <P> He studied composition and arranging under the GI Bill at New York's Juilliard  School and began "doing gigs" with Lucky Thompson's orchestra at the Savoy  ballroom and some club dates with Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, who had his own  group.  </P> <P> "One night Duke needed a substitute trombonist and Mercer recommended me. It  was like a dream come true," Sanders recalls in his tiny rectory office, his  eyes flickering like high altar candles. "I always thought he was beyond my  reach and never met him until I went backstage at the Apollo. He loaned me a  jacket, handed me some music and told me I'd be OK.  </P> <P> "They were closing that night with Pearl Bailey. I played the second show. Duke  suggested I come out on the road with them for a few nights. He didn't say  where we were going or for how long. We went to the South and out through  Texas. Four months went by. We wound up in San Diego and I didn't get home  until April."  </P> <P> Memories warmed that rectory cubicle more than the afternoon sun faintly  filtering through the lace curtains: Going to Hollywood to record Duke's sound  track for "Anatomy of a Murder," playing President Lyndon B. Johnson's White  House and Carnegie Hall with Ella Fitzgerald, crossing the Atlantic on the Ile  de France to do a command performance for the queen and that other duke, the  Duke of Edinburgh.  </P> <P> Jazz then was America's most popular export, and Ellington's recordings led all  Continental charts. "The Europeans took our music very seriously. They knew  everyone in the band," he said. "I'll never forget the Royal Festival Hall. As  each of us came on stage they applauded us, like players coming on the field at  the Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Duke and his valve trombonist came home on the Queen Mary. A few weeks later  Sanders had a confession to make. He told Ellington he was leaving the band to  find himself.  </P> <P> An incident during rehearsals at the Blue Note in Chicago eased some of the  pain. "Duke called me over to the piano and played something serene and  meditative. I told him it was beautiful. It was an accompaniment to the 'Our  Father' he was writing for a sacred concert with Mahalia Jackson.  </P> <P> "I never talked religion with Duke and wasn't conscious he belonged to any  particular denomination. But his whole way of doing things and how he dealt  with us musicians showed a respect and warmth for the individual that I think  is very spiritual.  </P> <P> "God was treated reverently on the bandstand, too. Duke was very generous with  requests, but there was one he would always bypass. If someone requested, as  they usually did, 'When the Saints Go Marchin' In,' he wouldn't touch it. He  felt that with all the other music available, why risk making fun of what his  mother taught him as a hymn."  </P> <P> Ellington hated to lose a fine trombonist and, even rarer, an expert copyist.  "He was very fatherly about my decision," Sanders said. "He kept saying: 'Do  what you got to do and make it work for you.' "  </P> <P> He was ordained on Feb. 10, 1973, by Bishop Walter Curtis of Bridgeport. Duke  couldn't get to the ordination; he was off doing one-nighters.  </P> <P> But the next day, when the new priest celebrated his first Mass at St. Pius V  Church in the Jamaica section of New York City, where his family had moved, "lo  and behold, there was Duke sitting in the front pew and, my, it was wonderful  to see him."  </P> <P> A year later, Duke was dead and Sanders was among the mourners at New York's  St. John the Divine Cathedral listening to Ella Fitzgerald sing his haunting  "Solitude."  </P></p>

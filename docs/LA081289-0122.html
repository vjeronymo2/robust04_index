			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ORANGE COUNTY LIFE;  </P> <P> FOREIGN FLAIR COMES TO KITCHENS AS EUROPEAN FEATURES FLOURISH  </P> <P> Orange County is taking notice of the beauty, quality and efficiency of  European kitchen design.  </P> <P> German-made cabinets, British cooktops and ovens, Swedish dishwashers, Swiss  faucets and sinks, and American countertops and floors blend together to create  a fresh, universal appeal, making a kitchen that can be as functional as it is  elegant.  </P> <P> Ettie Ettinger, owner of Kitchen Gallery in Laguna Beach, says European  kitchens began growing in popularity, first on the East Coast, about five years  ago. "In New York, kitchens are usually quite small -- at least compared to  here. One must make the most of every available inch of space. In Europe,  kitchens are even smaller, and energy is at a premium, so people learned to be  resourceful."  </P> <P> It was that resourcefulness that led to the creation of such space savers as  frame-less cabinets, shallow pantries and corner cabinet carrousels. Innovative  cabinets offer such features as built-in pullout bread and snack bins, deep  drawers that pull out for easy storage of pots and pans, cooking hobs that  allow access from three sides, and swing-up storage bins that lock into place  during use.  </P> <P> Cabinets are available in a variety of woods, laminated finishes and lacquers.  Hundreds of cabinet fronts and handle combinations make it possible to  completely change the style of the room. Charlotte Barnhoorn, a Laguna  Niguel-based interior designer, says that a dramatic effect can be achieved by  simply changing a kitchen knob or handle. "You can take a basic lacquered  cabinet, and by changing handles, toe-kicks, light valances and crown molding,  anything from country to contemporary can be achieved."  </P> <P> Bill and Brenda Graham of Laguna Niguel recently moved into a newly built home  in Coronado Point. Brenda asked Barnhoorn to decorate the home, emphasizing her  taste for a contemporary, eclectic look. The smooth, cream-colored, lacquered  cabinets are set into a slim frame with narrow groove and finished with  hand-dipped brass knobs. Countertops and back splash are of black granite. A  cream-colored marble floor completes the design.  </P> <P> The Grahams enjoy cooking in their new kitchen. "The cabinets are wonderful for  many reasons," Brenda says. "They are fingerprint-resistant, and shelf height  is adjustable. The granite countertop is indestructible, and like the floor,  you just use plain water to clean it." Brenda says that storage drawers for  pots and pans make for easy access and eliminate bending, stooping and reaching  for frequently used items. Cabinets are maintained as with any fine wood --  dusted regularly and polished occasionally.  </P> <P> Ettinger believes that European-style kitchens -- which can be installed in  existing homes at a cost of $20,000 to $50,000 -- are ideal for homes that are  being remodeled. "Many people are remodeling homes that were built in the  1940s, '50s, '60s. Many of the homes are in Laguna; the kitchens are very, very  small and they have less amperage. With this system, you can accommodate  existing amperage and plumbing without the cost of having to add to it."  </P> <P> Dave Busk, founder and president of Busk Development in Dana Point, has current  projects at Ritz Cove and Laguna Niguel and several remodeling jobs in Monarch  Beach and Newport Beach. He began using European kitchens a year ago, when he  saw them exhibited at a design and trade show. An architect had drawn kitchen  plans for a house he was developing. Wanting to maximize efficiency, Busk asked  that the plans be modified. "What I ended up with was something completely  different -- more sophisticated, a slicker look. Within the next five years, I  believe that most custom homes will emulate the European flair for design," he  says.  </P> <P> Kevin Bradshaw, territory manager for Schreiber, a Southgate-based company that  distributes Creda cooktops and ovens, believes that Creda -- a British company  and a division of General Electric of the United Kingdom -- and other foreign  brands, such as Gaggenau, Miele and Asea, have surpassed American large  appliances because of their efficiency and styling. "We believe our products,  Creda gas glass cooktops and ovens, are the most sophisticated on the market.  The entire unit is only two inches deep and is designed to fit wherever you  want it to go. It can be fitted over a drawer or dropped into a cutout space."  </P> <P> Bradshaw believes that a fundamental advantage of foreign cooktops and ovens  over American brands is efficiency. He says that these appliances use 30% less  energy and cause 80% less spills. Sealed spillage wells keep spills out of the  cooktop interior and stop them from seeping over the surface, Bradshaw  explains. "The advanced burner design combines the burner cap and burner ring,"  he says. "This gives a greater performance. High-speed burners and low-speed  burners are capable of the highest boil or the lowest controlled simmer."  </P> <P> Cooktops and ovens are available in white or charcoal. White models are  finished in high-quality optical glass, providing a vivid, "white-on-white"  look.  </P> <P> During the past decade, American manufacturers have begun to lose their  foothold in the large-appliance industry, according to Bradshaw. The growing  popularity of small appliances made by Braun, Krupp and Toshiba introduced  American consumers to the sleek look and efficiency of foreign appliances. The  American appliance industry recognized a need to upgrade design and efficiency.  Consumers are beginning to see such manufacturers as Kitchen-Aid and Tappan  introduce new designs that appeal to more discerning consumers.  </P> <P> Countertops bear no resemblance to the once shiny, plastic Formica of the  1950s. Now, styles and patterns that both look and feel like marble can be  found. Textured Formica resembles leather and is completely washable. Corian,  touted as a miracle product from DuPont, is available in a wide assortment of  colors and patterns and is durable and stain-resistant. Accidental knife nicks  can be easily sanded away. Corian is often mistaken for marble, alabaster or  onyx. For those who prefer everlasting beauty and durability, granite is a  natural choice.  </P> <P> Flooring has changed dramatically, too. Now available is vinyl tile that  requires little maintenance, is scuff-resistant and can be cleaned with only  soap and water while retaining its shine. The trend is toward natural stone,  but woods such as oak, spruce and pine are also favorites.  </P></p>

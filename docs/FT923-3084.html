			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further buy as Brit Polythene advances 44% ACQUISITIVE British Polythene Industries, the UK's largest polythene film products maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 44 per cent, or almost Pounds 2m, to Pounds 6.53m in the six months to June 30. The company also announced the purchase of BP Chemical's UK polythene film operations at Bromborough on the Wirral for Pounds 6.4m cash. In 1991 the business made operating profits of Pounds 780,000 on turnover of Pounds 14.1m, though it is now trading at about break-even. BPI's turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 85.2m (Pounds 79.4m), though Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, said that the rise was better than it seemed because 'virgin' polymer prices had halved between the first six months of 1991 and 1992. From Pounds 730 per tonne, they fell to Pounds 365 and currently stood at Pounds 420, though he said the outlook was downward again. Interest payable fell to Pounds 771,000 (Pounds 1.15m) - organically, Mr McLatchie said, not because of October's Pounds 15.6m rights issue. Those proceeds were spent on acquiring Courtaulds Plastic Films, now renamed Brithene Films, for Pounds 9.21m, Hobbs Packaging for Pounds 2.52m, Monopol/JAF Vickers for Pounds 725,000 and Gooch Plastics/Clingtech Packaging for Pounds 3.2m. BPI estimated that the acquisitions contributed Pounds 1.51m to group profits. Since the period-end, a further Pounds 9m has been spent including the purchase from BP. Mr McLatchie said that the company had been acquisitive in policy for 'a while now', but that it was 'only in the last 12 months that prices have been sensible'. BPI has restructured itself from two to three divisions - industrial, retail and films. Industrial, where supplies to the building and agricultural markets were depressed in the period, will account for about 44 per cent of turnover after the restructure. Retail, which mainly supplies carrier bags to grocery multiples, and films, which makes shrinkwrap, stretchwrap and film to the convertor and lamination industries, will both account for about 28 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 15.25p (11.99p) basic and 13.51p (10.91p) fully diluted. The interim dividend is lifted to 3.5p (3p), the first rise in the half-year payment since 1989.</p>

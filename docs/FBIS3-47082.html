The Finance Ministry [MOF] cannot begin to formulate the  budget unless a specific framework of economic stimulus measures  being worked out by the Economic Planning Agency is made clear,  Saito told a press conference.    The third extra budget will be formed to finance additional  public works projects and other fiscal steps expected in the  pump-priming package to help the Japanese economy out of the  long slump.    Saito avoided comment on whether or not his ministry will  allow issuance of deficit-covering government bonds to fund  proposed income tax cuts.    The MOF will respect the conclusion on the matter to be made  by a joint economic forum between the government and ruling  coalition parties, he said.    The ministry, which had been adamant about hiking the  consumption tax to offset income tax cuts and against the  issuance of deficit-covering bonds, reportedly softened its  stance on the issue recently.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Heatwave mixed blessing for shops Sizzling summer weather last month boosted sales of soft drinks, ice cream, summer clothing and garden furniture, but depressed business in indoor furniture, carpets and electrical goods, the British Retail Consortium said yesterday. The data came as the Central Statistical Office announced that retail sales volumes grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in July, compared with June, and 3.8 per cent during the year. Although these figures were slightly higher than in June, when the annual volume growth was 3.3 per cent, City analysts said they painted a picture of steady, rather than sharp growth. Almost all the growth in last month's figures came from the food sector, they said. Non-food retailers saw a small monthly fall in their sales volumes, in spite of aggressive discounting, suggesting that consumer confidence remained relatively patchy in the aftermath of April's tax increases. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with Warburgs, said: 'The overall picture is one of lower prices keeping volumes up, rather than strong spending growth threatening higher prices.' In the household goods sector, for example, sales volumes fell by 0.7 per cent in July, compared with June, in spite of heavy discounting in this sector. Measured on a three-monthly basis, sales values and volumes each rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, indicating that prices in this period had been flat. The consortium said furniture and carpet sales were depressed in July by the hot weather and a static housing market. Electrical and electronic goods also performed badly, with sales marginally down on the previous year. Although fridges and freezers sold well, demand fell for camcorders and video games. One household goods sector that benefited was the DIY market, which saw strong demand for barbecues and garden equipment, the consortium said. Sales at clothing and footwear retailers rose slightly, with volumes growing by 0.2 per cent in July, compared with June, and 1.2 per cent in the three months to July compared with the three months to April. Seasonally adjusted values, however, were flat between June and July, and grew by only 0.9 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months.</p>

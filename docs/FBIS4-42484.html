			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Becket report: "Governor Spells Out Terms for </F> Union"]    [Text] Monetary union Europe is being prevented by "the  intolerably high level of unemployment throughout the European  Union [EU] and the huge differentials between the levels of  unemployment between the different members states," says Bank of  England Governor Eddie George.    That is preventing the economic convergence of the  countries,  which is a pre-condition for a single currency, he said this  weekend at the London conference of the Association Cambiste  Internationale.    "Until much greater real economic convergence has been  achieved, flexibility of nominal exchange rates may help to  speed up the process of convergence."    But it will be a long time before sufficient and sustainable  convergence of stable economies will permit such a monetary  union, Mr George said. Fixed exchange rates are, however, not  an alternative. Wide economic stability is the only process  that will maintain steady exchange rates, he explained.    "Fiscal discipline, a reduction in the role of the public  sector, often involving privatisation, internal and external  liberalisation" are generally now agreed as sound policy.    "If we can't achieve greater internal stability as a matter  of self-interest, then I am not at all sure that a nominal  external anchor would necessarily be a more compelling general  discipline."</p>

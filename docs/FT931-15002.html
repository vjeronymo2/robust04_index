			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Hills bows out on buoyant note - Nancy Dunne on US trade representative's four years in office THE CUSTOMARY perfection of Mrs Carla Hills' office was disturbed this week by packing boxes and a chair covered with ribbons. The chair - shipped over from the White House cabinet room - was a gift from her senior staff and bears a nameplate: 'US Trade Representative, February 1, 1989'. Although she and her friend and boss, George Bush, are leaving office, and the frustrating Uruguay Round talks are still dragging on, Mrs Hills' mood was buoyant. When her stint finishes, at noon next Wednesday, she will go home to consider the 'next chapter in my life.' Of the past four years, she has no regrets. The job was the 'most exhilarating' she ever had, including her first cabinet post heading the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She hopes to hand to her successor, Mr Mickey Kantor, a completed package of Uruguay Round market access agreements. She wants to say: 'I think you ought to go forward with this. It is politically supportable here at home.' But her demeanour suggests that, once again, the European Community is playing havoc with her best-laid plans. The US, she says, needs 'a big package' of tariff reductions on products like pharmaceuticals, nonferrous metals, wood and paper to generate support in the US Congress for the entire Gatt package. 'If the EC doesn't play,' she says, 'we have a huge segment of trade that is not covered. They have not been willing to put together a package that has the maximum effect economically and politically.' The key to the Uruguay Round may have been disappointingly elusive, but Mrs Hills finds solace in the knowledge that she has completed 'hundreds' of market-opening agreements and brought 20 unilateral Section 301 cases against protectionist markets, more than all her predecessors together. For all the bluster supplied by Capitol Hill and the deadlines and the sanctions threats, Mrs Hills retaliated rarely - twice against Canada in disputes over lumber and beer, and once against India over pharmaceutical patents. The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), completed after 14 months in a final dash before the Republican party's pre-election convention, was the climax of her tenure. She speaks almost romantically of that 'magic moment' in every negotiation. 'You can't slow (the negotiations) down or you lose momentum. You can't speed them up. There's just a momentum. You want to cut it off at the peak lest they unravel.' She gives a lot of credit to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas for his economic reforms. She knows that critics say the US has no business integrating its economy with that of an autocratic regime. But she still retains an abiding faith that 'economic reforms go hand-in-hand with political reforms'. Mrs Hills takes no credit for her successes, giving that to 'the team' in her office and her congressional and private advisers. She says: 'Our trade policy is built by consensus.' She is even grateful for the much-maligned Washington lobbyist, whom she defends despite criticism by foreign officials that the US private sector has too much sway. She says that the US, since its earliest days, has had 'people who speak out and speak clearly about their interests'. The lobbyist is paid and biased and might exaggerate his case, but she weighs these views with those of industry's economists and other more objective sources. 'If you are willing to listen to all this cacophonous sound, you get a far better picture than if you just hole up and read a book or, worse yet, deal viscerally with trade.' Inside the Washington Beltway, Mrs Hills is considered one of the few stars of the Bush cabinet, yet she is recognised as a public figure more often overseas than in the US. Her visit to the Taj Mahal was interrupted by the clicking of hundreds of cameras held by Japanese tourists. She also is the only Bush cabinet official to have been burned in effigy - in France recently by farmers protesting against the farm trade deal struck in the Uruguay Round. Mrs Hills is tough and tenacious, and is unlikely to stop pushing for a final agreement on the round until Bill Clinton is sworn in as president. Only then will she take home her packed boxes and sort out her options.</p>

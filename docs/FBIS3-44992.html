Following a high-speed growth  of 13.2 percent in 1992, the economy continued to grow at a  super high-speed of 14.1 percent in the first half of 1993.    On this basis, whether or not China can truly take a big  step  forward in 1994 in building a socialist market economy and in  restructuring while maintaining a particular rate of economic  growth and effectively curbing inflation will be a key to  whether or not China's economic development can enter a new  stage in the 1990's.  <H5>  I.

Overall Analysis of Economic Development Trend in 1993 </H5>   In the first half of 1993, China's economic growth rate  was the highest in recent years. The GDP increased by 14.1  percent, and total industrial output value increased by 25.1  percent. Moreover, there was excessive expansion of investment  scale, and the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the  whole society reached as high as 61 percent, of which the growth  rate of investments by state-owned organizations reached 70.7  percent, deducting price factors, the actual growth is over 30  percent, far exceeding the actual growth rate of the GDP. The  investment structure is still not sufficiently rational. First,  besides an increase in the proportion of investments in  communications and transportation, the proportion of investments  in energy, raw and processed materials, agriculture, and other  basic industries all are in decline.    Take state-owned organizations, for example. The total  volume of investments in the first half of 1993 increased by  63.6 percent compared with the corresponding period of 1992, but  the investments in energy, raw and processed materials, and  agriculture grew by 18.1 percent, 51.9 percent, and 28.6 percent  respectively. Second, the proportion of nonproductive  investments was too high, the growth rate of productive  investments by state-owned organizations in the first half of  1993 was 58.6 percent, and that of nonproductive investments was  up at 83.1 percent. In particular, the investments in real  estate grew too rapidly, and commodity housing investments by  state-owned organizations grew by 144 percent. Such a "double  high" problem and excessive increase in monetary issue that  appeared simultaneously led to a speed-up of inflation. In the  first half of 1993, the commodity retail price index of the  whole society rose by 10.8 percent, and the price index of the  cost of living for city and town residents rose by 13.5 percent,  of which that of 35 large- and medium-sized cities rose by 17.4  percent.    The CPC and the government have taken necessary measures,  and  starting from controlling the investment scale and strengthening  the financial order, have stepped up macroeconomic regulation  and control, and initial success has been achieved. By the end  of September, the average growth rate of total industrial output  value declined by one percentage point compared with the average  growth rate of the first half of 1993. The increasing posture  of fixed assets investments slowed down, the growth rate of  investments by state-owned organizations from January to  September dropped by nearly four percentage points compared with  that of the first half of 1993, and newly operated projects  reduced markedly. Prices of the means of production turned from  speedy rise to relaxation, residents' savings rose rapidly, and  the foreign exchange market was tending toward stability.    Taking an extensive look at the year 1993, the general trend  of economic development is: First, the economic growth for the  whole year will maintain a high speed, and the GDP growth rate  will be about 13.5 percent. However, the growth situation in  the second half of the year will slow down smoothly, and the  increase value growth rate of primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries will be about 3.5 percent, 20 percent, and 11 percent  respectively. As the measures for regulation and control of the  central authorities have inhibited newly operated projects to a  certain extent, the growth rate of investments in the second  half of the year will drop distinctly. But the fixed asset  investment scale of the whole society for the year will break  through the 1,100 billion yuan, with a growth rate of over 40  percent. Second, both income and consumption of the residents  present a rising situation, the market is flourishing and is  tending toward stability, and the nominal growth of the total  volume of social commodities may reach 23 percent, but the  growth of income and consumption of rural residents will still  be obviously lower than the average level of all China. Third,  the economic growth rate and the investment growth rate in the  second half of 1933 have somewhat reduced, but thanks to impacts  by the cost push factor and by the excessive scale of monetary  issue, and due to the steady rise in consumption demand, prices  still continuously increase, and the rise in various price  indexes will break through 10 percent. Fourth, the monetary and  financial situation has started turning for the better, but will  still be beset with difficulties, and new monetary issue will  reach a record- breaking level.  <H3>  III. The Importance of Strengthening Macroregulation and  Control </H3>   An important feature in the development of the national  economy in 1993 is that when the speedily growing economy  probably entered an "overheated" stage, the CPC and the  government introduced measures for macroregulation and control.  These measures will produce the following direct results:    1. They will curb further deterioration of monetary  difficulties and the chaotic situation, prevent excessive  expansion of the scale of fixed assets investments of the whole  society, avoid further aggravation of inflation, guarantee basic  balance between general supply and demand, favorable to  maintaining mid-term and short-term economic stability and  mid-term and long-term sustained economic growth.    2. They will be favorable to restructuring, to concentrating  funds to speed up the construction of basic facilities, relaxing  the constraint of the "bottleneck" sectors of the national  economy, and laying a foundation for long-term economic  development. This is obviously different from the readjustment  in 1988-1989.    3. It is an extremely necessary measure and a broad and  long-term view to start by strengthening the monetary order.  Strengthening the economic order in every aspect, and building  up a necessary market order, are important conditions for  successfully building up the system of a socialist market  economy. The essence and cause for various problems that have  cropped up in the present stage of economic growth are not so  much of an "overheated" economy as "over-chaotic" economy.  Various over-chaotic orders are the fundamental causes that  give rise to an "overheated" economy in certain aspects.  Therefore, not only monetary order should be strengthened, but  orders in various other aspects, such as fiscal levy order,  various securities market order, and real estate market order,  as well as the working order of various levels of administrative  and management departments, should also be seriously  strengthened to build up a strict and effective system to be  rational follow-up actions for strengthening the monetary order.  These are not only the requirements for developing a market  economy, but also fundamental measures for maintaining social  stability and solidarity throughout China.    Another important feature of economic development in 1993 is  that China's economic growth is entering a new stage of  development. The 14th CPC Congress clearly pointed out that the  goal of reform was to put into practice the system of a  socialist market economy. Theory and practice have told us that  no matter which kind of social system is in place, the market  cannot automatically reach general equilibrium and optimum  performance, and intervention or regulation and control by  external factors is absolutely necessary. Such intervention or  regulation and control not only refers to day-to-day  macroeconomic regulation and control, but more important it  refers to necessary environment and institutional  establishments. In the first stage of China's reform, in light  of influences by the traditional planned economy, we should  emphasize the market economy; in the new stage, we should shift  the emphasis onto building a market economy. In the present  strengthening of order, the central authorities not only point  out the necessity for continued reform, but also put forward the  initial framework for building a socialist market economy. This  is fundamentally different from the control over an "overheated"  economy on previous occasions, and is therefore of important  significance.    On the other hand, we should also pay close attention to  the problems that may probably be brought out in the course of  carrying out these measures.    First, as the deposit interest rate has increased by a big  margin, and the policy of savings to retain value has been put  into practice, the loan interest rate will also be compelled to  increase by a big margin. This will add to the difficulties of  funds supply, and increase the pressure on the cost of  enterprises for fundraising, in particular the pressure on that  of state-owned enterprises, thus increasing the scope and amount  of losses.    Second, tight money will result in "debt chains". With the  decline in economic growth rate, intermediate demand will  greatly decrease, and enterprises with unsatisfactory economic  operations will meet with the problem of difficult sales in a  market whose temperature is dropping. It can be foreseen that  "debt chains" will be a problem that enterprises must encounter  in 1994.    Third, the consumer goods market basically remains in a  state  of supply slightly greater than demand. To increase interest  rates will encourage the tendency of savings, and reduce  consumption. This will only inhibit future investments, with  little impact on existing investments. As there has been too  big a proportion of investments in general processing industries  in the last two years, the production capacity built up  therefrom will create new supply within a subsequent period of  time. Moreover, there have been excessive increases in the  prices of investment goods in the last two years, which add to  the cost of future products, and it is extremely difficult to  eliminate this kind of price rise pushed by cost. This problem  will create obstacles to the stability and balanced development  of the economy for a period of time to come.    Fourth, the interest rate of long-term deposits at present  is  too high, and apart from affecting people's expectations it will  create problems for banks' long-term operations. First, the  actual interest rate that the banks are required to pay for  long-term deposits is too high, which increases banks'  operational difficulties. Second, in banks' operation of funds,  the growth rate of loans for fixed assets is much higher than  that of other loans, and the cost of this type of loan will be  high, which will create an unfavorable impact on basic  facilities construction that mainly relies on bank loans for the  source of funds.    Fifth, various measures taken at present are an integration  of market measures with administrative measures, which basically  fit in with the actual situation of tracks changing in China's  present economic structure. However, they are of an "emergency"  nature, and it is unavoidable for the problem of "one cutting"  to emerge in the course of implementation. Moreover, it is also  necessary to avoid difficulties in restructuring resulting from  the protection of large and influential profit and taxpayers by  local governments.    The fundamental solution to these problems can only rely on  the thoroughgoing reform of the monetary system and the  financial and taxation system, and on the establishment and  improvement in the system of a socialist market economy.  <H5>  IV. Several Possibilities for a "Soft Landing" in 1994 </H5>   The measures for macroeconomic regulation and control  introduced at present have both to solve the problems of an  "overheated" economy, and to maintain appropriate high-speed  growth of the national economy, and bear an obvious  characteristics of "soft landing." A "soft landing" is not only  difficult in operation and control, but there are also several  possible results.    The first result is: Due to the fact that the strength of  various measures for regulation and control are properly  controlled, that various levels of leadership and economic  management departments are closely coordinated, and that all of  China is well coordinated and acts in unison, the momentum of an  overheated economy is brought under control, the inflation rate  starts declining, and the economic growth rate has dropped to  about 10 percent. In a relatively tight economic environment,  there is an increase in the weight of reform in the monetary and  banking system and the financial and taxation system, and a push  for state-owned enterprises to move toward the market. The  investment scale both maintains growth and is kept under  control, the investment structure is improved, and investments  in communications, transportation, post, and telecommunications  continue a high growth rate. Moreover, the proportion of  investments in agriculture, energy, raw and process materials,  and other basic industrial sectors increases. The proportion of  nonproductive investments and that of investments in general  processing industries decreases, and the overall investment  scale maintains a growth rate of about 20 percent. On the other  hand, as the residents' income increases, the consumer demand  grows steadily, and social general demand maintains a moderate  degree of growth. Stimulated by demand, industrial production  maintains a growth rate of about 15 percent, and is within the  range that the "bottleneck" sectors can support. Economic  development is smoothly transitioning to a period of high-speed  and steady growth, and can be sustained for a number of years.  These are the results which we expect will appear.    The key to achieving these results lies in carrying out  in-depth reform in an overall manner, building up a  complementary system of a socialist market economy, and ensuring  an orderly development of the national economy. The emphasis on  macroeconomic regulation and control should take structure  readjustment and optimization as the center, and effective  control of inflation should be an important prerequisite for  achieving this goal.    The second result is: The strength of macroeconomic  regulation and control is too strong, and excessive contraction  leads to excessive loss of speed in economic growth, resulting  in a "hard landing." The investment scale and price rises are  brought under control, but the emphasis of regulation and  control is not placed on structure readjustment and  optimization. Only speed reduction in economic growth is  enforced to fit in with the "bottlenecks" without paying  attention to developing the "bottlenecks" sectors. This will  not only bring about losses in economic development, but will  also become the starting point of the next round of an  "overheated" economy.    The third result is: As a result of evading the problem of  restructuring or being satisfied with a smattering of a subject,  far less taking rectification and chaos control and building up  the system of a socialist market economy as the final goal of  the present macroregulation and control, under the pressure of a  number of problems brought by slowing down the rate of economic  growth, economic reform stops moving forward, and the deep-level  contradictions that impede healthy economic development have not  been overcome. Hurriedly relaxing money and control over  investment scale and loosening the gate of monetary issue for  the sake of stimulating economic recovery leads to an early  rebound of the economic growth rate, thus further deteriorating  the economic structure. The constraint on communications and  transportation is further strengthened, the contradiction  between energy supply and demand becomes tense again, the  inflation that has just been curbed is revived like dying embers  glowing again, and the economic order becomes chaotic. The  expectation of residents has deviated from normal, and even  provoked factors of social instability, which compels the  decision-making departments to take "emergency brake" measures  and carry out large scale readjustment and contraction of the  economy, thereby resulting in unnecessary losses and seriously  affecting the development of a socialist market economy.  <H5>  V. The Characteristics of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>   As long as no major mistake is made in 1994, the growth of  the national economy will continue a momentum of smoothly  slowing down. This will provide favorable conditions for  strengthening industrial restructuring, and carrying out an  overall reform with market economy as a guide. In analyzing the  characteristics of macroeconomic development in 1994, we should  pay major attention to these three aspects: Growth rate,  investment scale, and inflation.    1. The economic growth rate will drop by a moderate degree,  but will maintain a high level of growth. The growth rate of  the national economy in 1994 will be lower than that of the  previous two years, but it is forecast that it will still stay  at about 10 percent. There is both necessity and possibility  for the economic growth rate to drop by a moderate degree while  a high level of growth is maintained. Its necessity lies in:    First, moderate reduction of the growth rate fits in with  the  cyclical stage of China's present economic development.  Moreover, it plays the role of appropriately mitigating the  constraining contradiction of the "bottleneck" sectors and  curbing large price increases, and ensures that the work of  economic restructuring will have a good environmental condition  to concentrate financial and material resources on vigorously  developing the construction of basic industries and basic  facilities.    Second, maintaining economic growth at a high level is  beneficial to avoiding big rise and fall in economic  development, reducing the shock caused by cyclical fluctuations,  ensuring the stability of economic development, and maintaining  a situation of social stability and unity.    Third, a moderate reduction in the economic growth rate  without a serious loss of speed conforms with the requirements  of long-term, steady, and healthy development, and conforms all  the more with the requirements of quickening in every aspect the  pace of building up the system of a socialist market economy.  Such an economic growth rate fits in with the general  principles and measures for implementation being formulated by  the central authorities for building up and developing a  socialist market economy.    In analyzing the possibility of achieving such a growth  rate,  we should see both the possible constraining factors and also  various kinds of motive forces.    The constraining factors come mainly from two aspects: The  "bottleneck" constraint and the system constraint. The  constraint by the "bottleneck" of communications and  transportation is known to all, and there have been large  increases in their investments in the last two years, but time  is required before these investments truly play their role.  Excessive demand for raw and processed materials has made the  increase margin of the prices level of the means of production  exceed the 1988 level. The symptoms of energy supply shortages  have appeared, and China's energy export in 1991 was about 40  million tons, less than the amount of growth of energy  consumption in 1992. With its high-speed economic growth, China  will change in one or two years from an energy export country to  an energy net import country. Only by appropriately reducing  economic growth rate can the "bottleneck" constraint be  relatively alleviated. Judging from the supply capacity of the  "bottleneck" sectors at present, an economic growth of about 10  percent in 1994 can be basically supported.    The system constraint is mainly expressed in the delay in  monetary and financial reforms and the delay in functional  transformation of government departments. This will provide an  opportunity to various factors that cause "over-chaotic"  economic activities, and lead to an overheated economy. When  high inflation is brought about by an "overheated" economy, the  authorities cannot but take emergency braking measures.    The motive force that promotes economic growth is mainly  investment demand and consumption demand. Since the 1990's,  there have been marked increases in the residents' income level,  which has reinvigorated the consumer market that has been weak  for a time and has led to a steady increase in total consumer  demand. In 1994, the consumption growth rate will come close to  the GDP growth rate, and the consumer goods market will remain  prosperous. The growth of consumption is not just an expansion  in quantity, more importantly it is an improvement in quality.  Competition in the consumer goods market will become  increasingly fierce. The growth of consumer demand will create  favorable conditions for economic growth, in particular for the  growth of light industrial production and the development of the  tertiary industry. Moreover, high savings, which are beneficial  to solving the problem of funds shortage, will also constantly  bring vitality to economic development.    2. The growth situation of investment scale will reduce,  but to maintain a moderate degree of investment is still  required, so as to strengthen restructuring. Investment pull is  the major motive force of super high-speed economic growth that  started in 1992. In 1994, thanks to subjective and objective  reasons, the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the  whole society will decline by a considerable margin, but the  total amount of investment, it is forecast, will still exceed  1.35 trillion yuan, and the actual investment growth rate will  still be higher than the actual growth rate of the GDP by one to  two percentage points. First of all, to maintain a particular  scale of fixed assets investments of the whole society is  necessary for achieving a smooth transition to super high-speed  operation of the national economy, and it is helpful to  preventing economic slides and the intensification of  contradiction between general supply and demand. Second, to  rationally readjust the economic structure, strengthen the  construction of basic facilities, and expand the supply capacity  of the "bottleneck" sectors, it is also necessary to strengthen  the investments in agriculture, in communications and  transportation and post and telecommunications industries, the  energy industry, and the industry of some raw and processed  materials, so as to solve the problem in the two aspects of  investment structure and total amount. To cope with the  "bottleneck" constraint, it is improper to take an attitude of  "cutting the feet to fit the shoes". We should carry out active  and positive economic restructuring by following the principle  of concentrating funds and taking preferential measures for  developing the "bottleneck" sectors. Not only the strategic  actions of vigorous development of basic industries will  contribute to economic growth, but the gradual mitigation of the  "bottleneck" constraint will also promote an overall and  high-speed growth of the national economy. Third, due to  unbalanced development in reform and opening-up, and thanks to  the differences in the original conditions, there is now an  ever-greater gap in economic development between the coastal  areas and the interior and remote areas, which has become a  problem that requires an immediate solution. To speed up the  economic development of the interior and remote areas, and to  reduce regional gaps, it is also necessary to increase  investments in these areas by in-depth reform. Finally, initial  success has been achieved in the macroregulation and control  measures taken by the central authorities in 1993, there have  been large increases in the residents' savings, and the banking  and monetary system has concentrated through rectification  considerable amount of funds that can be made use of, thus  providing funds conditions for maintaining a certain scale of  total investment amount in 1994. Maintaining a particular scale  of fixed assets investments in 1994 will be an important  propelling force for maintaining a certain economic growth rate  and speeding up economic restructuring.    The measures for regulation and control taken by the central  authorities in 1993 have been generally well received by  economic circles overseas, which has not only strengthened the  confidence of investors overseas for short-term stability of  China's economy, but has also enabled them to see a bright  future of long-term, healthy, and high-speed development of  China's economy, and helped them extend their vision of  investments from coastal areas to China's hinterland. In 1994  and in a number of years to come, foreign capital will play an  ever more important role to maintaining a continuous growth of  the scale of fixed assets investments in China.    The proportion of local investments in the fixed assets  investments of the whole society rises continuously. In 1992,  the proportion of local investments in total investments reached  60 percent. From January to August 1993, in investments in  state-owned enterprises alone, the proportion of local  investments rose to 62 percent, with a growth rate of 74.3  percent. In 1994, local investments will still occupy an  important proportion, but the tendency of local government  behavior which runs counter to the policies of the central  authorities has not always been effectively overcome. In  economic development and maintaining growth rate, local  initiatives should be brought into play and relied upon.  However, one of the formidable enemies in strengthening  macroregulation and control and maintaining economic stability  is blindness in local development. To solve this problem, we  should of course rely on certain administrative means, but the  key still lies in building up as soon as possible the system of  a socialist market economy, and standardizing the behavior of  various levels of government from the angle of system, so as to  obtain the results of a coordinated, steady, and all-round  development of China's economy.    3. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of inflation, and  prices will still remain high. Due to influences by the cost  push factor and excessive monetary issue during the previous  period, their delay effects and the introduction of a number of  necessary reform measures have made the control over inflation  in 1994 become an extremely arduous task, and it will be very  difficult to keep the price rises below 6 percent. It is  estimated that the retail price level of the whole society in  1994 will come close to 10 percent, and the price index of the  living cost for city and town residents may possibly break  through 10 percent.    In 1992 and 1993 prices of raw and processed materials as  investment goods rose by a big margin, which resulted in  increases in the cost of products of the manufacturing industry.  As the increase margin is too big, it is very difficult for  enterprises at the present technological level and economic  strength to digest it completely, and about 50 percent of the  price increases of the means of production, it is estimated,  will be shifted to the prices of the consumer goods. The prices  of investment goods in 1993, it is estimated, will increase by  18.5 percent, of which about 9 percent will be shifted to the  prices of the consumer goods in the following year and the years  afterwards. These are price increases pushed by cost, and can  in no way be overcome by further reduction of demand.    Another important cause of price rises is the large increase  in the amount of money in circulation. A 30 percent growth is  estimated for 1993, and it is impossible for it not to produce a  push on prices in 1993 and 1994. Plus influences by other  factors, the margin of increase in social retail prices in 1994  will come close to 10 percent. If certain errors again appear  in macroregulation and control and management in 1994, it will  be possible that prices rise will again break through 10 percent.  <H5>  VI. Policies Proposals </H5>   Based on the above analysis, successfully achieving "soft  landing" and maintaining a particular economic growth rate in  1994 should be the goal of macroeconomic work. Optimizing the  industrial structure should be the central task of various kinds  of economic work, and curbing inflation is an important  prerequisite for achieving the above goal. Quickening the pace  of reform systematically and in an overall manner and building  up the system of a socialist market economy are fundamental  guarantees for a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development  of China's economy.    1. Properly control the strength of macroregulation and  control. Pay attention to historical experiences and lessons,  continue implementation and improvement in the regulation and  control measures taken at present, keep strengthening the  monetary order, the financial and taxation order, and the order  of various kinds of market, and do better jobs in  macroregulation and control. The present "soft landing" work is  in a state of direct regulation, many problems accumulated  during the previous period have not been effectively overcome,  and the difficulty is therefore greater. There are some positive  factors in the present regulation and control. For example, the  impact on nonstate-owned enterprises is greater than that on  state-owned enterprises, the impact on inhibiting local  investments is greater than that on investments by the central  authorities, and the impact on group consumption is greater than  that on the residents' consumption. But we must also see that  to solve fundamentally the problems in various aspects of  macroeconomic operation, exceedingly difficult and unremitting  efforts are still required to solve the problems in structure  and mechanism. It is necessary to guard against "one cutting,"  and to carry out classified guidance aiming at regions and  industries, so as to ensure a successful realization of "soft  landing." At least before the second half of 1994, it is not  suitable to introduce measures that stimulate excessive  resumption of economic growth, and earnestly put the stress of  development on readjusting and optimizing the economic  structure. This is because: First, the economic growth rate  will slide in 1994, but a growth of about 10 percent is still  high-speed, and a growth of over 15 percent of total industrial  output value is quite spectacular. Even if the economic growth  rate for 1995 is reduced by a further 2 percent, a growth rate  of 8 percent is not low. Second, the pressure of inflation in  1994 will be enormous. There were excessive monetary issues in  1992 and 1993, and considering the cost push and other factors,  even if tight money will continue in 1994, the price rises will  also come close to 10 percent, and stimulation of economic  recovery will only aggravate inflation. Third, the tense  situation of communications and transportation where problems  are most concentrated in the current cycle will not be relaxed  before 1995. It is impossible for the energy shortage problem,  the shortage of oil and electricity in particular, to ease up in  1994, and even if there are large increases in energy  investment, it is difficult to see the results in one or two  years. The stress of macroeconomic policies in 1994 should be  placed on speeding up reform and restructuring. If we do a good  job in economic restructuring in 1994, and earnestly increase  the strength of investments in basic industrial sectors,  appropriately control the investments in other sectors, then we  can first ensure a moderate degree of growth of investment  demand (it is suitable to keep the margin of investment at 20 to  25 percent), and achieve "soft landing." Second, we can  increase the supply of the "bottleneck" sectors, and lay a  foundation for the next economic recovery, and even for a  long-term and high-speed growth of the national economy.    2. Readjust and optimize the industrial structure, and lay  emphasis on strengthening the investments in agriculture, the  communications and transportation and post and telecommunication  industries, the energy industry, and the industry of some kinds  of raw and processed materials. It is necessary to improve the  investment performance by investment structural reform to better  solve the "bottleneck" constraint problem. At present, it is  necessary to solve well problems in five aspects: First, the  development of the "bottleneck" sectors mainly relies on the  increment readjustment of increasing the supply capacity by  investments, it is therefore necessary to enlarge the quantity  of state investments (including those by the central and local  authorities). This makes it necessary to increase the state  revenue and increase the proportion of revenue in the national  income by financial and taxation structural reform. In  expenditure, it is necessary to enlarge the proportion of  investments in basic facilities, so as to ensure the source of  funds. Second, it is necessary to reform the investment  structure, carry out the joint stock system and various other  forms of funds raising and financing by long-term loans and  issue of construction bonds, and fully draw and guide social  funds and foreign capital to make investments in basic  facilities construction. Third, the state is required to work  out and carry out rational industrial policies, and promote a  speedy development of basic industries and basic facilities  construction. Fourth, it is necessary to further reform the  pricing structure, follow the principle of the market economy,  mobilize the initiatives of investments and operations by  economic benefits, and speed up the pricing reform of  communications and transportation and energy within the scope  allowed by the inflation rate. Fifth, it is necessary to  actively introduce market competition mechanism in industries of  communications and transportation and post telecommunication  which are highly monopolistic. To break industrial monopoly in  unnatural monopolistic sectors is the most effective method for  developing these sectors.    3. Strictly control inflation. The goal for controlling  inflation in 1994 should be: Relax the intensity released by  the pressure of inflation and strive to lower the rate of price  increases in 1955 and the years afterwards. In 1994 we should  strive to control the price increase rate at about 8 percent  without breaking 10 percent, and actively create conditions to  try to keep the rate of price rises in 1995 at about 6 percent.  So long as there is no further expansion of investments in the  recent period, and appropriately control the growth rate of  money in circulation, it is possible to achieve this goal. This  makes it necessary to speed up the monetary and financial  structural reform, make proper arrangements in monetary and  financial planning, control basic currency growth rate, the  amount of monetary issue in particular, and control the credit  scale strictly in accordance with the need of a moderate and  high-speed economic growth. According to forecast simulation,  new monetary issue in 1994 should be controlled within 100  billion yuan, and new credit scale should be limited to 550  billion yuan. However, one of the causes for the excessive  increase in the price index of the residents' living cost is too  rapid increase in the prices of daily necessities and services  which have relatively small income elasticity. In this respect,  the guiding control and mandatory control on the part of the  state should play a role to inhibit influences by artificial  factors.    4. Quicken the pace of building up the system of a socialist  market economy, make preparations for various reforms, and make  1994 a year of major reform. Beginning from now, we should make  preparations. First, study the opportune moment and measures  for reform, and the balanced and overall developments of various  aspects to ensure an orderly progress of reform. Second, make  necessary public opinion preparations to ensure that the  psychological expectation of the resident are normal. Third,  study the bearing capacity of various aspects about the measures  of reform, so as to keep a rational quantity limit and the scope  of strength under control. Fourth, study the problems and  deviations that may possibly crop up in the course of  implementation, work out preventive measures aiming at specific  goals, speed up the building of economic legal system, and  ensure the successful progress of reform. Speed up the pace of  reform systematically and in an overall manner, beginning first  from the reform of the monetary and financial systems, followed  by various other complementary reforms. This will enable China's  reform to enter a new stage. It not only can ensure a stable  development of the national economy in the next one or two  years, but will also open up a vast world for high-speed  development of China's economy in this century and over a long  period of time to come.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The session of OAU foreign ministers ended its  proceedings last night, a day after the scheduled date of  closure. [passage omitted]    From the very beginning of the proceedings until they ended  last night, the Rwandan crisis was touched on more and more  prominently with lengthy discussions resulting in the creation  of a commission in charge of the Rwandan issue. [passage omitted]    The last conclusion and the most astonishing of all was that  none of Rwanda's neighboring countries so far had been involved  in the massacres. Alright, this is true. But when they say  that neither of the warring sides in Rwanda was involved in this  crime against humanity, this is truly astonishing. It is  difficult to believe that the OAU was unaware of the role played  by the Rwandan Government clique in the genocide through its  army rabble and its militiamen. But given that the proposal for  creating courts to try those responsible has been approved, let  us hope that this means the judiciary is aware that there are  criminals somewhere.</p>

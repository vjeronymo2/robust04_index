			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFFORDABLE HOUSING  </P> <P> In response to your editorial "Nonprofit Housing: A Rich Idea," April 2:  </P> <P> As a nonprofit housing developer of emergency shelter, transitional housing and  permanent housing, I applaud your editorial. I have personally been involved  with nonprofit housing for 15 years and as an architect I started L.A. Family  Housing Corp. seven years ago.  </P> <P> Your article discussing building on city-owned land and the speeding up of the  bureaucracy are all vital pieces that need to be accomplished if we are ever to  solve the problem of homelessness and the lack of affordable housing. Please  continue to write about this issue and maybe some day homelessness and the lack  of affordable housing will be a part of our shameful past.  </P> <P> ARNOLD ROSS STALK, Executive  </P> <P> Director, L.A. Family Housing Corp.  </P></p>

On the other hand, the environmental  organization Global 2000 is starting a large-scale petition  campaign: It calls on the U.S. Congress to withhold financing  of Temelin: "The nuclear power plant project has already been  rejected by the World Bank and other banks with reference to  cheaper and safer alternatives," the petition states:  "Therefore, we are appealing to you not to support the  short-term economic interests of the U.S. nuclear industry."    This campaign is supported by Education Minister Rudolf  Scholten: "If signatures are collected in schools, I endorse  that." The first prominent person to sign is [singer] Rainhard  Fendrich. Lists for signatures can be obtained at "Global  2000," 1120 Vienna, Flurschuetzstrasse 13, telephone 0222/812 57  30.    Environmental activist Petr Hlobil of the Czech  environmental  organization "Children of Earth" believes that "the majority of  the people in southern Bohemia are against the project."  Organized resistance is already forming, according to Hlobil.  Hlobil does not accept his government's argument that Temelin is  necessary so that the outdated coal-fired power plants in  northern Bohemia can be closed down. Until 1995-96 -- the  earliest date of Temelin's coming into service -- most of the  coal-fired power plants in the region will already have been  closed down or improved. Only 430 of the 2,000 megawatts of  Temelin will then be needed in northern Bohemia.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Scottish TV edges ahead helped by rise in programme sales AN INCREASE of more than 40 per cent in programme sales was the main factor allowing pre-tax profits at Scottish Television, the independent television contractor for central Scotland, to edge up from Pounds 11.11m to Pounds 11.23m in 1990. Sir Campbell Fraser, chairman, said that 'within the context of a testing year', the company performed well in every area of its activities. The results come just days before the deadline on May 15 for companies to submit bids to the independent television commission for the new ITV franchises. Sir Campbell said the company was putting the final touches to its application for central Scotland. If reappointed, he was looking forward to 'a return to better days' in 1992. He noted that, among other attributes, the company had a strong balance sheet, improving share of advertising revenue, increasing programme sales and costs under tight control. Advertising revenues were up only 2 per cent at Pounds 89.05m (Pounds 87.32m), but Sir Campbell said ITV as a whole stood still. By contrast programme sales and services rose strongly to Pounds 18.24m (Pounds 12.91m). Total turnover was Pounds 114.08m (Pounds 103.78m). The pre-tax line was, however, depressed by a rise in the Exchequer levy to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 4.04m): 'not the first time', Sir Campbell noted, that the charge had been increased at a time of difficulties for the industry. However, compared with the previous year, profits were helped by charges of only Pounds 558,000 (Pounds 3.15m) for voluntary early leavers and retirements and reorganisation. The final dividend is lifted to 23p (20p) for a total of 28.75p (25p). Earnings per share were 62p (61p). See Lex</p>

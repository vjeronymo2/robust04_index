The delegation will be headed by Ibrahim Nimr Husayn  and Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that  the Syrian foreign minister approved the delegation's arrival;  however, the delegation preferred to put off its departure to  Damascus in the wake of the Hebron massacre.    Our correspondent's inquiries revealed that immediately  after  Basil al-Asad's death was reported in the media, Dr. al-Tibi,  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, sent a letter to Nayif  Hawatimah in Damascus requesting permission to send a delegation  to offer condolences on behalf of the Galilee Arabs. Dr. Ahmad  al-Tibi also specified the names of the proposed members of the  delegation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Smith: "French Army Not Welcome in </F> Rwanda"]    [Excerpts] France is getting ready to intervene in Rwanda,  despite the declared hostility of the rebel movement which, on  the ground, is fighting for the survivors of the genocide whom  it claims it wants to protect. [passage omitted]    In a last-ditch attempt to win RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  support for its initiative, last night France sent Jean-Michel  Marlaud, the evacuated ambassador to Kigali, back to Rwanda.  This triggered a race against the clock, since a favorable vote  from the UN Security Council, which in principle should be taken  for granted, can scarcely be envisaged if the Rwandan rebels  continue to want to fight the "humanitarian protection force."  It is true that France has requested an offensive mandate  allowing it "to impose peace by forceful means," in accordance  with Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. However, after the bloody  failure of the Americans in Somalia, what country would send its  men into another "humanitarian war?" Moreover, since they are  planning to enter Rwanda from Zaire, it is hard to envisage the  French soldiers entering the hideouts of the "government" forces  with the acclamation of the authors of the genocide wielding  clubs, machetes, and nailed boards. These militias believe, as  do the RPF, that the French have come to "help" them once again.    Hindered by this "image problem," the French chiefs-of-staff  are trying to obtain, for the Senegalese or Italian troops who  are ready to participate, the right to pass through rebel-held  territory, entering via Uganda. A military source in Paris  explained yesterday evening: "For the Italians, we will be  stressing their Catholicism and the many evangelization  missions...," although he admitted that "this is far from cut  and dried." By making a clear distinction between humanitarian  aid and the envisaged "military-humanitarian" mission, the RPF  nonetheless authorized the transit of 30 tonnes of emergency  supplies sent by France from Uganda. Despite the "French  military threat," the Rwandan rebels have even promised to keep  this humanitarian corridor open "for regular convoys."    A French official yesterday explained: "We have sidelined  the leading extremists of our former policy, which was totally  pro-Hutu," quoting the name of General Huchon at the Cooperation  Ministry. "However, by intervening in the west of Rwanda and  making the government-held zone, where much of the population  has taken refuge, a safe area, we will create a kind of Hutuland  which would otherwise be militarily condemned. It is clearly a  political maneuver, and, in the wake of the Tutu genocide, one  that will be completely unacceptable to the RPF." Already, in  his article printed last Tuesday in LIBERATION, [Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe had stressed "the need for a restart of  political dialogue, irrespective of the situation on the  ground." Where the massacres were concerned, he also demanded  that those responsible for "these genocides" -- in the plural --  be brought to trial...</p>

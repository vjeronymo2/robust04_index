			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Walt Disney agrees to TV station swap deal WALT DISNEY, the Hollywood studio and theme park group, has agreed to swap a Los Angeles television station it owns for 45 per cent of Pinelands, the New Jersey holding vehicle of a leading New York independent television sta-tion. The transaction calls for Disney to sell the Los Angeles-based KCAL-TV to Pinelands in a deal estimated to be worth Dollars 200m. Pinelands, which controls New York's WWOR-TV station, was previously owned by MCA, the Hollywood entertainment group that was acquired by Matsushita of Japan. Matsushita was required to spin off Pinelands 15 months ago because US regulations prohibit foreign ownership of US television inter-ests. The Disney-Pinelands deal may yet run into obstacles since it is being opposed by Mr Mario Gabelli, the New York money manager whose company owns 12 per cent of Pinelands. Mr Gabelli complained that the transaction undervalued Pinelands.</p>

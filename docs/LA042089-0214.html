			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GANNETT PAPER VOTES FOR UNION  </P> <P> Employees at the Gannett-owned Burlington Free Press, Vermont's largest daily  newspaper, have voted overwhelmingly to unionize, results tallied today show.  </P> <P> The vote was 77 to 47 to join the Graphic Communications International Union.  </P> <P> The election pitted the 150,000-member union against the $3.3-billion Gannett  Co., which historically has fought hard against unions at its 88 newspapers. It  was the first time in five years that Gannett has lost a union election.  </P> <P> Workers at the Free Press had complained of low wages, unpaid overtime and  recent reductions in health benefits. They alleged that Gannett has taken  profits from the Free Press and other newspapers to support other enterprises,  notably USA Today, its nationally circulated newspaper.  </P> <P> Unions represent about 20% of the 37,000 Gannett Co. workers.  </P></p>

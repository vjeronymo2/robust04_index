			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, has visited the military police battalion within the  Bosnia-Herzegovina General Staff of the Supreme Command. He  informed the representatives of the military police about the  current military situation, and the peace negotiations. Edin  Muhic reports.    [Muhic] Dzevad Radzo, commander of the military police  battalion, briefed Dr. Ganic about the activities of the members  of this battalion. He emphasized the high morale of his  fighters, whose average age is about 25. Radzo also stressed  the excellent cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  particularly in fighting crime. The fighters of the military  police battalion are also involved in combat operations together  with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.    Speaking about the latest round of the Geneva talks, Dr.  Ganic stressed that the Serbian-Croatian coalition from  Karadjordjevo [location of Milosevic-Tudjman talks in 1991 on  the carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina] was again at work.    [Ganic] However, we will continue to fight. We will wait  for the convention of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, wait to  hear their views on the [word indistinct] that they will support  a unified Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not support  this Karadjordjevo concept. [words indistinct] some other  coalitions are possible, coalitions that no one has ever under  any circumstances envisaged.    [Muhic] Addressing the partition of the country, the  carve-up of Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia, Ganic said:    [Ganic] Tudjman and Milosevic cannot carve up Bosnia. They  cannot even with the help of some circles in Europe, because  that would extend the Bosnia-Herzegovina war into new regions.  No one has ever counted on that. You have heard that we have  been offered Peljesac, that is, a part of Peljesac to build a  port, so [we have been offered] a part of another country,  somebody else's territory. I would like to remind you that we  have built one port on somebody else's territory, the port of  Ploce. Now they want us to build another one. Why should we  [word indistinct], when we have our own coast [in and around  Neum], and we can build the port there, on the territory over  which we have sovereignty, and that is some 24 kilometers of  coast.    [Muhic] The international community during the Geneva talks  has abandoned the principles set at the London conference, Ganic  stressed.    [Ganic] We have to return to them. Whether by the Security  Council or some other [word indistinct] conference, a Balkan one  or a London one, whatever, the principles have to be set again  and then, based on those principles, we can search for a  political solution.    [Muhic] Some of the solutions have to be found in  Bosnia-Herzegovina itself, Ganic said. First of all we have to  bolster the army. There are still reserves, both in the  internal organization of the military and civilian authorities,  and in involving our people abroad. Just the things that we  have done inside Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded results. What,  in the view of Presidency member Ejup Ganic, is needed for the  war to be ended?    [Ganic] It will be over when both Serbia and Croatia  understand that they cannot carve up Bosnia, that they cannot  carve up Bosnia in the way set out in Karadjordjevo. They  cannot restrict the Bosniak people to a few enclaves in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Muhic] At the end of his visit to the military police  battalion, Dr. Ejup Ganic said:    [Ganic] We here are defending certain values that do not  belong to Bosnia-Herzegovina alone, but to all civilization.  Because of that, our fighters make one of the best armies ever  formed in Europe.    [Muhic] Dzevad Radzo, commander of the military police  battalion, expressed his gratitude to Presidency member Ejup  Ganic for the information, and concluded that the military  police -- regardless of the political solutions -- will carry  out its tasks for as along as needed.</p>

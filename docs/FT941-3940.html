			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scottish salmon also subsidised Sir, I refer to your editorial comment 'Salmon wars' (March 10). While it is no doubt true that the Norwegian salmon industry has received considerable state aid, the same must also be said of the Scottish industry. Since the late 1970s Scottish salmon farming companies have received UK and EU direct aid in the form of grants, interest relief subsidies and cheap loans; in certain cases direct aid has exceeded 50 per cent of the start-up costs of Scottish salmon farming ventures. In addition the Scottish (and Irish) industries are protected by an import tariff of 2 per cent which is significant in such a low margin business. The real problem is that Norway enjoys several fundamental advantages over Scotland: in general, sites are more sheltered and less prone to storm damage; the temperature and day length regimes engender faster growth and a lower incidence of disease; the size of farms is strictly limited by the licensing authorities and as such Norway has not suffered some of the appalling diseconomies of scale witnessed at large units in Scotland where disease has resulted in drastic losses. Without the benefit of state aid the efficient family-operated, medium-sized Norwegian salmon farm is profitable at an average price which is perhaps 20-30 per cent below the stated average cost of production in Scotland. The real worry now is not Norway but Chile: its nascent, fast-growing industry is producing salmon even more cheaply than Norway. Whether Norwegian salmon is excluded from the EU or not, international competition in the maturing salmon market is going to intensify. In the long term, salmon prices are unlikely to recover.

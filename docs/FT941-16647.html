			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Northern Ireland peace talks head towards stalemate The Northern Ireland peace process was heading towards stalemate last night after Sir Patrick Mayhew underlined the UK government's determination not to respond to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of the Downing Street Declaration. The Northern Ireland secretary's comments coincided with the strongest hint yet by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, that the IRA would not renounce its 25-year armed struggle without such clarification. Mr Adams told the Irish News, a Belfast-based nationalist newspaper: 'I said always what I wanted at the end of this peace process was to end up with a package, a proposition I can bring to the IRA in which hopefully I can make a definitive point which will lead them to change their campaign. I don't have such a package; I don't have such a proposition.' Pressure on the UK government to respond to Sinn Fein's demands has been mounting in recent days, with many leading politicians indicating they think the request is reasonable. Mr John Major, prime minister, has said the demands are 'an increasingly desperate attempt to avoid facing up to the clear choice that confronts them'. Mr Adams last night wrote to Mr Major on the subject. Downing Street last night confirmed that Mr Major had invited Mr John Hume, leader of Ulster's mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, for a meeting soon after parliament resumes on Monday. In a move likely to be welcomed by Ulster Unionists, the government also signalled that Mr Michael Ancram, the newly promoted Northern Ireland minister, is to press ahead with talks with leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties within the next two weeks. Meanwhile, pressure mounted on Mr Adams and Mr Hume to publish details of their agreement last year which played a large part in getting the current peace initiative under way after a Dublin newspaper reported the Sinn Fein president had agreed to the principle of majority consent for any constitutional change in the province's status. Mr Hume and Mr Adams both dismissed the reports yesterday as speculation. A Roman Catholic man seriously wounded late on Thursday night was the first victim of loyalist terrorists since the joint declaration was published three weeks ago. Grassroots backlash, Page 6</p>

Viktor Klimov, head of the organization and methods  department, explained that over two-thirds of the deputy corps  of the legislative assemblies -- or oblast dumas as the new  bodies of representative power in the regions are mostly called  -- had been elected in these regions. That is just the number  of deputies necessary for the body to be considered capable, for  it to convene and start working. The rest of its members in the  regions will be elected in repeated elections, the dates for  which will be set locally. Viktor Klimov said "the elections  had given 100 per cent results" only in three parts of the  federation -- the Aginsk, Buryat, and Komi-Permyak autonomous  okrugs. In each of the three parts, deputies had been elected  from all 15 okrugs and their representative bodies were at full  strength.    In three parts of the federation the elections have been  deemed invalid. In St.Petersburg they have been prolonged to  today by the decision of the mayor.</p>

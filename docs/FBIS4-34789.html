			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for  21 August.    Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate for the  Institutional  Revolutionary Party, PRI, presents a 10-point program to combat  poverty, pledges to continue to implement and decentralize the  solidarity program, and calls upon all Mexicans to join in the  fight against poverty.    Cuauthemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the Party of  the Democratic Revolution, PRD, finishes a three-day visit to  Chihuahua State and is criticized by the National Action Party,  PAN, for his negative comments on PAN Governor Francisco  Barrios. PAN publicly accuses Cardenas of diverting funds while  he was governor of Michoacan.    National Opposition Union, UNO, candidate Pablo Emilio  Maderos visits the National Autonomous University of Mexico  where he pledges to fight unemployment and poverty.    Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the  Mexican  Green Ecologist Party, PVEM, visits Oaxaca State, where he says  the 21 August elections will suffer because of the high level of  poverty in Mexico. He calls for a peaceful solution to the  Chiapas conflict because, he says, an armed conflict benefits no  one. [Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 16  Jun 94]    In Veracruz, Zedillo speaks to thousands of PRI members,  saying the country's institutional life cannot be negotiated or  transformed into the political gain of uncompromising  minorities. He calls upon Mexicans to respect social peace,  sovereignty, national unity, independence, and freedom. [Mexico  City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 17 Jun 94 pp 1-5]    Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the  Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction, ends his visit to  several Jalisco municipalities.    Labor Party candidate Cecilia Soto holds a news conference  in  Reynosa, Tamaulipas State, during which she says that the United  States should provide Mexico and Colombia with evidence of its  will to reduce drug use, combat money laundering and arms  smuggling, and prosecute drug lords in the United States.  [Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 17 Jun  94]    Cardenist Front candidate Aguilar Talamantes says Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis' resignation is good for the  country and that his party and the Zapatist National Liberation  Army, EZLN, are both fighting for the same improvements. [Mexico  City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 20  Jun 94]    During an interview, PRD candidate Cardenas pledges to  improve Mexico's education system and says there is still time  to make electoral reforms. [Mexico City XEW Television Network  in Spanish 0430 GMT 21 Jun 94]    PRI candidate Zedillo admits that problems in the electoral  process have made would-be voters distrustful. He invites PRI  businessmen and intellectuals to attend meetings on his behalf  because such meetings would lend legitimacy to his probable  victory. [Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 21 Jun  94 p 1A]    Zedillo campaigns in Villa Alvaro Obregon, a Mexico City  low-income neighborhood where he reiterates his pledge to combat  excessive poverty. In Mexico City, Labor Party candidate Soto  calls for reforming the power of the president. [Mexico City  Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0140 GMT 22 Jun 94]    A new group called the Citizen's Network has been created to  promote peace during the elections. The PRD calls for an  amendment to the Electoral Law, but the PRI disagrees. Zedillo  says the people, not the government, own the solidarity program  because the people pay for it. PAN presidential candidate Diego  Fernandez de Cevallos denies that his campaign has slowed down,  saying that he stopped visiting small communities only because  such visits make him lose sight of the larger picture. Labor  Party candidate Soto proposes a women's secretariat and claims  that she is the victim of slander on the part of her opponents.  [Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 22 Jun  94]    The Federal Electoral Institute, IFE, reports that foreign  visitors will be allowed to observe the coming August elections  as a means of eliminating suspicions of fraud but the visitors  will be banned from participating in political activities. IFE  reports that the 48 million ballots required for the coming  elections have been sent to the states. Zedillo holds a meeting  at the Change 21 Foundation, where he says it is necessary to  create a new federalism. In Toluca, Labor Party candidate Soto  opposes the PRD's proposal to institute the death sentence.  [Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300  GMT 23 Jun 94]</p>

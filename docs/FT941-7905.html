			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Ukrainian nuclear deal put in doubt President Leonid Kravchuk of the Ukraine has thrown into doubt the agreement to rid his territory of nuclear missiles by deciding not to stand for re-election when his first term in office ends this June. Mr Kravchuk's office yesterday confirmed the president's decision, which comes amid weeks of fierce debate over Ukraine's intractable economic crisis. In a front-page interview in the morning's Demokratichna Ukraina newspaper, Mr Kravchuk said he had made 'a final decision' not to seek a second term because he could not, 'defend the current economic, social situation' to his people. The surprise decision coincided with the government's announcement to issue a wave of credits, totalling 10 per cent of last year's gross national product, to support industry and agriculture. His departure in four months casts a shadow over the deal to rid Ukraine of nuclear weapons, signed with Presidents Bill Clinton of the US and Boris Yeltsin of Russia last month in Moscow. The west was counting on Mr Kravchuk to ensure the implementation of the agreement since the Ukrainian parliament has still failed to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would guarantee Ukraine's non-nuclear status. Mr Kravchuk's first term was supposed to last five years until 1996, but a political deadlock between parliament and president last September was resolved by scheduling elections for both of them for the first half of this year. Mr Kravchuk's press secretary, Mr Victor Stelmakh, declined to offer an explanation for the decision not to seek a second term. 'Look at the papers,' he said. 'All the reasons are there.' The president's popularity rating has plummeted as Ukraine's economy has fallen further into a crisis of hyperinflation, dire energy shortages and a massive industrial slump. The 60-year-old former communist party ideology chief, who became president in 1991, has come under fire for failing to push through any substantial economic reforms. A December poll suggested only 11 per cent of Ukrainians had confidence in their president and only 17 per cent would vote for him on June 26. The former prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, polled higher. Since that poll, dissatisfaction and anger have only increased. Many Ukrainians have gone without wages since December. Enterprises, faced with a huge credit squeeze, have held back deliveries and cut production.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 May (PL) -- The Cuban Office of the  Prosecutor General has opened files on more than 150 people,  whose possession of wealth is believed to have come about  illegally. This is being done in accordance with the recently  implemented decree-law 149.    PRENSA LATINA learned from sources at the Office of the  Prosecutor General that these proceedings were initiated after  more than 60 homes and 200 vehicles, including cars, trucks, and  motorcycles, as well as vehicle spare parts and accessories,  were seized.    Similar action was taken with many motors, household  appliances, clothing, machinery, accessories, raw materials,  plastic products, tanks containing fuel, tanks filled with  oxygen and acetylene, and exorbitant amounts of grain and animal  feed.    Meanwhile, GRANMA reported that factory, store, small  business, and restaurant administrators, as well as farmers,  mechanics, and electricians are among those who have acquired  wealth illegally. The article adds that large sums of money, in  cash and in bank accounts, were also seized from these people.    One of the biggest files belongs to a resident of the  western  Pinar del Rio Province, who will have to prove legal ownership  of two cars, two motorcycles, two rice mills, one corn mill, and  a large number of spare parts and accessories, as well as a  large amount of oxygen and acetylene. This individual was  hoarding many pieces of fake jewelry, more than 250,000 pesos  (the same as $250,000 at the official exchange rate) in bank  accounts and cash, motors, and food.    In all these cases, including those in which it is obvious  that illegal activities were committed, those involved will be  given time to prove that the goods were acquired legally. If  the accused cannot prove this, the file will be sent to the  State Committee for Finance and the State Committee for Prices  to decide whether or not the goods will be seized.    This operation against the so-called hoarders is being  conducted in response to requests made by the people during the  more than 80,000 meetings at places of work, in accordance with  an agreement approved by the parliament and with the decree-law  passed by the government.</p>

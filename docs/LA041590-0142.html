			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SABERHAGEN, DAVIS ADD AURA TO ROYAL WIN  </P> <P> Perhaps Bret Saberhagen doesn't know this is a year ending in an even number.  Or maybe, with Mark Davis around, it won't make any difference.  </P> <P> With Saberhagen starting and Davis finishing Saturday at Kansas City in the  Royals' 3-1 victory over Toronto, major league history was made. It was the  first time a team had both reigning Cy Young Award winners figure in the  victory.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, the American League winner for the second time with a 23-6 record  last season, gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings to win it. Davis, who had 44  saves at San Diego to win the National League award, pitched a perfect ninth to  save it. In three appearances after signing as a free agent with the Royals,  Davis has retired all seven batters he has faced.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, who has had problems in even years and pitched brilliantly in  odd-numbered years, is off to a 1-0 start.  </P> <P> As a rookie in 1984, Saberhagen was 10-11. In 1985, he was 20-6 and won the  award for the first time. The next year he was 7-12. But, in 1987, he bounced  back to 18-10. In 1988, he fell to 14-16.  </P> <P> With that record, it would figure he might be in store for a below-.500 season  in 1990.  </P> <P> "Wrong," Saberhagen said. "This year, things are going to be different. I  really worked hard over the winter. I am in great shape and having Mark, the  best reliever in the game, can't hurt.  </P> <P> "He should get plenty of opportunities like this. With Monty (Jeff Montgomery)  setting him up, Mark will get the chances."  </P> <P> Montgomery was the finisher last season, getting 18 saves. When Saberhagen  faltered in the eighth, Montgomery came in to get the last two outs.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson scored two runs and had three hits, two of them doubles. In the  second inning, he singled off Todd Stottlemyre (0-2), stole second and scored  on Willie Wilson's double.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Jackson hit what appeared to be a routine single in front of  Toronto center fielder Mookie Wilson and legged it into a double, then scored  on Jim Eisenreich's single.  </P> <P> Texas 8, New York 4 -- Throughout his career, Nolan Ryan has probably lost more  well-pitched games than just about anyone. So, the 43-year-old power pitcher  wasn't about to turn down his 291st victory just because of a mediocre  performance.  </P> <P> Ryan, who pitched five hitless innings to win on opening day, gave up 10 hits  and four runs in seven innings at New York. He is 6-0 against the Yankees since  losing to them in Anaheim for the Angels in May, 1977.  </P> <P> "I didn't have my good stuff today," Ryan said. "But some days you get the  breaks. My fastball wasn't as good as it was the other day, but my control was  better."  </P> <P> Don Mattingly, usually a slow starter, had three hits off Ryan and is six for  12 this season.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Roger Clemens is throwing hard again and so is Lee  Smith. That means the Red Sox are off to a good start.  </P> <P> Clemens struck out 10 batters for the 39th time in his career in this game at  Boston. He gave up eight hits and three runs in 6 2/3 innings and the Red Sox  won for the 7,000th time.  </P> <P> Rob Murphy bailed out Clemens in the seventh and Smith got the last four outs  for his third save.  </P> <P> Chris Bosio blanked the Red Sox with two hits in five innings. He left with a  2-0 lead. The Red Sox jumped on Don August for all their runs in the sixth  inning. A suicide squeeze by Luis Rivera drove in the go-ahead run and Wade  Boggs singled home the fourth.  </P> <P> Baltimore 7, Detroit 4 -- Two years ago, the Orioles were the doormat of the  American League. Last year they were the big surprise.  </P> <P> In this game at Detroit, the Tigers, who lost 103 games last season, most  resembled a doormat. They made five errors to present the Orioles with three  unearned runs.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson gave up eight hits but only two runs in 5 1/3 innings to win it,  and Gregg Olson, the rookie bullpen sensation of last season, pitched two  scoreless innings to save it.  </P> <P> Oakland 5, Seattle 2 -- Dave Stewart continued to be nearly perfect in April.  He held the Mariners to two hits in 6 2/3 innings at Seattle to win his second  in a row. He is 16-0 in April the last three years.  </P> <P> Dave Henderson and Mike Gallego homered for the Athletics (4-1).  </P> <P> Stewart, going after his fourth consecutive 20-victory season, is 12-0 against  the Mariners.  </P> <P> Chicago 9, Cleveland 4 -- Sammy Sosa led an extra-base barrage at Chicago with  two triples in a romp over the Indians.  </P> <P> The White Sox pounded out 15 hits, six of them for extra bases.  </P> <P> Melido Perez needed help in the seventh, but posted his first win. Greg  Swindell was the loser. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

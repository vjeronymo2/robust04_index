			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Italian industry hit by protest strike ITALY'S public services, banks and much of industry was paralysed yesterday by a four-hour general strike called by the unions in protest at the 1994 austerity budget. Demonstrations were held in all the country's main cities. Union leaders attacked the government's economic policy despite a last-minute decision by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, to increase funds for creating new jobs from L800bn (Pounds 332m) to L1,300bn (Pounds 540m). As with the previous four general strikes in April, the union leaders were doubtful that the protest would produce concrete improvements for the rank-and-file or alter the basic austerity measures in next year's budget. Instead, the strike action reflected the general sense of frustration in the labour movement about pay falling behind inflation and the rise in the unemployment rate to nearly 11 per cent. The lack of real focus in the general strike provoked a tough response from Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. It issued a statement saying the unions were deluding themselves if they believed the state could continue to be guarantor of jobs or that hand-outs could be the motor of recovery. The strike had been preceded by a week of labour unrest in the transport sector. Significantly, the sole sector to observe a full day's stoppage was the chemicals industry. Here Enichem, the state chemicals group, is about to implement a restructuring plan which could see a 20 per cent reduction in the workforce. In September, Enichem workers at Crotone in southern Italy carried out a violent occupation of the plant and nearby town which signalled the begining of a more radical labour climate nationwide. Apart from employment, yesterday's strike was intended to highlight the inequalities in the tax system, with salaried workers bearing the brunt of contributions while the self-employed evade taxes on a huge scale. The government is currently battling to retain a 'minimum tax' to impose on the estimated earnings of the self-employed and this week decided to call a vote of confidence in parliament on this issue. The unions are also complaining that strong lobbying on has persuaded the government to to divert more money in the 1994 budget to top up pensions at the expense of public sector pay increases. The budget, due to be approved by mid-December, is attempting to reduce the public sector deficit to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product and find an extra L32,000bn mainly through spending cuts.</p>

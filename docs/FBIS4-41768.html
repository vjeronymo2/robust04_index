			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova and others]    [Text] The preliminary results of the presidential  elections in Ukraine revealed diametrically opposed tendencies  in the east and west of the country, which can ultimately lead  to a split, a high-ranking Russian expert specializing in  Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Monday [27 June].  He noted, though, that he expressed the opinion of a political  scientist rather than a diplomat.    What happened was easy to predict, he went on to say. The  west voted for Leonid Kravchuk, who scored 90 percent of the  votes in Lvov, for instance. The east, including Donbass,  Zaporozhye and Crimea, voted for Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma,  who is leading with an impressive preponderance.    Obviously, the electors voted for the ideas expressed by the  candidates, not for the candidates as such. Kravchuk symbolizes  independence and gradual departure from Russia, while Kuchma --  independence and rapprochement with Russia, he said.    He also noted that before the Soviet Union's breakup,  Ukraine  had never existed as an independent state. The west of Ukraine  was initially part of Austro-Hungary and then Hungary and  Poland, while the east had always gravitated to Russia. "The  conventional border ran along the Dnieper. Hence, the left-bank  (eastern) and right-bank (western) Ukraine," said the Russian  expert. The preliminary results of the elections show that the  historical division was still strongly influencing the alignment  of political forces in Ukraine, he said.    He said he did not want to make far-reaching conclusions.  "One should not forget, however, that during the 1991  referendum, 90 percent of the Ukrainian residents voted for  independence. The situation has changed since then. This is  the only thing one can say with confidence," he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> CHANGES IN MATH EDUCATION PROPOSED  </P> <P> A group of leading mathematics organizations, warning that American students  are dangerously unprepared in math, outlined an ambitious plan to revise math  education that calls for less rote learning and a stronger emphasis on problem  solving and fundamental concepts and more use of calculators and computers. The  plan incorporates a number of ideas proposed by math educators in recent years,  but it is the first coordinated effort to lay out a specific blueprint for  implementing them. The organizations, working under the auspices of the  National Research Council, said they would establish teaching standards for  every grade, rewrite curricula and reconsider the current division of the  subject into arithmetic, algebra, geometry and other distinct courses.  </P></p>

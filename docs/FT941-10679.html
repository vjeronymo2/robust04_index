			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Olivetti rules out rights issue for this year Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, has 'absolutely no reason' for a rights issue this year, even if it wins the licence to run a second national cellular communications network, according to Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman. Mr De Benedetti said mobile communications was 'not a diversification or opportunistic for Olivetti. It's at the heart of our business'. However, company officials have admitted winning the licence would have a negative impact on cash flow during the project's early years, when heavy investments would be required. According to company forecasts, a successful bid by the Omnitel consortium, headed by Olivetti, would cost the latter between L1,500bn and L2,000bn (Dollars 887m-Dollars 1.2bn) in the 18 months from winning the licence. The project would create 2,000 jobs. Omnitel, which includes Swedish Telecom, Bell Atlantic, Cellular Communications and Lehman Brothers, is one of three contenders to run the new GSM-standard network. A government decision is expected by the end of April. Olivetti has stressed the importance of winning the mandate. However, winning it is expected to have a modest negative impact on earnings for up to four years because of heavy investment spending. Olivetti would seek to limit costs by using existing financial resources and avoiding additional debt. However, officials implied it might need to turn to shareholders eventually to fund the additional spending. Olivetti, which last year pushed through a L902bn rights issue, will seek shareholder approval to issue up to L2,000bn in new shares and bonds over the next five years. However, a senior executive said the proposal, to be put to shareholders in April, had been misunderstood, and did not necessarily mean extra cash would be raised. Winning the licence could affect Olivetti's results just as it is poised to emerge from sustained losses. Bolstered by a shift into more profitable service-based activities, Mr De Benedetti said breaking even was a reachable objective this year.</p>

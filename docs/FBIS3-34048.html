Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports  that the three have announced, however, that Tzomet leader  Refa'el Eytan can acquiesce to their request to suspend the  party director general and appoint an external auditor to probe  party affairs by 7 February, when the Knesset House Committee is  expected to approve their petition to be recognized as an  independent faction. If he does, they will withdraw their  secession. They contend that one-third of the Tzomet  Secretariat will join their move.    Eytan's reaction: Segev is gone and good riddance. Now we  will be able to run the party without intrigue. Eytan will  convene a news conference in a short while.    The three stated that they have not negotiated with anyone  and that they are busy organizing their new movement. Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that their faction will qualify  to receive party funding in the sum of 2 million shekels a year.  If they join the coalition, they will be eligible for  ministerial and deputy ministerial posts in accordance with the  current coalition key.    The three seceding MK's today held contacts with Labor MK's;  it was decided to wait four to six weeks before launching  negotiations on their joining the coalition.    More political reactions: Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan said  this was an internal affair concerning Tzomet alone, and if the  three endorse the government guidelines, nothing will prevent  their joining the coalition. Ran Kohen, chairman of the Meretz  faction, also called on the three to accept the government  guidelines and to fight for their missions from within the  government.    Arye Der'i, the SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] chairman,  said SHAS will not rush to join the coalition if the three  Tzomet MK's join it. SHAS will return to the coalition only if  the government is founded on a majority of Jewish MK's, or if  the implementation of the agreement with the Palestinians is  guaranteed not to harm the settlers in the territories.    Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said he will not intervene  in the internal affairs of other parties, but he regrets any  rift in the right-wing parties.</p>

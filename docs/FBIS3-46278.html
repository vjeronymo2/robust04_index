			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 26 (XINHUA) -- A program for  improving coal-use efficiency and the environment, jointly  carried out by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and  the Chinese Government, has been progressing smoothly since its  implementation in 1992.    Yuan Shaofu, deputy director of China International Center  for Economic and Technical Exchange (CICETE), which is in charge  of implementation of the program, said that after more than a  year of effort, the program has achieved prominent results in  various aspects.    He said that the aim of the program is to support the  Chinese  Government in exploiting coal resources efficiently by spreading  or developing technologies and equipment concerning the  production or use of coal. Research, design, manufacturing,  transportation and some other aspects of the program can help  raise the efficiency of coal exploitation, cut down on  environmental pollution and promote the health and safety of the  people.    A key point of the program is to raise China's capability in  using some critical technologies for coal production, he added.    Yuan said the budget for the program is 17 million U.S.  dollars, of which UNDP will put in eight million U.S. dollars,  while the Chinese Government is responsible for nine million  U.S. dollars.    Specifically, the program involves recovery and utilization  of chemicals from coking, circulating fluidized bed combustion  technology, control of atmospheric pollution from coal  combustion, exploration for deep coalbed methane as well as  other aspects.    Concerted efforts by UNDP and CICETE in the past year have  resulted in varying degrees of progress in these aspects, Yuan  said.    China is the world's biggest coal producer. By the end of  the century its annual coal output will reach 1.4 billion tons.  Presently coal constitutes 74 percent of China's total energy  output, while it makes up 76 percent of total energy consumption.    Forecasts show that by the end of this century coal will  still constitute 70 percent of China's total energy demand.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Truce agreed in glazing dispute A truce was agreed in the High Court yesterday in a poaching dispute between Anglian Windows, the Norwich-based double-glazing company, and Aspen Windows, set up by Mr George Williams, Anglian's founder and former chief. Anglian, the UK's biggest double-glazing group, is suing Aspen, Mr Williams, and 10 salesmen who left Anglian to join Aspen. It claims the 10 are in breach of their contracts. Pending a full hearing of the dispute, the salesmen gave undertakings to Mr Justice Aldous not to solicit customers who were Anglian customers during specified periods. Aspen pledged not to induce breaches of contract by the 10 or any other Anglian representatives.</p>

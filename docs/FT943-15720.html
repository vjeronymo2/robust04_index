			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (13): Expectations confounded - In spite of its recent strategy of overseas expansion Marzotto, the clothing and textiles group, has experienced a severe cutback in profits. Andrew Hill talks to its chairman / The Italian experience To get to work, Pietro Marzotto, chairman of Italy's largest clothing and textile group, drives a large silver Lexus saloon, rather fast, through the streets of Valdagno, the small northern Italian town where Marzotto has its headquarters. He likes to show visitors how his family put Valdagno on the map, and in the process built not just an international company, but a social infrastructure of schools and sports clubs in the town. But Mr Marzotto is less sentimental when it comes to talking about the group itself, and figures for the past 10 years show why he cannot afford to be anything other than ruthless in business. In that time, he has seen Marzotto's net profits grow from L10.1bn (Pounds 4.14m) in 1984 to L50.3bn in 1989, only for recession to cut the profit back to L10.2bn last year. The main difference between now and 1984 is that turnover reaches nearly L2,000bn annually, compared with L400bn 10 years ago. The really irritating part for Mr Marzotto is that this setback has come after a concerted strategy of expanding internationally, through acquisition and export, and in spite of the 1992 devaluation of the lira. More galling still for the charismatic chairman (although the whole world market for Marzotto products was comparatively depressed in 1993) is that one of the main reasons for the 74 per cent decline in profits was the poor performance of the group's Italian clothing activities, particularly in classic menswear. Of total turnover last year, L1,205bn - nearly 62 per cent - came from sales outside Italy. But overall Italian sales fell by 16 per cent, and in the clothing sector by 22.7 per cent. The only element which saved Marzotto from an even worse year was the performance of Hugo Boss, Germany's biggest menswear designer, which recorded a 73 per cent increase in its 1993 profits. Marzotto owns nearly 64 per cent of the voting stock of the German company. The 1992 and 1993 results were a serious disappointment for many analysts of the Italian market, who had expected Marzotto - as a big exporter in an internationally competitive sector of Italian business - to lead the way for all Italian exporters on the back of the currency devaluation. But the international downturn confounded those expectations, particularly in the clothing sector, which accounts for 65 per cent of group sales. As the group points out in its 1993 report and accounts, 'in countries (such as the US and UK) which experienced growth in GDP, consumption did not increase notably; while in those where production slipped, the decrease in consumption was several times greater than the reduction in income'. The group picked out Italy, Germany, France and Spain as particularly difficult markets in 1993. There was at least some benefit from the lira devaluation in the group's other sectors of cloth, threads and yarns. Thread and yarn sales outside Italy increased by 32 per cent, more than offsetting a slight fall in Italian turnover, and cloth sales increased by the same amount abroad, against a decrease of 12 per cent on the home market. Not surprisingly, the experience of 1992 and 1993 has only made Mr Marzotto more determined to reduce the share of the Italian market in Marzotto's results. He sees Italian sales coming down to 35 per cent of the group total in 1994 and to 30 per cent by the end of the decade. 'Italy will remain fundamentally firm, but the others will grow,' he says. According to Mr Marzotto the 1992 devaluation merely returned the Italian exporters to normal competitiveness, which had been lost during the difficult 1988-92 period when all Italian companies were fighting to keep costs down. Now at least there is a basis on which to start growing exports again, and the process has already started. Mr Marzotto confirms that export orders for 1994's winter season of clothing are up strongly, and he is even more confident about the company's ability to increase its share of the export market in the commodity cloth and thread sectors. That said, Marzotto's expansion by acquisition means it is increasingly becoming difficult to talk about 'exports', because Marzotto products are often manufactured outside Italy. Of the group's 10,131 employees, more than three-quarters are still in Italy, but during 1993 it was the home country which bore the brunt of job cuts (accounting for 923 out of the 1,260 jobs lost), and that process seems likely to continue. In spite of his family's past philanthropy, Mr Marzotto is hard-nosed about the group's duty to its Italian employees. 'We still have a responsibility towards Italy, but we have to look at costs,' he says. He points out that in the Czech republic, where Marzotto is buying a yarn manufacturer, productivity may be lower but labour costs are a tenth of those in Italy, while in Tunisia, where the group has another thread factory, they are 8 per cent of Italian costs. It comes as little surprise to learn that Hugo Boss's comparatively strong growth is partly based on a gradual move of its remaining German factories to the east. Does that mean that the days of the 'Made in Italy' marketing strategy - promoting Italian products for quality and design - may be numbered? 'For certain markets this marketing policy is still valid,' says Mr Marzotto, 'but we think it's our label which indicates quality now.' The next two years - as its export markets emerge from recession - are likely to provide the real answer to the question of whether Marzotto has benefited from the lira devaluation and its heavy emphasis on expansion abroad. Mr Marzotto is adamant that the aims of the company are now firmly embedded in the group's management structure. 'It's a mentality more than a structure: looking more towards the (rest of) the world. It's a mentality which affects top management and which is affecting all the levels of the group,' he says. One thing is certain, and that is that Pietro Marzotto himself is not constrained by any of the old chauvinistic concerns which kept markets and minds closed. Asked why he chooses to drive a luxury Japanese car, rather than a traditional Italian saloon, such as the ubiquitous Lancia, he says simply: 'We don't make anything to compare with this.'</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong route Sir, I note that Michael Thompson-Noel 'hurled himself out of London down the motorway to Solsbury Hill very close to Bath' to support the protest against the proposed by-pass (Hawks &amp; Handsaws, May 21/22). Surely those who are concerned about road building 'madness' should set an example by leaving their cars at home whenever possible. Why did he not use public transport from London to Bath - and then proceed the short distance from Bath by road?

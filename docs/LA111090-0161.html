			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER SPEAKS AGAINST ABORTION  </P> <P> Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) told a group of Cal State Fullerton  students Friday that the war on abortion can be won only through persistence  and courage.  </P> <P> "The (Berlin) Wall came down without any military action," Dannemeyer told some  60 students, most of them anti-abortion advocates. "It was done by human  beings, and was gradually broken away."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer's noon appearance was sponsored by the Students for Life Coalition,  a newly formed anti-abortion group on campus.  </P> <P> The congressman, a longtime outspoken critic of abortion, attacked liberals and  told the students there must be a return to a basic Judeo-Christian ethic  system that this country was founded on.  </P> <P> Kevin La Point, a 21-year-old senior psychology major who formed the campus  group in September, said he was pleased with the turnout.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a growing interest in our group," La Point said, adding that  the coalition plans to eventually hook up with other colleges in the Southland.  "So far, we've had about 195 people express an interest in the group."  </P> <P> La Point said he believes there are many students who are generally concerned  about the abortion issue but do not know where to turn. With speakers like  Dannemeyer, La Point said, the coalition should be able to get more exposure.  </P> <P> While most of the audience seemed to side with Dannemeyer's position on  abortion, some students attending thought he was out of step with the majority  of Americans.  </P> <P> "The man is one big contradiction," said Nathan Wells, a 20-year-old junior.  "He continually talks about how morally corrupt our society is becoming and how  we must protect the unborn. But in the same breath, he talks about our  justification in being in the Middle East."  </P> <P> Freshman Jane Feltz, 19, who sat quietly in the back during Dannemeyer's  speech, said she is having a lot of trouble grappling with the abortion issue.  </P> <P> "It's a very difficult situation," she said. "At times I think it should remain  legal. Then, I think it shouldn't. I just haven't made up my mind." ERIC  HAMILTON  </P></p>

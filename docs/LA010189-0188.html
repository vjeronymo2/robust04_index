			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1988 THE YEAR IN REVIEW;  </P> <P> GROWTH:  </P> <P> Our readers wrote letters throughout 1988 expressing their viewpoints on a  variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We  appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to  hearing from you in 1989.  </P> <P>  Let's look at growth in Orange County as if we all had a stake in tomorrow.  </P> <P> One way or another, our children are going to pay for the countless ills  brought about by unwise development. There's still time, however, to move into  the next century with style.  </P> <P> Let's work together to find ways to preserve open space and recreation land, to  develop affordable housing, to create jobs, to control traffic and to improve  the quality of life. Nuts to those of limited vision who would surrender our  future to past mistakes.  </P> <P> WILLIAM E. GANN  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

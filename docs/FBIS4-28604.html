			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social  Welfare held a news conference on 10 June on issues related to  war victims in Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics,  almost three million people were killed in the war including one  million soldiers from throughout the country and more than four  million people were wounded. The war also left 170,000 aged  homeless persons who now depend on the assistance of their  countrymen and social welfare centers. More than two million  people were affected by toxic chemicals and about 500,000  children were deformed.    Implementing and developing the nation's humanitarian  tradition, our party, state, and people have applied various  forms of assistance to help these war victims. However, this is  a wide-scale and very difficult, complicated task that cannot be  resolved by the Labor, War Invalids and Social Welfare Ministry  alone. It needs the special attention and assistance from the  entire society, genial persons, and humanitarian and charitable  organizations at home and abroad.    Assistance programs for these war victims should include  measures to restore and promote their physical fitness; help  relieve their difficulties in the daily life; and create  conditions for them to participate in various social activities,  especially in productive labor. This will enable them to live  peacefully with other people in society.</p>

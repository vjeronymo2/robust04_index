			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "First Step Toward Transparent Tender System"] </F>   [Text] The public distrust in biddings for public works  projects is deepening following a series of bribery scandals  involving general contractors. The United States, pointing out  that construction bid rigging symbolizes the closure of the  Japanese market, has pressured Japan to change the conventional  tender system.    On 18 January, the cabinet announced an action program aimed  at revamping the current tender system for the public works  projects after endorsing it. That day, Obayashi Construction  Company, a major general contractor, came under investigation  and it can be said that the investigation indicates anew the  need to revamp the current tender system for public works  projects.    The action program, that has been worked out on the basis of  Central Construction Deliberation Council recommendations, is a  summary of ways for overhauling the current tender system and at  the same time, an answer to the United States.    The action program's key point is that more than 4.5 million  SDR (special drawing rights: approximately 700 million yen)  worth of public works projects to be implemented directly by the  central government and more than 15 million SDR (approximately 2  billion yen) worth of public works projects to be implemented  directly by government-invested organizations, and prefectural  and municipal governments will be subject to an open competition  tender system.    About 20 percent of the public works projects, whose orders  are to be placed by the central government, will be open to  foreign firms. The action program, that is in tune with  international rules, has been accepted by the United States.    Although the action program will be applied to large-scale  public works projects for the time being, the government has  formally announced that it will adopt the open competition  tender system next year. The announcement is a step forward.    The United States, which has set 20 January as a deadline  for  slapping sanctions on Japan unless Japan takes satisfactory  measures to open its construction market, should now withdraw  the planned sanctions against Japan.    Needless to say, the action program is no more than a  framework to make biddings transparent and open the Japanese  construction market. To make the reform effective, it is  important for the central and local governments to work to  operate the action program fairly and flesh it out.    A majority of the public works projects implemented by the  central and local governments still remain subject to the  conventional designated bid system and it is necessary to take  actions to improve the system.    There is no need to point out that the construction  community  should drastically reform their consciousness to rid them of the  traditional bid rigging structure. It is also indispensable to  carry out political reform and urge bureaucrats to strictly  restrain from getting jobs in construction, firms that they  oversee. The Fair Trade Commission has the responsibility to  rigorously enforce the Antimonopoly Law.    We hope that U.S. and other foreign firms will work to gain  access to the Japanese construction market by fully using a new  tender system. Free competition will serve to hold down the  costs of Japan's public works projects that are higher than  those in other nations.    U.S. firms, which are ahead of other foreign firms in such  software as designing and consultants, are interested in gaining  access to them. The action program makes it mandatory that the  central government and public corporations planning to implement  more than 450,000 SDR worth of public works projects, and local  governments planning to implement more than 1.5 million SDR  worth of public works projects, offer an opening tender for  designs and consultants.    The number of orders for the designing and consultants will  be very limited because in Japan, government offices in charge  of placing the orders are staffed with many technocrats who are  assigned to design and manage the public works projects. This  phenomenon has forced the technocrats to seek free technical  know-how from the private sector, thereby paving the way for  them to forge a collusive relationship.    Now that the private sector has come to have better  technology than the government has in many areas, the government  should leave the software area to competition among firms. This  is compatible with the administrative reform policy and will  bring about the effect of adopting state-of-art technology for  the public works projects.    Construction friction between Japan and the United States  will undoubtedly recur unless the Construction Ministry  transforms itself from the current business ministry into a  policymaking ministry. The ministry should reform its function  on its own, not by external pressure.</p>

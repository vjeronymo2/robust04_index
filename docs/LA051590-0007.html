			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley's water rationing proposal victimizes the poor. The poor who live  in old homes or tenements with deteriorating plumbing have less control over  their water usage than anyone else.  </P> <P> The poor will in effect end up paying for water usage by households better able  to control water usage, households with swimming pools, with expansive grounds,  with funds available to repair plumbing. In other words, the mayor is asking  the poor to subsidize water usage by the rich. The mayor's rationing exemption  for households with new swimming pools is particularly outrageous.  </P> <P> While the rationing proposal might work in a city composed mainly of  middle-class and upper-class households, the vast majority of households here  now have annual incomes less than $25,000. Someone might hint to Bradley that  declining city services and increases in crime and pollution have caused  middle-class families to flee.  </P> <P> DAVID D. MILLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

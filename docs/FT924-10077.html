			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Letter: Swedish example of way to run open government Sir, You have frequently reported on rising distrust of the Eurocrats in Brussels among the citizens of EC countries. The Swedish government might have a valuable contribution to make in the efforts to improve the communication between the EC citizens and the EC governing bodies. In Sweden all government acts are made public unless specifically stamped 'secret'. And the label 'secret' may only be applied to specific sections of a document, containing information regarding commercial secrets, defence secrets and matters concerning personal integrity of individuals. This, among other things, means that the Swedish public and Swedish journalists can walk into any government agency and demand to see today's mail or to look at any specific act kept in the agency. This principle of public acts might seem shocking to many politicians and bureaucrats who are used to the opposite principle  - that all public acts are kept secret unless specifically made public. But I would point out that the system has worked well for 200 years and has greatly contributed to making Swedish government virtually free of corruption.

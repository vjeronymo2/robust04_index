			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Housing where it is most needed Sir, Your leader, 'A new policy for housing' (November 23), raises a number of points. The provision of Pounds 750m will undoubtedly help a good many homeless families, while at the same time removing 20,000 empty properties from the saturated housing market. Although it might not be enough, it is at least a start and is evidence that the government is taking the problems seriously. But, if the Pounds 750m is to be used effectively, it must be channelled to the areas which need it most - that is, those with the highest levels of repossessions and households with negative equity. The relaxation of the restrictions on council spending of their capital receipts, while welcome in principle, would have produced quicker results if selected areas had been allowed to spend part of their existing receipts. As things stand, it is difficult to see local authorities being able to raise much revenue through council house sales between now and December 1993. While not all council housing is as poor as your leader implies, you are right to suggest that people who cannot afford (or do not wish) to buy should be able to turn to the private rented sector as a realistic alternative. What is needed is all-party political support for measures to encourage banks, building societies and other institutions to take on the role of landlords. An end to the current tax discrimination and the introduction of worthwhile financial incentives would work wonders in this respect.

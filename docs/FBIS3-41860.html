A memorandum submitted  to a representative of the high commission said the best way to  resolve the dispute over Kashmir is through direct discussions  between the governments of India and Pakistan as envisaged under  the Simla Agreement. The Youth Congress-I also urged Pakistan  to refrain from making provocative statements in future if it  wishes to maintain peace in South Asia. Islamabad should also  stop interfering in India's internal affairs, the memorandum  said.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Media mogul Ted Turner and five other former America's Cup skippers have asked  New York's highest court to rule against the San Diego Yacht Club, which won  the sailing race with a catamaran.  </P> <P> Turner and the other skippers filed papers with the New York Court of Appeals,  asking to join a friend-of-the-court brief filed last month by seven other  former skippers.  </P> <P> Arguments in a challenge brought by New Zealand's Mercury Bay Yacht Club, which  lost the 1988 race, are scheduled for next month. Under century-old rules, the  court is the final arbiter of disputes over the America's Cup.  </P> <P> At issue is the catamaran captained by Dennis Conner for the San Diego Yacht  Club, which successfully defended the America's Cup in 1988. The challengers in  that race, the Mercury Bay Yacht Club of New Zealand, have argued that the  vessel gave the Americans an unfair advantage and should have been  disqualified. Several yacht clubs have also come out in support of the New  Zealand club.  </P></p>

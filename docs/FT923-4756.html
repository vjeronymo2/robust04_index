			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: US Treasury to test single price auction THE US Treasury plans an immediate start to its experiment with single price bond auctions with this month's auction of two and five-year notes. The Treasury plans a year-long test of the single price auction formula, replacing its current multiple price system for all monthly sales of the two and five-year notes. Under the current auction format, the Treasury determines a cut-off price at which it can sell all the securities it put up for auction, but successful bidders must pay the price specified in their bids. With the single price formula, the Treasury will determine a cut-off price in the same way, but all successful bidders will pay this price. Mr Jerome Powell, undersecretary for finance at the Treasury, said academic research suggested this should result in more competitive bidding and should therefore reduce the US government's borrowing costs. 'You are letting people pay a lower price than they bid or get a higher yield than they bid, which would appear to cost us money. On the other hand, everyone bids more aggressively,' Mr Powell said. Treasury officials argue that securities buyers have an incentive under the current system to aim for the market consensus. This leads many buyers to bid through the big dealers who have the most information about the market, because if they bid too high they will end up owning bonds or notes for which they have paid more than the market price - the winner's curse. 'The theory is that people would bid more aggressively because no-one would suffer from this winner's curse,' Mr Powell said. The Treasury plans to judge the success of the single price experiment at reducing its borrowing costs by comparing the volume of bids with the volume of securities auctioned, and the auction yield with the yield of the same securities in the 'when-issued' market before the auction takes place. It will also examine the number of competitive bidders, the concentration of awards with certain firms and the yield dispersion of accepted bids. Dealers expect the Treasury to sell around Dollars 15bn of two-year notes and Dollars 10.5bn of five-year notes, the same volume as last month, at the first single price auction in three weeks' time.</p>

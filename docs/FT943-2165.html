			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Swedish Liberals await a call Mr Bengt Westerberg, the leader of Sweden's Liberal party, said last night that he had received a party mandate to negotiate with the Social Democrats, the winners of Sunday's general election, over a possible coalition. But he thought it was more likely that the Social Democrats, who fell just 13 seats short of a majority in the 349-seat parliament, would form a minority government. A coalition between the Social Democrats and the Liberals would be warmly welcomed by financial markets and Swedish business because they believe it would bring tough action to curb the country's budget deficit. However, political analysts say the weak showing of the Liberals in Sunday's election, when they lost 20 per cent of their votes, makes the alliance unlikely. Yesterday Mr Ingvar Carlsson, prime-minister elect, delayed until today an announcement on his efforts to form a government following preliminary contact with the leaders of the other parties. The uncertain political situation continued to weigh on the markets, with bond yields edging higher and the Swedish krona and shares both losing ground.</p>

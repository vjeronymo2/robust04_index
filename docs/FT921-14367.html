			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Spain hits target Spanish inflation rose just 0.1 per cent in December to bring accumulated inflation for the year to 5.5 per cent - the government's target, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. The figure means inflation is down a full point compared with the end of 1990. The Madrid stock market rose sharply despite the fact that underlying inflation for the year rose slightly.</p>

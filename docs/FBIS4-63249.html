			<p>BFN     [Text] The new Crimean Supreme Council has taken yet  another step toward deterioration of relations with official  Kiev. At its session yesterday, the Crimean legislature  approved, with a majority of votes, the nomination of General  Lepikhov, who was nominated by [Crimean] President Yuriy  Meshkov, as chief of the Crimean Security Service. In this way,  it ignored the decree issued by Ukrainian President Kravchuk  reorganizing the Crimean Republic Security Service and the  Ukrainian Security Service [SBU] General Department in the  Crimea. The SBU press service in Kiev emphasizes that the main  goal of the reorganization is to increase centralization of the  service leadership and the effectiveness of its fight against  organized crime in the Crimea, where it is assuming more and  more dangerous forms.    Through the NOVYNY television and radio agency, the press  service also reports that Crimean President Meshkov has  practically ignored a wire sent to him by SBU Chief Yevhen  Marchuk. The wire informs him that the SBU General Department  in the Crimea, established in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's  decree, shall remain unchanged, in terms of its function, staff,  and number.    The press service also reports that SBU First Deputy Chief  Valeriy Malikov is currently in Simferopol with a group of SBU  workers. They are preparing materials concerning the fight  against organized crime in the Crimea, which will be examined at  the next meeting of the SBU Collegium.</p>

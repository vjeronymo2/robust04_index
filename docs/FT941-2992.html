			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Negotiations on entry to WTO to be speeded up Trade negotiators in Geneva yesterday reached broad agreement on two important procedural decisions to be taken by ministers next month in Marrakesh when they meet to sign the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation accords. The first aims to speed up negotiations with countries which, for one reason or another, will not automatically qualify for membership of the World Trade Organisation, the powerful new world trade body that will supersede the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. The draft decision would allow negotiations on WTO membership to start immediately after the Marrakesh meeting, without waiting for the organisation to be established. Countries affected fall into four categories: China and Algeria, which participated fully in the Round but are still negotiating Gatt membership; some less-developed nations which have not yet submitted tariff and services schedules; some Gatt members which joined too late to take a full part in the Round; and countries joining Gatt after the Marrakesh signings but before the WTO comes into force, probably next January. The second draft decision establishes a WTO preparatory committee with widely drawn terms of reference to bridge the transition between the Marrakesh meeting and the WTO's entry into force. The committee, open to all countries eligible to be WTO founder members, would handle administrative, financial and procedural matters relating to the future WTO, including accessions. It would also draft terms of reference for WTO subsidiary bodies and launch the work programme already agreed in the Uruguay Round, for instance on some aspects of trade in services, and the links between trade and the environment. Still to be decided, and highly controversial, is whether the preparatory committee is able to discuss other suggestions for future work by the WTO. The US and some European countries want worker rights to go on the WTO agenda. However, this is being vigorously opposed by many developing nations.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Bank moves in support of Canadian Dollars - Market Reaction THE Bank of Canada intervened to support the Canadian dollar yesterday as it fell sharply following the results of the general election and worries about a resurgence of separatism. The central bank was seen selling US dollars and buying a volatile Canadian currency as the latter initially fell more than 2 cents against its US counterpart to hit a low of CDollars 1.326. The Canadian dollar had weakened on electoral uncertainty but picked up just before the result on the belief that a strong Liberal government was better than a weak conservative one. The Canadian currency steadied later to close in Toronto at CDollars 1.3118 to the US dollar. In contrast equities were less volatile with the TSE 300 index gaining 31.9 at 4,187.1 in moderate trading. On Wall Street, economists were surprised by the extent of the Conservative defeat. 'The joke around here is that it was the greatest defeat of any standing government in the post-Babylonian era,' said Mr Bruce Kasman, senior international economist with Morgan Stanley in New York. 'This wasn't just a defeat for the Conservatives,' said another analyst. 'It was a total disappearance.' But opinions differed on the impact of the Liberal victory on Canadian financial markets, mainly because of uncertainty about the new Liberal government's economy policy. Mr William Sterling, international economist with Merrill Lynch, said that if Liberal leader Mr Jean Chretien 'goes for growth' with some form of fiscal stimulus, Canadian bond and currency markets could suffer because of the implications such a policy would have for the CDollars 35.5bn federal deficit. Economists say a lot depends on whether ratings agencies downgrade Canadian government debt at the first sign of an expansionary fiscal policy. 'The view in the markets is that the rating agencies are going to have quite a bit of influence on how much latitude the incoming government has,' said Mr Sterling. As for US investors' view of Canadian markets, Mr Kasman said: 'Investors here like the high yields relative to the US, but there is concern about the role of the Bloc Quebecois in parliament, and concern about regional framgmentation of the Canadian political scene.' Mr Kasman believes the main risk in terms of financial markets is a declining Canadian dollar. 'Investors know the Bank of Canada is already in the mode of trying to ease interest rates, and is willing to accept the price.' That price is a further depreciation in the Canadian dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray sent his letter of  resignation to the president today. By doing so, he expressed  his disagreement with the procedure for appointing Nikolay  Yegorov, the new minister for affairs of nationalities. We  would like to recall that there were no consultations with  Shakhray, although he as the vice premier was in charge of  national issues.    However, Moscow's political circles have a different  explanation on the reasons for the resignation. Of late  Shakhray's department was overseeing Russia's northern regions,  for whose support credits amounting to several trillion rubles  were allocated. Observers believe that the true reasons for the  resignation are disagreements in the Russian leadership on who  will be sharing out these credits, and how this will be done.</p>

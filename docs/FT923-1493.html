			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: USG in deal over debt restructuring USG, the parent company of US Gypsum, yesterday announced it had reached agreement in principle with two of its three creditor groups on a debt restructuring plan which would involve it making a 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Under a pre-packaged scheme, a company reaches agreement on a restructuring with its creditors before filing for bankruptcy, minimising the time it spends under the authority of the court. USG's filing would only involve the parent company with no effect on trade creditors of its operating subsidiaries or the asbestos health claims against US Gypsum. USG, which ran into trouble after loading up with debt to fend off a 1988 takeover, said it had agreed with its senior bondholders' committee and agents of its banks on a restructuring which would reduce the face value of its debt from Dollars 2.7bn to Dollars 1.6bn. Some 82 per cent of the equity would be owned by holders of 13 1/4 per cent senior subordinated bonds, whose creditor committee has accepted the plan. Some 15 per cent would be held by the junior creditors, who have rejected the scheme.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Delors urges unity; keeps quiet on union DELIVERING a traditional pre-summit appeal for European unity, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, yesterday made an important tactical decision. He did not mention the word 'Maastricht'. Mr Delors, who received an honorary degree yesterday from the vice chancellor of Edinburgh University, Sir David Smith, used his acceptance address to call for an 'organised and caring' Community which would be more than merely a free trade area. Dressed in a red gown and looking less like a would-be Emperor of Europe than a slightly abashed Meistersinger, Mr Delors admitted the EC was going through a period of doom and gloom. He urged the Community to look beyond its ups and downs and create unity in diversity. Although he praised the single European market, he avoided referring to the Maastricht treaty on European union.</p>

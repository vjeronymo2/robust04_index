			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy by </F> Aleksandr Kabanov; place and date not given: "Volodymyr  Lanovyy: `When There Is No Responsibility, There Is No Democracy  Either...'"; from the "Current Interview" feature]    [Text] [Kabanov] How do you envision the mechanism for  people's deputies' responsibility before their voters?    [Lanovyy] No such strict mechanism exists in Ukraine, and  this means, no matter how sad it seems to be, that there is no  democracy. In the United States, for example, there are 18  levels of state officials' responsibility for various crimes and  misdemeanors. Have you ever seen a report by our finance  minister on his work performed over the last six months? Under  current political and economic circumstances, he simply must  regularly explain how much of the state money is spent and for  what. He must provide reports every month, and he must bear the  responsibility for money resources working for nationwide  interests, not for the interests of certain social groups.    [Kabanov] How do you assess your chances for victory in the  upcoming elections?    [Lanovyy] I would like to appeal to the people: Look who  has been leading you, and what these activists have achieved?  Do you trust current President Leonid Kravchuk, former Supreme  Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, or former Prime Minister Leonid  Kuchma? They had, in my opinion, every opportunity to introduce  positive reforms.    I worked with them pursuing one goal -- to reform the  Ukrainian economy as quickly as possible -- but apparently, I  worked too fast -- I stepped on the throat of their personal  desires and aspirations. As you recall, I was removed...    [Kabanov] In your opinion, are any of the other candidates  for the presidential chair in a better situation than Parliament  Speaker Oleksandr Moroz regarding propagandizing populist ideas?    [Lanovyy] As a matter of fact, having become speaker,  Oleksandr Moroz is in the most convenient situation, even  compared with the current president. He now has the rostrum,  the microphone, and television -- all means to influence a  sufficient number of voters.    [Kabanov] What is your opinion on the Crimean issue?    [Lanovyy] In terms of strategy, the Crimea must remain  within Ukraine. They want to separate? They want to obtain the  status of an independent state? This will not take place. Let  them take advantage of any liberties, but the Crimean parliament  must work in accordance with the Ukrainian Supreme Council  resolutions. I am for a peaceful resolution to this issue, by  means of agreement.    [Kabanov] How do you assess the activities of the Ukrainian  National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA-UNSO]?    [Lanovyy] When I was reading UNA-UNSO documents, the  position presented in them seemed very attractive to me.  Although I accept the actions of UNSO units in Georgia, similar  actions should be planned at the state level without  amateurishness. I respect both left- and right-wing forces for  their confidence and willingness to act. Yet, it would be  better if these forces agreed on one point -- on the need to  work for the future and real reforms in our state. UNA-UNSO, as  well as other public and political organizations, has the right  to exist within the framework of the law. However, I do not  support the methods, with the help of which the aforementioned  organizations have been looking for self-affirmation.    [Kabanov] Who should have the initiative in all  transformations within society, the president or the parliament?    [Lanovyy] The presidential authority has great powers in  Ukraine. The president can make legislative decisions, he can  even change the system of local administration. The parliament  is waiting for the president's initiation, his program for  socioeconomic reforms, outline of strategy for joint actions,  and consolidation of all forces and means to resolve nationwide  problems. The current president does not have any initiative.  Here is a recent example: Kravchuk has recently stated that we  do not have a law on presidency, and it therefore makes no sense  to hold presidential elections. But why do we not have such a  law? Who, if not Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] himself, should  display initiative in the adoption of such a law?    [Kabanov] How do you assess the current economic situation?    [Lanovyy] Seventy percent of Ukrainian enterprises are  currently standing idle. The government claims that there is  stabilization. The rights to payments and credits have been  restricted. This is why there is no money for trade. Nobody  buys anything. Real stabilization of prices is maintained by  balancing supply and demand through either an increase in the  volume of production (either domestic production, or imports),  or structural redistribution (surplus production in one sector  is compensated by selling the overstock abroad and importing  scarce products). In Ukraine, apparent stabilization has been  achieved by the artificial damming of trade.    Someone once told me a very apropriate analogy: I want to  pull you out of water because you are drowning. I throw a noose  over your neck and pull. I will eventually pull you out of the  water, but will this do you any good? Prices in Ukraine have  been bridled in such a way that everybody will eventually die.  Thus, all the talk about stabilization in groundless. As a  matter of fact, another collapse and disorder is coming.</p>

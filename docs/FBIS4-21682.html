			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 3 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen on Saturday [2 April] lauded a mildly worded UN  Security Council statement on the North Korean nuclear standoff,  saying it helped to ease tension on the Korean peninsula.    "The adoption of a presidential statement focusing on  dialogue has helped to ease tension and gives the countries and  organizations concerned some time leeway," Qian told a  delegation of Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP is  the largest group in Japan's seven-party coalition.    After one week of diplomatic bargaining with China, which  firmly opposed the adoption of any resolution against its  longtime ally North Korea, the 15-member Security Council on  Thursday issued a nonbinding presidential statement urging  Pyongyang to allow the completion of international inspections  of its nuclear facilities.    The statement did not include a threat of sanctions should  North Korea continue to refuse the inspections, but said  "further Security Council consideration will take place if  necessary in order to achieve full implementation" of nuclear  safeguards Pyongyang signed with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    Noting that the statement has nonbinding character, Qian  said, however, he hopes "that it can be avoided that such a  situation occurs."    He suggested that the IAEA explain to Pyongyang why  inspections carried out over two weeks in March are considered  inadequate to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear  material for weapon purposes.    Pyongyang, while maintaining that its nuclear program serves  strictly civilian purposes, contends it fully complied with the  IAEA inspection demands.    The SDP delegation headed by Issei Inoue arrived on Friday  for talks with Chinese leaders and representatives of the  Chinese Communist Party (CCP).    In a meeting with Li Shuzheng, head of the International  Liaison Department of the party's Central Committee, on Friday  both sides agreed to dispatch another SDP delegation to China in  mid-May to mark the 10th anniversary of relations between their  parties, SDP officials said.</p>

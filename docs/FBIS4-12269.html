			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Singer] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Some 500 IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] reserve officers, most of whom are still on active  reserve duty, yesterday sent the prime minister a petition,  declaring: "Eretz Yisra'el belongs to the Jewish people, and you  have no right to give it away to strangers! 'Arafat is no  better than a war criminal! Terror must not be rewarded!"    The reserve officers -- ranking from lieutenant to brigadier  general -- signed a petition initiated by Aharay [Follow Me], a  reserve officers movement opposing the agreement with the PLO.  Among the signatories are Reserve Brigadier Generals Amatzya Hen  and David Hago'el.    The letter further states: "All our lives, we fought for our  homeland, we went to battle, guarded the border, and lost  friends while defending our homeland. By giving away parts of  the homeland to the murderers of women and children and shaking  hands that are covered in blood, you are telling us that our war  was in vain. Our comrades fell in vain, and the battle order  was a mistake, because it could have been solved by surrender  and concessions to the aggressor and the murderer.    "We are opposed to this terrible move, which leads to  complete surrender, to an indefensible country, and the loss of  all moral values, as well as the loss of our capital of  Jerusalem the streets of which are already decorated with PLO  flags," the reserve officers write.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Framlington Russian fund Framlington, the London-based investment manager, is launching the first ever quoted Russian investment fund. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, will be its chairman. Its portfolio will consist mainly of stakes in small to medium-sized joint ventures between Russian and western companies. It has already targeted six such ventures in food processing, high technology such as space and electronics, and consumer goods such as textiles. Other investments are likely in companies which service the Russian oil and mining industries. The fund will buy stakes averaging 20 per cent, worth typically between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 4m. Up to Dollars 75m (Pounds 50.3m) of the fund's shares will be placed with institutions in the UK, continental Europe and North America. Subscriptions to the closed-end, Luxembourg-regulated fund will close in mid-December prior to share listing in Luxembourg and London. The minimum stake is Dollars 100,000. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is taking a Dollars 16m slice, and the International Finance Corp is expected to take Dollars 8m. Mr Connell Gallagher, Framlington's Russian investment analyst, forecasts that the value of the fund's investments will grow by more than 30 per cent a year over 10 years. As well as political and economic risks, the prospectus warns institutions that the fund's investments may be illiquid due to the lack of an established Russian securities market. This may make it hard for the fund to realise its full net asset value. Mr Boris Jordan, Credit Suisse First Boston's Moscow-based director, says the main risk of investing in Russia is the absence of a proper legal system to protect shareholders' rights. However, CSFB is positive about the fund's prospects: 'Russia is one of the world's largest emerging economies,' says Mr Jordan. 'The sectors targeted by the fund will be quite heavily invested over the next year, and most of the interesting opportunities will quickly disappear.' Brokers to the fund are Smith New Court, Bank Austria, and CCF Elysees Bourse, a division of Credit Commercial de France, the French bank which is Framlington's majority shareholder.</p>

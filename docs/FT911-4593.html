			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Living standards found less costly FAMILIES had to spend less in February this year than in August 1990 to maintain the same living standards, according to a survey published today. The biannual cost-of-living survey for March by the Reward Group, an employment consultancy, was carried out before the Budget. The survey therefore excludes the effects of the VAT increase and the poll tax reduction. Its measure of 'required income' to maintain unchanged living standards includes the cost of housing and National Insurance. 'Over the last six months, required incomes have actually fallen, albeit by a nominal 0.4 per cent, and have only risen by 3.1 per cent over the last 12 months,' the survey says. That adds an extra dimension to official inflation data which this week suggested that underlying inflation remained troublesome in spite of falls in the headline rate measured by the retail prices index. The mortgage rate last month was 14.5 per cent, exactly the same as the rate a year ago, so that the Reward's Group's cost-of-living rate is relatively undistorted by housing costs. The costs of goods and services, the survey suggests, has risen by 3.7 per cent during the past six months, and by 7.9 per cent during the last 12 months. According to the all-items RPI, inflation was rising at an annual rate of 8.2 per cent in March. The Reward Group also finds that the 'corner has been turned' on house prices, which are not falling as fast as they were six months ago. The average price of houses for sale is falling at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent in February, after 6.1 per cent in August. House prices in the South West are rising fastest, with more modest recoveries reported in East Anglia, the south-east and Greater London. UK regional cost of living.

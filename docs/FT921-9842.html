			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Major shareholders win the day at Conroy Petroleum MR RICHARD Conroy, founder and chairman of the Irish exploration group Conroy Petroleum and Natural Resources, was voted off the board along with the other nine directors at a packed nine-hour extraordinary meeting in Dublin. The vote went about 60:40 against Mr Conroy, although around 90 per cent of the small shareholders backed the existing board. A new eight-man board under the control of the company's two major shareholders takes over. The shareholders, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a financial offshoot of Canada's Corona International, have a combined holding of 43.35 per cent. The new board announced that it was to begin 'a detailed assessment of the company's operations immediately,' and that Mr Graham Mascall, managing director of Outokumpu, and Mr Paul Carroll, a director of Dundee, would be temporary joint chairmen until 'an independent Irish chairman' was appointed. Hostility to Mr Conroy first surfaced in 1990 when the companies' two nominee directors, one of whom was Mr Mascall, resigned over disagreements on ore marketing arrangements for the chief asset - the 6m ton zinc/lead orebody at Galmoy, 70 miles south-west of Dublin. Mr Conroy objected to an Outokumpu proposal giving it sole and exclusive marketing rights to the ore. The boardroom coup was precipitated though by Conroy's IPounds 7.7m share exchange acquisition last year of Atlantic Resources, an Irish oil/gas exploration company. The two main shareholders argued that this was overpriced, was diverting Conroy's attention from developing Galmoy, and were clearly angered by what they saw as Mr Conroy's effort to dilute their holding in the company. Mr Conroy has remained adamant, though, that the Atlantic deal 'was good value', creating total oil and gas assets which he estimated 'at between IPounds 9m and IPounds 10m'. The new board is likely to sell off Conroy's oil and gas assets and to focus efforts on Galmoy, which would dovetail better with Outokumpu's other zinc mining interests in Ireland. These are the Tara mine at Navan, western Europe's biggest zinc mine, and its 24 per cent stake in the 13.5m ton zinc/lead deposit at Lisheen, close to Galmoy. At the meeting, Mr Mascall said it would be the intention to bring Galmoy into production 'as soon as possible'. Mr Conroy said: 'I am fully supportive of that. That is what I have been trying to do'. Cost of developing Galmoy is put at some IPounds 65m, once planning permission is approved. When in production the mine should be one of the lowest cost producers in the world.</p>

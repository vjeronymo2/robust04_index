			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Sure, the traffic -- and the pace of life in general -- is becoming more hectic  here. Luckily, there's an antidote. This appears to be the massage capital of  the world, judging from a survey of LA Weekly.  </P> <P> The newspaper carries classified ads for Russian massage, holistic massage,  hypnotic massage (no nude or topless), French massage, student massage, Asian  massage, German massage, Swedish massage, and a home-grown version, "California  Swedish massage" (no doubt featuring an avocado spread on the customer's body).  </P> <P> There's even Australian massage.  </P> <P> G'day!  </P> <P> A ski resort's sign on U.S. 395 near Lone Pine contends: "We have more flakes  than Venice Beach."  </P> <P> Even in the summer?  </P> <P> The Medflies keep coming back -- their return is less romantic than the  swallows' -- but Chris Norby has no plans to update his 8-year-old  Monopoly-like Medfly Game.  </P> <P> "It's a little outdated now," acknowledged Norby, a Fullerton city councilman.  "It's got people like (former Gov.) Jerry Brown, Orson Welles and (former Lt.  Gov.) Mike Curb."  </P> <P> Norby says he sold "a couple thousand" copies of the board game, which was  "more political satire than a kids' game."  </P> <P> Some of its "Crop Cards," similar to Monopoly's "Chance" and "Community Chest"  cards, still seem current though.  </P> <P> For instance:  </P> <P> * "Medfly attacks Telly Savalas after mistaking him for a Honeydew melon."  </P> <P> * "Malibu health food store begins selling carob-coated Medflies as gourmet  delicacies."  </P> <P> Dan Dektar reports that the slowing drivers who jammed up the Valley's freeways  the other day to watch the last flight of Lockheed's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane  weren't alone. Dektar spotted a Southern Pacific freight train that had  stopped, with the engineer leaning his head out the window to take a gander.  </P> <P> About 3,147 former pieces of evidence arrived at the Los Angeles Regional Food  Bank on Thursday, which was good news for the needy.  </P> <P> The frozen delicacies were confiscated California spiny lobsters donated by the  state Department of Fish and Game to the bank, which accepts private and public  food donations and distributes them to 475 agencies in the county.  </P> <P> Seized in August, 1988, because they were smaller than the legal limit, the  costly crustaceans remained in cold storage as evidence against the fish  companies that bought them. No jurors or lawyers handled the goods during the  judicial proceedings, by the way. They were viewed from a distance.  </P> <P> Speaking of good news, Ethel Bruce of North Hollywood has a message for an old  friend, Alyse McLaughlin. Bruce was saddened to read that McLaughlin was one of  the people whose residence was damaged in the Westwood fire.  </P> <P> Bruce phoned The Times to say: "If she lost her personal things, I want her to  know that I have 17 years of Christmas cards that contain photos of her family  from the 1940s through the 1960s. I'd be only too happy to give them to her."  </P> <P> Employees at Cal State Northridge are officially celebrating Abraham Lincoln's  birthday today. No, it's not a reflection on the school's history department.  </P> <P> This bit of revisionism stems from the fact that there are no classes this week  and that many employees take those days off anyhow. So the state universities  rescheduled several holidays, including the 16th President's birth, for the  last week. Honest Abe.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a group of local history buffs excitedly report that they've formed  the Millard Fillmore Bicentennial Commission. They're planning what surely will  be a giant nationwide celebration of the 200th anniversary of the 13th  President's birth.  </P> <P> As every Fillmore fan knows, the big day will be Jan. 7, 2000.  </P> <P> Theme of the celebration, according to Panorama City pediatrician Hal Bass,  will be:  </P> <P> "A New Millennium and Millard, Too."  </P> <P> Let's hope Cal State Northridge doesn't gum up the works by celebrating it in  December of 1999.  </P></p>

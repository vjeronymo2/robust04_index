			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LOPEZ SHOOTS FINAL-ROUND 66, WINS LPGA TITLE  </P> <P> At the start of Sunday's final round of the LPGA Championship at Mason, Ohio,  Ayako Okamoto held a two-stroke lead in her pursuit to win her first major  title on the women's tour.  </P> <P> But she was anything but confident considering she had fallen victim to golf's  fickleness on past occasions.  </P> <P> Her worse fears were realized once again when Nancy Lopez won her third LPGA  Championship -- all at the Jack Nicklaus Sports Center Grizzly Course -- with a  final-round six-under-par 66, overtaking Okamoto on the final eight holes to  win by three shots.  </P> <P> The victory was the 40th of Lopez' 13-year professional career.  </P> <P> "Nancy is No. 1. . . . " Okamoto said.  </P> <P> Okamoto, who has been in or near the lead in the final round of the last five  LPGA Championships, said she was not surprised to be overtaken.  </P> <P> "I knew that Nancy -- or somebody -- would catch up after the turn," she said.  "A one- or two-stroke lead isn't much over those players."  </P> <P> Lopez has won more than $157,000 on the Jack Nicklaus Sports Center course in  her 11 LPGA Championships. She lived on the course for two years.  </P> <P> "It's hard to compare them," she said of her three LPGA victories. "All have  been special for me. The first year (as a rookie in 1978), being so young,  winning with my dad here and all of that pressure at such a young age -- it  meant a lot."  </P> <P> Lopez finished at 14-under-par 274 after earlier rounds of 71, 69 and 68. Her  closing 66 was the low round of the day.  </P> <P> The victory was Lopez' fifth top-10 finish in the LPGA Championship. It was her  first victory of 1989 and made her the top money-winner with more than  $279,000. She has finished in the top three in eight of her 10 tournaments this  year.  </P> <P> Okamoto's closing 71 gave her a 277 total.  </P> <P> Susan Sanders, a non-winner in five years on the tour, closed with a 68 to  finish third at 278.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley, who won the LPGA Championship in 1986, shot a 73 for 283, tied  with non-winner Allison Finney.  </P> <P> Jane Geddes, the 1987 LPGA Championship winner, was at 284 with a final-round  71. Patty Sheehan closed with a 78 for 285.  </P> <P> Ian Baker-Finch of Australia was given breathing room by the double bogey that  struck down Tim Simpson on the 14th hole and cruised to a four-stroke victory  in the Colonial National Invitation tournament at Ft. Worth, Tex.  </P> <P> Baker-Finch needed only a closing round of par 70 to become the first  wire-to-wire winner on the PGA Tour this year.  </P> <P> David Edwards, nine strokes back when play began, took second with a 65 for a  274 total, and Simpson, one stroke closer when play started, finished with a 68  for 276 and was tied for third with South African David Frost, who had a  closing 69.  </P> <P> Bob Charles shot a five-under-par 65 to defend his title in the $300,000  Commemorative Seniors tournament, breaking his tournament record with a  17-under-par 193 total for 54 holes.  </P> <P> Charles, who had a four-stroke lead entering play Sunday, saw it narrowed to  two by Don Bies when he bogeyed the par-4 eighth hole. He recovered to win by  five shots.  </P> <P> It was Charles' third tour victory this year. He has earned $45,000 to boost  his 1989 earnings to $184,137.  </P> <P> Holly Hartley of Oceanside shot a one-under-par 71 and Taiwan's Huang Bie-shyun  slumped to a 76 to give Hartley a two-stroke victory in the Chukyo  TV-Bridgestone tournament at Kasugai, Japan.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications which are complete and responsive may be subjected to a preliminary evaluation by reviewers from the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC) to determine if the application is of sufficient technical and scientific merit to warrant further review; the CDC will withdraw from further consideration applications judged to be noncompetitive and promptly notify the principal investigator/program director and the official signing for the applicant organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those applications judged to be competitive will be further evaluated by a dual review process. The primary review will be a peer evaluation (IRGRC) of the scientific and technical merit of the application. The final review will be conducted by the CDC Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC), which will consider the results of the peer review together with program need and relevance. Funding decisions will be made by the Director, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), based on merit and priority score ranking by the IRGRC, program review by the ACIPC, and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Review by the Injury Research Grants Review Committee (IRGRC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Peer review of ICRC grant applications will be conducted by the IRGRC, which may recommend the application for further consideration or not for further consideration. Site visits will be a part of this process for recompeting ICRC's. Reverse site visits may be a part of this process for new applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factors to be considered by IRGRC include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The specific aims of the application, e.g., the long-term objectives and intended accomplishments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The scientific and technical merit of the overall application, including the significance and originality (e.g., new topic, new method, new approach in a new population, or advancing understanding of the problem) of the proposed research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The extent to which the evaluation plan will allow for the measurement of progress toward the achievement of stated objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Qualifications, adequacy, and appropriateness of personnel to accomplish the proposed activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The soundness of the proposed budget in terms of adequacy of resources and their allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The appropriateness (e.g., responsiveness, quality, and quantity) of consultation, technical assistance, and training in identifying, implementing, and/or evaluating intervention/control measures that will be provided to public and private agencies and institutions, with emphasis on State and local health departments, as evidenced by letters detailing the nature and extent of this commitment and collaboration. Specific letters of support or understanding from appropriate governmental bodies must be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Evidence of other public and private financial support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Progress thus far made as detailed in the application if the applicant is submitting a competitive renewal application. Documented success examples include: development of pilot projects; completion of high quality research projects; publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific and technical journals; number of professionals trained; provision of consultation and technical assistance; integration of disciplines; translation of research into implementation; impact on injury control outcomes including legislation/regulation, treatment, and behavior modification interventions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review by CDC Advisory Committee for Injury Prevention and Control (ACIPC)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Factors to be considered by ACIPC include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The results of the peer review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The significance of the proposed activities as they relate to national program priorities and the achievement of national objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. National and programmatic needs and geographic balance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Overall distribution of the thematic focus of competing applications; the nationally comprehensive balance of the program in addressing; the three phases of injury control (prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation); the control of injury among populations who are at increased risk, including minority groups, the elderly and children; the major causes of intentional and unintentional injury; and the major disciplines of injury control (such as biomechanics and epidemiology).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Within budgetary considerations the ACIPC will establish annual funding levels as detailed under the heading ``Availability of Funds.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

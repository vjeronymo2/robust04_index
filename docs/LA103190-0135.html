			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PIRU;  </P> <P> 70% WATER SERVICE RATE HIKE PROPOSED  </P> <P> A 70% increase in domestic water rates has been proposed for Piru by Warring  Water Co., the unincorporated community's water purveyor since 1926. If  approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, the new rates will be the  first increase in 10 years.  </P> <P> At a public hearing in Piru on Tuesday, Gary Pace, a Fillmore resident who is  negotiating to buy half of the family-owned company, tried to justify the  increase by citing the effects of inflation on operating expenses, maintenance  costs and taxes. Pace said the company has operated with a deficit for the last  five years and has lost $33,000 during the first nine months of 1990.  </P> <P> The company has needed to raise rates since 1985, Manager Frances Warring  Talbot said. "But I was trying to sell my share and I was advised against  raising rates at that time."  </P> <P> A Warring family nephew, Michael Giddings, remains half-owner of the company  but lives out of state and has not been directly involved in managing the  operation.  </P> <P> Talbot, 76, is retiring after 26 years in the company. She said that state  regulations and the sale of a farm irrigation portion of the company prolonged  the transfer of company responsibilities to Pace and delayed the rate increase.  </P> <P> Basic services charges for most residents will double from $4 to $8 monthly if  the PUC approves the increase. Pace outlined a new rate schedule to residents,  including an increase of 22 cents per 100 cubic feet of water. The first 300  cubic feet of water will no longer be included free with the basic monthly fee.  All water will be subject to the new charge of 85 cents per 100 cubic feet,  Pace said. One hundred cubic feet is 748 gallons, Pace said.  </P> <P> Although the size of the increase shocked some residents, Daniel Paige, a  senior utilities engineer with the PUC, said that given the length of time  since the last rate hike, the big jump in fees should not be a complete  surprise.  </P> <P> At the hearing Tuesday, some residents expressed concern that the increase  would hurt people living on fixed incomes, and there were complaints about poor  maintenance of the system in recent years.

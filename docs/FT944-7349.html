			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Defence spending split threatens Japan coalition A split over defence spending has opened in Japan's three-party ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists, threatening the government's stability. The dispute, over the rate of increase for next year's defence budget, intensified yesterday when finance ministry officials announced they were pushing for a lower rise next year than the 0.9 per cent set by the coalition in August, a month after taking office. This strengthens the hand of the pacifist Social Democratic party, the second largest coalition partner, an unusual ally for the finance ministry. The Socialists felt they were coerced into agreeing the 0.9 per cent rise by the dominant coalition member, the conservative Liberal Democratic party. 'It is our duty to chart a clear course for disarmament,' said Mr Wataru Kubo, the Socialists' deputy leader. Mr Kozo Igarashi, chief cabinet secretary, denied the government would reduce the figure. Socialist politicians fear they have alienated traditional supporters over the past few months by discarding most of their party's former policies, such as opposition to the military's constitutional right to exist and opposition to sales tax, in order to form a government with the LDP. As a result, they are eager to demonstrate progress on pacifism, one of the few policies the party still retains. Failure to agree on the defence budget would increase pressure on a group of dissidents, orchestrated by Mr Kubo, to form their own party. If the Socialist party broke up, the government could be deprived of a majority. The LDP's proposed rise, while the lowest for 33 years, would bring Japanese defence spending to Y4,730bn (Pounds 30.3bn). It is the second largest defence budget in the world, inflated by the yen's rise in value and huge pension and social security payments. On the outcome also hang the hopes of several foreign defence-equipment suppliers, awaiting finance ministry clearance before their contracts can proceed.</p>

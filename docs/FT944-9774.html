			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Telia profit more than doubled Telia, the Swedish state-owned telecommunications group, more than doubled profits in the first nine months, lifting its income after financial items to SKr4.68bn (Dollars 645m) from SKr1.98bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Cost-cutting enabled it to overcome intensifying competition in its home market. The company has shed more than 15,000 jobs in the past three years, cutting its workforce to less than 33,000. The recovery in the Swedish economy contributed to a 4 per cent rise in operating revenues to SKr27.38bn. However, domestic demand has been restricted by reduced public spending and a slowdown in residential construction. The company predicts full-year results substantially higher than last year, when profits were SKr3.95bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] France understands ever better Lithuania's economic  and political aims and is determined to support them by every  means. This was said by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius after  his visit to France.    According to him, his meetings with the French president,  the  head of the government, some members of the Cabinet of  Ministers, and representatives of influential financial and  trading companies, demonstrated there was a great interest in  Lithuania and in the possibilities of political and economic  cooperation. This cooperation, claims Adolfas Slezevicius,  should become concrete now.    As is known, the Lithuanian delegation led by Adolfas  Slezevicius paid a working visit to Paris on 17-21 May.    The Lithuanian prime minister mentioned the European  stability pact as one of the most important facts of political  support. Adolfas Slezevicius has an especially favorable opinion  about the initiative by the French prime minister to hold  regional round tables where it will be possible to discuss at  the level of European state leaders and experts, for example,  relations between the Baltic states and Russia. This will  divert our dialogue with Russia in a completely different  direction, claims Adolfas Slezevicius.    It is especially important to Lithuania in the sense of  economic cooperation to attract as much French capital as  possible to Lithuania. Some conditions are essential for this  purpose, for instance, the protection of and guarantees to  investments, insurance, the abolition of double taxation, etc.    According to Adolfas Slezevicius, expert missions from  French  insurance companies, the Central Bank, the Finance Ministry, and  the electronic industry, will soon be coming to Lithuania.  Concrete projects in which French companies could take part  will be discussed. Technical assistance is possible in the  administration of taxes and in financial payments.</p>

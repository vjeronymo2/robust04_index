The council's ecological security commission has asked the  government for 473.5 billion roubles to protect the coast of the  Caspian Sea which was recognized an ecological disaster zone.    The water level in the Caspian Sea has been rising by an  average 15 centimeters a year since 1978. On the Russian coast  3,220 thousand hectares of valuable land has been swamped,  causing economic damage estimated at 4.3 billion roubles (in the  1991 prices).    The cities of Makhachkala, Derbent and Kaspiisk, as well as  more than 30 smaller residential centers in Daghestan, the  Republic of Kalmykia (Khalm-Tangch) and the Astrakhan region,  are already feeling the impact. The water rim is moving inland  at a speed of 1-2 kilometers a year. The waves reach up to 20  kilometers inland, the sanitary situation is deteriorating and  toxic substances threaten epidemics of plague, cholera and skin  diseases.    The commission worked out more than ten other specific  recommendations for dealing with the situation caused by the  continuing rise of the water level in the sea, which is  threatening the existence of many coastal cities in Russia and  neighboring countries, as well as off-shore oilwells and  platforms belonging to Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,  Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey.</p>

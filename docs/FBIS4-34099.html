			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 14 Jun (AFP) -- According to similar  reports issued in Caracas today, seven Venezuelan commercial  banks closed their doors today "until further notice" following  a decision by the Central Bank of Venezuela to exclude them from  clearinghouse activities.    Although the source did not deny nor confirm the news to  AFP,  its reporters were able to confirm that the Construccion,  Barinas, Maracaibo, La Guaira, Metropolitano, Bancor,  Hipotecario de Occidente banks and the Sociedad Financiera  Fiveca remained closed today. Despite the fact that the banks  were closed, their employees were working while hundreds of  customers protested at the doors.    These seven banks and Latino Bank -- the country's second  largest bank, in which the government intervened in January and  which reopened in April with losses of $5 billion -- have  received financial assistance amounting to $4.300 billion since  February to prevent their collapse.</p>

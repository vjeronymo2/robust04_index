MENA learned that they discussed a plan for the negotiations  in this round, which is scheduled to continue until Thursday or  Friday morning and then resume in the next two weeks to reach an  agreement on implementing Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho.    Members of the two delegations joined the meeting later.  During the afternoon session, the delegations are due to form  subcommittees to discuss the disputed issues, basically, the  border crossings, the size of Jericho, and the security of the  Israeli settlements. Sea, air, and road security and how to  control it in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September  will also be discussed.    The Civil Committee concerned with the transfer of the  self-rule power, which formerly met in al-'Arish, is scheduled  to open meetings in Taba on Tuesday morning.</p>

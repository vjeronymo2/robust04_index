			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS  </P> <P> No plastic pails and rusty trowels here, please. Rising well above the high  tide line at Will Rogers State Beach on Saturday will be sandcastles and sand  sculptures worthy of a Main Street gallery.  </P> <P> This, the 9th Annual Sandcastle Competition, is being held to benefit the  William Z. Landworth Memorial Scholarship Fund. The competition is divided into  three categories: sandcastle building, sand sculpture and "anything goes," the  latter for children under 10 years. It will be staged from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  where Pacific Coast Highway and Temescal Canyon Road meet on the beach. The  public is invited to participate as well as view the sculptures. Entry fee is  $15. Phone: (213) 380-4595.  </P> <P> It's Sunday morning and you don't have any plans for the afternoon. Dig out a  pair of walking shoes for an adventure through the streets of West Hollywood.  Fantastica '90 is a self-guided stroll through West Hollywood's art galleries  and designer showrooms from noon to 5 p.m. Dancers, poets and clowns will  provide entertainment, and goodies from top Los Angeles restaurants will be  served along the way. The afternoon activities will culminate with a juried  silent auction. Tickets are $25 per person and can be purchased at the plaza of  the Pacific Design Center, at 8687 Melrose Ave. Phone: (213) 653-0440 for  information. Proceeds benefit the Los Angeles Free Clinic.

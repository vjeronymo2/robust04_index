			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su] </F>   [Text] On 27 May, North Korea and the United States held  working-level contacts on two occasions and discussed the  schedule and agenda for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, but  no final agreement was reached. However, since North Korea and  the United States both feel that it is necessary to hold the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date, government  authorities view that the DPRK-U.S. talks can be held before 10  June at the latest.    Even though the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is being  delayed somewhat more than expected, the government has already  reached an agreement with the United States on the strategy that  it will take regarding the third round of talks. Kim Sam-hun,  ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, who returned on 26 May  after visiting the United States to deal with this matter said:  "The basic position of the ROK and the United States is that  both countries will make an attempt to completely resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue at the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks." In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, the  two countries are of the position that the issues of completely  returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT];  receiving special inspection [tukpyol sachal] of unnotified  facilities; and accepting the International Atomic Energy  Agency's [IAEA] demand for inspection on the replacement of the  fuel rods in the five-megawatt atomic reactor, must be demanded  to North Korea and implemented. On the other hand, if these are  implemented, the ROK and the United States agree that the issue  of improving DPRK-U.S. relations and economic assistance, which  North Korea is demanding, can be discussed on a comprehensive  level. However, the ROK and the United States are of the  position that they will not settle for a package deal which is  to simultaneously exchange each other's demands, which is being  demanded by North Korea.    If the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is held, the  government  decided that it will demand that North Korea completely return  to the NPT and meet the conditions of the IAEA's demands on the  replacement of the fuel rods first. This is due to the judgment  that since North Korea is continuing to refuse ordinary  inspection [tongsang sachal] by putting forth its special status  in that its withdrawal from the NPT is still being withheld, it  is urgent to return North Korea to the NPT and normalize  ordinary inspection. Also, using its special status, North Korea  is refusing the IAEA's condition in storing the fuel rods which  were selected voluntarily. Therefore, if North Korea promises to  completely return to the NPT, the tug-of-war regarding the  replacement of the fuel rods will be able to come to an end.    The ROK and the United States decided that even during the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, if measures for nuclear safety  is broken because North Korea decides to unilaterally replace  the fuel rods, they will suspend the talks.    However, the ROK and the United States already agreed that  if  North Korea completely returns to the NPT and responds to  holding discussions on the issue of special inspection, they  will hold a wide range of discussions on the demands made by  North Korea including the issue of improving DPRK-U.S.  relations. It also seems that practical discussions on methods  for resuming South-North dialogue to discuss the issue of  implementing the South-North declaration on denuclearization  will be held at the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. Even though  the government withdrew the exchange of special envoys as a  precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the ROK and  the United States decided that they will carry out the  South-North dialogue in a mutual and supplementary way to  discuss the DPRK-U.S. talks and the issue of South-North mutual  inspection.    In the issue of improving DPRK-U.S. relations, issues other  than the nuclear issue are linked such as North Korea's  missiles, human rights, and terrorism issues. Therefore,  government authorities view that there is high possibility that  discussions for a full-scale improvement in relations will be  held at a separate political consultation which will be held  after the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    Regardless of this kind of strategy by the ROK and the  United  States, how the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks will proceed will  be determined in connection with how North Korea deals with this  matter. Therefore, the government authorities still worry about  this matter.</p>

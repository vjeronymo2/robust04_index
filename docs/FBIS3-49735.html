			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Edited" version of news conference given by Prime Minister </F> Vladimir Meciar and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik on 12  January after the Visegrad summit; presented by editors Jarmila  Tosecka and Ivo Kunsh; passages within quotation marks are  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Kunsh] [passage omitted] I quote the first  question. It is said that the Visegrad summit could become an  impulse to expand U.S. economic interests in Central Europe. The  question is whether Slovakia would not be left on the margin of  the economic sphere in the same way it is being left out in some  political relations.    [Meciar] "First of all, during the talks, the interest of  the  United States in direct cooperation was stressed. On the  contrary, Mr. Clinton made a statement to the effect that the  United States would not exclude us from anything. [passage  omitted]    "On the contrary, President Clinton himself is in favor of  doing away with barriers in bilateral trade exchange. He favors  greater openness of markets and the weakening of the  protectionist policy aimed at imports from our country, all of  this to make better economic cooperation possible. His statement  that the United States will economically support Slovakia is  very important for us. It is especially important because many  banking circles have been waiting just for this kind of a  statement by the President so that some credit lines that are  under preparation could open." [passage omitted]    [Tosecka] An editor from the Hungarian section of Slovak  Radio was interested in knowing what the content of bilateral  talks with the Hungarian partners was, especially whether there  was an agreement on resuming the talks that allegedly were  suspended last year.    [Meciar] "We had various talks. Foreign Minister Moravcik  will speak about his part and I about mine.    "Prime Minister Boross and I have met. We have discussed  both--the issues concerning the Visegrad Four and bilateral  relations. We have said that so far the attitudes to  controversial issues--that is, ethnic minorities and  Gabcikovo--were irrational and damaging to both countries. We  agreed that we have to find new points of departure to resolve  these issues. We cannot continue harming ourselves by impairing  the trustworthiness of each other. We have fully agreed on this.    "As for the concept of future development, the Hungarian  Government is affected by the coming May elections. It is very  complicated to enter this process through extensive measures now.    "We expressed Slovakia's willingness to conclude the  so-called big agreement. We expressed our readiness to hold  consultations on all matters of interest. We expressed our  readiness to work faster in setting up a customs union. We dealt  with the readmission agreement and the related subsequent issues  of opening customs checkpoints on the borders. However, we will  leave the crucial decisions for the time after elections."    [Moravcik] [passage omitted] "[Foreign] Minister Jeszenszky  and I have confirmed our interest in continuing our intensive  contacts to clarify some open issues." [passage omitted]    [Kunsh] An Arab journalist was interested in knowing whether  there are any obstacles to arms production and arms trade in  Slovakia.    [Meciar] "The Slovak arms industry in 1993 produced only 8-9  percent of its 1989 capacity. [passage omitted]    "An analysis that we carried out has shown that our  essential  shortcoming is that we had lost market since the arms trading  and arms-trading institutions did not exist. That is why we have  set up a state-owned shareholding company in which several  ministries participate. This company will be involved in arms  exports and imports.    "The development in Slovakia continued and goes on at  present  as well. Its quality is relatively high. The systems that have  been developed and tested or are undergoing tests meet world  parameters. Of course, we will offer them to the market, and the  Slovak Army will be equiped with them as well.    "Regions to which this technology will or will not be  exported are the subject of a licensing procedure." [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview given by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to </F> an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given;  monitored in progress -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]    [Correspondent] You are not only a presidential candidate,  but also a person whom fate decreed to be the first president of  contemporary Ukraine, a post you now hold. How would you  describe the present condition of the Ukrainian state?    [Kravchuk] First, I am able to say today that this state,  Ukraine, finally exists. Throughout many centuries it did not  exist, and now it is here on the world map, recognized by the  world community. It is a fact. It is the result of the great  effort of our people, our parliament, our president, our  government and all the power structures. [passage indistinct]  We have the will of the people, we have the laws reflecting  this will, and we have the efforts of the president and other  power structures to implement this course. It is difficult  indeed. We, and the people, can see that. But we can sincerely  say that nobody in the world can hope to cover this road with  ease. [passage indistinct]    [Correspondent] What in Ukraine's present condition worries  you most? And what do you think must be done to improve that  condition?    [Kravchuk] The hardships are of a both objective and  subjective nature. What worries me most is the hardships in the  economic system and the economy in general, the decline in  living standards. The first thing we must do is stabilize  production. The next thing is to do all in our power to give it  a boost. This is the basic and all-determining factor, because  this is the basis of all our future steps, be it to safeguard  social security, or, for example, to raise pay in the Army,  which we must do and will do at any cost -- to provide officers  with housing and raise their pay -- or to improve the financial  status of the vulnerable strata -- pensioners, the disabled, and  many other categories of people here who need this kind of  improvement to secure them a more or less acceptable lifestyle.  This is the main thing. How can it be done? There are ways to  do this. There are programs both in the government and in the  Supreme Council, and I hope they will be eventually approved;  mechanisms will be worked out, and we will find the resources to  do it and to move forward.    There is also the political situation. We need to overcome  the differences in the existing views of our economic and  political development. This is a must. We must be united in  our need to develop, to overcome the obstacles and to move  forward.    Regrettably, however, everything is being done to make us  fall out [words indistinct] to find differences between the  president, the prime minister and the chairman of the Supreme  Council. I can see now how the press is attempting to do this.  [passage omitted] Today, however, there is another danger,  (?you know), in that a (?certain) part of the leftist forces is  giving in to (?wicked malice), [words indistinct] in Donetsk and  Lugansk oblasts, and everything repeats itself (?once again).  At the beginning, there were (?just a few people) demanding a  Nuerenberg process to try the Communist Party. I had to make  the greatest effort to ward this off, excuse me, legal  Bacchanalia. We averted it, prevented it, and no heads rolled.  Right now, it appears, yet another victimization is being  called for, now of (?the other) side. I was simply terrified to  listen [words indistinct] to a group present in that hall. You  may have (?already) heard [words indistinct] in Donetsk oblast.  [Passage indistinct]. So there is (?a danger), a threat -- (?as  long as there are those forces) -- there simply is a threat of  losing statehood and, most importantly, democracy. [Words  indistinct] and (?those methods) have nothing in common with  democracy.    So I would just like to appeal to the electorate (?and all)  to stop that Bacchanalia and restrain the people on either side  making an attempt on the sacrosanctity of democracy and  statehood, for it is the people themselves who (?in the long  run) will be taken hostage of all this. We have already seen  this. We already (?know) this. So (?we should avert) this  danger.    So, there is both some progress, there is the state, state  establishments and certain basis of what has already been done,  and there are forces [words indistinct] fighting for power can  lead to the irreparable. So we at all costs will have to stop  extremism (?in all its manifestations) on either side and  prevent any, I would like to emphasize, any attempt on democracy  and our state, because there is, I would like to repeat, that  threat.    [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct]    [Kravchuk] I agree. There should be stable laws and a well-  established constitution corresponding with the changes that  have taken place, and a stable [word indistinct]. That is a  must. For example, government is a problem for us [words  indistinct] changes to parliamentary elections because there are  (?some difficulties) in that the laws and the constitution do  not agree with each other, a disagreement which makes it  possible to initiate constant changes accordingly, that (?affect  the stability) of government. I agree with that.    That problem, however, is not just a matter of  personalities.  It once again has to do with the Constitution and the laws,  i.e., the basis that was defined and supported by the people and  tolerates no such changes.    [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, my understanding is that  today you will do without electoral promises.    [Kravchuk] [Passage indistinct] Second, I will certainly do  whatever I can in order to prevent a conflict between Ukraine  and other states, for Ukraine never to be the first to take any  action aimed at an attempt on human life, war or threat [words  indistinct]. Clearly, (?quite another) matter is someone coming  and trying, let us say, to suppress us. Any state and any  people would protect themselves. That, however, would be  protection rather than aggression by us.    As for (?an empire), I have already addressed that question  and would really like it never to re-emerge. To achieve that,  however, we need to (?do everything we are doing), laying the  foundation of our peaceful, democratic and well-considered  policy, good-neighborliness and partnership for us to move  forward. Life goes on. There will be new people coming to  power, while that which we are doing today and the foundation we  are laying today is to continue. [Passage indistinct].    I believe [words indistinct] our wealth and achievements  that  we have secured in the time that has passed (?since  independence). (?I belive) that Ukraine will resolve any  problems [words indistinct].</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW DIRECTION  </P> <P> President Reagan's obsession with tiny Nicaragua during his two terms kept the  U.S. government from dealing with more profound problems in the Western  Hemisphere. Now an impressive array of 60 political leaders from the Americas,  led by former U.S. Ambassador Sol M. Linowitz and former Costa Rican President  Daniel Oduber, propose a new direction for President-elect Bush.  </P> <P> In a report, "The Americas in 1989: Consensus for Action," the group,  Inter-American Dialogue, says that general agreements have emerged since its  first meetings in 1982 on how the hemisphere can best deal with several complex  problems. The section of the Dialogue's 59-page report understandably getting  the most attention deals with ways to end the violence in Central America. The  prestigious panel says that the peace plan proposed last year by Costa Rica's  President Oscar Arias Sanchez created the framework for an end to a decade of  warfare. But before the plan can work, the report concludes, the United States  and Nicaragua must reach a mutal security agreement. The U.S. government must  give up any idea of over-throwing the Nicaraguan government, and Nicaragua's  Sandinista rulers must curtail their dependence on the Soviet Bloc. That means  negotiations between Washington and Managua, which Reagan stubbornly refused to  pursue but which should be among Bush's first moves on taking office.  </P> <P> The report is equally forthright and sensible on other subjects, reporting  that:  </P> <P>  -- After six years of economic depression, most Latin Americans are so much  worse off todaythan they were a decade ago that the debt crisis could soon  spark a political crisis.  </P> <P>  -- Latin America's economy must grow by at least 5% a year to restore  confidence. To do that, Latin American governments must restructure their  economies and revamp their development strategies, the United States must deal  with its own financial problems, there must be more lending to Latin America,  and debt-reduction agreements must be negotiated between individual countries  and creditor banks.  </P> <P>  -- The Western Hemisphere is losing the fight against drugs, and the best hope  is to deemphasize police strategies of eradication, interdiction and political  pressure in favor of programs to limit demand for drugs through education and  rehabilitation.  </P> <P>  -- Environmental problems, especially the continued destruction of rain  forests in Brazil and Central America, threaten not only the health and  well-being of all Americans but even the future of the planet as well. The  group urges governments to discourage environmentally destructive activities  and to invest in better managing their natural resources. Protecting the  environment will be costly for many poor nations; in the long run, neglect will  be even more costly.  </P> <P> Members of the Dialogue include former Latin American presidents and ministers,  as well as senior U.S. officials from both the Democratic and Republican  parties. The final section of their report reflects a sincere concern for the  preservation of democracy. They warn that unless these challenges are met, many  democratic governments in the hemisphere could fall, to be replaced by  repressive regimes of both the far right and the extreme left. Bush should heed  the warning.  </P></p>

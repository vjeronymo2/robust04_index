			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpts from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Higher </F> Court's work report delivered by Xia Zhonglie, president of the  higher court, to the Second Session of the Eighth Zhejiang  Provincial People's Congress on 2 March 1994]    [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of party committees  at various levels and under the supervision and guidance of  people's congresses at various levels and their standing  committees as well as the Supreme People's Court, people's  courts at various levels in the province seriously implemented  the resolution of the First Session of the Eighth Zhejiang  Provincial People's Congress on the provincial people's higher  court's work report, centered their work on promoting economic  construction, carried out various adjudicatory work, enforced  law in a strict manner, strengthened the ranks of judicial  workers, and made progress in various tasks. During the whole  year, various people's courts concluded the trials of 137,983  cases of various types, a 4.7 percent increase over the previous  year, and the number of cases not yet concluded was 18.2 percent  less than those in the previous year. They gave full play to  the functions of judicial organs and played quite a good role in  safeguarding social and political stability, in promoting  reform, opening up, and economic construction, and in  intensifying the anticorruption struggle.    In the past year, we took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guiding  ideology; considered the implementation of the party's basic  line of "one central task and two basic points" as the  fundamental task; based ourselves on emancipating our minds and  seeking truth from facts in carrying out judicial work; enforced  law in a strict and serious manner; correctly handled relations  between adjudication and service, between striking at law  offenders and adjusting various policies, and between handling  various cases according to the law and being "conducive to the  three causes, namely conducive to developing the productive  forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength  of our socialist country, and improving the people's living  standards;" raised the level of judicial work; and strived to  protect reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, and to  provide legal services. In our work arrangements, we  concentrated on the three major things put forward by the party  Central Committee, namely strengthening macrocontrol of the  economy, opposing corruption, and safeguarding social stability.  We actively unfolded adjudicatory work; placed the struggle and  "hitting hard" against law offenders and the trial of major and  serious cases, especial major economic crimes, in the first  place; and ensured the smooth implementation of major policy  decisions by the central authorities. While doing a good job in  adjudicatory work, we paid attention to the building of judicial  workers, conducted a massive investigation on law enforcement  and discipline against corruption, consciously accepted the  evaluation and judgment of our work by the people's congresses,  conscientiously improved our work, constantly promoted the  purity and enhanced the fighting ability of judicial workers,  and guaranteed the accomplishment of our adjudicatory work.    In the past year, people's courts at various levels in the  province have strengthened leadership in accordance with the  above-mentioned general ideology and arrangements, adopted  various measures, and stressed the following tasks:  1. Strengthened the Intensity of Dealing Blows to Serious  Criminal Law Offenders, Safeguarded Social Stability    The good or bad public order in society directly influences  the overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic  construction. To safeguard stability in the society, people's  courts in the whole province adhered to the policy of "dealing  heavy blows to crimes," and punished criminal law offenders who  killed people or committed crimes of robbery, rape, hooligan  activities, and explosion, and crime groups with Mafia-like  tendencies. In the whole year, various people's courts  concluded the trial of 18,857 cases of the first instance,  increasing by 16 percent as compared with the previous year.  Those who were sentenced from five years' fixed-term  imprisonment to life imprisonment or death accounted for 50.3  percent, increasing by 2 percent as compared with the previous  year.    Last May, the provincial party committee launched a  campaign to crack down hard on gangs of criminals, the abduction  of women and children, and "train and road bandits," and  strictly enforce the ban on prostitution. The provincial court  promptly worked out special plans in regard to the targets,  methods, steps, and specific measures of the crackdown. Courts  at all levels swung into immediate action; some courts set up  special leading groups and 47 courts appointed 162 additional  judges to reinforce their manpower. The broad ranks of cadres  and policemen worked overtime to handle the numerous indictments  resulting from the drive against crimes. In regard to vicious  cases that pose a great harm to society and which the people  detest most, the courts concerned moved them up and assigned  personnel to try them quickly, render severe sentences, and give  them wide publicity, thus effectively curbing the arrogance of  criminals.  2. Severely Punish Serious Economic Crimes and Implement  the Anticorruption Drive.    Courts in Zhejiang underwent two phases in their handling of  economic crimes last year. In contrary with the rampant  economic crimes in society, the number of economic crime cases  in the first half of 1993 dropped by 42.3 percent from the same  1992 period. In the second half, pursuant with a directive of  the CPC Central Committee calling for stepped-up efforts in  investigating and prosecuting a number of major cases, courts  and procuratorial and judicial organs in the province redoubled  efforts in trying economic crime cases. A meeting of presidents  of intermediate courts sponsored by the provincial court last  August called for cracking down particularly hard on state  functionaries in party and government organs, judicial organs,  law-enforcing administrative departments, and departments in  charge of economic administration who take advantage of their  positions to embezzle, take bribes, and misappropriate public  funds. The meeting also called for firmly cracking down on  crimes such as production and sale of fake and shoddy goods,  smuggling, sale of contraband goods, fraud, tax evasion, and  refusal to pay tax. The meeting urged leadership of courts at  all levels to take personal charge of trials involving major  cases, step up supervision and guidance, and establish a system  of recording and reporting major cases. On two occasions in  September and November, the provincial court outlined plans for  speeding up trials involving embezzlement and bribery, notifying  the courts concerned about cases already indicted or soon to be  indicted by the procuratorial organs. Courts throughout the  province earnestly implemented the meeting's guidelines . Many  courts also set up collegial panels or designated backbone  cadres to take exclusive charge of the trials. By the end of  last year, the province completed proceedings at first instance  of 2,602 cases; of them, the number of cases completed and  criminals sentenced in the second half of 1993 rose 55.4 and  42.5 percent, respectively, over the first half.    From the economic criminals tried last year, we can see  that there were several characteristics: First, state workers  of party, government, judicial, administrative, and law  enforcement organs--354 in total--accounted for 10 percent of  these criminals, which is quite high. Second, many cases  involved large amounts of money--198 criminals had illegal gains  of more than 30,000 yuan, of which 71 gained more than 100,000  yuan--and some cases were the first ones of their kind in  Zhejiang. Third, cases involving manufacturing and selling fake  and shoddy products and counterfeiting trade marks increased--84  persons were sentenced for committing such crimes. Fourth,  criminals given heavy sentences increased--279 persons, 22.9  percent more than the previous year, were sentenced to 10 years  or more in prison, of which 13 were sentenced to death and 28  were given a temporary suspension of their death sentences. The  severe punishment for serious economic criminals indicates the  party and state's firm determination to fight corruption; it  helped maintain the economic order and lift people's spirits.  3. Forcefully Stepped Up Economic Trial To Improve  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and To Advance the Market  Economy    Last year, the number of cases involving economic disputes  increased sharply. There were many cases in which lawsuits  involved several million yuan or tens of millions of yuan, and  in which enterprises involved were on the verge of bankruptcy  because they were unable to collect due payments. Cases  involving disputes over purchase and marketing contracts  increased noticeably, and cases with new characteristics also  increased. To meet the needs of developing the market economy,  courts across the province regarded the trial of economic cases  as important work--they strengthened leadership, adjusted trial  personnel, enhanced their trying capabilities, made trial  process more regularized, and strived to improve the quality and  efficiency of case handling. Last year, we handled and closed  42,902 cases involving economic disputes after the first trial  and settled disputes involving a total of 2.9 billion yuan,  respectively 23.2 percent and 151.5 percent more than the  previous year.    Courts at all levels conducted trials of economic cases,  closely revolving around strengthening macroeconomic regulation  and control, deepening reform of the economic system, and  developing the socialist market economy. In addition to  handling more cases properly and efficiently, they endeavored to  expand their services and offered to serve economic construction  and to solve problems for enterprises. They took positive  measures to support efforts to straighten out the financial  order and offered to collect overdue loans for creditors. They  went to financial departments to understand the actual  situations and then drew up appropriate measures--writing  letters to urge debtors to pay or sending people to debtors to  persuade them to pay--to collect overdue loans. By taking these  measures, they collected 563 million yuan of overdue loans,  relaxing some financial department's shortages of funds. They  also provided more services to help enterprises free themselves  from predicaments. Many courts did not wait for cases to be  referred to them; instead, they took the initiative in  understanding enterprises' operations through economic judicial  liaison officers or by sending someone to enterprises concerned.  They did their best to provide legal assistance to enterprises  with difficulties. Courts at all levels also established  economic disputes mediation centers. According to the  guidelines of the 16th national conference of court presidents,  eight intermediate courts and 59 grass-roots courts in the  province established economic disputes mediation centers.  Following the principle of being "voluntary, fair, legal, and  efficient," these mediation centers settled 4,145 economic  disputes cases and settled disputes involving 330 million yuan.  It took an average of 13 days to settle a case--some cases were  settled on the same day--keeping pace with the quick step of  market economic development and winning concerned parties'  welcome.    While the old system is being transformed into a new one,  cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, credit cards,  futures trade, and other new problems continued to crop up.  Sometimes there were no laws for trying such cases or the laws  are not specific enough, making trial work very difficult.  Courts handling such cases insisted on the principle of seeking  truth from facts, boldly sought new ways of practice, and  conducted trial work prudently and in accordance with the civil  procedural law, enabling them to achieve good social results.    4. Carried Out Various Judicial Work in an All-Round  Manner and Gave Full Play to the Regulatory Function of the Law.    The trials of civil lawsuits are closely related to the  production and lives of the masses. Civil litigations surpass  all other lawsuits in terms of the number of cases, number of  categories, and scope of work. Following the continual  deepening of reform and opening up to the outside world, civil  contacts have become increasingly extensive, giving rise to a  constant increase in new kinds of civil lawsuits directly linked  to the market economy such as labor disputes and labor  remuneration and copyright cases. Last year we accepted and  heard 575 cases under these three categories. The vast number  of judicial personnel handling civil cases persisted in doing  meticulous work, emphasizing mediation, and properly handling  cases, regardless of whether they belonged to the major  categories of marriage, debts, and compensatory damages, or to  the new categories. Last year we concluded 63,634 civil cases  during their first trial, 49.6 percent of which were settled  through mediation, playing an active role in protecting the  legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons in  accordance with the law, maintaining social stability and unity,  and promoting spiritual and material civilization.    Last year, under the situation of a decreasing number of  administrative cases closed and growing difficulty in trying  cases, courts at all levels overcame the fear for difficulty,  held off various interferences, and persisted in handling cases  in accordance with the law to settle 1,270 administrative cases.  Administrative organs' punitive decisions were upheld in 354  cases, or 27.9 percent of the total, and annulled or revised in  220 cases, or 17.3 percent; nolle prosequi took place in 602  cases, or 47.4 percent; the suitor's claim was rejected and the  trial terminated in 94 cases, or 7.4 percent. As such, we not  only protected the legitimate rights and interests of citizens,  legal persons, and other organizations in accordance with the  law, but also supported administrative organs in exercising  their functions and powers. In our work, we laid stress on  administrative cases involving infringement upon enterprises'  property rights and operational and management powers, land, and  urban planning, concluding a total of 306 cases under these four  categories. Through the administration of justice in accordance  with the law, we promoted the transformation of enterprise  operating mechanisms and safeguarded the smooth progress of old  town reconstructions and development zone constructions at  various localities.    In the first year after its establishment, the Ningbo  Admiralty Court developed the spirit of building an undertaking  through arduous effort, made bold attempts, and enthusiastically  carried out judicial work. It accepted and heard 103 maritime  cases of various kinds, and concluded 78 of them. It put an end  to the history that maritime cases taking place in the Zhejiang  waters had to be referred to courts outside the province, and is  playing an active role in helping develop our maritime  transportation, fishery production, and foreign trade.    Over the past year, courts in Zhejiang at all levels  actively participated in the overall improvement of public  security and order through conducting trials. In focusing on  open trials to promote the awareness of the legal system, the  courts held 504 public sentencing meetings at which 3,441 people  were given sentences. To achieve a better effect, the courts  used the media to explain the laws involved in each case. A  total of 2,075 people were given probation, but their behavior  was routinely checked to enforce their disciplinary control. We  actively launched a suggestion campaign. A total of 1,058  suggestions concerning judicial affairs were passed to the  relevant departments. Of these, 70 percent were adopted. As a  result, we achieved fairly good social effects. We attached  great importance to out-of-court settlements and succeeded in  preventing from happening more than 1,700 possible suicides,  murders, and fighting caused by civil disputes.  5. Uphold the Principle of Tightening Law Enforcement and  Increasing the Level of Judicial Work    Tightening law enforcement is the state's fundamental  requirement for judicial work. It is also a matter of great  concern for the people. In their trial work, courts at all  levels persisted in handling their affairs strictly in  accordance with the law, and they strived to improve the quality  of their case handling. The courts tried to improve the  quality, efficiency, and social effects of their work. First,  they persisted in holding public trials and in improving the  quality of trial work. They paid great attention to three  important links in trial work: investigation, cross-  examination, and debate. They attached importance to evidence  provided by the parties concerned and brought into full play the  role of the collegial bench. Second, they strengthened trial  supervision and work guidance. If appeals were rational, trial  corrections were rendered in a timely fashion. Last year, 272  past legal cases were given retrials. A total of 84 cases  appealed by procuratorial organizations were handled. Of these,  27 cases were given a retrial. Third, they began to experiment  with a system in which persons responsible for wrong cases  should be uncovered and punished. Four intermediate courts and  44 grass-roots courts have already established such a system.  Cadres and police who were responsible for wrong cases were  given suitable punishments. This measure helped judges to  foster a serious and conscientious trial work style and to  enhance their sense of responsibility. Fourth, the courts  explored ways to improve trial work. In conducting trials of  economic and civil cases, the courts emphasized the relevant  parties' responsibility for providing evidence. The courts  introduced a standardized trial system in which all cases will  be handled promptly. After summing up trial experiences gained  by localities, the provincial people's courts have already  formulated standardized regulations concerning the trials for  economic cases. Such regulations--which concern standards of  quality, trial procedures, detailed regulations for convening a  court, and evidence provided by the parties concerned--played a  fairly important role in improving the level of trials.    Second, they strengthened the training of cadres and took  steps to improve the professional skills of trial personnel. In  recent years, new laws and regulations have been promulgated one  after another, and new developments and problems have popped up  in trials. In addition, some comrades who became court  presidents following last year's expiration of terms were  unfamiliar with the practice of their professional work. In  light of this, courts at all levels stepped up their training,  held seminars to familiarize them with their jobs, and sponsored  meetings to exchange trial experience. Provincial courts  sponsored training classes for presiding judges of criminal,  civil, and appeal courts and organized two-month-long in-service  training sessions for 25 grass-roots court presidents. These  training and job-related activities have helped improve the  ability of key members of the trial cadres to resolve problems  and have played a positive role in raising judicial standards  and ensuring good qualities in handling cases.    Third, they earnestly carried out the struggle against  corruption. Emphasis was placed on court leaders' taking the  lead in maintaining honesty and exercising self-discipline and  on establishing a system for leading cadres to take  responsibility in building party style. At the same time,  vigorous efforts were made to carry out the following two tasks.  First, efforts were made to resolutely stop the unhealthy  practice of using judicial authority to wantonly collect fees  under all sorts of names. Court offices which caused confusion  in terms of judicial and administrative powers were abrogated.  Second, a general inspection on law and discipline enforcement,  with a special emphasis on corruption, was launched. Various  methods were adopted--including internal investigations,  soliciting views from the departments concerned, and studying  cases with a clear objective in mind--to find out whether there  were abuses of power for personal gain and unfair verdicts. The  general inspection showed that the overwhelming majority of  cadres and police officers had faithfully enforced the law. The  courts concerned dealt sternly with 27 cases of the violation of  law and discipline discovered in the course of inspections. The  courts used these violations as negative examples to educate  cadres and police officers and as warning to them. This has  promoted honest and clean government.    There were still many problems and difficulties in our work  during the past year. The main problems and difficulties were  as follows: First, the thinking and awareness of the cadres and  police officers fell behind political and economic developments.  A few of them were not very conscientious about serving  economic construction. Old ideas formed over a long period in a  planned economy still exerted influences to varying degrees.  There were still instances of approaching cases in isolation  without paying attention to their social effect. Second, there  were still instances of a failure to enforce the law strictly.  A small number of cases were handled poorly, and some cases  were not handled strictly according to legal procedures. Some  cases were not handled within the prescribed time, and some  major cases were not handled promptly. As a result, the social  effects of these cases were decreased. There were also  instances of a lack of strong measures against serious criminal  elements in trial procedures. Third, the environment for law  enforcement was not quite satisfactory. Some cadres were  partial to and pleaded for mercy for one party. Some even used  their authority to override the law and interfere in trials.  Because of strong local protectionism, cases involving people  outside the locality were difficult to handle; and the execution  of court judgments was even more difficult. Little progress was  made in the trial of administrative cases; the number of cases  concluded dropped 11 percent compared to the previous year.  Fourth, there were too many cases and very few personnel to  handle them. Equipment was obsolete, and many courts  experienced shortages of funds to handle cases. This affected  the smooth progress of trials. The provincial court lacked the  in-depth investigation and study of new developments and  characteristics emerging in the new situation. It also failed  to give prompt guidance and to exercise effective supervision  over trials. It lacked solutions to certain problems. We are  adopting measures to vigorous solve all these problems and  difficulties, and we have asked the provincial people's congress  and its standing committee to give us their support and to urge  the departments concerned to help solve them.    The execution of court judgments is an important part of  strictly enforcing the law. To effectively protect citizens'  lawful rights and to maintain the authority of court verdicts  and the solemn nature of the law, people's courts at various  levels paid attention to executing court verdicts. They  overcame and resisted local protectionism and made efforts to  execute court verdicts in a civilized manner in various ways by  integrating routine efforts with special efforts to carry out  court orders and by entrusting the departments concerned to  execute court verdicts. During the past year, various people's  courts executed a total of 43,123 cases of verdicts of various  types, and the number of cases not yet executed decreased by  11.4 percent compared to the previous year. To solve the  problem of "difficulties in executing court orders," the  provincial higher court seriously studied and formulated  "opinions on solving some specific problems in the execution of  court verdicts," "rules for the implementation of court  verdicts," and "opinions on how to reach desired goals in  executing court verdicts" to guide and promote the execution of  court decisions by people's courts at the lower level.    In the second half of last year, people's courts at various  levels adopted a serious attitude in voluntarily accepting  evaluations and comments from people's deputies in accordance  with the circular issued by the standing committee of the  provincial people's congress on evaluating judicial work.  Various people's courts made full preparations beforehand for  accepting evaluations from people's deputies. While carrying  out self-checks, various people's courts heard opinions and  suggestions on court work from peoples from various circles of  society by visiting people or by inviting people to express  their opinions and suggestions. Fifty-two people's courts sent  letters to solicit opinions from 9,359 people's deputies at  various levels; 61 people's courts invited 4,248 people's  deputies and supervisors of the honesty of government work and  members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference to take part in discussions at courts; and 74  people's courts went deep into villages and towns to solicit  opinions. Concerned courts conducted investigations one by one  on opinions and criticisms made by people's deputies and  seriously studied ways to make improvements. Through these  activities, the broad masses of cadres and judicial policemen of  various courts have further understood that commenting on and  evaluating judicial work is an effective way for the courts to  accept supervision from the people's congresses and also an  important way to gain the understanding of people's deputies and  to ensure the strict enforcement of the law.  6. Lay Stress on Opposing Corruption and Advocating  Honesty in Performing Official Duties, Strengthen the Building  of People's Courts    Over the past year, people's courts at various levels paid  attention to the building of judicial workers while attaching  importance to adjudicatory work. People's courts strived to  raise the political and professional quality of judicial workers  to guarantee the accomplishment of various adjudicatory tasks.    First, various people's courts have attached importance to  study and education for judicial cadres and policemen to raise  their political quality. In light of the problem of ideological  understanding in the transitional period from the old system to  the new system and the change of relations concerning material  interests in the new period, various people's courts have  strengthened education and guidance for cadres and policemen.  Judicial cadres and policemen were organized to study the basic  theory of Marxism, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee. The people's courts armed  cadres and policemen with the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to raise their consciousness of  implementing the party's basic line. Various courts also  conducted education on ideals, moral principles, and discipline,  and they encouraged cadres and policemen to carry forward the  spirit of dedication. The overwhelming majority of cadres and  policemen have been honest in performing their official duties  and have strived to make improvements. A large number of  advanced units and individuals who adhere to principles and who  enforce the law justly have emerged. In 1993, 71 collectives  and 153 individuals won praise and received awards. Of these,  the Zhouquan People's Court in Tongxiang city was accorded a  collective merit first class by the Supreme People's Court, and  Deputy Presiding Judge Dong Youquan of the economic affairs  court of the Shaoxing County People's Court and staff member Li  Yuanqing of the Jinhua Intermediate People's Court archives were  named national models for court workers.    The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  proposed to preliminarily establish the socialist market economy  by the end of this century. This is a crucial year for pushing  through overall progress and attaining key breakthroughs in  economic restructuring. Now we are faced with arduous tasks in  maintaining public security. As the state's judicial organ, the  people's courts will shoulder heavier tasks and greater  responsibilities. In accordance with the guidelines of the  ninth provincial party congress and the national conference of  higher court presidents, the guiding ideology for judicial work  throughout the province this year is:To use Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee as a guide; to hold court  trials comprehensively and uphold the principle of striking  severely at large and major crimes; to vigorously use judicial  means to regulate relations between various economic sectors; to  strengthen self-construction; to uphold strict and just law  enforcement; to strive to improve judicial standards; as well as  to provide legal support and services to the overall task of  "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability."Thus, we  will focus on carrying out the following work:    First, it is necessary to strengthen the functions of  dictatorship, to punish resolutely and strictly in accordance  with the law criminals who endanger national security, and to  uphold the principle of punishing serious criminal offenders  severely and promptly.To further carry on last year's work  in strictly cracking down on crimes, it is necessary to strike  at the crimes of murder, robbery, rape, gangsterism, drug  trafficking, and kidnapping and selling women and children,  particularly the crimes of secret gangster organizations.  Further, we must crack down on prominent crimes in accordance  with the characteristics of localities. Courts should actively  coordinate with the relevant departments to effectively curb and  rectify special crimes. It is necessary to quicken the pace of  case handling, trials, and handing down sentences to uphold the  courts' authority in curbing crimes and to widen the social  effects of the courts' work. While striking severely at crimes,  it is necessary to actively participate in the comprehensive  rectification of public order, as well as to bring into further  play the courts' role in holding public trials, offering  suggestions in judicial matters, publicizing the legal system,  and offering guidance and arbitration.    Second, it is necessary to continue to crack down  severely on serious economic crimes to promote a clean  government. We must do a good job of holding trials for  major economic crimes. We must strictly crack down on state  personnel who use their powers for corruption, bribery, and to  embezzle public funds. We must resolutely curb the crimes of  smuggling, swindling, producing and selling fake and  inferior-quality goods, and tax evasion. Court leaders must  personally handle major cases uncovered during the  anticorruption struggle and attend to them seriously once trials  are held. It is necessary to be determined, careful, and  accurate in handing down strict punishments in accordance with  the law. We must resolutely mete out heavy or death sentences  when essential. It is necessary to publicize typical cases that  generally concern and affect society by holding open trials,  passing sentences in public, or holding news conferences to  widen the social effects of cases' handling by the courts.    Third, We Should Further Consolidate and Regulate  Courts' Functions To Advance the Development of the Socialist  Market Economy.This year, the reform of the economic system  will accelerate; therefore, all courts should make full use of  judicial means to help nurture and develop the market system.  We should seriously enforce the "Economic Contract Law," the  "Company Law," the "Law on Protecting Consumers' Rights and  Interests," and the "Law on Unfair Competition," to ensure open,  fair, and orderly competition and to prohibit unfair  competition. We should enthusiastically handle and properly  settle cases involving financial management, resources  exploitation, tax levying and management, and price management,  to ensure that reform is carried out smoothly. By trying cases  involving problems coming up in the course of transforming  enterprises' operating mechanisms, we should safeguard  enterprises' rights to operate and manage their own operations  and should uphold enterprises' internal contract responsibility  system on business management so that enterprises can truly be  independent economic entities and be major players in market  competition. We should properly try cases involving village and  town enterprises' contract disputes over production and business  operation matters to advance the development of village and town  enterprises. At the same time, we should try carefully and  properly cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, futures  trading, and other new problems which come up while reform is  being deepened, as well as cases involving matters concerning  foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, in order to  create a good legal environment for deepening reform and opening  up to the outside world.    Fourth, We Should Tighten Supervision Over Trial Cases  To Uphold the Dignity of the Law.Currently, courts' trial  work is quite seriously disturbed by regional and departmental  protectionism--trials in a small number of cases have dragged  on, and court rulings were unfair. So, we must further  emphasize the need to strictly enforce the law, to tighten  supervision over trial work, and to enhance trial discipline.  In addition to carrying out education in adhering to the goal  of wholeheartedly serving the people and to stepping up  vocational training, we should improve the supervision and  inhibition mechanisms, continue on a trial basis the system of  investigating wrongly ruled cases, and affix administrative and  legal responsibility for persons handling cases illegally. We  should decidedly correct unfair rulings and wrongful law  enforcement. At the same time, we should further strengthen law  enforcement, reinforce and better equip our law-enforcement  personnel, decidedly get over the disturbance of regional  protectionism, emphasize enforcing the law in a civilized  manner, and uphold the seriousness of the law.  Fifth, We Should Deepen Court Reform and Improve Court  Work. First, we should step up the study of political  theory, especially Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee; further emancipate our minds; change  the way we think; and enhance our resolution and  self-consciousness in carrying out the party's basic line and  the policy of developing a socialist market economy. Second, we  should carry out the anticorruption struggle in depth and make  constant efforts to promote administrative honesty, in order to  enable cadres and policemen to withstand the trials and pounding  of the commodity economy. Third, we should build up our leading  bodies, improve administrative work, and strictly manage the  courts. At the same time, we should actively seek ways to reform  our trial procedures--in trying civil and economic cases, we  should emphasize the concerned parties' responsibility in  testifying. We also should improve courts' trial capabilities,  improve case-handling efficiency, ensure that all cases are  handled properly, and continue to build up the civil and  economic divisions and to improve these divisions' material  conditions, in order to carry out heavy trial work.  Sixth, We Should Be More Party-Minded and Should  Self-Consciously Subject Ourselves to the Supervision of the  People's Congresses.Relying closely on the party's  leadership and the masses and self-consciously subjecting  ourselves to the supervision of the people's congresses are the  fundamental assurance for the people's courts to properly  conduct their trial work. Courts at all levels should  voluntarily and in a timely manner submit reports to the party  committee and the people's congress in charge concerning their  work plans and new situations and problems in their work, and  they should suggest ways to deal with these new situations and  problems. They should follow the party committees' instructions  and subject themselves to the supervision of their people's  congress. They should resolutely carry out relevant resolutions  adopted by their people's congress and its standing committee  and handle earnestly and in a responsible manner matters  committed to them by their people's congress and its standing  committee. At the same time, they should subject themselves to  procuratorial organs' legal supervision and the media's  supervision so that they can continue to improve their trial  work.</p>

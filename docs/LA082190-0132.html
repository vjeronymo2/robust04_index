			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESCUE TEAM TRACKS DOWN MISSING HIKER  </P> <P> A 34-year-old Orange man admitted Monday that he bit off more than he could  chew when he went hiking alone in an area near Trabuco Canyon.  </P> <P> Chauncey Cupkie spent an uneventful night in Holy Jim Canyon when he grew too  tired to hike out before dark.  </P> <P> "I knew exactly where I was," Cupkie said from his home Monday. "I just ran out  of energy to get out. . . . I put a lot of people through a lot of trouble, but  I'm OK."  </P> <P> Cupkie's mother had called the Orange County Sheriff's Department shortly  before 10 p.m. Sunday to report that her son might be lost in the canyon.  Deputies began a ground search soon after, and Cupkie was found unharmed about  7:35 a.m., walking along a brush-covered trail.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard Olson said that settling in for the  night was the best move Cupkie could have made.  </P> <P> "Most of your experienced hikers will tell you that when darkness comes, the  smartest thing to do is find a place, get comfortable and wait for daylight,"  Olson said. "A lot of people get injured after dark when they panic and try to  get out. I suspect that's what happened to our last victim out there. It was  dark and he fell over a cliff."  </P> <P> Cupkie, who said he took up hiking a few years ago, left a map of his planned  route with his mother before he left, making finding him much easier for  sheriff's deputies, Olson said.  </P> <P> "We were able to go right to where his vehicle was," Olson said. "If he hadn't  left a map, it could have taken hours to locate him out there."  </P> <P> Olson said that by 3:50 Monday morning, at least two bloodhounds and seven  search and rescue team members were looking for Cupkie.  </P></p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Japan and US fail to reach accord: Rift casts shadow over trade ties as Clinton and Hosokawa back 'cooling off' period The US and Japan yesterday failed to resolve disagreements over a plan to give US goods and services greater access to Japanese markets. President Bill Clinton, in sombre mood, told a press conference after his summit with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, the Japanese position 'simply did not meet the standards' agreed in Tokyo last July. 'It is better to have no agreement than an empty agreement,' he added. Mr Clinton did not publicly threaten US retaliation against Japan, saying 'we need a period of reflection to assess where we are'. However, senior administration officials said later there was a 'good-sized menu' of options the US could now consider. They said US trade relations with Japan had reached 'a turning point', implying an even tougher US stance in the future. Mr Clinton noted: 'The rest of our relationship is in good shape, but this is a serious problem.' Mr Hosokawa also urged a 'cooling off' period after the intense negotiations between ministers from both sides finally broke off in the small hours of yesterday morning. 'Unfortunately, at the very end we were not able to clear the hurdle of numerical targets, and I regret that very much,' he said. 'Numerical targets,' he went on, 'can acquire a life of their own and turn into another semiconductor case' - a reference to the two-year-old bilateral agreement aimed at giving the US a 20 per cent share of the Japanese chip market. This has recently fallen to just over 18 per cent, threatening new trade tensions. The most contentious issue in the so-called 'framework' process, which also embraces macro-economic policies, was the US demand that Japan open its domestic market in measurable ways to US exports of telecommunications, medical equipment, cars and car parts, and insurance services. A White House official said Mr Hosokawa had offered 'continuing negotiations' on the car sector, where US sales are tiny. But Mr Clinton had said this would be pointless without 'a change of attitude' on the Japanese side and without even 'a possibility' that agreement could be reached. In the press conference, Mr Clinton disputed at length the Japanese characterisation of the US position, often described as 'managed trade'. He said the US was seeking 'objective criteria' by which progress could be judged and which might encompass exchange rate variables, macro-economic performance and the price and competitiveness of US products. Mr Clinton's reference to exchange rates was taken in the foreign exchange markets as a hint that the US might seek a higher yen. In limited futures trading for March delivery the dollar fell by about one yen. Initial reaction in political and business circles was to commend Mr Clinton for not settling for a cosmetic agreement. Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat, said that ultimately the Japanese government would have 'no alternative but to open its markets'. The American Electronic Association supported the administration's determination to get 'full effective and measurable' access to the Japanese market. An early test case may come next Tuesday when the US trade representative is due to comment on complaints from Motorola about its treatment in the Japanese cellular phone sector.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Game, set, match to the mandarins THE COLLISION OF TWO CIVILISATIONS: THE BRITISH EXPEDITION TO CHINA 1792-4 by Alain Peyrefitte HarperCollins Pounds 20, 621 pages THIS is a very remarkable book, not only for its contents but also on account of its structure. It is very long - 621 pages dealing with the 22 months that it took Lord McCartney to take his diplomatic mission to China and back. He hoped to establish an embassy at the Celestial Court. He failed utterly, so 600 pages may seem a very generous amount of space and the method adopted by Peyrefitte may seem leisurely indeed. The art of Peyrefitte lies in his use of chapters. Chapter I begins with McCartney's departure from Portsmouth on September 26 1792; 80 chapters later, on September 6 1794, McCartney drops his anchor in Portsmouth, his mission completed. Each day of McCartney's journey is covered; no chapter is less than three pages and none more than nine. This could have led to tedious monotony but Peyrefitte at times allows himself to cover considerable periods in short chapters - the outward and inward journeys, for instance, mentioning only incidents such as stopping at St Helena on the way back. However, he uses these repetitive days of sailing very neatly: on the journey from Madeira to the Cape Verde Islands, for example, he sketches the political and social climate in which McCartney had pursued his career and, in the next chapter, as they skim along before the trade winds, the outlines of his biography are covered and the structure of his character delineated. Once China is reached the chronological tempo is diminished: chapters cover a few days, some only one. And here the longueurs are again avoided by discussions of Chinese food, buildings, dress, agriculture, women's feet, pederasty among the Mandarins, etc. The history and geography of China in general, and of the Manchu world in particular, are conveyed with remarkable economy and clarity and, when the long journey is completed, not only is the enormity of the disaster revealed but so is its inevitability. During the journey Peyrefitte weaves a vivid tapestry. He brings alive the Chinese countryside, the harshness and monotony of the landscape of the north, and the vivid sub-tropical South with its richness of colour and abundance of produce. He brings home to us the vast size of the Chinese Empire with its teeming peasantry and multitudinous craftsmen and merchants, outpopulating Europe, including Russia. For four thousand years, in spite of civil wars, the infiltration of Buddhism and thousands of peasant uprisings, the institutions of government had strengthened, not weakened. Furthermore, China had enjoyed a considerable technological advantage over the world beyond its bounds, especially in hydraulics. Peyrefitte makes us see how reasonable was the mandarins' and emperors' monumental conceit and why they regarded McCartney's eruption into their world as an unseemly irritant to be got rid of, with courtesy but minimal cordiality, as soon as possible. As chapter follows chapter the characters - McCartney, his deputy Staunton and his scientists and artists - become rounded personalities. Peyrefitte understands their bafflement, at times their wonder, but, more importantly, he stresses as day follows day the growth of a more critical attitude towards the Chinese and their society, with the filth, the disease, the absurd dependence on necromancy, the attitude to women. For McCartney their utter failure to show the slightest interest in the Western technological marvels which he had brought the emperor as presents completed his disillusion. Voltaire's image of China (based on self-flattering reports from Jesuit missionaries) as a well-ordered state created by philosophers - stable, rich, with outstanding technical skill and effortless wisdom - vanished. McCartney now realised that the Chinese empire would never change, except through force. As Peyrefitte so wisely points out, even force and decades of Maoist communism have been unable to break down these cultural attitudes that have been building up like a coral reef for 4000 years. Hatred and fear of foreigners, the rock-like belief that the Chinese way is always the best, and best interpreted by aged men, still persist. Chris Patten should read this book. Although most of what Peyrefitte writes about is based on the work of scholars, he has discovered two new sources of the highest value which he uses with skill: one, the annotations made by the emperor himself in scarlet ink on edicts and documents relating to the embassy, and the other an astonishing, clear-eyed, perceptive diary of young Thomas Staunton, a boy of 12, the only Englishman on McCartney's staff to speak, write and read Chinese. By the time he returned home at 14 he had come to the right conclusion - that it would take war to break open China; he spent his life promoting it. This is a wonderful book, a work of very high intelligence and remarkable clarity, suffused with wisdom and a deep sense of the problems of human existence and cultures. It is a very great achievement and the small chapters make it easy to devour.</p>

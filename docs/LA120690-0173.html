			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: TEENS NEED TO CLEANSE SKIN MILDLY  </P> <P> Preventive skin care for teen-age boys and girls needs to include no more than  a daily routine of mild cleansing, moisturizing and sun protection -- plus  regular shampooing for oily hair, said Dr. Ellen Gendler, a New York  dermatologist.  </P> <P> "The single most important criterion of any skin care routine is that it  neither aggravate an existing acne problem nor bring on breakouts where there  were none before," Gendler said.  </P> <P> Wash your skin morning and evening with a cleanser designed to provide a rich  lather without drying. Limit exfoliants or scrubs to twice a month since they  can be irritating to acne-prone skin. For oily skin, use a mild, low-alcohol  toner. If you are using acne medication, however, a toner can aggravate your  skin. For dry skin, apply a greaseless moisturizer that won't clog pores. And  use a sun block of at least SPF 15.  </P> <P> "Although most people are aware of the danger of prolonged exposure to the sun,  few realize that the greatest damage comes from exposure before the age of 20,"  Gendler said.  </P> <P> "Nature has given us two ears but only one mouth." -- Benjamin Disraeli  (1804-1881)  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: DFS given Pounds 271m valuation - Chairman and his family will raise Pounds 129m from sale of 47.7% stake MR GRAHAM KIRKHAM, executive chairman of DFS Furniture, and his family yesterday raised Pounds 129m when their sale of 47.7 per cent of the shares in the specialist upholstery retail chain was underwritten at 260p a share. The remaining 51.7 per cent stake he and his family will have after flotation is worth Pounds 140m at the issue price, and the whole company is valued at Pounds 271.1m. Mr Kirkham will not sell any further shares for a year. He will have a three-year fixed-term contract with a remuneration package worth about Pounds 300,000. He said the length of his contract and his continuing substantial investment in the shares showed his commitment to the company. The issue price gives an historic p/e for the year to August 1 of 19.7, on earnings per share of 13.2p, before non-recurring costs. Profits included a Pounds 868,000 gain on the sale of land, and excluding that the p/e would have been about 20 1/2 . DFS said that had it been quoted, it would have paid a dividend for the year of 6.4p, giving a notional yield of 3.1 per cent, covered 2.1 times. The rating is at a slight premium to the stores sector. J Henry Schroder Wagg, sponsor to the issue, said the pricing reflected investor demand. Profits before tax and non-recurring items have risen from Pounds 4.7m in 1989 to Pounds 20.8m in 1993. DFS said it expected to maintain its growth rate, and said current trading was in line with expectations. Operating margins should be maintained at last year's 16.3 per cent. The group, which has 24 upholstery stores and three shops selling dining furniture, has funded its expansion entirely through cash flow and plans to continue that policy. It has Pounds 16m of cash. The flotation comprises a placing of 32.5m shares and a public offer of 17.5m shares. Applications close on November 17 with the basis of allocation expected the following day. Dealings are due to start on November 24. NatWest Wood Mackenzie is broker to the issue. COMMENT It is rare in the stores sector, or even in the stock market, to find a company with apparently assured and rapid growth, and no financing problems. The only question is whether it is too much of a one-man band. But Mr Kirkham is still young, and seems as committed as ever to running the business. The DFS issue should be a success. Analysts are looking for the p/e to come down to under 18 in the current year which looks attractive.</p>

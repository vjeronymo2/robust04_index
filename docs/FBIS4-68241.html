			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by H. Pryshchepa, instructor at the Department of </F> Air Force Tactics at Chernihiv VVAUL [higher military aviation  school for pilots], under the rubric "Reaction": "The L-39 Will  Yet Prove Useful. Concerning Some Problems in Training Military  Pilots"]    [Text] In articles devoted to issues associated with  the building of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, NARODNA ARMIYA has  often dealt with the urgent problem of flight personnel  training. In particular, the article "How To Train Military  Pilots," published on 9 December 1993, focused on the need to  create a method system of instruction for students in military  educational institution [vnz] and of additional training for  officers and on the need to develop training and combat-training  airplanes for this purpose. Continuing the discussion on this  subject, an experienced professional offers an opportune  suggestion.    We know that frontline aviation and the aviation of the Air  Defense Forces [PPO] are currently in a very difficult situation  due to the economic crisis in which our Ukraine now finds  herself. Command headquarters is doing everything it can to make  it possible for pilots to fly, but, unfortunately, it has very  limited supplies of materials and equipment, fuel and  lubricants, and its ability to replace aviation equipment is  also limited. Nonetheless, there is a solution.    During this severe economic crisis, I propose using a new  system requiring only modest expenditures for training young  pilots for our Air Force and Air Defense Forces. The point of  this system is to enable all flight school graduates to complete  the new program in one and one-half to two years and attain the  level of first-class grade using the L-39 training airplane.  There are many of these planes in Ukraine, and the available  number of them makes it possible to use them for this purpose  for the next few years. The fact that these planes use small  amounts of fuel will allow each pilot to accumulate from 80 to  100 flight hours per year.    In order to accomplish this purpose, a center for training  fighter pilots first class, bomber pilots first class, and  navigators first class could be created at the existing  Chernihiv VVAUL, for example. The school offers a material base  and a trained staff of pilots.    The most important elements in fighter pilot training are  aerobatic flying [vyshchyy pilotazh], air combat with fighter  airplanes, attacking ground targets involving simple and complex  maneuvers, and flying by day and by night in clouds in poor  weather. Can pilots not be taught all this at low cost on the  L-39's? Later, a pilot trained to this degree can be retrained  at an already existing base (the same Chernihiv base) on a  fighter plane with an additional 15-20 hours for pilot training  and combat use of the new sighting mechanism, and the best of  them can also be trained to serve as instructors.    There will be those who will say that the L-39 is not a  MIG-20 nor a SU-25. I agree. But where are we to get the money  to train pilots to achieve the rank of airman first class and  and airman second class on the MIG-29, which burns as much fuel  in one flight as the L-39 during an entire flight shift? I am  also relying on my own experience. I received my basic training  on the MIG-21 BIS. I retrained on MIG-23's of almost all  modifications, the MIG-29, and the SU-17MC without any  difficulty and in a short period of time. I regard myself as a  pilot with average skills, the kind that make up the majority in  Ukraine and the world over. Even a three-year interval during  which I did not fly while studying at the academy did not result  in the loss of the skills I had acquired earlier.    A young officer coming to a unit after training in such a  center will not be merely "personnel" ["shtatna odynytsya"]; he  will be "combat personnel" ["boyova odynytsya"]. He will need  only 25-30 hours of training on a combat airplane per year to  retain his form and 20-30 hours on the same L-39. I see no  better solution in the present difficult situation.</p>

North Korean  Citizens Bring Eight Kilograms of Heroin Into Russia"]    [Text] Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned from  competent sources that a successful operation was conducted in  Maritime Kray a few days ago to stop an attempt to smuggle  heroin from North Korea into Russia. The operation in this case  was mounted simultaneously by several agencies: the Russian  Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate for Combating Illicit  Turnover of Drugs; the kray internal affairs administration; the  Pacific Fleet Counterintelligence Service; border troops; and  the local directorate of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service. According to information available to the editorial  office, the events developed in the following manner: On 9  June, operatives held two citizens of North Korea on suspicion  of smuggling in a big amount of narcotics from the territory of  the DPRK. Their names have not been disclosed at the  investigation's request. The detectives' expectations were  justified: The check turned up eight kilograms of heroin in the  possession of these citizens. Both North Koreans were arrested.  Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The DPRK is a unique  enclave where a Stalinist regime has been preserved in a  classical form. The population in that country is under total  surveillance by the special services, and to go abroad one has  to go through the strictest screening. To smuggle such a large  amount of the narcotic from North Korea without the deliberate  connivance of the authorities appears most improbable. The  value of the heroin seized from the DPRK citizens is $1 million  at the going rate on the world drugs market, which is all the  more impressive against the backdrop of the economic plight of  Kim Il-song's regime.</p>

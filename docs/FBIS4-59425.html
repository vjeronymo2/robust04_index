			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "The Tea Breaks Remain, The </F> Power Has Gone"]    [Text] The Histadrut's Executive Committee might continue  to take its incessant tea breaks for some time to come, but  Labor lost power yesterday. It suffered a crushing, painful,  and humiliating defeat when for the first time in 73 years it  lost its hegemony over the Histadrut Labor Federation.    It could be called "an earthquake," or "an upheaval," but  Knesset Member Avraham Burg was closer to the mark when he said:  "We have been screwed." The blow is much more painful because  Labor brought the downfall upon itself. Just as in 1977 Labor  under Rabin did not feel the public had grown sick and tired of  it, and that its loss of power was written on the wall, in 1994  Labor under Rabin did not read the map properly and lost power a  second time.    Labor old-timers can shed tears over not paying attention to  Hayim Ramon's prophesy about the mass suicide of the whales.  The whales are now in their death throes on the beaches, and  depend on the goodwill of Ramon, Sarid, and Der'i to admit them  into the Histadrut coalition. [Histadrut forefather] Berl  Katznelson is now turning in his grave.    Ramon's impressive victory, especially since he had only a  short time to organize, is proof of the desire by voters -- even  among the Haberfeld supporters, who failed to turn up at the  polls -- to punish Labor in general, and Labor in the Histadrut  in particular. The main blow was suffered by the party  bureaucracy and personally by Rabin and Peres, who permitted it  to happen.    Labor last night talked about "soul searching," and "the  immediate return of the deportees," but from today on, it is a  new ball game. Overnight, Ramon jumped from a position of  asking for favors to one of dictating terms. And in his new  status, and with lots of allies in his former party, Ramon is  precipitating Labor into a period of shocks which could end not  only with the "clearing away" of the entire generation following  Rabin and Peres, but (perhaps) also end the careers of Rabin and  Peres themselves. The two can forget about running for top  office in 1996.    Ramon, a product of the system of direct elections and  telegenic politics, will run against Ehud Baraq and then perhaps  against Bibi Netanyahu. Now, for the first time there is a  chance that the young will take over the reins of power before  old age creeps up on them. Our politics jumped two grades  yesterday.    Ramon's impressive victory provides him with several  alternatives. The most striking is that he now has the  infrastructure to set up a new center party with Meretz and part  of Labor, which one day will be able to set up a young and fresh  government with a wider-ranging parliamentary base than Rabin  and Peres managed to achieve in the 20 years they ruled the  party.    There is only one small obstacle in the path opened up to  Ramon yesterday: He has to be secretary general of the  Histadrut, fulfill all his promises, deal with a 35 billion  shekel deficit in the pension funds, cut, sell, defend, close  down, and what not. If he is made of the right stuff and if he  shows us he can perform as well as he talks, the sky is the  limit.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Letter: Government finances finite? Sir, I read with considerable interest Joe Rogaly's article 'Deep mine of discontent' (October 17), but there is one point which seems particularly bothersome in the present economic mess we are in, and that is the state of the government's own finances. The extent to which the National Debt is doomed to increase, and the ongoing reliance on a continuing high level of new borrowing by the government, would seem to raise the spectre in the not-too-distant future of government being unable to meet its commitments when borrowings mature owing to its inability to obtain yet further borrowings. I would be delighted to hear that this is an impossible situation, but is it? If a government can see nothing wrong in a prime minister and a chancellor stating assertively that there will be no devaluation, permitting overseas investment in gilts on the back of that promise, and then allowing the chancellor to remain in office after devaluation has taken place, it would seem entirely comprehensible that it might welsh on its debts. If it did not want to tell overseas investors they could not have their money back, it would be a simple domestic matter to tell domestic investors in National Savings products and gilts that the substance of their investments would not be repaid, pleading force majeure. Or am I being too fanciful? I hope so for the sake of my remaining years of retirement. G M Armitage, 99 Overstrand Road, Cromer, Norfolk NR27 0DJ</p>

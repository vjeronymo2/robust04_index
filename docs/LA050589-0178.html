			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EX-CHAMP EXONERATED IN SEX CASE  </P> <P> Trevor Berbick, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, was found not  guilty of sexually assaulting a Halifax teen-ager in her parents' house four  years ago.  </P> <P> In handing down his verdict Thursday, Judge Felix Cacchione said he did not  find the teen-ager, now 19, a credible witness. There were too many  inconsistencies in her testimony, he said.  </P> <P> Berbick, 36, who once lived in Nova Scotia and now lives in Florida, said he is  relieved by the decision. But he said the court case robbed him of his  concentration and cost him millions of dollars in potential fight earnings.  </P> <P> The Jamaican-born boxer won the WBC heavyweight title in 1986 but lost it a  year later to Mike Tyson.  </P></p>

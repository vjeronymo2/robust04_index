			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APPLES WILL REAPPEAR IN SCHOOL CAFETERIAS; STATE CALLS FRUIT SAFE  </P> <P> School districts began taking steps Friday to restore apples and related  products to cafeteria menus, as the state's top health and education officials  added their voices to the chorus of government agencies declaring the fruit  safe to eat.  </P> <P> Scores of districts in California and throughout the nation hastily banned the  fruit this week, following the lead of the nation's two largest school systems,  Los Angeles Unified and New York City schools, which had stopped serving apples  in any form because of fears about Alar, a growth-regulating chemical used on  some apple crops.  </P> <P> Most districts contacted Friday said they expect to begin offering the fruit  again after students return from next week's spring break.  </P> <P> "It's a relief it's over," said Joyce Pinto, supervisor of food services for  the ABC Unified School District, which includes Cerritos, Artesia and Lakewood.  "I think (the danger) was a bit exaggerated."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, some school districts were still refusing to serve apples  to students Friday until they received written assurances from the U.S.  Department of Agriculture that the fruit was not tainted with a chemical called  daminozide, authorities said.  </P> <P> Although federal and state agencies officially discounted Thursday a report  that apples treated with the chemical pose a health risk, most local school  district officials said they were still playing it safe and waiting for letters  from Department of Agriculture officials following further testing of apple  products.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the South Bay Union Elementary school district, with 8,700  students, said that, although the district had heard that the apples are safe,  a decision had not been made about whether to serve apples to the students.  </P> <P> In Alpine, apples are not considered "on hold' because they were never  scheduled to be on this week's menu anyway. Next week is Spring Break, and the  district expects to hear from USDA officials before classes begin again.  </P> <P> Bonsall Union Elementary, Borrego Springs Unified, Encinitas Union Elementary,  Fallbrook Union Elementary, Lemon Grove Elementary, Oceanside Unified, South  Bay Union Elementary, Sweetwater Union High and Valley Center Union Elementary  were not serving apples.  </P> <P> San Diego Unified school district, the state's second-largest, Cajon Valley  Union Elementary school district and several other districts are serving the  fruit after being informed by suppliers that their apples are not sprayed with  the chemical.  </P> <P> After a weeklong ban, Los Angeles school district Supt. Leonard Britton said  Thursday that apples and some related products could again be served in school  cafeterias, basing his decision on results of laboratory tests showing the  items to be safe. The federal government also formally declared Thursday that  it is safe to eat apples.  </P> <P> By Friday morning some Los Angeles district schools began placing apple orders  with the district's central food warehouse, where about 450,000 apples are in  storage, a district official said.  </P> <P> State Food and Agriculture Director Jack Parnell, Health Services Director  Kenneth W. Kizer and Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig also announced  Friday that Alar levels of only 1/400th to 1/1,000th the federal safety  standard of 20 parts per million were found in samples of apples and apple  products taken from Department of Education storehouses in Pomona and  Sacramento.  </P> <P> None of the tested apples or apple products had levels of daminozide, the  chemical from which Alar is made, of more than .055 parts per million.  Daminozide has been linked to cancer in laboratory studies.  </P> <P> Charges of Alar's dangers, particularly among young children, were made last  month by a New York-based group called the Natural Resources Defense Council.  </P> <P> "We have a lot more significant health problems" than apples with trace amounts  of Alar, said Honig, who joined the other officials at a news conference in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy to Continue  </P> <P> He said the state Department of Education, which supplies schools with apple  products from U.S. Department of Agriculture surpluses, will continue to accept  apples from crops treated with Alar. He added, however, that if the federal  government bans the chemical, "it's not going to break our heart."  </P> <P> Neither Kizer nor Honig said he is prepared to take the extreme step --  advocated by some environmentalists -- of requiring schools to serve only  chemical-free fruits and vegetables to pupils. According to Kizer, there is  insufficient scientific data to support such action.  </P> <P> The New York City school system, which serves one million students, was the  first district in the country to drop apples from the menu until federal  authorities could verify the fruit's safety. An official there said Friday that  administrators will meet Monday to decide when to resume serving apples and  products made from them.  </P> <P> Woo reported from Los Angeles and Morain from San Francisco.

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Avonmore down 9% to IPounds 10m Correction (published 10th September 1994) appended to this article. Weak milk margins hit Avonmore Foods, the expanding Irish dairy and meat processor, which yesterday reported a 9 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits to IPounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.99m) on sales 15 per cent ahead at IPounds 592m. Mr John Duggan, chairman, said international markets for dairy products had yielded noticeably lower returns in the first half. 'This impacted adversely on margins in the Irish milk business,' he said. As a result, the dairy division's operating profit rose just 8.7 per cent to IPounds 8.46m, on a 36 per cent jump in sales to IPounds 320.4m. Sales were boosted by the acquisition in July last year of the Dairy Crest liquid milk business. Mr Duggan said the division had also suffered an adverse impact from the longer-than-expected integration of the liquid milk operations in the south of England. The meat operation was hit by weaker markets throughout Europe, particularly in Germany. Profits fell from IPounds 3.9m to IPounds 2.8m on sales down by 5 per cent at IPounds 204.4m. Profits in the agricultural business fell from IPounds 5.91m to IPounds 5.4m on sales up by IPounds 3.2m to IPounds 67.3m. The dividend was increased by 6.5 per cent to 1.65p. Earnings per share fell almost 11 per cent to 4.8p. CORRECTION In yesterday's FT it was reported that Avonmore Foods had issued a profits warning. While the company reported a reduction of 9 per cent in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year, it did not issue a warning about future profits.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt attracts bargain-hunters in heavy volume THE WAR between negative and positive views on the German market tilted in favour of the enthusiasts yesterday, as bargain-hunters were seen in Frankfurt and other markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had to accommodate the collapse of steel pay talks and the drop in Tokyo, and yet the DAX put on another 6.96 to 1,622.67 after a gain of 6.18 to 658.69 for the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose from DM6.2bn to DM6.9bn, led by Siemens which traded in a relatively huge DM1.4bn as it rose DM6.60 to DM642.60, followed in turnover terms by Deutsche Bank and Daimler; Veba, the energy group, came fourth as it rose DM4.70 to DM368.10. The feeling persisted that opinion was moving towards a more responsible approach to annual wage rises, offering the chance of an interest rate cut if the Bundesbank saw real evidence of change. One professional, however, warned that speculators had taken the initiative again and that investors might need to be careful. Sensitive individual stocks moved either way, AMB by DM18 to DM808 on its takeover attractions; meanwhile, a previous target, Nixdorf, fell DM45 to DM133, having been suspended after Siemens, which had been willing to pay DM225 a share cash for a larger minority, sought to accumulate the remaining 5 per cent or so with a paper offer worth only DM107 a share. PARIS ran into light profit-taking in volatile trading after its gains last week. The CAC 40 index closed down 13.15 at 1,824.29, just off the day's low of 1,821.85 and well off the day's high of 1,839.20. Turnover was estimated at around FFr2bn after Friday's FFr3.6bn. In building materials, Lafarge was among the day's losers, falling FFr23 or 6.7 per cent to FFr318 after on a sharp drop in profits for 1991. Weekend comments by the chairman, Mr Bertrand Collomb, that he saw no immediate sign of a pick-up also dashed hopes for 1992. Euro Disney fell as low as FFr145.50 on news that it faced a claim for FFr850m in allegedly unpaid accounts from 16 French building contractors. It later recovered to close FFr2.20 down at FFr146.30 with 314,700 shares traded. Lyonnaise des Eaux continued its downtrend, falling FFr14 or FFr429, this time on reports that the problems at a US subsidiary were worse than expected. MILAN overcame a weak start to end flat in technical trading as monthly options expired. Options on all stocks were taken up, with the exception of Olivetti and Pirelli. Trading was expected to remain technical until the close of the January trading account on Wednesday. The Comit index eased 0.7 to 530.97 in turnover estimated at L110bn after Friday's relatively heavy L140bn. Among industrials, Fiat fell L87 to L4,990 and Pirelli eased L6 to L1,045. Dealers reported a good market in telecoms, with Sip rising L18 to L1,490 and Stet up L7 at L2,215. ZURICH eased in thin volume, the Credit Suisse index falling 3.2 to 462.5. MADRID closed slightly off in steady trading, the general index falling 0.60 to 252.49 after falling sharply in morning dealings, and then recovering as last week's predictions of a 0.4 per cent increase in the December inflation rate were revised to a 0.01 per cent rise. STOCKHOLM was fractionally higher after a weak opening. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 4.0 to 958.0 in turnover of SKr384m after SKr502m. Astra, the pharmaceutical company, saw its A unrestricted shares fall SKr14 to SKr566 on rumours that the company was going to open all share categories to foreigners. The margin between restricted and unrestricted shares has narrowed recently. OSLO rose on domestic buying following the gloom at the end of last year. The all-share index rose 6.85, or 1.6 per cent to 436.89 in moderate trading worth a total of NKr318m. Higher prices for North Sea oil took Saga Petroleum free shares up NKr6 to NKr90. Anecdotal evidence of better tanker rates left Bergesen B up NKr6 to NKr6 in very good volume; and talk of a return to profits in banking saw Den norske Bank restricted up NKr2.20 to NKr12.20 in 715,000 shares. HELSINKI rose 2.9 per cent, the Hex index putting on another 23.4 to 853.3, 11.5 per cent up from its 1991-92 low of 765.2 only three weeks ago. AMSTERDAM rebounded from a weak opening to close near the session's highs on the prospect of lower interest rates. The CBS Tendency Index closed at 116.6, 0.4 on the day. ISTANBUL gained 1.2 per cent in active buying ahead of the economy package due to be unveiled on Thursday. The index rose 55.49 in the sixth straight day of gains to end at 4,691.25, the highest since 4,700.77 on March 20 last year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am   12 pm   1 pm    2 pm    3 pm     close 1103.50  1103.65  1105.61 1106.65 1106.73 1105.46 1105.35  1105.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1107.34    Day's Low  1103.37  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 10    Jan 9    Jan 8     Jan 7     Jan 6 1105.40   1100.02  1080.21   1086.06   1092.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

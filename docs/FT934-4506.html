			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Sawallisch's Strauss - Concert On Tuesday the London Philharmonic had Wolfgang Sawallisch again as their conductor, in the Royal Festival Hall. He is 70 now, and one of the last masters of his generation: infinitely knowledgeable about the Austro-German repertoire, hugely skilled at making his orchestras understand what he wants and play up to it. We should treasure Sawallisch. The LPO played Strauss's auto-celebratory Symphonia Domestica for him. It is the composer's most unnecessary big work. It came at the fag-end of his 'symphonic poems', in 1903 - even before the Salome which turned him into an opera-composer for the remaining half of his long life. Enthusiasts praise the intricacy of its counterpoint: all those marital and familial Leitmotiven so forcibly welded together, in opulent orchestral dress. But the original model was surely the three-tunes conjunction in Wagner's Meistersinger Overture - the Mastersingers, the Prize Song and the Apprentices all at once. (Having read the programme-notes, we pride ourselves upon noticing that.) Liszt's reaction to it was scathingly honest: something like 'Ah, so you're doing counterpoint then]' There is a great gap between that kind of conscious exercise, like Strauss's Symphonia, and (say) the vital, fluent interplay of parts in Tristan. On the other hand, every musical element in the Symphonia boasts Strauss's hallmark. If there is something factitious about the 'symphonism', his ubiquitous personality is vivid and real as could be. Sawallisch has always struck me as a pragmatic, intelligently sceptical interpreter, disinclined to attach weight to anything but what is actually embedded in the notes. Here, he captured the lusty colours and the just emphases for every moment in the inflated score; the result was transparent far beyond the norm, superbly controlled and grandly disarming. Earlier, he introduced us to Werner Egk's 1949 'French Suite after Rameau', which few of us will ever hear again. Its five movements are bright, angular, quirky fantasies on harpsichord pieces by Rameau: some dissonant birdsong, a jack-booted Gigue, a smoochy elaboration of 'Les tendres Plaintes'. They fairly breathe their sweet-and-sour postwar period, which Sawallisch must know through and through. From 30-odd years ago I retain friendly memories of Egk's Die Verlobung in San Domingo a Latin-American film noir piece, and hope that the ENO may one of these days try it on. In Bruch's celebrated G minor violin concerto - period stuff - Sawallisch supplied a faultlessly sympathetic accompaniment for young Leonidas Kavakos, replacing the phenomenal Maxim Vengerov. (That still-younger Siberian emigrated a few years ago to Israel, and has been called up for his National Service there; we must hope that he does not hurt a finger or a wrist, for he is irreplaceable.) No invidious comparisons: the Kavakos technique was equal to every demand, and his plain, open sincerity shone where more seasoned and cynical violinists resort to flashy tricks-of-the-trade. We shall hear much more of him.</p>

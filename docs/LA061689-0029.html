			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COULD CAUSE RECRUITING PROBLEMS;  </P> <P> 'WESTHEAD LEAVING' RUMORS FLY AS FAST AS LOYOLA'S ATTACK  </P> <P> The sports rumor mills have worked overtime since Paul Westhead arrived as  basketball coach at Loyola Marymount, especially in the last two years when  Westhead's teams have set scoring records and appeared in the NCAA playoffs.  </P> <P> Westhead has been mentioned for virtually every coaching opening from Stanford  to Washington to Texas to Providence. Reports have had him interviewing across  the country, from sea to shining sea, from the high and mighty (Kentucky) to  the lowly and downtrodden (Clippers).  </P> <P> The rumors and Westhead sightings have stopped just short of the supermarket  tabloids linking him to extraterrestrial teams and recruiting Elvis.  </P> <P> Funny thing is, Westhead has not actively sought another job since coming to  Loyola four years ago and has rarely been contacted by the dozens of teams  supposedly craving him.  </P> <P> The latest stops on the reported Westhead itinerary were the University of  Maryland and the New York Knicks. The Baltimore Sun reported that Westhead was  a prospective candidate for the Maryland opening; apparently that was  speculation. Maryland did talk to several coaches -- including USC's George  Raveling -- before hiring Gary Williams from Ohio State. But Westhead said he  "was never involved" in the Maryland hiring process.  </P> <P> So the day Williams was hired at College Park, another report hit the news  wires saying Westhead was talking to Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi. And,  indeed, Westhead said he had spoken with Bianchi this week. But, Westhead said,  linking a conversation with Bianchi to a job offer was jumping to a conclusion.  It was merely a conversation between old friends, Westhead said, about  everything but the job opening.  </P> <P> And what about Newsday's report that the two talked business? "I did speak  (with Newsday) and made it very clear we did not talk about the job," Westhead  said. "There's nothing to it."  </P> <P> Westhead said the constant job rumors are more amusing than irritating. "It's  not like every week you're indicted for something," he joked. "I don't put a  lot of stock in (rumors) but I don't find it annoying. If your name is being  mentioned, I guess the spill-off is it's a compliment."  </P> <P> He has found that it can cause anxious moments when recruiting. "It is curious  when I talk to a prospective recruit," he said. "They or their parents will  invariably say, 'We hear you're leaving.' My feeling is it's kind of  interesting. I'm here starting my fifth year and the rumors always come from  places where the coach has been there a lot less than five years. But if the  recruit is concerned, there could be damage."  </P> <P> One signing was held up recently when Westhead's name surfaced for the Kentucky  job. Tony Walker, a guard out of Ventura College, finally signed a few days  later. The Kentucky job wasn't filled until last week, when Rick Pitino was  hired away from the Knicks.  </P> <P> While the Westhead rumor mill continues to churn, he said his summer travel  schedule is built around recruiting for Loyola, scouting the high school  all-star camps and tournaments at Princeton, N.J., Santa Barbara and Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Westhead, who last coached in the National Basketball Assn. in 1983, has always  maintained that he would listen to an attractive offer (Knicks?) but is happy  at Loyola, where his fifth team -- with a nucleus of Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble  and Jeff Fryer -- appears capable of a West Coast Athletic Conference title and  a three-peat in the WCAC Tournament.  </P> <P> Westhead's only other coaching plans for the summer involve a fast-break clinic  in Great Falls, Mont.  </P> <P> "They told me they have the greatest hunting in the country there," he said. "I  said, 'I don't hunt.' They said they have some of the best fishing in America.  I said, 'I don't fish.' They said they have a couple of the best golf courses  around. I don't golf. But they said, 'C'mon up anyway, we'll have a great  clinic.' "  </P> <P> Hmm, sounds fishy. Is there a coaching opening at the College of Great Falls?  </P> <P> Back spasms cost Loyola star Hank Gathers a possible spot on the U.S. team that  is competing in Mexico City to qualify for the World Games. The 6-foot-7  Gathers was reportedly  </P> <P> felt he was not sufficiently healed to accompany the team to Mexico.  </P> <P> Gathers is back in Los Angeles, Gathers is back in Los Angeles, has resumed  normal workouts and training and said he felt that he made a good impression on  pro scouts who attended the workouts. Westhead, who attended part of the  tryouts, said Gathers "was certainly everyone's equal" and "was clearly in the  plans" of U.S. Coach Bobby Cremins. "The spasms took a couple of days to cool  down. It's nothing really serious. He's back lifting weights."  </P> <P> Although the West Coast Athletic Conference hasn't been considered one of the  nation's premier basketball leagues, WCAC teams did well in the 1980s. As the  WCAC prepares to enter a new decade, it will be building on a 10-year winning  percentage of .550. The WCAC's eight teams played better than 200 games above  .500 at 1,185-971.  </P> <P> Three teams played above .600: Pepperdine (187-110, .630), Santa Clara  (178-113, .612) and San Francisco (123-80, .606). Three more were above .500:  Gonzaga (157-106, .597), St. Mary's (147-130, .531) and Loyola (138-137, .502),  and San Diego was right behind at 134-138 (.493). Only Portland was truly in  arrears, at 121-157 (.435). Over the last four seasons Loyola has won nearly  two-thirds of its games at 79-42.  </P> <P> During the decade, half the teams had top seasons of 25 wins or more -- Loyola,  Pepperdine, San Diego and USF.  </P> <P> Pepperdine makes a pretty good case for being the WCAC's program of the decade.  Not only did the Waves have the best record in men's basketball, they also were  tops in baseball at 397-203 (.662) and won every WCAC baseball title for the  last six years. The Waves were also strong in volleyball and tennis.  </P> <P> College Notes:  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount lost its top baseball recruit to the pros. Third baseman Andy  Fox out of Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento was a second-round  choice in the pro draft and signed with the Yankees this week for a large bonus  . . . Loyola outfielder Travis Tarchione, who was not drafted last week, has  signed a pro contract with Salt Lake City. Teammate Miah Bradbury, a junior who  was expected to be taken in the first couple of rounds, is reportedly  disappointed at being a sixth-round pick and is leaning toward returning to  Loyola. The catcher was selected by the Phillies . . . Cal State Dominguez  Hills golfers Jeff Manare and Rick Chartrand have received All-Region honors .  . . Dominguez Hills soccer players Chris Wilson and Kristi White have been  named to the West Regional Olympic Development teams, making them part of the  talent pool that will provide the 1992 Olympic teams.  </P></p>

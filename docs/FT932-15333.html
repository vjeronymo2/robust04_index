			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: UK must learn a lesson from European partners Sir, Your editorial, 'Labour and industry' (April 7), stressed the importance of institutional relationships (labour-management relations, pay, etc) inside companies instead of technological quick-fixes. The politics of free collective bargaining practised through the 1980s bumped up labour costs in Britain far above its competitors'. The increases in productivity brought about by mass redundancies (2.3m manufacturing jobs disappeared between 1980 and 1990) could not compensate. You refer to the 'miracle companies of the east' but one of the most striking aspects of their pay relations is the much smaller ratio between salaries paid to workers and to top executives. In Britain, this gap has widened significantly, is widening and must diminish before the more harmonious workplace you rightly identify as the key to success can come into being. Perhaps, instead of a statutory minimum wage, Labour should propose a statutory maximum one. I also question the endless reference to Asia. Surely there are plenty of European examples of countries which manage their affairs better than Britain. Small ones such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland have better records in industrial output, trade and so on. And despite horrendous difficulties occasioned by unification or political stasis, the economic records of Germany and France are far better over the past decade than the UK's. Institutional relationships in both countries play their part. The new French government has just called in the unions to discuss economic questions while the workers on the board of Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen are working constructively with managers to re-shape the companies. It was sad, therefore, to read the predictable 1980s response of the Confederation of British Industry to Labour's worker directors proposal. At least they merit reasoned discussion. The CBI should try to learn from what works in other countries. Denis MacShane, 54 bis, route des Acacias, Case postale 1516, CH-1227 Geneva, Switzerland</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An American man who served 18 years in a Mexican prison was released at the  border Sunday, only to be jailed again in San Diego because of outstanding  arrest warrants in other states.  </P> <P> Henry Kenneth Wangrow, 59, was convicted of murder and narcotics violations in  Mexico and spent the last 18 years in a Mexican prison, San Diego police  spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> Shortly before 6 a.m. Sunday, Mexican authorities notified the U.S. Immigration  and Naturalization Service that they had released Wangrow from prison and  intended to deport him via the San Ysidro Port of Entry, Robinson said. Police  Officer Rodney Johnson was sent to pick up Wangrow to escort him back to the  United States -- but when Johnson ran a routine records check on Wangrow, it  turned up five outstanding warrants.  </P> <P> Wangrow is wanted in Cook County, Ill., on three felony warrants for burglaries  that occurred between 1965 and 1969, Robinson said. In addition, Wangrow had  two no-bail federal warrants in 1969 and 1970 from the U.S. Marshals'  headquarters in Arlington, Va. Robinson said he did not know the nature of the  federal crimes Wangrow is accused of, but the warrants were issued because  Wangrow failed to appear in court.  </P> <P> Both the U.S. Marshals' office and the authorities in Cook County still want to  prosecute Wangrow, Robinson said. Wangrow is being held in the County Jail  downtown pending extradition proceedings.  </P></p>

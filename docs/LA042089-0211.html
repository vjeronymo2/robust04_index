			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHICKENS THINK IT'S A YOLK;  </P> <P> IT'S NO SHELL GAME, FRENCH FIRM MAKES SQUARE EGGS  </P> <P> Eggs may not all be egg-shaped anymore if a French firm's marketing plan  succeeds in the United States.  </P> <P> In a move that might leave even chickens scratching their heads, the firm hopes  to sell "square eggs" in gourmet shops across the nation soon.  </P> <P> The square eggs are really fully cooked, reconstituted hard egg cubes,  two-thirds of an inch square, currently being marketed by the firm Ov'Action  Inc., of Lieven, France.  </P> <P> One advantage is that they can be cooked in a microwave oven, unlike the  from-the-hen variety whose shells can create a messy explosion if they are  microwaved.  </P> <P> The squares are not available in the United States yet, but federal approval  for a private tasting of the square egg has already been received.  </P> <P> The microwave-cooked, pasteurized and/or homogenized egg cubes contain three  layers of egg -- white on top and bottom and yellow in between. It has a 21-day  shelf life when stored at cool temperatures and sells for around $2 for a  24-pack in some French food stores.  </P> <P> It is supposed to make an excellent salad garnishing or be used in making  canapes for parties and can be served as a substitute for most types of cooked  eggs.  </P></p>

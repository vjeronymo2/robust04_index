			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Crystal designs IN AN age dominated by mass-produced pieces Cumbria Crystal's hand-made full lead crystal stands out as much for the manner of manufacture as for quality of design. Though most designs are based on 18th and 19th century classical antique pieces, lending an air of antiquity, Cumbria Crystal evolved only in 1975, when five friends with an interest in antique glass started a company devoted to producing clear, uncut full lead crystal, using traditional techniques. The original designs, such as Ambleside, are to my mind the nicest - their air of gentle Englishness, of simple but not stark lines, make them desirable vessels for imbibing anything from Elderflower cordial to finest claret. Then there are hard-to-find shapes such as old-fashioned jelly glasses, capacious but clean-lined punch-bowls, decanters, and straight-sided tumblers. Although I prefer the simplest designs the shapes also come with decorative cutting, from the most elegant, Hellvellyn (a favourite of British embassies) to the most ornate, Grasmere (the best-seller). Find Cumbria Glass at Asprey's, Selfridges, Harrods, John Lewis and other quality stores. The Ambleside range, above, costs from Pounds 29 for wine goblets to Pounds 160 for the Captain's decanter. The factory shop at Lightburn Road, Ulverston, Cumbria (tel: 0229-54400) sells cheaper seconds.</p>

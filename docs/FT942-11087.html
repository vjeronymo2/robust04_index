			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 64% increase at Forward Group Forward Group, the specialist circuit board and chemicals manufacturer, raised annual profits by 64 per cent, helped by the first contribution from Central Circuits, a Telford-based company purchased from the receiver in February 1993. Over the 12 months to January 31, pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 2.02m. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 5.6m to turnover which jumped to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 12.5m), and Pounds 595,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.44m). The purchase of Central Circuits widened Forward's manufacturing base, although it has temporarily taken the group closer to the mass market for circuit boards and diluted turnover of its usual specialist low volume, high value business. Looking at the group's main markets, Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said there had been some improvement in the electronics industry, but that telecommunications was more of a growth area than military business. The group's business with medical customers was also growing. Earnings per share rose from 11.06p to 16.71p. The proposed final dividend is 3p, bringing the total to 5p (3.3p).</p>

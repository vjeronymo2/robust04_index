			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the spokesman for the Committee for the </F> Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang, 17  January--read by announcer]    [Text] A Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the  Fatherland [CPRF] spokesman has issued a statement in connection  with the bellicose, absurd remarks made by the South Korean  puppets as soon as the New Year began in order to aggravate  tensions while seeking a large-scale war rehearsal.    A statement of the CPRF spokesman:    With the start of the new year, the South Korean puppets are  making bellicose, absurd remarks aimed at further expanding  provocative war rehearsals and thus aggravating tensions this  year. According to a report, South Korea's so-called hardliners  toward the North and military warmongers said that even if the  Team Spirit joint military exercise were to be suspended this  year, they would expand another kind of South Korea-U.S. joint  military exercise to fill the gap created. In the SEOUL SINMUN,  a paper produced and patronized by the government, they said  that they would conduct a large-scale war rehearsal combining  the two military exercises, Ulchi and Focus Lens, in August in  case the Team Spirit exercise should be suspended.    Prior to this, the South Korean ruler and military leaders,  in a so-called New Year news conference and New Year opening  ceremony, picked on us again and made bellicose, absurd remarks  without hesitation, referring to complete combat readiness and  establishment of an emergency combat posture. While all fellow  countrymen are resolved with high aspirations to make the year  of 1994 a year of achieving national reconciliation and unity  and bringing a turning point for peace and peaceful  reunification, the South Korean authorities are agitating  confrontation and war in their attempt to conduct a new  large-scale war rehearsal in place of the Team Spirit joint  military exercise. This shows that they intend to seek  confrontation and war rather than national reconciliation and  unity again this year.    The CPRF sternly denounces the South Korean puppet clique's  war frenzy of seeking a large-scale war rehearsal against us in  order to aggravate the North-South relations and lead the  situation on the Korean peninsula to a grave catastrophe, with  the start of the new year, and brands it an open challenge to  the entire nation that desires alleviation of tension, peace,  and peaceful reunification.    As has been known, as a measure to resolve the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit  joint military exercise in South Korea is on the order of the  day. At a time like this, the South Korean authorities are  scheming to conduct another kind of large-scale joint military  exercise to replace the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  thus attempting to put a brake on the progress of the DPRK-U.S.  talks and to lay a new grave obstacle to resolving the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula.    Even if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended  in South Korea, if another joint military exercise is conducted,  the suspension of the Team Spirit nuclear war rehearsal will in  fact become meaningless. If things turn out this way  [ironsiguro nagandamyon], the nuclear issue cannot be resolved  on the Korean peninsula, nor can the alleviation of tensions or  peace be realized, and a more dangerous war situation will  prevail instead. The South Korean ruling bunch should never  miscalculate [opan] our demand to suspend the provocative  large-scale war rehearsal.    We are not only prepared for dialogue but are well prepared  for war as well. No matter how precious peace may be, we will  never beg for it. We will resolutely counter [taecho] reckless  acts of provokers.    Confrontation, war, and civilian democracy [munmin] are  incompatible. If the South Korean authorities that claim  themselves to be advocates of civilian democracy, continue to  follow the road of confrontation and war in collusion with  foreign forces, ignoring fellow countrymen who desire  reconciliation, unity, detente, and peace, they will certainly  pay a dear price for the nation.    [Dated] 17 January 1994, Pyongyang.</p>

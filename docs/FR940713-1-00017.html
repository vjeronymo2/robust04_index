			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The costs associated with foodborne illness attributable to improperly handled poultry are thus substantial in both human and monetary terms, and the Department has undertaken a comprehensive program of research, regulation, and consumer education to try to improve the situation. The reduction of foodborne pathogens on meat, meat food, and poultry products remains the Agency's highest research priority. Eight of the Agency's ``top ten'' research topics concern aspects of this problem. FSIS is developing a number of regulations, including this proposed rule, to deal comprehensively with the problems associated with pathogens on raw meat and poultry. For example, the Agency recently promulgated a regulation requiring safe handling labeling on all meat and poultry products that are raw or have not been subjected to a process that would make them ready-to-eat. A vigorous consumer education campaign is underway to publicize the safe handling labels and to remind consumers of the importance of food safety practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would strengthen the Department's pathogen reduction effort by providing enhanced assurance that ready-to-cook poultry are free of disease and visible contamination that may harbor pathogens. This would be accomplished, first, by requiring official establishments to meet their responsibility to present for post-mortem inspection only birds that have been presorted for condemnable conditions. Second, FPS process tolerances for fecal contamination would be eliminated. The effort to reduce such contamination is likely to yield corresponding reductions in harmful bacteria on dressed poultry carcasses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the on-line/off-line carcass inspector, provided by the proposal, would be able to increase FSIS oversight over establishment dressing procedures, such as viscera harvest, and on-line trimming. Inspectors would now have the opportunity to inspect every carcass after the viscera harvest operation. Because, under the current inspection systems, there is no on-line inspection position after viscera removal, Federal inspectors are not able to view every carcass at the end of the production line before the carcasses enter the chiller. This proposal would correct that situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, all reprocessed poultry would be reinspected. Added assurance would thus be provided that reprocessed poultry are free of visible contamination and unlikely to be a cause of cross contamination when introduced into the chill system. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

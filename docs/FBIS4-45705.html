			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Solar Energy </F> Policy Criticised"]    [Text] The Foundation for the Natural Heritage in Europe  (Euronatur) has criticized research conducted in Germany and the  European Union in promoting solar energy "which risks losing  Europe one of the most important markets for the future."  Contrary to the Japanese, which has set up large support  programmes for developing solar energy, "Western Europe is  continuing to waste billions" by betting on nuclear energy,  thereby running the risk of leaving this large market to the  Japanese, says no Euronatur. Another harmful consequence of  this policy is that Eastern European countries should thus miss  a "unique opportunity "of succeeding in their change in energy  policy. Euronatur mentions as a concrete example the EU project  to support the construction of two nuclear power plants in  Ukraine and adds: "It is a scandal that public funds continue  to be spent in the wrong directions." Euronatur deplores the  fact that the promotion of solar energy is not mentioned in EU  assistance programmes for Eastern Europe, which shows "that  assistance programmes seem to have been conceived in cooperation  with the nuclear lobby."</p>

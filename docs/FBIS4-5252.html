			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of the "basic content" of the Hanoi </F> 20-25 January Midterm Party National Conference Resolution]    [Text] 4. To what dangers did the political report refer?    There are four dangers:    -- The most outstanding danger is the possibility of being  left further behind economically. We are already behind when  compared to our neighbor countries. We will be left further  behind if we do not perform well in leadership, management and  in many other tasks. This could lead to lagging economic  development, low efficiency, and backward industry. This will  make our life more difficult, jeopardize political stability,  and limit our ability to consolidate national defense and  security.    -- The risk of being disoriented from socialism will happen  if we are not able to overcome the deviations in the lines and  policies as well as in the implementation of those policies and  lines.    The aforesaid achievements proved that we basically have  been  moving in the right direction. At the same time we have  nurtured many deviations that are not acceptable in socialism.    On the ideology front, the struggle against misguided and  hostile viewpoints is slow and shows a lack of profound  awareness about the dark scheme and sabotage activities of  hostile forces, which are aimed at scrapping the party and  socialism. A low level of vigilance prevails. Deviations from  socialism have led to the birth of straying trends denying the  revolutionary achievements on culture and literature and arts,  claiming that literature and arts should be separate from the  political lines of the party.    In the economic context, the state-managed and the  cooperative economic sectors are slow to renovate and  consolidate. The state-managed economic sector has not played  well its leadership role in both production and distribution.  In many localities, cadres do not exercise thrift to save more  for national construction, thus causing big losses and waste to  the state and collective properties.    We have to do our utmost to avoid this danger, not only at  the level of grassroots management, but also at the levels of  policy making and orientation. Errors made in the phases of  guiding or steering the implementation of lines and policies may  lead to wrong lines and policies.    -- The danger of corruption and authoritarianism. Corruption  has become a national disaster, a hot and urgent issue that is  wearing down our people's confidence.    Authoritarianism makes the party and state distant from the  people. It can produce actions that run counter to the  interests and aspirations of the people thus damaging the trust  of people in the party and state.    -- The plots and activities of "peaceful evolution"  initiated  by hostile forces constitute a major and serious danger. To  prevent and counter "peaceful evolution," we have to fight this  violent subversion plot, which is a class struggle, a struggle  between capitalism and socialism at a very complicated and  decisive stage. This struggle has a vital meaning to the  survival of our party and political regime, and to the  independence of our country.    The four dangers have, between themselves, inter-related and  dialectical relations. Successful suppression of one danger  will limit the development of the others, and vice versa. The  danger of "peaceful evolution" has effected, and is effecting  vigorously internal dangers. Elimination of internal dangers  means the failure of the "peaceful evolution" plot of hostile  forces.    We will firmly grab our opportunity to develop advantages  and  strength. We are capable and we will repel all four dangers    5. What is the background of our achievements?    The party midterm national conference has affirmed that the  most basic, vital reason for our achievements is our party's  determination to maintain a leadership role, reject pluralism  and a multiparty system, safeguard our independence, and  innovatively set up lines and policies that suit the rules and  realities of Vietnam. This will successfully motivate the  comprehensive strength of the national unity bloc and expand  international cooperation.    Our party is a party of the worker class, the representative  for the interests of the worker class, the laborers, and the  people as a whole. This reality has been proved through the  great victories scored by our people under the leadership of the  party. Taking advantage of the current complicated situation in  the world, the reactionaries, those hostile forces attacking us,  are attempting to overthrow our regime in various ways. The  most dangerous of them is the call for pluralism, a multiparty  political system, and the legitimization of the opposition and  reactionary forces. Realities in other socialist countries  showed that the practice of pluralism and multiparty system is  the prelude to a loss of leadership by communist parties, to the  fall of people's governments, to the demise of social order, and  to the growth of ethnic hatred and a difficult life for people.    In order to obtain further successes in our renovation, our  party has to continue to develop Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi  Minh Thought, especially Lenin's thought on the new economic  policy and state capitalism. The party has to work out  innovative transition models and intermediate steps that suit  our concrete circumstances in order to firmly bring the country  to socialism.    II. The New Development Stage and Major Tasks    In evaluating achievements and analyzing weaknesses, the  conference has come to an important assessment: In spite of the  shortcomings we need to overcome, there have been important  achievements created. We need to create the premises for the  country to shift to a new development stage, one of  industrialization and modernization.    Those premises include many elements in both stature and  strength, in both physical and spiritual contexts, as well as in  economic, political, cultural, and social fields from both  inside and outside the country.    The conference determined the transition phases to the new  development stage. We have not had all the premises yet, and we  should not hastily advance to the new stage. We have to advance  carefully as we continue to solve remaining issues. This way we  will avoid economic crisis and create more premises for  industrialization and modernization.</p>

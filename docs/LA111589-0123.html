			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INSANITY REJECTED AS HIGH SCHOOL SIEGE DEFENSE;  </P> <P> COURTS: YOUTH, 15, IS ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON  AND FALSE IMPRISONMENT.  </P> <P> The attorney for a teen-age student accused of shooting a boy in the face and  holding a drama class hostage at an Anaheim high school said Tuesday that he  will not use insanity as a defense, raising the possibility that the youth will  plead guilty.  </P> <P> Cordell L. (Cory) Robb, 15, reportedly beset with family problems, is accused  of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, five counts of false  imprisonment and bringing a firearm onto school grounds.  </P> <P> If convicted, he could be imprisoned in the California Youth Authority until he  turns 25.  </P> <P> Gary L. Proctor, Cordell's court-appointed attorney, said before the youth's  pretrial hearing in Juvenile Court here: "There's no defense. . . . It's not a  matter of what he did; it's a matter of what we can do to help him."  </P> <P> On Oct. 5, the ninth-grader armed himself with a handgun and shotgun, walked  into a drama class at Loara High School in Anaheim and shot Anthony Lopez, also  15, in the left side of his face, police said.  </P> <P> Lopez had reportedly told Cordell that he did not think the gun was real.  </P> <P> Cordell held students at gunpoint for about half an hour while talking with  police on a classroom telephone. Then he surrendered.  </P> <P> A month ago, at Proctor's request, Juvenile Court Judge C. Robert Jameson  appointed Dr. Ernest Klatte, a psychiatrist, to assess Cordell's mental  stability and determine whether the youth is fit to cooperate with his  attorney.  </P> <P> Proctor said after the hearing the evaluation was needed to determine "why he  acted the way he did and what we can do and try and help him."  </P> <P> Based on the evaluation, Proctor said, he will not pursue a defense of insanity  or diminished capacity.  </P> <P> "He was neither," he said about Cordell before the hearing, adding that his  client is competent to stand trial and fit to cooperate in the case.  </P> <P> At the Tuesday hearing, Jameson ordered that a probation officer prepare a  report on what types of rehabilitation would be available for Cordell and where  he might be housed.  </P> <P> Cordell was present at the hearing, his hands cuffed behind his back. Another  hearing was scheduled for Dec. 14.  </P> <P> Last month, Jameson ruled that Cordell represented a threat to himself and  others and must be detained indefinitely. He will be held in Juvenile Hall  during his trial.  </P> <P> Proctor did not oppose the ruling. He said his client had been placed on a  "suicide watch" for a short time after his arrest.  </P> <P> Cordell took the class hostage in a bid to get his stepfather's attention so  they could discuss their problems, Proctor said.  </P> <P> He said that the family is moving to Northern California and that the youth no  longer wants to live with his stepfather.  </P></p>

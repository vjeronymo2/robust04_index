			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: West needs to build more aluminium smelters, says Reynolds Metals chief THE WESTERN world's aluminium industry needs to build 13 new smelters costing about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 if it is to keep pace with expected growth in demand, according to Mr Harry Helton, executive vice president, metals and raw materials, at Reynolds Metals, the second-largest of the US aluminium groups. However, the industry is being forced by the present low level of prices on the world aluminium market to delay starting work on new smelting capacity and this might lead to a very tight supply situation at the end of the 1990s. Mr Helton explained: 'We can't go to shareholders and ask for a new smelter until we can see a sustained upswing in the aluminium price'. The industry needed to see a sustained price of 80 cents to 85 cents a lb (Dollars 1,763 to Dollars 1,873 a tonne) before it could reasonably start investing again, he said, adding: 'That price would not scare our customers'. Last night aluminium for delivery in three months time closed on the London Metal Exchange at Dollars 1,272 a tonne. Mr Helton said that the Reynolds estimate of future aluminium needs was based on an assumption that annual demand for the metal from fabricators would grow at 2 per cent. It took no account of those forecasts that suggested a big upsurge in the use of aluminium in cars, nor did it assume any substantial drop in metal imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States. It also took account of the much faster growth in the use of recycled (scrap) aluminium compared with primary metal. Reynolds last year temporarily closed its Troutdale smelter in Oregon, which can produce 171,000 tonnes a year, because of low prices, forced down mainly by an unexpected surge in aluminium exports from Russia. Mr Helton said Reynolds would restart Troutdale 'as soon as we see a sustained (upward) move on the demand side.' The company is involved in two smelter projects outside North America. Mr Randolph Reynolds, executive vice president, international, said a controversial scheme in Nigeria 'is coming along slowly'. The Nigerian government is financing the whole of the DM2.4bn (Dollars 1.66bn) project, which includes a power plant and residential accommodation as well as an aluminium smelter. Reynolds has an 11 per cent interest in the smelter, is providing its technology and is committed to selling 140,000 tonnes of production a year. 'We are being very cautious and making sure the money is available before making any move,' said Mr Reynolds. The target for start-up of the 180,000 tonnes a year Nigerian smelter is early 1994. It will be managed by Reynolds in co-operation with Ferrostaal, a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering and steel group, which is leading the project. Mr Reynolds said that a joint-venture project between Mitsubishi of Japan and Reynolds for a 190,000 tonnes a year smelter in Venezuela had been shelved temporarily. He added: 'Venezuela is an excellent place to build a smelter so we are still interested. But, because of market conditions, it is not being given our highest priority. The (Venezuelan) government understands'.</p>

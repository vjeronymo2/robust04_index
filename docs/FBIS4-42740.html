			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed WP/KvdB: "Flemish Socialists Are Only </F> Winners in May Survey -- Flemish Liberal Democrats Drop Slowly,  Christian People's Party Remains Below 22 Percent"]    [Excerpt] The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] is the  only Flemish party to make clear progress in the May survey  which the Dimarso polling bureau, commissioned by DE MORGEN,  carried among of 1,000 Flemings, 1,000 Walloons, and 400  inhabitants of Brussels aged 18 and above.    The Flemish Socialists appear to be slowly recovering from  the uproar caused by the BBTK [Socialist Union of Employees]  scandal in March. Back then, the SP dropped from 17.6 percent  to 15.3 percent. In May, the SP climbed back to 16.2 percent.  That is still 3.4 percent below the result obtained in 24  November 1991.    The VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] has not managed to reach  the 30 percent mark again since January. In May, the VLD party  dropped half a percent from 29.2 percent to 28.7 percent.    The CVP [Christian People's Party] is stagnating at 21.7  percent (up 0.2 percent), and since September 1993 has not  exceeded 22 percent. Live Differently [Ecologists], however, is  the big loser. The Ecologists lost 1.1 percent of their support  and dropped to 10.6 percent. The VB [Flemish Bloc] scored 11.3  percent after a climb of 0.3 percent. The VU [The People's  Union] was forced to give back some of the ground gained in  April and dropped 0.4 percent to 7 percent. Rossem is at 3.1  percent (up 0.2 percent).  <H5>  French-Speaking Socialist Party Drops </H5>   In Wallonia, the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] saw  another 1.1 percent of votes flow away. The atmosphere of  scandal is continuing to pursue the French-speaking Socialists.  With 30.5 percent, Busquin is only 0.4 percent above February's  historic low point (30.1 percent).    The PSC [Social Christian Party] managed to benefit a little  from PS losses and climbed by 0.6 percent to 19.9 percent. Ecolo  also is on the increase: up 0.7 percent (to 16.5 percent). Jean  Gol's PRL [Liberal Reformation Party] stagnates at 22.9 percent  (down 0.2 percent). The "others" category, including the United  Left and National Front, also stagnates at 10.2 percent.    Dimarso's survey traditionally covers voter preferences for  national parliamentary elections, therefore it is not per se  representative for the upcoming European elections.  Nevertheless, it is probable that in the middle of the European  campaigns, telephone surveys give a good indication of  intentions for the European elections. Reference is made to the  strongly domestic character of this European campaign, which  would reduce the chance of differences between surveys covering  European or national elections.    In the latest Dimarso poll, 17.2 percent did not answer.  That is a few percentage points lower than the normal average.  In April, the "don't know, refuse" category was 18.9 percent.

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (2): Caution the guideline for Europe's No 1 - Shell's reputation for being financially conservative may just be the quality needed to help it retain its premier position in a period of uncertainty over the direction of oil prices / Profile of Royal Dutch/Shell The scallop-shaped logo of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of companies is one of the most pervasive in the commercial world. As a symbol of an oil company which on the basis of size is challenged only by Exxon of the US, it is recognisable in virtually every country. The logo itself has undergone various stylistic changes since the company was formed out of a 1907 alliance between Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and the Shell Transport and Trading Company of the UK. But the original structure of the company has proved remarkably resilient. The 1907 agreement called for the retention of separate identities, while the merger itself was based on a 60:40 split. Today, Royal Dutch remains a parent company, deriving its income from its 60 per cent interest in the group of operating companies. Shell Transport and Trading holds a similar position in the UK, based on its 40 per cent ownership of the group. The joint group managing directors of the parent firms, led by chairman of the committee of managing directors, CAJ Herkstroter, still reflect the Anglo-Dutch roots of the company. This is in contrast with the intensely 'national' character of many of the individual operating units. It is an arrangement which may appear to be a recipe for conflict, but which has clearly worked well over the years. The glue which binds Shell together has been the careful cultivation of a multinational layer of senior management whose outlook is international and who share a common corporate culture. 'We find that it's good for executives to go to countries where they may not be able to speak the language and begin to solve problems,' according to one senior Shell manager. Such structures and practices have helped Shell to weather nearly every combination of economic, commercial and political storm in its history. But critics say it has also left it with bureaucratic management and an internal focus which does not necessarily reflect the interests of its investors. But its reputation for being financially conservative and cautious (gearing in 1992 was just 7 per cent) may just be the qualities needed to help it to retain its premier position in corporate Europe in a period of great uncertainty over the direction of oil prices. Shell's structure may also prove to be the model for how an integrated oil company can survive and perhaps even thrive in a weak price environment A recent study by NatWest Securities in Edinburgh predicted that Shell's earnings, for example, will prove to be relatively impervious to persistently low prices over the next three years. This is because of expected benefits for its downstream operations in refining and marketing from low crude oil prices. Another offsetting factor would be the possibility that low oil prices would help to fuel an overall economic recovery. In that case there might be a stronger than expected upturn in chemicals, a sector in Continued on next page which Shell is among the top 10 companies worldwide and the dominant producer among the integrated oil companies, although much of its capacity is concentrated in high-cost continental Europe. The NatWest study concluded that Shell's medium-term fortunes are dependent less on oil price movements than on the overall state of the world economy. Other strengths which are likely to help Shell through the present turmoil in the industry include a strong presence in the fastest growing economies in Asia. It also has one of the largest international natural gas businesses, a market segment where prices have so far stayed relatively buoyant as countries and companies realise the environmental and cost benefits associated with the fuel. Shell's reputation has been enhanced by its effectiveness in finding new reserves at relatively low costs. Figures from Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, show that Shell's finding costs over the past three years have averaged Dollars 2.50 per barrel of oil equivalent (which includes natural gas and condensate). That compares with an average among European oil companies of Dollars 3.58 a barrel, and an average for the US majors of Dollars 3.97 a barrel. Shell's relative efficiency means, however, that cost-cutting, the theme which last year underpinned the share performance of other oil companies, such as British Petroleum, has a less marked impact. The NatWest study also notes that the company's low gearing means that any cost-cutting it does achieve will make less of a bottom line impact than similar actions taken by more highly geared competitors. But Shell does share one big concern with its competitors: that oil prices drifting in the Dollars 13-Dollars 16 range of the last six months will lead to the postponement or cancellation of a number of capital-intensive projects. Over time that would constrain the growth of Shell's worldwide asset base, perhaps its main pillar of corporate strength.</p>

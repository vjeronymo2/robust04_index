			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant-General Boris Agapov, vice </F> president of Ingushetia, by Rodion Morozov, occasion, date and  place not specified, under rubric "Opinion": "Boris Agapov: `The  State Border Has Collapsed'; Previous Spirit of Border Troops  Has Been Lost Irretrievably"; photograph of Agapov included]    [Text] Even today, Lieutenant General Boris Agapov is  a very authoritative person in the Border Troops, despite the  fact that it has been almost a year since he parted with them.  In late 1991 and early 1992 Agapov, at that time deputy chairman  for operations work (intelligence and counterintelligence) of  the Committee for Security of the USSR State Border, was one of  those who insisted: "The Border Troops must be common [for all].  This is not a structure to be pulled down first of all by  dragging it apart to national quarters." But a different  approach predominated. In the interview presented, Agapov, now  vice president of Ingushetia, discusses the consequences of this  and the present situation of the Border Troops.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The Border Troops have lived a  very troubled life for the last two and one-half years. First  they are removed from the USSR KGB, then handed over to the  Committee's successor, the Russian Ministry of Security, then  again are made into a separate structure. From your point of  view as a person who served in the Troops for almost 30 years,  to what extent was their independent existence, or to the  contrary, their existence within the framework of a particular  department, justified?    [Agapov] The Border Troops should be  independent--this is my profound conviction. It stands to reason  that they must be in constant contact with services providing  state security, with customs officials, and also with various  ministries and departments such as the ministries of Defense,  Internal Affairs, Finance, and Economy, and with the Foreign  Intelligence Service. But only on an independent basis,  otherwise the Troops lose their appearance and their  professionalism, taking on in their place the coloration and  ideology of the department to which they are assigned.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And from the very beginning, from  the moment they were established, did the Border Troops exist  independently or were they on someone's "leash"?    [Agapov] When the Russian Federation Border Guard  was established after the Revolution (the Decree establishing it  was signed by Lenin on 28 May 1918), where didn't they try to  drag this Guard! Into the Ministry of Finance and into some kind  of other departments, but nothing worthwhile came of this. And  because the primary mission of the Border Troops is to provide  state security on the border, in the final account they ended up  in that department which also engaged in providing security--on  the scale of the entire country. And they fully took root in  this system of OGPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB. They took root, I do not wish  to hide this.    But as I said, in performing certain common functions  together with security organs, the Troops unfortunately also  assumed other functions alien to them, such as pure  counterintelligence connected with internal problems. And some  subunits even engaged in the "fifth line," the fight against  ideological subversion--true, only in the border zone. Of  course, Border Troops personnel did not carry on developments  independently, but they collected information that was out of  the ordinary and passed it on to where it was supposed to go.    By the way, here is one more argument of no small importance  in favor of independence. Information which Border Troops  personnel have is unique in its way: They observe the  development of a situation on border territory--their own and  the enemy's. But when Border Troops were part of state security  organs, their information did not go to the country's leadership  directly. It first went "topside," to the KGB, where it was  processed, fitted, and sorted in a suitable manner, and the real  picture thus was distorted substantially.    Generally there were many different slants. One time, for  example, an idea was hanging around (although not carried out,  it still hangs around) about subordinating the Border Troops to  the Ministry of Defense, or about their organizational  development according to the type of one of the branches of the  Armed Forces.    What also contributed to this was the fact that, to their  misfortune, Border Troops personnel were deprived of their own  institute where professionals--staffers, organizers of border  security, operations personnel--were trained. That is why at one  time Border Troops personnel were trained at the Frunze Academy.  This ended with us losing specialists in 30 years of such  practice. It would turn out that on completing the Border Troops  school and serving on the border 5-6 years, an officer would get  to the Academy, pick up a "militaristic" intoxication, and then  think only in categories of division, corps, army, front. And  our troops were slanted toward the Army... True, this later was  corrected, a Border Troops faculty was established right there  in the Academy, and they provided Border Troops instructors. But  still the spirit, way of life, and curriculum were close to that  of the Army. At that time the thesis spread that the Border  Troops not only should guard the border, but also defend it.  Therefore, it was said, in case something happened Border Troops  officers are obligated to be ready to command armies, corps and  even fronts, although as a matter of fact this is absolutely  unrealistic! The Border Troops are incapable of genuinely  defending the border. There are border covering forces of ground  troops for this.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Then just what should the Troops'  activity boil down to?    [Agapov] It isn't necessary to reinvent the wheel.  The functions of Border Troops are functions of exceptional  importance: Controlling entry and exit and stopping the  smuggling of drugs, weapons, ammunition and explosives. When I  speak of illegal crossings, I naturally have in mind not some  kind of idle persons, but the work of enemy special  services--insertion of illegals/spies, saboteurs, and  terrorists--although of course there have been other instances  as well. For example, criminals avoiding justice often tried to  flee from us. Some people fled in search of political asylum,  and the very same also happened in the other direction. But  purely agent insertions remained the important thing.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And to what extent did they bear  a mass nature?    [Agapov] This path was used most actively after  the Patriotic War. Subsequently other opportunities--technical  reconnaissance, space reconnaissance--appeared, and  well-adjusted technical information services began to arise.  Later came the warming in relations between the Soviet Union and  the West. Legal opportunities for obtaining information  appeared. Superb conditions for collecting information were  created on the territory of former Union states: they did not  keep our secrets very well there. They acted according to the  principle that someone else's secret is not my secret. In  particular, Poland became such a fount of information about the  Soviet Union's secrets; they were sold there right and left,  wholesale and retail. So the need for a form of work such as  agent insertion gradually began to disappear. But those states  whose legal and technical capabilities were limited, China for  example, continued to use the traditional method of inserting  illegals.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] The border previously was built  along the perimeter of all Soviet Union territory. How is it  built today?    [Agapov] It is terrible to say this, but  practically not at all. The old state border security system has  collapsed and a new one has not been created. And as a result  such breaches gape along the entire perimeter of Russia's  borders today that it will take a minimum of 15-20 years to  close them somehow. The shortsightedness of politicians and the  striving to place their interests over state interests is at  fault for everything.    When all this was being decided--the Union had disintegrated  and the CIS had arisen--there was a group of people in the  Border Troops leadership (including me) who said: "Stop and  think better of it!" We insisted that we need to preserve a  unified border space and ensure a smooth flow of Union Border  Troops into CIS Border Troops, and this opinion found support up  to a certain point. Appropriate agreements were signed and a  CinC CIS Border Troops was appointed--Colonel General Ilya  Yakovlevich Kalinichenko.    Then everything fell apart. There were too many who wanted  to  become commanders of their own Border Troops--Ukrainian, Uzbek,  Kazakh, Russian and God knows what others. The presence of  statehood presumes the presence of borders, they said. The fact  is, already then it was understandable that not one former Union  republic was capable of ensuring the independent security of its  borders on a purely economic and financial basis. The result is  gigantic breaches on all axes: On the Central  Asiatic--Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and  Turkmenia; in the Transcaucasus--Azerbaijan, Armenia and  Georgia; and although the border is guarded in Ukraine and  Belarus, it is far from as it was before.    Only a few sectors of the "old" border--built up and with  adjusted duty--were preserved: The borders with Norway, Finland,  China and Mongolia. These sectors are more or less closed, but  the rest... The system was established for over 70 years, bit by  bit. Necessary engineer works, obstacles, observation posts,  border zastavas, posts and detachments were built. All this was  smoothed out and settled. They knew where to send details and  where, how, and what to secure in each kilometer. But everything  was pulled down in an instant.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And how effectively did the  previous system operate?    [Agapov] Five or six unpunished border violations  during the year were considered a major, inadmissible failure in  the work of the Border Troops. There were serious "sortings  out," stern measures were taken, and people were removed from  the job. The chief of a border zastava could be discharged to  the reserve unceremoniously for a penetration. And if the chief  of a border detachment had a minimum of two penetrations on his  record, that was it; his service ended on that. So only  irreproachable, hard-working organizers of border service who  did not reserve for themselves the right of failure advanced in  service.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And now?    [Agapov] Now the penetration count has gone over  the thousands.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] What sectors of the border  traditionally were considered the most troublesome?    [Agapov] The Transcaucasus was considered the most  difficult and crucial sector of operation, difficult even for  purely geographical reasons: The Soviet population and the  population across the border were in maximum proximity to each  other, a matter of meters. You understand that it is one thing  when there is a 30-40 km border strip from the main line of  engineer works to the state border and it is quite another  matter when it is 5-6 meters. There are more urges for contacts,  illegal crossings, relations, illegal transactions and so on. It  is there in the Transcaucasus, on the border with Turkey and  Iran, that Border Troops personnel forged their expertise.    True, with respect to looking after the border, another  troublesome sector was considered to be the Norwegian and the  Baltic.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You say that the old border  security system has collapsed today. What does this threaten for  the country's security?    [Agapov] There is a constant movement of weapons,  ammunition and drugs across the border. Into whose hands will  all this fall? That's the whole point! The criminal situation in  Russia today is fraught with the most unpredictable  consequences. Terrorism of all stripes and all directions is  flourishing. Add to this the overall political instability.    Some kind of feverish, helpless attempts are being made to  change the situation, but in vain. The conditions in which the  Troops find themselves are such that they cannot cope with this  task. They are incapable of providing reliable security for  Russia's state borders. In addition, Russian Border Troops  personnel today have to perform duty on the border of third  countries. Russian Border Troops are securing the border of  Tajikistan with Afghanistan, Georgia with Turkey, and Armenia  with Turkey.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But is this justified?    [Agapov] It is justified only because otherwise  these borders will not be secured at all. Where is the  absurdity? We do not have our own borders with these  states--they are "transparent"--and so we have to secure their  borders to prevent illegal movements across their territories  onto Russian territory. Some generally believe that we must get  out of there, post troops along Russia's present perimeter, and  that's it. But this is precluded; ready-made positions and the  old structure have remained on the former Union border. It is  cracking and falling apart, but it still can be used. But to  begin from scratch... This will take 15-20 years, not to mention  the material and financial costs, which are completely beyond  our capability now.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] And what is the solution?    [Agapov] Only a common border. Heads of CIS member  states must sit down at the negotiating table...    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But if we take into account that  rivers of weapons and drugs are constantly flowing across  uncovered borders, as you yourself say, and all this is being  turned into enormous amounts of money... The fact is, this is  very, very profitable for someone. Consequently, big problems  may arise with the establishment of combined Border  Troops...    [Agapov] Naturally, and this is why we must set  the most rigid conditions today for those states from which this  flow is coming. Steps must be taken to bring them to their  senses. Say to them: "Brothers, either you properly close your  border or we will have a stern talk with you."    Or just what do we have? I recently met with the commander  of  the North Caucasus Border District. So? He recently conducted a  troop operation on the border between Dagestan and Azerbaijan.  They confiscated around five billion rubles and detained 60  persons from who knows what countries and of who knows what  nationalities, who penetrated into Azerbaijan, then tried to  travel into Russia, and the other way around. But for this it  was necessary to mobilize practically all district forces, and  this for a one-time action, in order to close--for a  time(!)--only a small sector of the border.    But this probably is not even the most terrible thing--not  perforated borders or material disorder. The impression of what  a Border Troops person is has been eroded and the previous  spirit of these Troops has been lost. Previously in securing the  border a Border Troops person secured the entire Soviet people,  the whole country, and he was proud of this. But today the  Border Troops person is a mercenary. He was ordered: "Go God  knows where and secure God knows what." Secure what? On what  grounds? Therefore, as with any person forced to do something,  he does not guard, but simulates guarding. I am speaking about  the officer. And what can be said about the soldier? Does he  have a great need for the Georgian or Azerbaijani border so as  to put his life on the line for who knows what?    Honestly speaking, when the USSR Border Troops were  eliminated, many of us found ourselves in a very difficult  situation. The question arose: Into which troops should we go  serve--Ukrainian, Georgian, Russian, Kazakh, Moldovan or perhaps  Belarusian? It was necessary to choose. But I--and not just I  alone--served in the Border Troops for 30 years and guarded the  safety of the Moldovan and Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian,  Bashkir and Jew to an equal extent. It was all one for me. And  so to go guard the border of some one republic... And I made my  choice--I left the Troops. And I know many did the very same.  But... Some received an apartment, some did not serve to  retirement. And those who already had all this, or the young  ones who had to serve 15-20 years until retirement, left. Now  the "old-timers" will serve to retirement and also will leave.  And again there will be a collapse. A collapse on a collapse.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Building societies free to form captive insurers THE government is to allow building societies to set up their own insurance companies to protect them against repossession losses. The move follows complaints that general insurers' terms have become too expensive and restrictive. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said that the rule preventing societies owning more than 15 per cent of a non-life insurance company was being relaxed to allow them to establish 'captive' insurers to write their own mortgage indemnity policies. The chancellor's disclosure came in a speech to the Council of Mortgage Lenders in London in which he also emphasised that the government would not compete too hard with societies for retail funds through its National Savings products. Mr Lamont said the government was not aiming this year for a net inflow to National Savings of more than about Pounds 4.1bn, the figure for the past financial year. He said changes to National Savings were not designed to 'scoop the pool'. Mr Lamont also disclosed that the government's scheme to take 16,000 empty properties off the market by allocating Pounds 577m to housing associations to purchase homes had more than achieved its target with 18,000 houses purchased by the end of last month. The chancellor welcomed signs of stabilising house prices and the hope it offered to owners with negative equity, but emphasised that the government did not want to see a return to the 'rampant house-price inflation' of the late 1980s. He said: 'We can now look forward not just to a recovery in the housing market, but a recovery which offers the prospect of greater stability in the future.' He sounded a positive note on the economy as a whole, saying that over the past month 'nearly every indicator has pointed to recovery'. Such signs also augured well for an improvement in the housing market. The decision to allow captive insurers comes after tough negotiations between the general insurers and the societies. The insurance companies have insisted on substantial rises in premiums to cover their past losses on repossessions. Insurance companies made losses estimated at more than Pounds 2bn on mortgage indemnity insurance taken out on properties bought in the late 1980s. They have now set a series of restrictions on the types of properties they will insure. Societies welcome the relaxation of the restriction on them owning captive insurers. Woolwich Building Society indicated that it intended to set up a subsidiary if it obtained permission at its annual meeting this month. However, few other societies will be able to establish captive insurers in less than a year, because most have just held their annual meetings at which proposals for a rule change to enable the move would have had to be discussed. Woolwich, which anticipated the move by putting forward a special resolution to its annual general meeting on April 15, said it was 'delighted' that the new power had been given to societies. Mr Peter Robinson, managing director, said: 'We have been interested in this route to cover some of the risk exposure from future residential lending for some time. Armed with the necessary powers, we will actively pursue the opportunity.' Mr Chris Sharp, managing director of the Northern Rock Building Society and chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that anything which gave societies more flexibility to arrange insurance was 'very welcome'. Abbey National said on Thursday that it had established a captive insurer based in Guernsey with Pounds 10m of capital to write mortgage indemnity insurance on mortgage loans made this year. It is seeking reinsurance of the risk. Mr Dane Douetil, a director of the insurance brokers Special Risk Services, said that captive insurance companies gave societies more flexibility and would be tax-efficient, but they still faced reinsurance negotiations. Legal &amp; General, one of the primary mortgage indemnity insureres said last night that it was 'relaxed' about the change because societies' captives will not be allowed to write the more lucrative house and contents policies.</p>

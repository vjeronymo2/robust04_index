He thinks that one  of the reasons for Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's  rejection of this plan is supposedly that it was going to be  approved by the Army. Daly Valet interviewed Desjardins:    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desjardins] I am not  disappointed, because I was there; I experienced all the events  and I knew Aristide would not agree. That is the reason we  entered here especially to meet with the Army because you know  you have [changes thought] this plan involves [preceding word in  English] the Army too. So (?we wanted) to see whether the Army  would not agree as well; but we knew that Aristide would not  agree. The reason is that most of the time Aristide agrees with  what he believes the Army will not accept and disagrees when he  feels that the Army will agree. Perhaps -- feeling that the Army  would agree with the plan even if it does not agree now, that it  will eventually agree with the plan -- Aristide will not, that  is all.    [Valet] What is your position concerning the Army? It is  said  that the Army has reservations regarding this plan. What is your  stance?    [Desjardins] Yes, it says he has reservations, but it does  not say it does not agree. I represented -- I do not say I  unofficially represented the Army, but as a National Cooperative  Action Movement deputy, they present me as a neo-Duvalierist --  I realized that my duty was to defend the Army because....  [pauses] It is always said that the Army of a country is that  country's honor. I know that if I criticize the Army, I  automatically criticize my country. So I was obliged to defend  the Army. [passage omitted]    [Valet] As for Gen. Cedras' departure: Do you think the Army  agrees or, at least, as you say you are close to the Army, do  you think the Army has consented to the general's departure?    [Desjardins] I do not say that I am close to the Army. I  said  that I am a member of the 30 September [1991] family. So, if I  am a member of the 30 September group, this automatically means  that I am part of the Army. I cannot tell you that Gen. Cedras  has agreed with it 100 percent; but I believe that if he studies  the plan and identifies with it, he will agree. [end recording]</p>

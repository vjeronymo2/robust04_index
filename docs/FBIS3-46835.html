			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] decided on 28 December to  appoint Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the DA Joint Staff  Council, as the agency's adviser effective 1 January. Sakuma  will be the third man to fill this position, succeeding Haruo  Natsume and Seiki Nishihiro, both of whom also formerly served  as administrative vice minister of the DA. Sakuma will also be  the first person from among uniformed DA officials to become DA  adviser.    Sakuma, who was among the first group of persons to graduate  from the National Defense Academy, has served as chief of staff  of the Maritime Self-Defense Force and as chairman of the Joint  Staff Council. He retired in July 1993.    In the DA, voices have been raised for some time strongly  urging that advisers be chosen from among not only civilian  officials but also from among uniformed officials. Sakuma has  been chosen apparently in consideration of balancing the  appointment of civilian and uniformed officials.    Moreover, because active debate within the government is  expected next year over how Japan's national defense program  should proceed, including a reexamination of the "National  Defense Program Outline," one senior DA official has stated, "We  hope that Mr. Sakuma will make good use of his past experience  as a top uniformed official in charge of managing national  defense."</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shift in market depresses sales IBM yesterday presented a grim picture of its struggles to come to terms with fundamental shifts in the computer market. Sales of IBM's key products - mainframe computers, large capacity data storage systems and minicomputers - all declined sharply, reflecting a broad market shift away from centralised computing toward networks of smaller computers. Mainframe sales were down 12 per cent for the year, while sales of minicomputers fell by 'a couple of points for the year in a softening market'. Personal computer sales were down by about 15 per cent for the year, despite a strong comeback in the fourth quarter. One bright spot was the company's workstation business, which grew by about 30 per cent. The product sales results reflect an industry-wide shift toward smaller, less expensive computers that carry lower gross profit margins. IBM said gross margins in the fourth quarter were 'slightly below 40 per cent,' with pricing pressure in the mainframe, data storage and PC sectors driving the decline. PC profit margins improved in the fourth quarter, raising hopes that pricing pressures have eased, IBM said. But yesterday Compaq Computer, one of IBM's largest competitors in the market, announced price cuts of 12 to 16 per cent on its portable notebook PCs. Hardware sales declined as a percentage of total revenues to 52 per cent for the year from 57 per cent in 1991. This reflects a significant shift in the computer industry, and especially for IBM, toward services as a primary source of revenue and income. IBM said its software revenues rose 5.8 per cent for the year, to Dollars 11.1bn. However, software revenues declined 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, largely because of lower sales of software for minicomputers. Services, including consulting and systems integration, rose 31.7 per cent for the year to Dollars 7.35bn. IBM sees this sector as a significant growth opportunity and is rapidly expanding its service operations worldwide. Revenues from rentals and financing rose 11.9 per cent to Dollars 4.68bn, but showed slower growth in the fourth quarter.</p>

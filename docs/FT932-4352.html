			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (1): City strives to shine - Sheffield has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years, but not its manufacturing industry, now spread more widely in smaller companies  -and some of them are very successful. Nevertheless the struggle out of recession is hurting THERE is belligerence in Sheffield these days. It is not the usual conflict between city council and central government, but survivors in manufacturing industry aggressively proclaiming they are alive and deserving of more recognition for what they have done. The mood is typified by Noel Edwards, chairman of Barworth Flockton, a steel manufacturer and processor. 'Sheffield is not a post-industrial society,' he declares. 'We are manufacturers and we are fighting back. We have been thought to be in decline, but we are not. We never really have been. 'We have to be quick-footed and adapt. We have looked for niches where we can compete and we have got on with it. We have ridden recession because we had hard-working facilities and people.' Sheffield's problem is that its manufacturing has survived at the expense of jobs. In 1942, Sheffield made a record 1.9m tonnes of steel in 176 furnaces. Last year, just seven furnaces produced 2.25m tonnes - but with only one eighth of the 1942 manpower. Mike Bower, who took over leadership of the Labour-controlled city council a year ago, says 36,000 jobs disappeared from steel or associated industries in the first half of the 1980s. Unemployment quadru- pled, explaining the council's attempts 10 years ago to ease problems by expanding its own workforce. The spiral of ever higher business rates to pay for this antagonised the private sector, but was broken in 1989 by the government's introduction of a national uniform business rate. This reduced tension between public and private sectors, which were by then struggling to co-operate after years of slanging matches had proved counter-productive. Last year it was all hands to the pump to save the World Student Games, to which the council committed itself in 1987 as an aid to regeneration, not realising they were virtually unsaleable to television, the only guarantor of enough sponsorship to make them pay. The games were a sporting success, but lost twice as much as budgeted and left a Pounds 157m bill for facilities, to be cleared over the next 20 years. A damning report by the District Auditor, the government's council spending watchdog, left Sheffield with egg on its face and appearing incompetent. A backlash is now ensuing. Backbench Labour councillors last month voted seven left-wingers out of party office, leaving Mr Bower, a moderate dealmaker, in a strong position. He has already persuaded town hall union members to avoid job losses this year by taking a pay cut, even though everyone knows the overstaffed payroll will eventually have to be trimmed. In industry and commerce, there is grumbling at the damage the games fiasco has done, but ranks are closing to stress the long-term value of the facilities to the city. Vigorous promotion of manufacturing achievement will now play its part in trying to restore Sheffield's reputation - and there is much to boast about. Last year's 2.25m tonnes of steel was top grade feedstock for precision or high stress engineering fabrications. Recession has forced a 30 per cent drop in prices over two years, but Sheffield has coped because - says Ray Douglas, this year's Master Cutler and a British Steel director - it now has the lowest unit production costs in the world. This month the Cutlers' Company, the ancient guild protecting Sheffield's name for quality in manufacturing, is mounting a 'trail of excellence,' with customers from Britain and abroad visiting suppliers - and their suppliers' own suppliers and other customers. The city's laboratories and universities are included. Visitors will be fed at a special Cutlers' Feast. 'Sheffield Shines' will be adopted as the city's equivalent of 'Glasgow's Miles Better.' Peter Newman, former chief executive of Davy and now chairman of the governors of Sheffield Hallam University and a director of Sheffield Development Corporation, says: 'We are hoping to do our bit to end the patronising British attitude to manufacturing. Don't run us down, is one of the things we are saying.' The trail will demonstrate the city's vertical integration between steelmaking, steel and metals processing, testing, design and manufacturing  -'intracity trading has been very important in local industry standing up to recession. Sheffield has always had a village atmosphere but this has only recently manifested itself industrially,' says Mr Newman. But can the picture possibly shine this brightly? There is overcapacity in European steelmaking. Mr Edwards and Mr Douglas would have been less bullish, for example, had Britain not left the ERM. For some it has been a close run thing. It seems impossible to find anyone in Sheffield to call last September 16 black Wednesday - 'White,' 'platinum,' or 'diamond' are the most common words. William Cook is chairman of Andrew Cook, a company which now claims to be Europe's largest manufacturer of steel castings. With 80 per cent of his output exported directly or indirectly, he admits he would have been in trouble by now had exchange rates stayed at ERM levels. WHAT is left of British manufacturing 'is pretty good and exporting like mad,' says Mr Cook. 'Things are certainly not getting worse, but many of my customers in the UK have gone. If the government allows the pound to rise again or we go back into the ERM, this will screw things up completely. Our unit costs are already lower than they have ever been.' Suppliers of professional services are equally revealing. Andrew Darwin of Dibb Lupton Broomhead, the city's leading corporate lawyer, says: 'Insolvency has done well. We have been busy in Sheffield, although we have had few high profile insolvencies. Litigation has also been busy, with a lot of debt collection business.' According to Nicholas Kemp, director of the Sheffield Association of the Engineering Employers Federation: 'Most companies have had difficulties in the recession but it's a mixed picture. Our April survey of members was the most positive for two-and-a-half years, but there are still some companies finding the going very difficult. One universal area of big concern is the downturn in Germany - 'we can compete on quality, price, unit costs and productivity, but the orders are just not there. We think we'd have an advantage if they were because trading conditions pose problems for our German rivals, who have never faced recession in the way we have.' Mike Myerson, of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says his clients remembered the recession of 1980-82, battened down the hatches, shed labour early and reduced costs. Only one failed. Surviving recovery, however, may be equally difficult. David Campbell, of accountants Grant Thornton, says: 'Everyone has orders now. These were few and far between a year ago, when many had no orders at all. Now companies are short of finance to pay for them and have no more security to offer.' Most of Sheffield's manufacturing is now in small or medium-sized companies. In 1979, Mr Kemp's association had several members with more than 6,000 employees each. Now it has none with more than 2,000. But he has 350 member companies - 100 more than in 1988. Most employ under 50 people, with 31,000 jobs between them. The structure of Sheffield manufacturing has thus changed dramatically, with a much flatter distribution of businesses by size. Some have not felt the recession because they have good niche markets, but Sheffield's future now depends on as many as possible of these small, owner-managed business growing bigger. Many are insecure. Jonathan Hunt, is senior partner of Wake Smith, one of Sheffield oldest legal firms, chairman of Sheffield Enterprise agency and a member of the local training and enterprise council. 'There is a fairly good supply of money, but there are gaps. We need more small scale venture capital funding,' he warns. As some of its manufacturers strive to exploit their impressive gains - or even just to keep them - Sheffield's economy seems worryingly fragile.</p>

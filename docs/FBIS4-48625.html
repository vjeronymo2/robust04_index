			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Charles Gankay Taylor has described as  irresponsible recent utterances by the United Nations Observer  Mission in Liberia, that the Liberia Council of State has the  authority to appoint heads of public corporations and autonomous  agencies. President Taylor said such statements have the  tendency of bringing about renewed problems in the peace process.    The former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly]  government president said the United Nations has nothing to do  with politics, and should stay out of Liberian politics.  President Taylor said it is clear, although not explicitly  stated in the Cotonou Accord, that the leaders of the three  parties to the Liberian conflict will appoint ministers and  other officials of government. He said it was predicated upon  an agreement among the leaders of the parties that led to the  allocation of cabinet posts.    President Taylor emphasized that it was out of the intent of  the leaders that all positions in government are filled, saying  discussions among the leaders are an addendum to Cotonou. He  stressed that whatever discussions are held among the leaders,  with the intent of arriving at certain decisions, must be  considered an addendum to the Cotonou Accord, and any attempt to  do otherwise will not be accepted.    President Taylor said the leaders of the various parties, in  an attempt to avoid any delays in the transitional process,  allowed the government to be seated in order to facilitate the  speedy implementation of the disarmament process and the holding  of free and fair general and presidential elections. President  Taylor, in referring to the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional  Government], gave an analogy, saying the LNTG is the birth of  the union of three parties, which brought forth what he called a  whole human being, with a head and other parts of the body.

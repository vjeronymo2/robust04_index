			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): A new weapon for the trouble-shooters THE FINANCIAL TIMES ON MANAGEMENT edited by Christopher Lorenz and Nicholas Leslie FT/Pitman Pounds 25, 232 pages I FIND it extraordinary that so few financial journals or business pages follow developments in the art of management itself, in spite of the fact that it is obvious that the difference between successful companies and their less successful brethren lies in the skills and abilities of their management. There is no lack of advice to the manager. There was a time when I could, and did, read almost every new management book as it appeared, but it is impossible to do so today. The Financial Times Management Page has long been required reading for me because of my continuing fascination with the study of management, and it is also something that I look forward to each week. Like most practising managers I have little empathy with the 'instant solution merchants.' Every management problem is unique; in my experience there is never a single solution. In the ideal company, management is ultimately about the concerns and efforts of groups of people working together to achieve a common goal. The skill of the manager lies in making the choices which lead to success. The Financial Times Management Page is invaluable. It features factual reports on what a variety of managers are actually doing. Moreover, it sets these reports in both an international and a financial context. It therefore acts as a sort of look-out, scanning the horizon and alerting us to what others are thinking and doing. One seldom reads an article without it jogging some internal response. The Management Page does not set out to tell you what to do - rather it sets out to tell you what others are doing and the successes or difficulties they have encountered. As a regular reader I had not expected that Financial Times on Management would provide me with new perspectives since, apart from new commentaries, it relies largely on reprinting articles published during the past two years. However, I was wrong. I now realise that, as well as reading and mentally noting the articles, I could have gained a lot by filing them under various headings and re-reading them from time to time. The sub-title - 'grappling with change and uncertainty' - says it all. The only certainty for the future is uncertainty, and the sure knowledge that we are all going to have to cope with unpredictable change at an ever accelerating rate. Change can be either a threat or an opportunity - and it is a cruel exposer of management inadequacies. By the use of many examples the book underlines the need continually to change and adjust to these forces and clearly shows the fate of those who fail to be flexible in their thinking and strategies. Dealing with change is not simple, and it only works if the culture is changing in harmony with the organisational or operating concepts. The introduction sets out 12 messages, illustrated throughout the book. The responsibility of the manager is to select the particular ones needed by his organisation, and then to transfer the ownership of such ideas to his people. Despite the complexity of business situations and the need for tolerance of ambiguity and differences of approach, the manager can only cope with a very small number of objectives at a time. Business messages have to be made simple if they are to be believed and acted upon, but they also have to be consistent and sustained if they are to result in action. The book demonstrates clearly the dynamic nature of business management and the fate of those who believe that there is a safe haven where they can rest and 'consolidate.' The increasing trends towards globalisation and the enabling power of the computer age have produced yet another pressure on business, this time for speed of reaction. Time has always cost money, but lack of speed of change in a company can often lead to a fatal loss of competitive advantage. It is now essential not only to know where you want to go and what you want to do, but to do it faster than your competitors. If I have a criticism it is that, in spite of the efforts to encompass the needs of small businesses, there is not enough reference to the special opportunities and difficulties they face. More than 80 per cent of our businesses are small, and they employ the majority of people in the UK. Small businesses face many of the problems of the large, without the resources to cover mistakes, as well as having a vast array of unique difficulties of their own. Our future national economic success is heavily dependent upon the ability of small businesses to fight their corner against the best in the world. They need all the help they can get. Good managers are constantly seeking to improve their skills and always looking at the practical experience of others for ideas they can emulate, or warnings of pitfalls to be avoided. The Financial Times on Management contains plenty of both and, thanks to the paper's ubiquitous coverage of the business world, it culls its examples from every country and every type of industry. It is essential reading for us all.</p>

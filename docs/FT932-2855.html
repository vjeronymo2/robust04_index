			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Gatt acts on Russian application THE governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday set up a working party to examine Russia's application to join the world trade body and established a disputes panel on the European Community's new banana import regime. Russia's membership bid was widely welcomed by many, including the US and the European Community, but tough negotiations lie ahead on its terms of entry. President Boris Yeltsin, who met Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, in Moscow last Friday, said he hoped Russia could join by the end of this year. However, officials in Moscow and Geneva believe membership in two to three years' time is more realistic. Mr Sergei Glaziev, Russia's trade minister, said yesterday his country's accession to Gatt was an essential step in its integration into the global trading system, which in turn was vital for the success of economic and political reform. The Gatt council also approved draft entry terms negotiated for Paraguay, which will join the 111-member organisation later this summer once procedural formalities are concluded. At the same time, the council expelled Serbia and Montenegro from the seat held by the former Yugoslavia. In another development, the EC lifted its veto on establishment of an independent disputes panel to examine a complaint by five Latin American countries that the EC's new banana import restrictions violate international fair trade rules. The restrictions, which come into force on July 1, limit imports of Latin American bananas to 2m tonnes a year above which punitive tariffs are applied. Imports of bananas from African and Caribbean countries linked with the EC through the Lome Convention will continue to enter duty-free. The council failed to agree on whether the issue should be treated under 'rules of urgency' as requested by the Latin American banana producers. These require the panel to report within three months rather than the usual six months. The decision will now be left to the panel. The EC opposed adoption of an earlier panel report which condemned its existing restrictions on Latin American banana imports and, by extension, the Lome Convention itself as inconsistent with Gatt rules. Trade officials say the EC could seek a formal Gatt waiver for the convention, as the US has done for its Caribbean Basin Initiative. Trade ministers of the seven-nation European Free Trade Association, meeting in Geneva, said yesterday they expected the European Economic Area linking the EC and six Efta members in a giant free trade zone to come into force before the end of 1993. Delays in ratification by three EC countries - the Netherlands, Spain and Britain - mean the EEA cannot take effect on July 1 as hoped.</p>

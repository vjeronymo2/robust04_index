			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Mousse ado about nothing I WAS called into the Treasury this week for another briefing by Britain's best-known trencherman and voluptuary: the cube-shaped Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer and de facto prime minister. It is Mr Cube, not John Major, who is now calling the shots in the highest cabinet echelons. This was my second meeting with the chancellor, and it went just like the first. We ate and drank enormously, and laughed until the tears ran. 'Help yourself to a groaning platter,' said the chancellor when I greeted him, 'and don't spare the horses, hah hah hah hah hah.' As usual, there was a huge walnut sideboard on each side of his desk, the first bearing an extensive display of traditional English foodstuffs, the second buckling under the weight of assembled ciders and ales. 'Only the best English fare,' shouted the chancellor cheerily. 'None of that muck from Anton Mosimann. Pulses and grains? Organic protein? Meat-free recipes? Spinach gnocchi? Shrimp and veggie couscous? Don't make me weep. Have some of that hot-pot with a splodge of boiled tongue. There is Christmas pud for afters. You haven't heard it's Christmas? It's always Christmas here] Dear oh dear gorblimey] Get yourself stuck in, lad.' After an hour of this fun, I tried to steer the chancellor towards a brief chat about the economy. But you can't stir Mr Cube. Fire a toy gun at the chancellor and he retaliates with ballistic missiles. I said: 'Are you worried about the economy? What about those pundits who reckon you have an easy escape route from your public deficit nightmare?' 'F'instance?' 'Well, Anatole Kaletsky, who wrote recently that release from the public deficit nightmare - using the word ironically - was readily available, just as it was from the 'nightmare' of the ERM. He recommends four things: 'Cut interest rates sharply; raise taxes moderately, but in politically uncontroversial ways; allow the pound to float; and keep down the growth of unit wage costs.' Ideally, says Anatole, you should slash interest base rates by three full points to take them back to levels last seen in the 1950s. Why don't you do that, chancellor? Are you a man or a mousse?' 'Kaletsky Smaletsky]' roared the chancellor. 'You're both as daft as pegs. I have told you before, lad: the only things wrong with the economy are things inside your head. You go around in a dream. I assume you're taking pills. Double the dose at once, lad. There was a period of roughness. A breeze across the millpond. But all of that's behind us. The economy is a success. The country's in finest fettle, roaring away like the clappers. How many times must I tell you? 'All these cut-and-run johnnies who are telling me to slash interest rates, slash this, slash that, haven't an ounce of political nous or any traction in the real world. Dear oh dear gorblimey] What is needed now, and for years and years ahead, is stolidity and gumption. A firm hand on the tiller. No one rocking the boat. Steady as she goes, lad. Try that orange custard. It's one of Mrs Raffald's, from 1769. Yummie yummie yum-yum.' Sveltely, I changed the subject. I said: 'Do you still expect us to believe that John Major has your undiluted loyalty?' The chancellor replied mock-gruffly: 'My position is perfectly clear. I stand four-square behind John Major.' 'With a machete in your hand?' 'With a bottle of halibut oil.' Given that Mr Cube is now the de facto prime minister, I sought to quiz him on a number of other topics that ought to be close to a paramount leader's heart. I said: 'How do you think the government is doing in terms of foreign policy?' 'Absolutely splendidly,' he said. 'An unsung renaissance.' 'Defence?' 'Positively wonderfully.' 'Trade?' 'Quite brilliantly.' 'Social and welfare policy?' 'Nine out of 10.' 'Health?' 'Inexpressively marvellously.' 'Crime?' 'Undeniably promisingly.' 'Arts?' 'I believe we can say magnanimously.' 'Sport?' 'Without a doubt excitingly. Have you tried that shortcake? It's soaked in peach liqueur.' Vote Labour next election? I do not see how we could dare.</p>

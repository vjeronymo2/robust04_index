			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego Assn. of Governments committee Thursday agreed to study a "multiple  airport" solution to the region's need for a long-term alternative to  increasingly crowded Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> The plan, proposed Sept. 12 by San Diego City Councilmen Ron Roberts and Bob  Filner, would add a fourth option to the list of alternatives being studied by  the Sandag panel. The committee now is exploring the feasibility of shifting  the regional airport to Miramar Naval Air Station, a site east of Miramar and a  binational airport on the Mexican border.  </P> <P> As envisioned by Roberts and Filner, city-owned Brown Field on Otay Mesa, now a  general aviation airport, would be expanded into a major facility operating in  conjunction with Lindbergh. Montgomery Field and Palomar Airport in Carlsbad  might also be used for commuter air traffic.  </P> <P> The mix of air traffic at Brown and Lindbergh fields would be determined in the  future, depending on Sandag study of noise, ground access, environmental  constraints and the technical feasibility of landing airliners at Brown Field.  </P> <P> Sandag's Board of Directors will vote on the proposed study today.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 22 (ATA) -- The Tirana district  attorney has sent the case of Ramiz Alia to the court for trial.  To be tried along with Alia are former government officials  Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, Rita Marko, Simon Stefani, Hekuran  Isai, Aranit Cela, Zylyftar Ramizi, Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi.  The pre-trial investigations have lasted nearly a year.    The accused are charged with conspiracy leading to the  misappropriation of state property in the amount worth 2,883,502  leks. They are also charged with abuse of office and violation  of the fundamental rights of citizens resulting in economic  damages of 484,778 leks.    The results of the investigation are held to show that these  crimes were committed while the accused were serving in high  government and party posts in deliberate violation of judicial  norms and laws in force at the time.    Among the acts constituting the violation of the civil  rights  of citizens were the execution of 22 persons without trial in  1951 and the subsequent falsifying of court records.    Other former high officials of party and state shown by the  investigation to be involved in planning and carrying out these  criminal acts were: Enver Hoxha, Mehmet Shehu, Kadri Hasbiu,  Beqir Balluku, Nevzat Haznedari, Edip Cuci, Shuaip Panariti,  Vangjel Kocani, and Siri Carcani. These persons will, however,  not be tried because they are dead or missing or the statute of  limitations has expired.    The evictions and dislocations of thousands of people were  carried out in illegal fashion by special administrative organs,  when these actions were used as forms of punishment for various  civil acts.    These activities by the former organs of state security were  approved by the Politburo and carried out in secret in violation  of the Constitution and other laws in force. These practises  resulted in a pattern of continuous, systematic abuses of the  inviolability of the person (including loss of life) and  property of the citizen and the violation of his fundamental  rights including freedom of speech, assembly, press and other  forms of communication.    The accused are charged with complicity in the 1990 killing  along the state borders of persons held to be committing treason  by illegally trying to leave the country. To the charges of  murder in these cases has been added that of the desecration of  the bodies in order to create an atmosphere of intimidation  among the population.    Finally, the indictment holds the accused responsible for  the  anti-constitutional acts during 1967-1976 of forbidding the  practice of religion and the destruction of religious properties  of great historical and cultural value.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Yingjiang-Bhamo  highway, a new highway across the Sino-Myanmar [Burma] border  area, opened to traffic late last month.    The 128-kilometer highway runs from Yingjiang County in  southwest China's Yunnan Province to Bhamo city in the northern  frontier region of Myanmar.    The construction of the highway started in November 1991. It  connects the noted Yunnan-Myanmar highway in Yunnan Province and  links up with the Stilwell Highway in Myanmar (the Stilwell  Highway was named after Joseph Stilwell, a late U.S. general).  The section of the highway in Myanmar's territory is 56  kilometers. With the approval of the Myanmar government,  Chinese road builders joined in the construction of a  28.8-kilometer part of the highway on the Myanmar side.    The highway is built along the ancient commercial path which  stretched from Yunnan to Myanmar, India and Pakistan.    Sources said that the opening of the highway will promote  the  development of border trade between China and Myanmar and will  serve as a short cut for trade between China and Southeast Asian  and southern Asian countries.</p>

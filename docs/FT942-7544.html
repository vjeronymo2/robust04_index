			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: At last, first with the news - Television The idea that television was about to become the mainstay of journalism and that, willy nilly, newspapers would have to turn to the provision of background material, comment and colour, was in great favour 30 years ago. Nothing very much seemed to happen, however, and the subject went out of fashion. Yet slowly television did expand its journalistic capacity and techniques, and the subject matter it was able and willing to deal with, and now (looking beyond this week's strike by BBC journalists) we are seeing the success of something awfully like the revolution discussed in the 1960s - though now nobody seems to be paying much attention. An interesting example occurred last Thursday. At 9.30 in the True Stories slot Channel 4 had screened a long documentary by Nicholas Broomfield, who in a previous programme had shown himself spending a long time failing to get an interview with South African right-winger Eugene Terreblanche. Since that seemed to amuse people Broomfield used the same idea again, but this time his subject was Margaret Thatcher. While other people got themselves onto the press list, gained access to the lunches on her book promotion tour and so on, Broomfield showed himself failing at every turn. He made the reason fairly clear: he is inept. Seeking an interview with Mark Thatcher, Broomfield was asked for his telephone number but was unable to remember the name of his hotel, let alone the phone number. His journalism comes from the 'Hey mum look at me' school of studied naivety. Roger Cook, whose Cook Report on ITV had offered a lacklustre item on steroids earlier in the evening, sometimes seems in danger of joining the same school. However, it was the programme after the Broomfield fiasco which was interesting. Instead of the billed item on the health service at 11.05, Channel 4 rushed into the schedule a Dispatches Special about Robert Black, the man who, earlier that day, had been given 10 life sentences for murdering young girls. Obviously made in preparation for the ending of the trial, the programme contained a mass of background information on Black's life and upbringing, and clear indications that he may have been responsible for many more murders. Some details of the programme's content and technique were highly questionable: did the relatives of one victim really need to hear Black's description of what he did to her? And given the emotional nature of the case was it necessary to add mood music and heartbeat sound effects? What cannot be questioned is the speed with which television brought this material to the public. No doubt the viewing figures for an unscheduled programme late on Channel 4 were low, but the fact remains that television was several hours ahead of the newspapers. Last night in Assignment on BBC2 George Alagiah, who did such admirable work for BBC News in Somalia, reported on the 'reign of terror' in another African country in the 1970s when, as Alagiah said, 'ethnic origin alone was enough to put you in prison' and 150,000 people were killed. Not South Africa, of course, where deaths were a tiny fraction of that figure, but Ethiopia under the regime of Col. Mengistu. This may not have been the clearest or most technically polished programme of its sort ever made, but it is the first I have seen to give a detailed account of the Mengistu pogrom. Moreover, if there has been a report with anything like this detail in the British press I have missed it. Furthermore, although I have certainly seen newspaper reports about the activities of Dame Shirley Porter and her Conservative colleagues on Westminster City Council, I have never read an account with the detail that last week's Panorama provided. This was the programme notoriously pulled from the schedule immediately before the local elections, and it was not hard to see why there had been nervousness. No punches were pulled, the word 'gerrymandering' was used frequently, and no viewer can have been left in doubt that the programme makers' believed there had been deliberate wrong doing. The final sentence in commentary stated that Conservative party chairman Kenneth Baker portrayed the result of Dame Shirley's successful local election campaign as 'a victory for prudent and efficient local government' but that in truth her victory 'had largely been bought from the public purse'. Assuming the preceding statements were all reliable, the programme certainly justified that conclusion and it is a pity that it was not broadcast as a public service before the local elections rather than after. Nevertheless the most significant fact is that the BBC did not, to adopt the language of The Bill, bottle out. John Birt's first major task at the BBC was to overhaul, combine and expand the news and current affairs departments (to reorganise BBC journalism in other words) - and, some say, to introduce rigid hierarchical control and a uniform approach. Opponents of 'Birtism' claim that it smacks of both Stalinism and Thatcherism, and that, intentionally or not, it serves the interests of Conservative governments. It would seem difficult to square that argument with the Panorama in question. In the long term the sheer expansion of television journalism, partly resulting from the Birt reforms, partly from the general proliferation of television, will surely prove more significant than any supposed political slant. Yet however extensive television reporting might become, the medium would continue to be a poor relation in the world of journalism while it lacked the techniques, and to a large extent perhaps the will, to deal also in opinion. But these days even that is changing, albeit in a fairly small way so far, and chiefly on Channel 4. Frederic Raphael's attack on 'rightsism' - the special rights claimed by women, homosexuals, black people and so on - in last week's Without Walls on Channel 4 was a particularly significant straw in the wind since it ran counter to the political correctness which tends to dominate thinking in these areas on television. Gratifyingly there appears to be no tendency at present for television to drive newspapers out of business. But the expansion and development in television journalism discussed at such length 30 years ago does seem finally to be happening.</p>

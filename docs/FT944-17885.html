			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Persil Power 'no better than others': Unilever rejects report in new round of soap wars Persil Power, Unilever's controversial detergent, is no better overall at removing stains from clothes than other soap powders such as Novon Colour, Sainsbury's own-label brand, and Procter &amp; Gamble's Ariel Ultra, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. Ms Helen Parker, acting editor of Which?, the association's magazine, said that although the powder was good at removing some stains such as red wine, like other detergents, it was much less effective against difficult stains such as curry. Which? magazine carries a report on Persil Power in its latest issue. Unilever rejected the report. It said: 'The Consumers' Association is not a test institute. It is trying to work in a very complex situation. Tests by independent research laboratories show Persil Power is superior.' The detergent, which Unilever has promoted as the biggest breakthrough in a generation in cleaning power, has sparked controversy because of allegations that its patented manganese catalyst, the 'accelerator', can damage clothes under certain conditions. Soon after the launch of Persil Power the volume of 'accelerator' in the detergent was reduced by Unilever. The Consumers' Association tested the original version in June and the latest version last month and found no difference between them in cleaning power. Ms Parker said: 'If you were worried that you were missing out on a revolution in stain-busting because of the controversy over Persil Power, then rest easy. Our independent tests show that the stain-removing ability of new Persil Power is no better than that of some of its rival brands and own-brands.' The association said that its tests for potential damage by Persil Power to clothes will not be completed for several months. The Dutch consumers' association concluded three weeks ago that Omo Power, the version of the detergent sold on the Continent, was no better at stain removal than other detergents. Moreover, the damage it caused clothes was 'more than comparable powders'. Unilever gained support yesterday, however, from the Danish consumers' association, which was quoted as saying: 'There is no acute problem and we do not advise against Omo Power. If the detergent damages the garments, it will be a long-term effect.' The association also said it did not know whether other detergents had the same long-term effects because 'no other detergent has been tested as thoroughly as Omo Power'. Each negative report has hit Unilever's sales of the detergent, particularly in the Netherlands and Britain where press coverage has been heaviest. Unilever stood by its claims for the cleaning prowess of the latest Persil Power. It said: 'The Consumers' Association's results are based on laboratory testing. What we have always said is that it is what happens in homes that counts.'</p>

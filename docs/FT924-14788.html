			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Japan seen to be victim of bias by newspapers COVERAGE of Japan in many British national newspapers is negative and biased with a heavy concentration on whale hunting, war atrocity and 'funny Jap' stories, according to a new study. The survey - by Professor Douglas Anthony, professor of Japanese studies at Cardiff University, and sponsored by Andersen Consulting - was based on a study of the national and regional press from January to June 1991. Each article was rated as positive, neutral or negative. The mass-market tabloids, with the exception of the Daily Mirror, use 'viciousness, vacuity and sheer negative spitefulness in their treatment of items on Japan', the report argues. However, Today and the Daily Mail both had more neutral than negative stories. Coverage in the broadsheet papers was much greater but still less than Japan's size or importance merited. The Financial Times had the most articles on Japan - 639. After that came The Independent with 188 and The Times with 180. Such a high proportion of the FT's coverage was judged to be neutral that it was not considered worth making a full breakdown. The Sunday broadsheets, apart from their financial pages, were largely negative.</p>

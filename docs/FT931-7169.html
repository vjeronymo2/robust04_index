			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities on hold for ICI statement UK STOCK market investors were keeping well below the parapet yesterday as they waited for ICI, London's senior blue chip company, to disclose details of the financing involved in its demerger plan when it announces trading figures this morning. The likelihood of a near Pounds 1bn rights issue from ICI, even though widely predicted by analysts, was enough to keep many fund managers away from the market yesterday. Indeed, the Footsie Index to a large extent tracked the ICI share price, falling smartly in early trading but then rallying in the second half of the session. The initial fall in UK equities was sparked off by a sharp fall in the March contract on the Footsie, while the closing rally took in some buying support from overseas investors attracted by weakness in sterling. Also helping London was the early strength of the New York market which was 18 Dow points ahead in UK trading hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,817, a net loss on the day of 1 point. At these levels - the Footsie dipped to 2,810 in early deals, the lower end of the market's trading range appears firmly held. The chances of a fresh move to the upper end of the range, in the 2,900 area, waits upon ICI. The focus turned back towards the Footsie stocks, with the pharmaceuticals leading the market when overseas buyers appeared in the final hour of trade. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 7.2 to 3,029.9. Non-Footsie shares made up 65 per cent of the day's Seaq volume total of 592.7m. Tuesday's Seaq total of 597.8m shares was worth Pounds 1.23bn at retail level. 'We will all be amazed if ICI doesn't make a rights issue this morning,' commented one leading dealer. However, wild rumours circulated, the most prevailing being a suggestion that Glaxo might bid for Zeneca, the proposed pharmaceutical and bio technology company to be formed if the ICI demerger is carried through. The rest of the market continued to lack direction, and it was left to corporate developments to provide what few highlights there were. British Aerospace, disclosing a Pounds 1.2bn loss for the year, nevertheless pleased the market with its dividend policy. Bank shares remained easier in the wake of the increased debt provisions announced this week by National Westminster. The weakness in sterling, which depressed government bond prices, was noted cautiously in an equity market still expecting further cuts in domestic interest rates. Some strategists, however, said that such hopes were now being reined in to 'only half a point and not necessarily at Budget time.' The strategy team at Smith New Court warned this week that the chances of further big falls in short-term interest rates have diminished as signs of economic recovery become more evident. While approving of the UK market 'in absolute terms, Smith recommends a neutral stance. With no further important data on the UK economy expected this week, share prices appear dependent on weighty list of impending rights issue, in which ICI may be the most prominent but is certainly not the only feature. Even the Pounds 1bn issue predicted from ICI would probably be acceptable in the market but traders will be happy to have the uncertainty taken off their shoulders.</p>

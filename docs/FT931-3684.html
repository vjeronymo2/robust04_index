			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / W Europe car sales decline sharply NEW car sales in west Europe plunged in February by 16.9 per cent, as demand dropped steeply for the second month in succession. According to industry estimates, new car sales fell in February to 925,000 from 1.1m a year earlier, led by sharp falls in four of the five leading volume markets. For the first two months of the year new car sales in west Europe have fallen by around 20.6 per cent to 1.88m. In Germany, the single biggest market in Europe, sales fell in February by an estimated 22.7 per cent to 245,000, compounding the 27.5 per cent decline suffered in January. New car sales in Italy fell in February by 13.9 per cent year-on-year, while new car registrations in France dropped by 21.5 per cent, and sales in Spain fell by 33 per cent. The UK, slowly emerging from over three years of recession, has become one of the few markets in Europe to show growth, with a 16.1 per cent rise in registrations in February. UK sales have been higher than a year earlier in five of the last six months, and have risen by 11 per cent year-on-year in the first two months of 1993, albeit from a depressed level. Overall, new car sales both in February and in the first two months of 1993 have been lower than a year ago in 14 of 17 markets across west Europe with higher sales only in the UK, Ireland and Norway. Losses are mounting at several car makers in Europe, as plants are forced on to short-time working and thousands of jobs are eliminated. Five of the big six volume carmakers in Europe, the Volkswagen group, General Motors, PSA Peugeot-Citroen, Ford and Renault, have suffered a drop in sales of more than a fifth in the first two months of the year. European motor industry leaders are forecasting a decline in west European new car sales for the full year of 9-15 per cent, after four years in which demand has held steady at close to 13.5m. In the first two months of the year only Rover, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, has achieved a small increase in new registrations, supported by its still heavy dependence on its domestic UK market. Among the leading volume carmakers the Fiat group of Italy, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, has gained ground in market share and has moved into second place, helped by the more moderate fall in demand in Italy than in Germany, France and Spain. Japanese carmakers' sales in west Europe in the first two months fell by an estimated 16.8 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                           January-February 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Volume     Volume   Share (%)    Share (%)                          (Units)  Change(%)  Jan-Feb 93   Jan-Feb 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           1,883,000      -20.6       100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.       313,000      -21.0        16.6         16.7 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) Fiat (incl.

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIOMED FIRMS RACE TO IMPROVE PAP SMEAR TESTS  </P> <P> Robin Sealander was relieved with the results of her Pap smear.  </P> <P> For several months in late 1985, the 26-year-old Baldwin Park woman had  suffered from heavy vaginal bleeding and irregular menstrual periods. She went  to her gynecologist fearing that she had cancer.  </P> <P> The doctor took a Pap smear, a test used to detect cervical cancer. It came  back negative, as had two previous tests.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Sealander's symptoms didn't go away. Four months after the last  lab test, Sealander consulted another physician. He found that she had cervical  cancer. The effect of the disease was so severe that it was visible to the  naked eye.  </P> <P> "He just looked at her and said, 'You have cancer,' " recalled William  Sealander, Robin's father. "He knew right away."  </P> <P> Fifteen months later, Robin died.  </P> <P> "She was my only girl," Sealander said. "It's something you never get over."  </P> <P> What's shocking about Sealander's story -- and thousands like it -- is that Pap  smears often fail to detect cervical cancer, which can be cured if caught in  time. The industry's average error rate is an alarming 5%, and recent federal  and state inspections revealed that some labs misdiagnose nearly 20% of the Pap  smears they examine.  </P> <P> Nearly 70 years after the Pap smear was invented by Greek immigrant George  Papanicolaou, the computer age has finally caught up with the test. Scientists  and entrepreneurs, prompted by growing concerns among women and publicity about  problems plaguing the Pap smear industry, are joining forces in an effort to  improve the Pap smear's accuracy.  </P> <P> Biomedical companies around the United States have spotted opportunities. By  year's end, companies will be selling computers that they claim can immediately  detect cancer cells, kits that can spot a new virus that may cause cervical  cancer and improved swabs designed to collect hard-to-reach cervical cells.  </P> <P> "All of this is way overdue," said Tenny Tse, co-owner of Medscand, a Florida  medical supply company.  </P> <P> Pap smear diagnosis still requires a technician to stare through a microscope  at hundreds of thousands of cells per slide to find a handful that might  indicate the presence of cancer. Consequently, mistakes are frequent, and only  recently has the government begun to impose quality standards.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, National Cancer Screening Laboratories was dropped from the  Medicare and Medi-Cal programs after federal inspectors determined that the  Fullerton lab had misread 19% of the slides in a sample survey. The company has  shut down.  </P> <P> And a year ago this week, the state Department of Health Services shut down the  nation's largest Pap smear lab, Central Pathology Services Medical Group in  Tarzana, after a survey team reported that its error rate was 21%.  </P> <P> Nearly 60,000 women in the United States develop cervical cancer every year,  and 7,000 die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.  </P> <P> "I have a cupboard full of cases of women who were diligent and went back for  Pap smear after Pap smear and still died," said Dr. Dorothy Rosenthal, chief of  cytology at UCLA Medical Center.  </P> <P> The cost of a Pap smear typically ranges from $20 to $50, and the market  worldwide is tremendous. Fifty million women in the United States and 75  million in Europe spend billions of dollars a year getting Pap smears. About  125 million more smears are processed in Japan, South Africa and parts of South  America.  </P> <P> Until recently, laboratories used the Pap smear as an inexpensive loss-leader  to attract new business from doctors. Some labs charged as little as $1 per Pap  smear -- even though the test is done manually and requires heavy staffing --  in return for orders for much more expensive tests, such as urinalyses and  histologies.  </P> <P> Although some states require laboratories to bill patients directly, others,  including California, still allow doctors to mark up laboratory tests.  Physicians can boost their profits by seeking out a low-cost provider and then  charging a higher price to the patient.  </P> <P> "Gynecologists have an incentive to shop around for the cheapest market," said  Mark Rutenberg, co-inventor of a computerized Pap smear system named Papnet.  "They buy laboratory services like they buy their carpeting or lights: It has  to be inexpensive but look good."  </P> <P> Fewer and fewer labs, though, are using the Pap smear as a carrot. Federal  regulations now place an 80-slide limit per day on a lab technician's workload.  This has increased the demand for cytotechnologists -- individuals trained to  read Pap smears -- at the same time that there is a growing shortage of such  personnel.  </P> <P> The California Assn. of Cytotechnologists reports that the number of vacant  positions has ballooned from 19 in 1988 to 150 last year. There are only about  1,000 cytotechnologists in the state, mostly because few people are interested  in a job that can be tedious.  </P> <P> Salaries for qualified people have soared from about $20,000 two years ago to  as much as $50,000 in the Los Angeles area. The cost of a Pap smear has risen  accordingly.  </P> <P> Despite a crackdown on medical costs, few people think that patients or  insurance companies will object to a slight rise in price for new products if  those products yield better Pap smear results.  </P> <P> "For the first time (doctors) are willing to pay more to get an accurate Pap  smear. In the past, the cheapest was the best," said Rosenthal. "Now there is a  realization that Pap smears are important. They are not dipstick tests."  </P> <P> To many in the industry, automation appears to be the only solution to  personnel shortages and the public clamor for accuracy.  </P> <P> Two tiny technology companies have emerged as the leading candidates in the  drive to automate Pap smear diagnosis, and each is racing to finish first.  </P> <P> Papnet, manufactured by Neuromedical Systems Inc. in Suffern, N.Y., is expected  to be the first computerized system to be installed in labs, starting this  summer. Using image processing technology pioneered by Jet Propulsion Lab in  Pasadena, Papnet picks the 64 worst-looking cells out of the hundreds of  thousands that appear on a typical Pap smear slide.  </P> <P> Those suspicious cells are shown on a TV screen, which the cytotechnologist  examines to make a diagnosis. Papnet eliminates eye strain and fatigue that  result from trying to find the two or three abnormal cases out of every 100.  </P> <P> "It's a needle in a haystack problem," said Mark Rutenberg, co-inventor of  Papnet. "Right now, the cytotechnologist has to find as few as 10 bad cells out  of 300,000. The job with our machine is to find those 10 cells out of 64."  </P> <P> Neuromedical has notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of its  intention to sell Papnet for research purposes. This is a step towards being  able to introduce the machine commercially.  </P> <P> Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham has announced that it will install  Papnet in two of its labs this summer. And UCLA Medical Center has said it  intends to get one within the next eight weeks.  </P> <P> Neuromedical claims that during in-house tests, Papnet has never failed to  identify a Pap smear containing cancerous cells. However, academic studies to  confirm the machine's effectiveness are years away.  </P> <P> Dr. Leopold Koss, one of the world's foremost experts on Pap smears and  chairman of the pathology department at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in  the Bronx, has just begun reviewing Papnet's performance. "I wouldn't be  wasting my time if the instrument were not promising," he said. I and my  colleagues consider the machine very interesting."  </P> <P> Neuromedical, which plans to make a $20-million to $30-million public stock  offering in a few months, expects to rent the machines commercially for $5 per  Pap smear.  </P> <P> "On a slow day, we get calls from 30 labs wanting the machine," said Rutenberg.  </P> <P> Rosenthal at UCLA confirms that laboratories are anxious to find an automated  system that works. "People who have seen this and other machines have  practically signed contracts," she said. "They say, even before (the machines)  are ready, 'We'll take five.' "  </P> <P> Neuromedical's chief competi tor is NeoPath Inc. The privately-held Bellevue,  Wash., company is developing an image-processing system -- the AutoPap 300 --  that will automatically sort slides into two piles: normal and suspicious. The  cost is projected to be under $1 per slide. The company expects to begin FDA  trials by year-end.  </P> <P> Financial analysts say whichever company first succeeds in automating Pap smear  diagnoses stands to strike it rich.  </P> <P> "There are no (automated) systems out there today," said Wayne Wager, a general  partner with the venture capital firm Cable &amp; Howse. "The market is  somewhere in the neighborhood of half a billion dollars in equipment for  processing Pap smears."  </P> <P> Until now, the Pap smear has successfully resisted automation because of the  complexity of the cells on each slide. They come in various shapes and sizes  and often overlap like pancakes. Humans can distinguish boundaries, but  computers often can't.  </P> <P> "Our eyes are more clever than the machine -- so far," said Karen Andersen,  president-elect of the California Assn. of Cytotechnologists.  </P> <P> Besides automation, biomedical companies are working on tests to detect a virus  -- human papilloma virus (HPV) -- that some scientists think may be a precursor  to cervical cancer. The tests are being used by researchers in conjunction with  the Pap smear.  </P> <P> Life Technologies in Gaithersburg, Md., a publicly held company traded over the  counter, is the only company to date that has received approval from the FDA to  sell such a test for diagnostic purposes.  </P> <P> The company has sold about $4 million worth of its ViraPap product since the  test was introduced last year.  </P> <P> Enzo Biochem in New York and Digene Diagnostics in Silver Spring, Md., are  developing tests that they say are faster and easier to use than the ViraPap.  </P> <P> Even if a lab forgoes a new computer or the HPV test, it can greatly improve  its diagnoses by using advanced swabs that cost less than 50 cents each.  Studies show that many cancers and abnormalities are missed altogether on a Pap  smear because the doctor has failed to collect an adequate sample of cells  while inserting the swab into the cervix.  </P> <P> Two companies have introduced brushes that greatly increase the number of cells  obtained during a smear, including hard-to-reach endocervical cells that are  often the first to harbor cancer.  </P> <P> Medscand's Cytobrush was developed by a Swedish cytopathologist and is  considered a vast improvement over the cotton applicators and wood spatulas  still used by many physicians. The Cytobrush received FDA approval six years  ago, and some 20 million have been sold so far at 20 cents apiece, compared to  about 2 cents for a spatula or cotton swab.  </P> <P> Cytobrushes cost about 20 cents each, compared to about 2 cents for a cotton  applicator or spatula.  </P> <P> The April issue of the journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology contains an academic  study led by Dr. Paul J. Murata at UCLA that says the use of the Cytobrush  increased the number of cancers accurately diagnosed.  </P> <P> Connecticut-based Unimar has sold nearly a million of its Cervex-Brushes since  it began marketing the product last year. The brush costs from 29 cents to 44  cents.  </P> <P> Poor sampling may have contributed to Robin Sealander's death from cervical  cancer, according to a malpractice suit her father filed two years ago in U.S.  Superior Court in Pomona against a medical lab and her former gynecologist.  </P> <P> Dr. Irene Davos, a pathologist at Cedars Sinai Hospital, examined Sealander's  last Pap smear and testified that it "may have been an unsatisfactory specimen  and (the lab) should have requested another test."  </P> <P> The case was settled out of court last year.  </P> <P> AIMING FOR BETTER PAP SMEAR ACCURACY  </P> <P> PAPNET: an image processing computer that selects the 64 worst-looking cells on  a Pap smear and then projects them on a high-resolution television screen for  diagnosis.  </P> <P> AutoPap 300: an image processing computer that sorts Pap smears into two  categories, normal and suspicious. Only abnormal slides are reviewed by a  cytotechnologist.  </P> <P> ViraPap: a DNA probe test used to detect the presence of human papilloma virus  or HPV, which some scientists think may be a precursor to cervical cancer.  </P> <P> Cervex-Brush: a special swab designed to collect hard-to-reach endocervical  cells, which are then put on a Pap smear slide.  </P> <P> Source: Product manufacturers  </P> <P> IDENTIFYING ABNORMAL AND MALIGNANT CELLS  </P> <P> A technician uses a microscope to examine thousands of cells on a Pap smear,  searching for the relative handful that may indicate the presence of cancer.  Below are cell samples, as they appear through the microscope, showing normal,  abnormal but not precancerous, precancerous and malignant cancer cells.  </P> <P> PROBLEM CYTOLOGY LABS  </P> <P> Federal health officials have terminated the participation of several cytology  labs in reimbursement programs because of a high level of errors, mostly on Pap  smear diagnoses.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.53IN:3.43IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Termination  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Facility  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Location  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> date  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Uni Lab Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Westmont, Ill.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2/1/88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Central Medical Laboratory Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Southfield, Mi.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11/1/88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> National Cyto Lab Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Harvey, Ill.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12/23/88  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pines Peak Diagnostic  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Services Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Colorado Springs, Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2/7/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Central Pathology  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Services Med Group  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tarzana  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2/21/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Plaza Health Laboratories Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Brooklyn, N.Y.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6/1/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Medicon Diagnostic Lab  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> New York  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7/1/89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cancer Cytology Medical Lab  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rockville, Md.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3/1/90  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> National Cancer Screening  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Laboratories  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fullerton  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4/20/90  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  </P></p>

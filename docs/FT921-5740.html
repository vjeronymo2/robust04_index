			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Hopefuls struggle in political mass market: Bush still has to deal with an aggressive Buchanan in Georgia DEMOCRATIC and Republican presidential candidates embarked yesterday on a last day of whirlwind campaigning before today's round of primary and caucus voting. Seven states will cast their votes today in the Democratic nomination race, and five in the Republican race, promising the first significant indication of the breadth of support for the rival candidates. On the Republican side, Mr Patrick Buchanan, the outspoken right-wing television commentator, renewed his attack on incumbent President George Bush. The president sorely needs to beat off Mr Buchanan's challenge by defeating him roundly in Georgia, but must contend with Mr Buchanan's overt appeal to white racism in the state. Among the Democrats, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas fought to preserve their lead over their rivals Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Governor Jerry Brown of California. Until now, the nomination battle has been fought step by step in four states that rank among the smallest and most atypical in the US. Together, Iowa, New Hampshire, Maine and South Dakota account for only 3 per cent of the delegates to the Democratic party's nominating convention, and fewer than 4 per cent of the Republican party's delegates. They also number among the most ethnically homogeneous states in the nation, with a black population ranking below 1 per cent. Today's seven state contest, dubbed 'Junior Tuesday,' will decide another 10 per cent of convention delegates, and mark a shift from the retail politics of New Hampshire to a different kind of political mass marketing. Most of the attention is focused on Maryland, Georgia and Colorado, which along with Utah for the Democrats hold primaries, since these secret ballots provide more of a plebiscite for candidates. Senator Tsongas and Governor Clinton are battling for the lead among the Democrats in these states, with the former ahead in Maryland and Colorado and the latter comfortably in the lead in Georgia. For the Republicans, the battle has been concentrated in Georgia, since Mr Buchanan has been unable to get his name on the ballot in many states. But candidates can also boost their campaigns in states which allot their delegates in closed party caucus meetings - especially Minnesota, where Senator Harkin is mounting a strong bid with substantial backing among trade unionists and party activists who take part in such caucuses. Another four states vote on Saturday, followed by March 10's Super Tuesday contest, when eleven states will vote. They include Texas and Florida - after California and New York the two most populous states in the nation - and between them account for 20 per cent of the Democrats' convention delegates and 23 per cent of the Republicans. By March 17, when primaries Michigan, two heavily populated Midwestern states, nearly half the delegates to the Democrats' July convention in New York and to the Republicans' August gathering in Houston will have been decided. Some political analysts believe it is possible that no clear Democratic nominee will have emerged by then. Yet all the Democratic campaigns are running low on funds and badly need the impetus of a victory today and over the next two weeks. Mr Clinton, whose campaign has been the best financed and organised among the Democrats, is in some ways the best placed to persevere. His bid will, however, be severely weakened if he cannot demonstrate a capacity to win heavily in the southern states which dominate the next two weeks' voting and which are viewed as his home turf. By winning in either Colorado or Maryland, Mr Tsongas could gain enough momentum to carry him forward from his New Hampshire victory. Mr Tsongas has touted his 'electability' as a candidate who can draw alienated Republican voters. 'There are lots of Republicans out there who will come to us if we give them a home,' he said in a debate with his rivals on Sunday. This tactic may be less productive in Maryland, whose local rules allow only registered Democratic voters to take part in the Democratic primary. Mr Clinton renewed his attack on Mr Tsongas's economic policies as 'the 1980s style approach' as he campaigned in Maryland yesterday. He appears to have gained ground there in the last few days, though Mr Tsongas is still expected to win the state. Mr Kerrey could be weakened if he fails to win a single state today, while Mr Harkin is so short of money that he may not be able to sustain his campaign, even if he wins delegates in Minnesota. Mr Brown, after winning less than 10 per cent of the vote in two consecutive primaries, risks losing the federal funding which matches campaign contributions unless he can score higher than 20 per cent in a subsequent primary. Democratic party officials, however, fear that his populist campaign will be able to survive on a shoestring budget. On the Republican side, the battle is not so much over this year's nomination, which President Bush is expected to win overwhelmingly, as over the party's direction into the 1990s. Mr Buchanan claims that his performance in New Hampshire, where his losing score of 37 per cent to Mr Bush's 53 per cent was hailed as a moral victory, has pushed the president's campaign to the brink of disaster. 'I think one more New Hampshire-type victory down here in Georgia and the whole thing could collapse like a house of cards. Now, that is not our expectation, but it is our hope,' he said yesterday. All the same, Mr Buchanan is reckoned to stand little chance of winning even a single state against the Republican party establishment. Even right-wingers critical of some of Mr Bush's policies have rallied round the president.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 'JUNIOR TUESDAY': KEY CONTESTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Maryland     Georgia     Colorado     Minnesota  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unemployment  1988                     4.5%        5.8%         6.4%          4.0%  1990                     5.9%        5.0%         5.0%          5.1%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Food Stamp recipients  Sep 1988              248,000     493,000      208,000       248,000  Sep 1990              323,000     704,000      243,000       292,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Number of delegates  Democrat (% of    total)            80 (1.9%)   88 (2.1%)    54 (1.3%)       87 (2%)  Republican (% of    total)            42 (1.9%)   52 (2.4%)    37 (1.7%)     32 (1.5%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Result at last Presidential election  Republican                51%         60%          53%           46%  Democrat                  48%         40%          45%           53%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Congressional Quarterly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

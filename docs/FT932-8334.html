			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Degussa hit by health reforms DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and drugs group, yesterday unveiled a sharp profits reversal in the early months of the year. Blaming the state of the domestic and world economy and recently-introduced health reforms in Germany, Degussa said that group pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of March dropped 27 per cent to DM77m (Dollars 47.8m). It predicted it would not be able to make this much profit in the second half. The poor result follows a 14 per cent increase in profits in the first three months of the group's financial year, when the figure rose to DM49m. This means that from the first to the second quarter of the year profits dropped by 57 per cent. Group turnover in the first quarter rose 11 per cent to DM6.9bn, although Degussa said this was due to changes in group structure and an increase in metals trading turnover. Without these special factors, turnover would have fallen by 1 per cent. Degussa blamed the change in fortunes on the weakness of domestic and world economies, which hit all business areas but especially the group's metal activities. The pharmaceutical division was hard hit by German health service reforms introduced in January. These were designed to oblige patients to pay more for treatment and have led to what Degussa called 'substantial losses in turnover and profits' in its pharmaceutical activities, which account for 20 per cent of turnover.</p>

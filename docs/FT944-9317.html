			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Getting to the heart of the matter - Television The most notable television event of the past week took place on Sunday night at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London where a packed house watched a marvellously clear print of the 1924 movie epic The Iron Horse, John Ford's two-hour version of the construction of America's first trans-continental railroad 'from sea to shining sea'. Though it is 70 years old and silent, this archetypal western, which was accompanied by a new score for full orchestra, written and conducted by John Lanchbery, was one of the highlights of the London Film Festival. So in what sense was it a television event? The story began 14 years ago when the British Film Institute and Thames Television presented Kevin Brownlow's superbly restored version of Abel Gance's 1927 silent masterpiece Napoleon. Thames TV paid for Carl Davis to write a new score which was played by the Wren Orchestra in the Empire Theatre, Leicester Square. The event began at 10.30 in the morning and ended at 5.30 when it seemed as though the applause would go on for ever. I was not alone in asking when it would be possible to repeat that astounding seven-hour experience, and in time further performances were given in Britain, France, and the US. Then Channel 4 screened the movie for a national audience in Britain. Since then Kevin Brownlow and David Gill have continued their meticulous work on classics of the silent cinema. Thames TV maintained their support and encouraged Brownlow and Gill to make memorable documentary series about the early days of Hollywood, and, when Thames lost its broadcasting licence, Channel 4 took over the baton. Memorable restorations have included The Thief Of Bagdad and The Wind. British television is now seen as the driving force in the historic restoration of the silent cinema to its rightful place. This latest offering, The Iron Horse, foreshadows most of Ford's later preoccupations: the frontier spirit, the renegade white man in league with evil redskins (as Brownlow warned Sunday's audience, there is something here to offend practically everyone nowadays), man braving a huge and dangerous landscape, the lone Pony Express rider in a mad gallop to catch the thundering train and gain a safe haven, the fight in the saloon. Today they may seem like cliches but not, surely, in 1924. The experience of watching this movie on television when Channel 4 transmits it nationally in 1995 will not be the same as watching it in a theatre with an orchestra, but it will be so much better than never seeing it at all. The week's second most notable television event was also provided by Channel 4, this time in the Without Walls series which commissioning editor Waldemar Januszczak is steadily expanding from its original arts base into the widest conceivable - and admirably provocative - 'culture' magazine. Last week the first half was devoted to a tough and sceptical reappraisal of Calcutta's angel of mercy in Christopher Hitchens' polemical item 'Hell's Angel: Mother Teresa'. Hitchens' argument is now widely known: that, although treated as a saint, Mother Teresa seems much given to fraternising with right-wing extremists, dodgy when it comes to relieving the suffering of those in her care, and remarkably effective at increasing the misery of the world's poor by opposing birth control. It was a brave broadcast because the hysterical reaction from the huge and influential religious lobby was wholly forseeable. Before this sort of programme can get on the air you have to have people throughout a broadcasting organisation (in this case from chief executive Michael Grade to producer Tariq Ali) who believe that freedom of speech means the freedom to say what the majority do not already believe. The last time this happened in television was when Hugh Greene ran the BBC, and there were ructions then, too. This time Channel 4 rushed to give a voice to the religious lobby in Right To Reply and chairman Roger Bolton sternly demanded to know of Hitchens and Januszczak where was the 'balance' in their programme, as though he had missed the fact that theirs was the first attempt in years to counter the tons of unbalanced adulation weighing down the other side. Moreover, where was Bolton when we really needed him, during all those decades when religious proselytisers were pouring out their unbalanced programmes full of unsubstantiated stories about supernatural beings who would 'save' us all? Indeed, since such programmes continue, why is Bolton not regularly issuing stern challenges to the people in dog collars to achieve balance, to bring in level headed rationalists alongside the preachers and happy clappers to remind viewers that the evidence for risings from the dead, the afterlife, holy ghosts and so on is precisely nil? The third most notable television event of the week was ITV's Open Fire, a sort of drama-documentary ('based on the true story . . .') about a man named David Martin. Since he is now dead, having hanged himself in prison, most of us would probably never have heard of him had he not been the man whom the police thought they were shooting when they actually shot Stephen Waldorf as he sat in a yellow Mini in a London street in 1983. Anyone who knows even a little about the Waldorf affair must have asked 'How did the police get themselves into such a state of panic that they pumped that many rounds into the wrong man?' By telling the story of Martin, writer/director Paul Greengrass has provided a credible answer to that question. It showed Martin as a violent, gun-toting, transvestite bank robber and expert lock picker who, understandably enough, terrified some of the policemen who were pursuing him. Of course it is difficult to know whether Martin was really as startlingly good looking in drag as actor Rupert Graves made him. It is hard to know whether he really exulted in violence as was shown here, and hard to know what his sexual proclivities were, assuming he knew himself. But however questionable the details, Open Fire suggested one coherent and believable version of what could have happened. In the process it provided the opportunity for Graves and the remarkable Kate Hardie (unforgettable as the teenage runaway in Safe) to give outstanding performances as Martin and his girl friend Sue. Open Fire was almost certainly as close to the truth of 1983 as Iron Horse was to the truth of railroad building in the 1860s, at least in the sense of emotional truth - and that, surely, is largely what the Hitchens programme was about too.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Membership Negotiations Confirm </F> Differences With Four Applicant Countries"; as released by  Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The new phase of membership negotiations between the  Community and the four applicant countries, which were held this  Tuesday [8 February], confirmed the existence of difficulties  between member states (in defining the "common positions") and  with the applicants (which reject certain aspects of these  "common positions"). On Tuesday morning, member states had:    (a) defined their position on agriculture by accepting the  Commission proposal on the immediate alignment of prices (with  the possibility of transitional national compensation payments);    (b) noted certain differences over regional policy  (definition of regions of Nordic countries falling under  Objective 1);    (c) confirmed their position on the problem of transit  through Austria.    In the afternoon, these total or partial positions were  presented to the applicant countries in four separate successive  sessions. The applicants confirmed that:    (1) they reject the Community position on agriculture;    (2) Austria does not accept that the current transit  agreement would expire three years after membership and asks  that it remain valid until 2004;    (3) all four maintain for the most part their demands on  regional matters.</p>

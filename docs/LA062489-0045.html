			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT LIFTS BAN ON 'DIAL-A-PORN';  </P> <P> BUT LAWS CAN STILL FORBID MESSAGES THAT ARE FOUND 'OBSCENE'  </P> <P> The Supreme Court Friday upheld another form of free speech that many find  distasteful, ruling unanimously that the government may not ban for-pay  telephone calls simply because they are sexually oriented.  </P> <P> The justices struck down as unconstitutional part of a law passed by Congress  last year that made it a crime for anyone to sell "indecent" messages over the  telephone.  </P> <P> Thanks to recent technological advances, the court said, parents can ensure  that their children do not get access to the so-called "dial-a-porn" telephone  services, which began operating in 1983. As a result, the government is left  with no compelling reason for banning such calls for adults, the court  concluded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Obscene' Messages  </P> <P> However, on a 6-3 vote, the court also said that the government can ban the  messages that are so offensive as to be judged "obscene." For more than 30  years, the Supreme Court has adhered to the view that obscenity is not covered  by the First Amendment.  </P> <P> The ruling allows the once-booming dial-a-porn industry to stay in business but  it leaves open the threat that a jury may conclude that the messages are so  "patently offensive," sexually explicit and without redeeming value that they  must be banned.  </P> <P> Still, the dial-a-porn industry may face an even bigger challenge. As its  novelty has faded, many of the phone services have been losing callers and  money, according to a lawyer who represents the major dial-a-porn companies.  </P> <P> "This was a passing fad," New York attorney Norman Beier said Friday. "These  companies have all suffered a very significant decline in their business. It's  only about 10% of what it was a few years ago."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second in a Week  </P> <P> For the high court, Friday's ruling marked the second time this week that a law  passed by Congress was struck down as a violation of the First Amendment. The  justices, on a 5-4 vote Wednesday, threw out the 1967 federal law, as well as  all state laws, that made it a crime to burn an American flag as an act of  political protest.  </P> <P> The latest ruling also casts doubt on another election year law passed by  Congress banning all "indecent" broadcasts on television and radio. The Supreme  Court in 1978 said that the government could protect children by banning such  broadcasts during the day and in the early evening hours. But it also said that  such broadcasts -- which may have a sexually explicit scene or foul language in  the midst of serious drama -- could be shown in later hours when children would  not be watching.  </P> <P> Last year, however, spurred by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Congress enacted a  24-hour ban on indecent broadcasts, even though members questioned whether such  a blanket ban was constitutional. That law, now on hold, is being reviewed by  the U.S. appeals court in Washington.  </P> <P> "This ruling should help us. They have said again that indecent speech is  protected by the First Amendment," said Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer  representing the broadcasters who are challenging the Helms amendment.  </P> <P> The Telephone Decency Act, which also was sponsored by Helms last year, was  designed to wipe out the dial-a-porn industry, which took off with the  introduction of "976" services. Simply by dialing this code, callers for a fee  could gain access to a variety of recordings, including those with sexual  themes. It was an instant hit with adolescents.  </P> <P> By May, 1983, industry officials said, 800,000 calls per day were being made to  various "dial-a-porn" services. In California, more than 200 dial-a-porn  services were in business, some of which offered live conversations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outraged Parents  </P> <P> Outraged parents, facing huge phone bills, complained to the Federal  Communications Commission, which over five years and through several court  tests devised rules to ensure that children could not reach the message  services without permission. By requiring callers to use a credit card or a  special access code, or by permitting local phone companies to block out  certain "976" numbers, FCC officials believed that they had found a way to  solve the dial-a-porn problem.  </P> <P> But the Helms amendment intervened, prompting the Supreme Court test. The law  made it a crime, punishable by fines of as much as $50,000, to use an  interstate phone line for "any obscene or indecent communication for commercial  purposes."  </P> <P> Last July, as the law was to go into effect, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace  Tashima in Los Angeles blocked it as partly unconstitutional. Since obscenity  is not protected by the First Amendment, that part of the ban was upheld, but  Tashima struck down the ban on "indecent" messages.  </P> <P> The Ronald Reagan Administration appealed to the Supreme Court, but the  justices Friday affirmed Tashima's ruling in the case (FCC vs. Sable  Communications, 88-525).  </P> <P> Even though Congress can ban such broadcasts during the day, that does not mean  it can ban 976 phone calls, the court said. "Placing a telephone call is not  the same as turning on a radio and being taken by surprise by an indecent  message," Justice Byron R. White said. He was referring to the 1978 ruling  against comedian George Carlin, whose "seven dirty words" monologue was  broadcast over Pacifica radio stations in California.  </P> <P> Both Congress and the Reagan Administration said that the ban on all  dial-a-porn was needed because "enterprising minors" could find a way to get  access to it. But White said that there was no evidence to support this  assertion.  </P> <P> The three most liberal justices -- William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall  and Harry A. Blackmun -- dissented in part, saying that the government should  not be permitted to make it a crime for "consenting adults" to buy obscene  matter. Brennan, who has struggled with the obscenity question for more than 30  years, said that the court cannot define obscenity with any precision.  </P> <P> In other action, the court:  </P> <P>  -- Ruled that employers may provide lesser benefits for older workers without  violating the federal law banning age discrimination (Public Employees  Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts, 88-389). On a 7-2 vote, the court said  that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act generally exempts pension and  benefit plans.  </P> <P> An employee can win an age discrimination suit against a pension or benefit  program only by showing that the company or a government agency had "an intent  to discriminate" against older workers, the court said. It did not say how an  employee could prove that claim.  </P> <P> The ruling frees from liability an Ohio public employees retirement system that  forbids employees over age 60 from getting disability benefits. These older  workers can receive only retirement pay. An appeals court in Cincinnati, ruling  for a disabled 61-year-old woman, had said that the Ohio plan discriminated  based on age.  </P> <P>  -- Ruled that states are immune from being sued for damages by bankrupt  businesses and persons. On a 5-4 vote, the court said that the Constitution  blocks such suits against states (Hoffman vs. Connecticut, 88-412).  </P></p>

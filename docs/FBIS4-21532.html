			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government  grabbed "the stick" and considered using it Tuesday as the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] sent the North Korean  nuclear issue back to the United Nations Security Council.    The government's North Korea policy was finally pushed into  a  hard-line corner by the aggressive and crude remarks made by the  chief North Korean delegate to an inter-Korean working-level  contact last Saturday, when he threatened war against the South.    Realizing the futility of efforts to persuade Pyongyang to  accept full IAEA inspections and help resolve the nuclear issue  through dialogue, officials at Chongwadae [presidential office]  and national security-related ministries huddled to discuss  countermeasures against further North Korean provocation.    President Kim Yong-sam said Tuesday his government has asked  the United States to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles across  the country as soon as possible.    South Korea and the United States have also agreed in  principle to resume their joint military exercise "Team Spirit"  this year. President Kim said a final decision on the war games  will be made after he visits Japan and China.    Kim disclosed these plans at a meeting of senior Democratic  Liberal Party officials including Chairman Kim Chong-pil and  four party postholders.    Almost at the same time, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae met with U.S. ambassador to Seoul  James Laney and the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, Gen. Gary  Luck, to discuss the deployment of Patriot missiles here and the  Team Spirit exercise.    Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and National  Security Affairs Chong Chong-uk noted, "There has been nearly no  change in North Korea's attitude since it announced its  intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  last March.    "North Korea obviously wants to pursue its policy of  improving relations with the United States while delaying  inter-Korean dialogue with the eventual aim of eliminating  Seoul's links with the United States," Chong said.    North Korea's use of "such a nuclear card," however, will no  longer be effective, Chong declared.    At the hour-long breakfast meeting with ruling party  leaders,  President Kim expressed confidence that the South would repel  any kind of provocation from North Korea.    After recalling all instances in which Pyongyang  unilaterally  frustrated Seoul's sincere attempts at dialogue and  reconciliation, Kim said, "I did not expect the North to bring  up talk of war last Saturday."    The matter was especially appalling because the North Korean  chief delegate did not speak spontaneously but was reading a  statement prepared earlier in Pyongyang, Kim said.    "Since we do not want the North isolated from the world  community, we will leave the door open for dialogue," Kim said.    "But war should never break out on the Korean peninsula  again  under any circumstances. Preventing war is possible only when  we are strong," Kim said, explaining his reason for ordering the  deployment of Patriot missiles and considering resumption of  Team Spirit this year.    The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile,  counselled the government Tuesday to refrain from "physical  sanctions" against North Korea in favor of dialogue.    "If the government has determined that there is no immediate  danger of war, it should be cautious in deciding on the  deployment of the Patriot missiles and resumption of Team  Spirit," said the party following a meeting of its policy-making  Supreme Council.    "No one should be allowed to heighten tension on the Korean  peninsula," the party said in a statement. "Resolution of the  North Korean nuclear issue has to be made through a package  deal."    The proposed exchange of special envoys between Seoul and  Pyongyang will also have to be undertaken not as a precondition  to resolve the issue but at the same time, the party said.    The DP then urged North Korea to accept IAEA inspection of  its nuclear facilities to guarantee transparency of nuclear  safeguards and apologize for the chief delegate's statement that  "Seoul will turn into a sea of fire if war breaks out."    In addition, the opposition party pointed out that the Seoul  government should have a consistent North Korea policy.    Kim Tae-chung, former chairman of the Democratic Party, said  he "could not help being aghast at the sea-of-fire statement by  the North Korean delegate," according to his spokesman, Chong  Tong-chae.    Kim Tae-chung was extremely shocked after reading the  remark,  since the North Korean regime has been saying it was for "the  people of Korea" whenever there was a chance.    Kim, however, advised South Korea to avoid being taken in by  such an irrational provocation, Chong said.</p>

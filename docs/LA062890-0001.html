			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ORDERS STUDY ON 8 TRAFFIC  BOTTLENECKS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, acting on a motion by  chairman Ed Edelman, directed its staff Wednesday to conduct a study on how to  relieve traffic congestion in the county's eight most clogged corridors.  </P> <P> The six-month study will lead to the development of a congestion management  plan, required by the recent passage of Proposition 111, which raised the state  gasoline tax.  </P> <P> "If the cities (in the county) want money from the commission" they will have  to work with the agency to implement the plan," Edelman said.  </P> <P> The gas tax hike -- starting with a nickel-a-gallon increase Aug. 1 and  one-cent increase for each of the next four years -- is expected to raise $15.5  billion over the next 10 years.  </P> <P> "We can now draw strategies that will help provide the relief to commuters who  must travel on the busiest" roads, Edelman said.  </P></p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Risk and Reward: Loss focuses attention on detecting unauthorised trades THE Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m loss suffered by Sumitomo Finance International on its interest rate options book last autumn, after a desk manager concealed his real trading position from senior management, has highlighted once again the importance of tight management controls in the derivatives markets. Details of the loss emerged on Friday, when the Securities and Futures Authority expelled and fined the manager. Although failure to report true positions to management is not a risk peculiar to the derivatives market, it may be less likely to be detected, because the valuation of positions is so much more complex, and senior management, or in some cases the traders themselves, may not fully understand the instruments they are dealing with. In the case of over-the-counter options, as in this instance, the lack of liquidity and ready price information is a further element. There is some evidence that management controls were tightened following a Pounds 150m loss incurred by Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, in 1991, when large options positions on the dollar went wrong. Particularly on the corporate treasury side, the Allied-Lyons debacle shifted the trend towards assigning a servicing, rather than a profit-generating function, to treasury depart-ments. Within banks and securities houses there has been a concerted effort by senior management, at board level, to get to grips with the technicalities of the business. The concerns over derivatives risk expressed by regulators such as New York Federal Reserve chairman Mr Gerald Corrigan, although widely criticised within the derivatives industry as alarmist, have served an important function in refocusing the attention of senior management on how their derivatives business is run. One of the recommendations made by the Bank of England's internal report on derivatives published last week was that 'a guiding principle might be that at least two members of the board should be sufficiently knowledgeable to be able to ensure that the business is controlled effectively'. The Bank plans to adopt this recommendation as policy. In the Sumitomo Finance case, it appears that tighter controls might have forestalled the problem. The manager of the interest rate options desk had to record the value of his positions in management reports submitted to his chief executive, but he gave falsely inflated values in order to hide his true position. He then persuaded an employee with another firm, which he knew was used by Sumitomo's accounts department to check those valuations, to quote inflated prices that corresponded with those in his own internal management reports. 'In my experience there are a lot of banks where a trader believed to be of exceptional quality reports direct to the top,' said Mr Derek Ross, a Touche Ross partner who advises banks and securities firms in this area. 'It's easy to develop a culture which allows the trading room to develop without controls.' There are several important principles to be followed, according to Mr Ross: the segregation of duties between the dealing function and the exchange of confirmations (which is part of the pre-settlement function); payment instructions must also be independent; and the management reporting function (usually provided by the accounts department) should be responsible for performance measurement. 'When you get into a complex capital markets environment, the back office staff usually have to rely on front office computer systems for valuation,' points out Mr Ross. It is therefore important to ensure that the input to the valuation model is not provided by the trader. While a collusive fraud may still be hard to detect, controls involving a range of different functions in the trading, settlement and reporting process at least reduces the opportunities for trading positions to be hidden. 'You can't stop somebody doing an unauthorised trade,' admits Mr Ross. 'But you can make sure it can be closed out the following day.'</p>

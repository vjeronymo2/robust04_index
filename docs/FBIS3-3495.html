Mayor Hong Yongshi said in his recent government report that  Xiamen is to create an investment environment in line with  international practice.    Most of some 1,000 joint ventures in operation are located  on  Xiamen Island proper, which covers 131 sq km.    Hong said that last year the city delegated the power of  approving the setting up of overseas-funded firms to lower  departments while concentrating on the building of  infrastructure.    That year Xiamen approved 655 foreign-funded projects,  absorbing one billion U.S. dollars of foreign capital.    The city also allows greater freedom in the entrance to and  departure from the zone of personnel, cargo and capital.    Domestic and overseas firms have already entered the Xiangyu  Free Trade Zone, and Xiamen is determined to introduce more  overseas financial institutions.    Encouragement is given to investment in industry, the  service  sector and infrastructure projects, according to the mayor.</p>

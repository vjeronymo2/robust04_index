			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Precious metals It is not surprising that platinum led precious metals down this week. Worries over the Japanese economy, which accounts for just over half of world platinum uptake, coincided with General Motors' confirmation that further car plant closures were likely. With catalytic converters now de rigueur, any further fall in car output will dent platinum demand. For gold the picture is more technical. Speculators fretting that gold had failed to break the chart level of Dollars 360 an ounce were made more nervous by the platinum fall and some selling by US mutual funds and Australian gold producers. With the gold price now back near the year's lows in dollar terms - and at new lows for the year in other currencies - attention switches to the longer term. Bulls argue that Russian gold sales will continue to fall because mined output is falling and reserves were raided heavily in 1990 and 1991. Low US interest rates have tempted a few investors in, and the instability in Bosnia may also offer support. But with inflation low, there is little long-term reason for gold to resume an investment role. As a pure commodity, supply is more than adequate to meet anticipated industrial and jewellery demand. Then again, as a commodity, gold ought to have a floor just above the marginal cost of production - around Dollars 300 an ounce. Central banks are a wild card. If others follow Belgium and liquidate holdings, further price falls are possible. Even the threat that they will do so is enough to depress sentiment.</p>

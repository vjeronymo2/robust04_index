			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / DTI urged to delay British Gas split THE GAS Consumers Council has asked the government to delay decisions on the future of British Gas until an inquiry has examined the impact on consumers of proposals to break up the company and possibly abolish its monopoly. Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council, yesterday said the proposed inquiry should focus on whether the abolition of British Gas' monopoly of supply to small-scale, mostly residential customers, would result in a 'measureable benefit to the majority'. He added that if the inquiry also said there would be no substantial price rise for a minority of low-income customers and no threat to supplies, then 'the monopoly should be abolished without delay'. In a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry the council said it could not support many of the recent recommendations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for introducing greater competition into the gas market. The council was particularly concerned that the MMC wanted the cost of breaking up British Gas to be paid for by consumers. Mr Cooper also criticised the recommendation that British Gas' monopoly threshold should fall from 2,500 therms a year to 1,500 therms in 1997. Below the threshold British Gas is the monopoly supplier. The change would benefit only 400,000 households, he said.</p>

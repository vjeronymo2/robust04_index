			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / VSEL VSEL is being investigated for possible under-reporting of profits since privatisation in 1986, the National Audit Office report reveals. Under the privatisation agreement, if VSEL made pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 90m in the six years after it was sold it would have to pay half the extra to British Shipbuilders up to a limit of Pounds 40m. After extraordinary items VSEL made Pounds 35.8m over the period, said the NAO. But it said a review by British Shipbuilders accountants' 'raises a possibility that VSEL may be required to pay further consideration to British Shipbuilders'.</p>

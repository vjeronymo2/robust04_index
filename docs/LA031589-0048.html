			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30 KILLED, 100 HURT AS BEIRUT FIGHTING ESCALATES  </P> <P> At least 30 people were killed and about 100 wounded in Beirut on Tuesday, the  worst day for civilian casualties in several years in Lebanon's civil war.  </P> <P> Artillery shells exploded in the streets, maiming children on the way to  school.  </P> <P> Airplanes flew to Cyprus to avoid shelling at the Beirut airport, which was  then closed. Ships put to sea in an effort to escape the artillery pounding.  </P> <P> Gen. Michel Aoun, premier and commander of the Christian army, accused Syrian  army forces of initiating the fighting, the culmination of a week of escalating  clashes.  </P> <P> Aoun said the Syrians fired into both Christian East Beirut and Muslim West  Beirut, triggering a daylong exchange of artillery between Christian and Druze  militias in the hills southwest of the city.  </P> <P> Aoun said his army will try to force the Syrian troops to withdraw from  Lebanon.  </P> <P> "Lebanon cannot possibly stay under the mercy of the Syrian cannon," he told  reporters at the presidential palace in suburban Baabda, in Christian territory  five miles northeast of Beirut.  </P> <P> Aoun called on the Muslims of West Beirut to rise up against the Syrians as  Palestinians have risen up against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip.  </P> <P> He said he also asked the Arab League, which has been trying to mediate the  crisis, to "intervene at once to ensure the withdrawal of the Syrian occupation  army." The Syrians, brought in to put an end to the civil war, have been in  Lebanon since 1976.  </P> <P> Aoun's accusations were dismissed in Damascus as false. The official daily  newspaper Al Baath said the charges were aimed at "devastating Syria's  constructive role in Lebanon."  </P> <P> The shelling Tuesday morning caught Beirut civilians out in the streets at the  height of the rush hour. Screaming mothers ran through streets to rescue  children from schools in areas hit by shelling or from buses stranded in the  open. Shopkeepers banged down their shutters as radio stations urged people to  stay indoors and seek cover from the shelling. Banks also closed their doors.  </P> <P> The shelling on both sides of the line seemed to be indiscriminate, according  to reports reaching here, hitting near restaurants, bakeries, hospitals and  U.N. buildings.  </P> <P> Lebanon's latest crisis began last September when the Lebanese Parliament  failed to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel. Gemayel then appointed  Aoun as premier. The incumbent premier, Salim Hoss, a Muslim backed by Syria,  refused to step aside, leaving the country with two competing governments and  no president.  </P> <P> The latest round of fighting began about a week ago when Aoun decided to close  down small ports that have been used by Christian and Muslim forces to bring in  arms and duty-free goods.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN'S FAILURE TO APPEAR FOR SENTENCING IN SEX CASE ANGERS JUDGE  </P> <P> Dale Normand, the man accused of sexual misconduct by two teen-age girls,  raised a judge's ire Wednesday when he failed to show up for sentencing.  </P> <P> Robert Grimes, Normand's attorney, argued that, since his client pleaded no  contest to only one misdemeanor count of having unlawful sex with a minor, he  was not required to be present for sentencing.  </P> <P> "I did not anticipate I would be sentencing in absentia. I do not intend to do  so," said Superior Court Judge Andrew G. Wagner, who appeared irritated by  Normand's absence.  </P> <P> Wagner then issued a bench warrant for Normand, 37, but ordered it held when he  rescheduled sentencing for Tuesday. The judge also revoked Normand's $50,000  bail.  </P> <P> Normand's absence also angered Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain, who complained  that "it appears that Mr. Normand is playing games again." McClain reminded the  judge that the charges against Normand were originally filed as felonies, until  both sides plea-bargained to a single misdemeanor count.  </P> <P> Grimes argued that the law did not require Normand to appear for sentencing if  he were convicted on a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> "He's playing games. When he wants to show up, he shows up. When he doesn't  want to show up, he doesn't," McClain said after the hearing. "He wants to go  back and tell people that he is in control and doesn't have to come to court if  he doesn't want to. He's wrong. The court has ultimate control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrest Warrant Issued  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was learned Wednesday that Ohio officials have issued an arrest  warrant for Normand, a Canadian. Earlier this year, officials from the Ohio  Department of Commerce said that Normand was under investigation for selling  unregulated and unlicensed securities in Ohio. Normand is charged with bilking  10 investors of at least $300,000 there.  </P> <P> San Diego vice officers began investigating Normand in April, 1988, when they  received complaints from parents and young women. Police investigators were  told that Normand was recruiting young women to appear in a movie that he was  supposedly producing. In an interview last year, Normand said the movie was  going to be "a cross between a James Bond thriller and Raiders of the Lost  Ark."  </P> <P> However, in August, 1988, an 18-year-old San Carlos woman charged that Normand  lied about the movie. The woman obtained a restraining order against Normand,  and in court documents alleged that "he used lies and deception to have sex  with me." However, no charges were brought against him in that case.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, criminal charges were brought against Normand by a Michigan  teen-ager who was 17 when Normand invited her to San Diego to appear in a  movie. She told authorities that Normand also promised her modeling jobs. The  young woman eventually moved in with Normand and had sex with him on numerous  occasions.  </P> <P> The charge of unlawful sex with a minor was brought against Normand because the  Michigan teen-ager was a minor at the time, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rhetorical Question'  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Judge Wagner asked "a rhetorical question" about the plea bargain  worked out between prosecutors and Normand's attorney. "Am I not legally  permitted to reject the plea bargain and make it a felony if I choose?" asked  Wagner.  </P> <P> Prosecutor McClain agreed with Wagner, but Grimes said that, if Wagner rejected  the plea bargain, Normand would have to withdraw his plea to the misdemeanor  count.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Wagner displayed a stack of papers he received from the  Michigan woman and her father. Wagner informed both sides that he "read all of  them," but did not say whether he will be influenced by them in sentencing  Normand.  </P></p>

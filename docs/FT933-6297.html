			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Von Roll sees bigger deficit VON ROLL, the troubled Swiss steel and engineering group, reports a further 17 per cent slide in sales in the first half to SFr948m (Dollars 640.5m), blaming the European steel crisis and the slump in the Swiss building industry, writes Ian Rodger from Zurich. The group, which had earlier forecast that its loss would narrow this year, said it now expected an even larger loss than last year's SFr55m.</p>

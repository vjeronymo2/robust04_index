			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> FLOOR CLOTHS: WALKING ON ART  </P> <P> ROSEMARY COTNOIR throws her best art pieces on the floor for people to walk on.  A talented maker of decorative floor cloths, she has mastered the art of  transforming heavy raw cotton duck into paintings for the floor.  </P> <P> Most of her themes borrow from Russian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Abyssinian  usages of ornamentation, but some cloths possess a touch of whimsy -- one, for  instance, is painted to resemble a set of 3-D shelves holding a nautilus shell.  </P> <P> In the late 1700s, the New England settlers produced a similar type of floor  covering, but Cotnoir has an advantage: the availability of modern materials to  make her floor cloths far more durable. With her designs, she first applies  four coats of wall primer to the front and two coats to the back. ("People are  surprised that my cloths are heavy, and that they don't buckle," she says.)  Next, she cuts corners, folds under the edges and glues them in place, before  sanding the front surface and covering it with white oil-based paint. Then the  artist takes over. Working from a thumbnail sketch, Cotnoir applies her color  design with acrylic paints, and when these are dry, she covers the cloth with  five to six coats of polyurethane on the front and two coats on the back. The  entire process takes about four days, and she prices her pieces, generally 3x5  feet, between $400 and $600.  </P> <P> Cotnoir is not stingy with her secrets: "Don't use polyurethane out of the  can," she warns. "Dilute it -- one part paint thinner, three parts  polyurethane, and stir it well to mix it."  </P> <P>  Studio Cotnoir, by appointment only, (714) 631-8370.  </P> <P> LORETTA PARAGUASSU  </P></p>

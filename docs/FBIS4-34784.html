			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Triunfo Elizalde] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the National Human Rights Committee  (CNDH) circulated a new primer on human rights to increase  Indians' knowledge about their basic rights. This primer, which  is the 17th the CNDH has issued since it was founded, is  directed mainly at the Indians of Los Altos and the Lacandona  Jungle of Chiapas.    In the introduction, the CNDH states that on 28 January  1992,  the DIARIO OFICIAL published the decree by which an initial  paragraph was added to Article No. 4 of the Constitution  "recognizing the Mexican Indian peoples and stating that their  existence signifies the basis for the nation's multicultural  composition."    Further on, the primer emphasizes that according to Article  No. 27 of the Constitution; Article No. 128, Section No. 4, of  the Federal Code of Penal Procedures; Article No. 269, Section  No. 4, and Article No. 296 of the Federal District Code of Penal  Procedures; and Article No. 164 of the Agrarian Law, as well as  the 1989 Agreement No. 169 of the International Labor Office on  Indian and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, Indian  peoples have the following rights, among others:    1. Indian peoples deserve special respect for their rights  and dignity, as well as for their culture and tradition.    2. Indian communities have the right to protect their  languages, cultures, traditions, customs, resources, and  specific forms of social organization, circumstances that permit  them to maintain and strengthen their identity, as long as they  are not incompatible with basic rights as defined by the law or  with internationally recognized human rights.    3. Indian peoples have full fundamental rights, freedoms,  and privileges, which the law grants without any discrimination.    4. Indian communities have the right to the peace that  permits them to safeguard their members' lives.    5. Indian peoples have the right to an economic,  political, and social development that guarantees a decent life.    6. The state must guarantee Indians' effective access to  justice.    7. In federal and local trials involving Indians, their  legal customs and traditions will be taken into consideration  during the proceedings and when a final decision is made.</p>

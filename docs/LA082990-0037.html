			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> BISHOP RIDES A MUSICAL ROLLER COASTER INTO S.D.  </P> <P> When Stephen Bishop performs Saturday night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa, it  will be the expatriate San Diego singer-songwriter's first hometown appearance  in more than six years.  </P> <P> "I don't know why I haven't played here for so long," Bishop said from his home  in Los Angeles, where he has lived since 1969. "Things happen; you get caught  up doing stuff, and I'm pretty set in Los Angeles right now.  </P> <P> "I've only been touring a little bit, here and there, off and on, for the last  few years."  </P> <P> Had Bishop's comeback album, last fall's "Bowling In Paris," been a hit, things  would be different, he said. He'd be touring as extensively as he did in the  late 1970s and early '80s, his commercial heyday.  </P> <P> But the album, his first in nine years, flopped, and Bishop has since left  Atlantic Records. His recording career is currently in limbo.  </P> <P> "The label just didn't have a firm commitment to it (the album)," he said.  "Heavy metal is their forte, and they didn't really know what to do with me.  I'm a pop songwriter, and doing what I do, more and more, has become a  prehistoric thing, with everybody into rap or dance-pop or heavy metal.  </P> <P> "It's a weird time for music right now, but I'm not the type of person with  sour grapes -- and besides, there are too many other things to be involved in."  </P> <P> Indeed. Earlier this year, Bishop was invited by Phil Collins, who had produced  much of "Bowling in Paris," to contribute background vocals to one of the songs  on his latest solo album, "But Seriously."  </P> <P> "I did all the background vocals and double tracks on 'Do You Remember,' and  then when he came into town a few weeks ago, he asked me to sing with him at  the (Inglewood) Forum," Bishop said. "That was fun. He introduced me as 'one of  the best songwriters in America.' "  </P> <P> Bishop also spent a lot of time building a recording studio in his Hollywood  Hills home and went on a two-week tour of Japan.  </P> <P> And he's been writing songs like crazy.  </P> <P> "I do want to make another record, but, more than anything else, I want to keep  on writing," Bishop said. "I just finished writing a song with Pete Rafelson  for Paula Abdul, which we slaved over, and it looks good that Donna Summer  might be doing one of my songs.  </P> <P> "I'm also doing this thing with 'thirtysomething.' They're interested in me  doing some stuff for the show. And I've also got some movies I'm interested in  scoring. A lot of people are looking for songs, and that keeps me busy."  </P> <P> Songwriting is not only what he likes to do best, it is where the money is.  Bishop continues to receive royalty checks for his four self-penned Top 40  hits, 1977's "Save It for a Rainy Day" and "On and On," 1978's "Everybody Needs  Love," and 1983's "It Might Be You" (from the movie, "Tootsie").  </P> <P> He made a lot of money from "Separate Lives," the Oscar-nominated theme from  the 1985 film, "White Nights," that was recorded by Collins and Marilyn Martin.  And he expects to make even more come October, when a live version of the song  appears on Collins' upcoming greatest hits album.  </P> <P> So even though he's still scouting around for a new record deal, Bishop said,  he's not worried.  </P> <P> "I've been through this before," he said. "It's just the way it is; things roll  around and go up and down. It's a big musical roller coaster, and a lot of  people have been on it.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad I'm still in the amusement park."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: The second annual Marlboro Music Military Tour, featuring Poco,  .38 Special, and last year's "talent roundup" winner, Angel Train, touches down  Saturday afternoon at Camp Pendleton's A.C. (Ace) Bowen Rodeo Grounds. The  10-date tour of military bases around the country ends two days later at Pearl  Harbor. The show starts at 4 p.m. and tickets are $5 in advance, $8 the day of  the show. . . .  </P> <P> Two quasi-celebs have been tapped to headline a pair of upcoming benefit  concerts: Juice Newton at Saturday's outdoor fund-raiser for the American  Cancer Society on the Rancho Santa Fe Polo Grounds, and Rita Coolidge at the  third annual "Bring On the Night" benefit for the AIDS Assistance Fund, Sept. 9  at Sea World's City Streets. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Saturday for Boom Crash Opera's Sept. 22 concert  at Rio's in Loma Portal. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: B.B. King, Thursday at Humphrey's on  Shelter Island; America, Thursday at the Bacchanal; the Moody Blues, Friday at  San Diego State University's Open Air Theater; and Ronnie Montrose, Friday at  the Bacchanal.  </P></p>

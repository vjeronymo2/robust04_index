			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colonel Valeriy Kovalev report under "News From the Regions </F> From Our Correspondents" rubric: "`Green Caps' Become  `Self-Financing'"]    [Text] Minsk -- The Belorussian [Belarusian] Border Troops  Main Directorate has summarized its operational results for the  first five months of this year. The Border Troops Main  Directorate informed KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent that during  this period 948 violators had been detained, contraband goods  worth 11.5 million rubles had been detected, the export of over  225 tonnes of nonferrous metals had been prevented, and 276  weapons and 81 kg of drugs had been seized. The border guards  have returned $750,000 to the state treasury. This sum,  converted into Belarusian rubles, equals half of the resources  allocated to the border guard department from the state budget  for the current year. So the republic's "green caps" are  earning their keep.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Consumer protest at world trade plan THREE HUNDRED consumer, citizen and environmental groups from around the world yesterday demanded that Uruguay Round negotiators abandon the idea of creating a Multilateral Trading Organisation with 'massive powers' to override multilateral, regional and national rules. Congress Watch, a national consumer group in Washington, published a statement signed by groups in 70 countries. It said the MTO, proposed as part of the Uruguay Round, would impose policies on weaker countries; damage environmental, safety and consumer interests; and reduce international controls over monopolies. A senior US trade official yesterday said the Bush administration also had 'a number of concerns' about the proposed text creating an MTO. It would only support an MTO if its underlying rules were 'reasonable and fair' and if it did not result 'in a kind of usurpation of functions of sovereign governments'. However, the US is not yet satisfied with the underlying rules on investment, dumping and subsidies. The official suggested that it would be possible to complete the round without an MTO but with a strengthened dispute settlement system. The American delegation in Geneva seems to be struggling with the lame duck status of the Bush administration, although it stresses the continuity of US trade policy. Meanwhile, the US industry groups seeking to reduce tariffs to zero on such products as paper, wood products, and copper are also worried about lack of progress. Their support for a final Gatt package is considered crucial for congressional passage. Intel Corporation has dropped out of the 'Zero Tariff Coalition' to urge a break in the Gatt talks until after President-elect Bill Clinton is inaugurated.</p>

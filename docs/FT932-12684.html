			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Mitsui expands pharmaceutical interests TOYAMA Chemical, a mid-ranking Japanese pharmaceuticals company, and Mitsui Pharmaceuticals yesterday announced they are to merge, expanding the Mitsui group's influence in the Japanese drugs market. The deal involves one Y500 share in the private Mitsui Pharmaceuticals being swapped for 10 Toyama Chemical shares of Y50 par value. The merged company, to be formed on October 1, will be capitalised at Y18bn (Dollars 162.6m). While the new company is supposed to be owned equally by Toyama Chemical and Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, the merger is essentially a takeover by Mitsui group companies. Mitsui Toatsu, a chemicals company with an 80 per cent stake in Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, will have a 23 per cent stake in the new company. The deal shows the influence of keiretsu, or corporate families, in Japan. It was arranged by Sakura Bank, the core institution of the Mitsui group, which had a 4.9 per cent stake in Toyama, a common level of shareholding for a main bank in Japan. Toyama, strong in antibiotics, has struggled in an increasingly competitive Japanese market, and reported a pre-tax loss of Y6.3bn in the year to the end of November 1991, though it made a profit of Y3.6bn last year after a recovery in sales. The Japanese government is gradually lowering drug prices under a national health insurance scheme, putting pressure on the industry to restructure. Meanwhile, the Mitsui group has been attempting to build a pharmaceuticals operation comparable to the large companies run by the Sumitomo and Mitsubishi keiretsu groups. Sales at Mitsui Pharmaceuticals last year were Y20.8bn, less than half those of Toyama Chemical, and well below the Y422bn last year at Mitsui Toatsu, which has a broader based business including industrial chemicals and plastics. Before October 1, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals will issue 3m new shares to facilitate the swap. The two companies have already made their first profit forecast, suggesting sales in the year to end-March 1994 will be Y60.5bn, rising to Y75bn in the following year, while pre-tax profit will rise from Y4.5bn to Y5.5bn over the same period.</p>

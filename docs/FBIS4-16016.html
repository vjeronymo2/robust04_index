			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Federation Vice President </F> Aleksandr Vladimirovich Rutskoy by Enrico Franceschini in  Moscow; date not given: "I Will Bring About Russia's Rebirth"]    [Excerpt] Moscow -- [introductory passage omitted] Former  Russian Federation Vice President] Rutskoy is alive, free, and  determined to achieve power. He is set to challenge Yeltsin,  Zhirinovskiy, and all other candidates in the forthcoming  presidential elections. His slogan is: "Make Russia Great  Again," which is the purported aim of the book he is currently  writing, "The Collapse of a Power." In fact, this was the  starting point of the interview with LA REPUBBLICA and CORRIERE  DELLA SERA: The book will explain, he said, "how we ended up in  this shameful situation, and how Russia's power can be restored."    [Franceschini] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, that "power" began  to  collapse when you were still vice president. Could you do  nothing to prevent the collapse then?    [Rutskoy] Unfortunately not. There was a plan to push me  aside, to discredit me and gradually deprive me of all power.    [Franceschini] But why did you decide to break with Yeltsin  and swim against the tide?    [Rutskoy] Because they wanted a subservient vice president,  one who would have no opinions, make no proposals, not ask the  president any tricky questions, not criticize any of the  do-nothings and irresponsible elements in his team. The first  crack in our relationship appeared over Gaydar's economic  reforms. I was against them. The second crack developed over  my disgreement with the devious way in which it was decided to  found the Commonwealth of Independent States and thus destroy  the Soviet Union. Then came the rest: corruption, bribery at  every level of power, the cynical plundering of natural  resources, begging the West for aid in a most humiliating  fashion, and a subordinate foreign policy, as if Russia were a  doormat for the West to wipe the mud off its shoes.    [Franceschini] Zhirinovskiy also says all those things.    [Rutskoy] True, and I feel close to anyone who loves the  fatherland, who says that Russia deserves to fulfil the role of  a superpower. This country covers one sixth of the planet's  land: Fill it with a mixture of civil war, deprivation,  epidemics, nuclear power stations, and chemical plants, and the  result of all this will inevitably undermine stability in Europe  and Asia. Beggars do not wield a sword but at most a stick.  However, if Russia wields a stick instead of a sword, it will  be crushed. De Gaulle used to say: The sword is the axis of  peace. But when the sword is held by only one country, then the  latter becomes the world's watchdog. That is why at least two  superpowers are needed. As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned,  although our positions may differ in some respects, I believe we  can reach an agreement, as long as it is understood that I  reject radicalism and demagoguery.    [Franceschini] What concerns you most at present?    [Rutskoy] Our nation's debasement. Cynicism, immorality,  lying, theft, have become everyday events. Patriotism, on the  other hand, is considered a form of extremism, akin to fascism  or nazism. I am also alarmed by something else, namely the  resigned attitude of many people. Economic reforms that have  plunged us into poverty, an armed attack on parliament, a  Constitution worthy of a monarch -- what else must the so-called  "democrats" do for people to understand that we can no longer  live like this, that this is the beginning of the end? Where  else do people work without being paid for months on end, where  elso do pensions condemn people to starvation, children have  nothing to eat, mortality outweigh births, and the dead get  buried in plastic bags? In Russia, which was once a great and  powerful nation. I would like to ask the miners, the workers,  the peasants who today voice their protest: Where were you in  September-October 1993? How could you betray those who wanted  to defend you? Can you not see that the person responsible for  all this is your president?    [Franceschini] What did you expect the people to do then?    [Rutskoy] I expected them to suppoprt us. Not by rising up  in arms, but through a civil protest, a general strike.  Unfortunately, nothing of the sort happened. First everyone  was calling for the president's resignation. Then, when Yeltsin  dissolved parliament, they all fell back again on a  hand-to-mouth policy based on compromise. The result: The  executioners and ravagers of the country have been confirmed in  power.    [Franceschini] If you could go back, would you act  differently?    [Rutskoy] May I reverse the question: Would the people  today, knowing how things ended, still support the president?    [Franceschini] You claim that 500 people died at the White  House rather than the 149 mentioned in the official report...    [Rutskoy] The world watched a live TV broadcast of the  massacre, but an attempt is being made to hide the truth.  Everybody is silent, including the new parliament, but that is  only natural. Why say anything when they too are eating out of  the same plate? Only the press raises its voice, but only to  slander those who upheld the Constitution, and it blames us for  everything.    [Franceschini] If you had resigned from your post as vice  president, perhaps today you would be a deputy in the Duma.    [Rutskoy] All I ever got from being vice president were  insults and injuries, but stepping down would have been like  betraying my ideals, as well as all the people who voted for me.  Most of the new deputies elected to the Duma have applied this  theory: Betraying at the right moment means knowing how things  will end. This applies to all parties, including Gaydar's,  Yavlinkiy's, Shakhray's, and Zhirinovskiy's. I would not like  to be in the company of men who are prepared to serve any regime  as long as it feeds them.    [Franceschini] Is there a Rutskoy party?    [Rutskoy] The Free Russia People's Party, whose chairman I  am. We will be holding a congress in May in order to adopt our  new platform, win the next elections, and embark on reforms in  the interest of the people.    [Franceschini] Will you therefore be standing in the  presidential elections in 1996, or perhaps sooner if early  elections are called?    [Rutskoy] Yes, if the party nominates me.    [Franceschini] Boris Yeltsin was one of your political  "mentors," later he became a boss with whom you had some  differences, still later an enemy, and finally the man who gave  the order to shoot. What is your opinion of the president today?    [Rutskoy] I sincerely trusted this man. Unfortunately, I was  much mistaken. I have learned one thing from him: how not to  govern a country.    [Franceschini] Yeltsin now proposes a "social peace"  agreement to all forces in the country...    [Rutskoy] Are there any assurances that the people signing  it  will not then be silenced? Does it make sense to invoke social  peace and at the same time spy on one's opponents, tap their  telephones? If I lean out of the window, I can see someone  watching my home this very minute. All we have to do is go for  a stroll downtown and someone would be on my tail immediately.  I will vote with both hands for social peace, but such an  agreement is not feasible with the present leaders.    [Franceschini] While you were in prison, a new Constitution  was passed. Do you accept its legitimacy?    [Rutskoy] How can you accept a Constitution which was voted  after the shooting on Parliament, and was passed by a only  minority of voters? No, I do not accept it. But I am obliged  to comply with it just like any other law-abiding citizen. This  Constitution has the same value as power founded on bayonets.  Furthermore, even its author (Yeltsin) is probably not happy  with it, since it prevents him from doing everything he wants.    [Franceschini] What dou you think of the fight against crime  and corruption?    [Rutskoy] Have you ever seen a thief punishing theft? Can  someone who is corrupt combat corruption?    [Franceschini] It is feared in the West that if you become  president, nationalism will resurface...    [Rutskoy] Why worry about the West? What Russia thinks is  more important. But you can rest assured. With me as  president, it is the Russian nation, not nationalism, that would  be reborn. I am against the idea that one country should  overpower others to prove its superiority. But I believe Russia  will once again become a great nation. I will fight side by  side with my people to bring about the day when Russia will  again be a superpower.</p>

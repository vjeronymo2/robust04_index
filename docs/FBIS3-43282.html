The two main moderate opposition movements: The Action  Committee for Renewal (CAR) of Yao Agboyibo and the Togolese  Union for Democracy (UTD) of Edem Kodjo and five smaller parties  spelled out their complaints in a joint statement given to AFP.    The seven parties said the government had set the opening of  the election campaign for January 7 inspite of the fact that  "the updating of electoral rolls is not yet complete" and  "distribution of voter cards is nowhere near starting".    The opposition parties said they would "not bow to  unilateral  decisions taken with no consensus" and added that the elections  had to be "free, open, fair and acceptable for everybody".    More than 300 candidates representing 15 parties have  registered in the race for the 81 seats in the national assembly.    Two other opposition parties: The Union for Democracy and  Solidarity (UDS) of Antoine Folly and the Democrats' Party for  Unity (PDU) of Lucien Sanvi de Tove, have already said they will  boycott the poll.    The opposition in exile led by Gilchrist Olympio has also  urged a boycott.    The entire opposition abstained in the August presidential  poll won by President Gnassingbe Eyadema with 96 percent of the  vote.</p>

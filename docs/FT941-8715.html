			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Property: Minnow in a big pond - Vanessa Houlder on the strategy that has made Burford one of the sector's fastest-growing groups The announcement last week of a Pounds 103m acquisition by Burford has catapulted the UK group into the ranks of the country's top 10 companies in the property sector. The deal prompted Kleinwort Benson, merchant bank, to describe Burford as an 'outstanding company. The remarkable aspect of Burford is that the management has proved itself to be expert both in bull and bear markets.' The reason why Burford attracts such praise is a combination of conservative financial management, an ability to extract strong returns from difficult properties and a record of well-timed deals. But, above all, Burford's judgement of the market gyrations in recent years has made it one of the few property companies to survive the recession with its reputation enhanced. Burford demonstrated a flair for timing by selling property totalling Pounds 92m in 1989-91, enabling it to make substantial investments at the bottom of the market. The company turned buyer in 1990-91; since then it has invested Pounds 250m in property. Last week's acquisition of 15 properties from hotel group Ladbroke, financed by a Pounds 100m rights issues, will push up Burford's market capitalisation to about Pounds 350m. Burford likes to project itself as a conservative company with strong financial controls. 'Our gearing (ratio of borrowing to equity) and cash-flow considerations come before anything else,' said Mr Nick Leslau, chief executive. He attributes much of the company's success to the presence of Mr Nigel Wray as executive chairman. Mr Wray, a financier, holds directorships with media group Carlton Communications, Singer &amp; Friedlander, a merchant bank, and was recently appointed chairman of Carlisle, a property services group. He joined Burford in 1988 after his Chartsearch publishing company achieved a reverse takeover of Burford. Mr Leslau argues that his property expertise and Mr Wray's financial skills give Burford an edge over most competitors, which tend to be dominated by a single entrepreneur. The emphasis on tight controls at Burford is reflected in rigorous financial and management accounting, an emphasis on analysing the cash-flow of properties, a strict gearing limit of 100 per cent and a strong focus on government or blue-chip tenants, which account for 77 per cent of cash-flow. Burford also adheres to what it calls the 'Armageddon rule' - ie that if every tenant were to quit at the earliest opportunity the company would still be able to service its interest for another 15 years, assuming no tenant defaults. Burford's ideal portfolio is an equal split between high-quality, institutional-grade property, high-yielding properties let to secure tenants and 'difficult' management-intensive properties that are capable of generating high returns. An example of the latter is Heywood Business park, a warehouse distribution estate near Manchester which Burford bought from Control Securities last Christmas. The estate required an overhaul and a large percentage of its properties were unlet. 'With these sort of deals, it is more like buying a business than a property investment,' said Mr Leslau. 'There is a tremendously exciting upside.' Following the Ladbroke deal, Burford will have a higher weighting than usual  -by its standards - of top-quality property. Institutional-grade property comprises 80 per cent of the Ladbroke portfolio, increasing the percentage of this type of property in Burford's portfolio to 57 per cent. Burford intends to rebalance its portfolio by borrowing against the Ladbroke acquisition. If Burford gears up to 100 per cent it will command Pounds 150m of buying power. It will also raise more cash by selling Pounds 35m-worth of small buildings from a portfolio currently valued at about Pounds 2.5m. Burford believes that it has reached a size where returns do not justify the expenditure of management time on small properties. 'We have outgrown that type of property,' he said. Instead, it will concentrate on buying relatively big properties valued at Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m. Burford believes there is a gap in the market for buyers of this type of property. 'They are too messy for institutions but too big for the vast majority of property companies,' he said. As well as concentrating on larger properties, Burford also intends to switch the focus of its portfolio. Over the past year, it has been buying institutional-type property in the belief that such a move would be the first step towards reaping the benefits of a general upturn in the economy. Increasingly, however, the best returns are likely to come from secondary property, Mr Leslau said. These properties will be the main beneficiaries of rising rents and increasing levels of bank lending, he added. 'Over the next three years, the more secondary property will out-perform dramatically.' Arguably, the sector of the market that will out-perform all others in the upswing of the property cycle is development activity. Burford, however, insists that it will play no part in this. 'We will never speculatively develop,' Mr Leslau said. First, the company lacks the skills necessary for this type of activity; second, the high risks associated with speculative ventures are at odds with Burford's conservative philosophy. 'The psychology of developers and investors are poles apart,' said Mr Leslau. It remains to be seen whether Burford will continue to stand out in an increasingly competitive market. 'The question is whether it can continue to perform from a much larger and at present lowly-geared base, both in terms of gross and net assets,' said Kleinwort Benson. Mr Leslau is confident that Burford will continue to win good deals. His confidence is inspired by the skills of his agent, a good knowledge of potential deals and a concentration on a relatively unfashionable size and type of property. He is cool on the notion that Burford could eventually grow into one of the sector's largest companies. Size is meaningless, he said. What matters is earnings per share. But Mr Leslau insists that Burford's increased size after the Ladbroke deal will not be a hindrance to growth. Burford is still a relative minnow, he said. 'The day we feel that we cannot out-perform, we will sell the company,' he said.</p>

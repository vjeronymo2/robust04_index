			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / People: Bodies politic The ITV companies have chosen Gus Macdonald, managing director of Scottish Television, to be the first chairman of their new Broadcasting Board. The board, which will meet monthly, is designed to ensure that the companies get value for month for the Pounds 500m a year they will be spending on the new centralised ITV network.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  accused the United States today of distorting facts when it  described the country as a "terrorist nation."    On May 9, the U.S. State Department had issued an annual  report on terrorism in which it called the DPRK a "terrorist  nation," according to reports.    The DPRK spokesman said that by accusing his country of  being  a terrorist nation, the United States was hoping to conceal its  own terrorist activities.    He said that the United States is taking advantage of the  terrorist issue and current disagreement over the nuclear issue,  to malign the DPRK.    The spokesman said that his country opposes any terrorist  activity, and does not engage in support to any terrorist  activity.    He demanded that the United States improve its own behavior  and try to get rid of its own dub-name of "head of terror."</p>

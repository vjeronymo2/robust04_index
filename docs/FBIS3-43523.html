			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 8 Jan (AFP) -- The two main Togolese  opposition parties, Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy  [UTD] and Yao Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR],  today called on the government to "reconsider extending the  postponement" of the legislative elections in view of the recent  violence which, according to official tallies, has claimed 58  lives in Lome.    On 6 January, the government announced a two-week  postponement of the elections because of the "delay in making  certain material arrangements, especially the preparation and  distribution of individual voter's cards." The elections are  now scheduled to take place on 6 and 20 February.    "The new dates must be revised because there have been  several days of blockage," Mr. Kodjo told AFP, adding that "any  further action will depend on how the government resolves the  current security problem which may create obstacles in the  pre-electoral period."    Meanwhile, "the CAR has taken note of the government's  decision to postpone the election by 15 days to allow better  preparations for the legislative elections," but it "deplores  the fact that the delay is taking effect at a time when all  sectors of the country are paralized." Answering questions by  AFP, Mr. Agboyibor said that "the bodies set up to organize the  elections cannot profitably use the new delay."    The radical opposition has already reiterated its decision  to  boycott the legislative elections despite the postponement.  Leopold Gnininvi of the Group of Pan-African Social Democrats,  a three-party coalition, and Antoine Folly of the Union for  Democracy and Solidarity believe that "the postponement  announced does in no way improve the situation: It neither  restores the rule of law nor creates conditions for equitable  elections."</p>

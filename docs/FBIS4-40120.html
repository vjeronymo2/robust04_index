			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Savchenko: "I Will Sing Someone Else's Song"] </F>   [Text] And so it is done. On 3 June the Crimean Government  finally put its ministers in key posts--the Ministries of  Administration of State Enterprises, Agriculture and Food, and  Economics and Finance. For these positions the Supreme Council  approved the previously acting ministers Anatoliy Franchuk,  Serhiy Nikolskyy, Andrey Chernyavskyy, and Lyudmila Zaytseva.    This was preceded by long discussions on the draft law "On  Making Changes and Additions to the Law of the Republic of  Crimea and On the System of Central Organs of State Power of the  Republic of Crimea." The work, which was essentially to have  been completed in the commissions, spilled over into the plenary  part of the session. With incredible stubbornness the deputies  defended one or another ministry or state committee, wanting to  expand the government at their own discretion, no matter what.  Many of the deputies were concerned most of all by the fact  that the government could turn into a closed type of society  since the number of ministries and state committees would be  limited.    Ultimately the document prepared by the Standing Commission  of the Supreme Council on State Construction, Legislation,  Legality, and Law and Order was adopted with corrections and  additions.    We turn the floor over to the deputies:    V. Brodin: I voted for the law on making changes and  additions to the law on the system of central organs of state  power. We must make it possible for the government to function.  And the fact that the document was not properly prepared is not  its fault. The deputies should have been given both the  structure and the personnel composition of the ministries and  committees beforehand. In 14 days we will return to the  document on the structure of the government.    L. Grach:There is a situation in which a polarization  process, which will not submit to any kind of normal analysis,  takes place in the parliament's work. Those who shouted the  loudest and defended the Constitution were zealously flouting it  today. Naturally, I voted against it. The entire national  economy of the Crimea was signed away. This means that in three  or four months we will have a lamentable condition in the  Republic, and in this case responsibility for the state of  affairs will be born by the parliament, which made it possible  to flout the Constitution.    These are two mutually exclusive opinions we heard during  the  recess after the voting. And when the session continued it  turned out that certain deputies still did not understand the  entire essence of the document for which they had voted. This  is what happens when there is confusion and haste. One must  assume that in two weeks, although this is an extremely short  amount of time, the session will again return to the question of  the government, but this time with carefully prepared documents.    This meeting of the session revealed another extremely  serious and unfavorable aspect: There is no mutual understanding  between the legislative and executive powers. In order to push  the government to adopt the decision, President Yu. Meshkov  spoke repeatedly at the meeting. "A failure to solve the  problem of the government will place the economy of the Crimea  in an even more difficult position which could be characterized  as catastrophic. And instead of accepting the government in the  form in which it is functioning and can function and endlessly  improving on the law on the government, you are putting us back  where we started. Be consistent. If you are responsible to the  voters, you should follow their orders." These words from the  president convinced a large number of deputies and they  supported him.    The time itself requires rapid, resolute measures. The more  so since for several months nobody has actually been doing  anything about the economy and economic activity in the  Republic. The new Crimean Government, which undertook to  correct the reforms, must see the deputies as allies who will  evaluate it for its actual activity. The deputies, who have met  the government halfway, must be consistent in their subsequent  decisions as well.</p>

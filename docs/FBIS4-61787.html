			<p>BFN     [Text] The timetable for the withdrawal of the Russian  Army, which Russia submitted as a supplement to the  Latvian-Russian treaty signed on 30 April, does not include many  Russian military facilities and Army units stationed in Latvia.  According to information at the disposal of Ilgonis Upmalis,  head of the Latvian bureau for monitoring the withdrawal of the  Russian Army, 191 Russian Army units are stationed in Latvia at  247 military facilities. The timetable submitted by Russia  includes 155 military units and formations, as well as command  structures.    Mr. Upmalis today explained that the formations of military  facilities mentioned in the timetable and list submitted might  include many separate military facilities. However, in this  case it is impossible to define precisely the number of  facilities and Army units included in the formations. According  to Upmalis, it is planned during this week to assess the  timetable submitted by Russia and to make a list of Army units  which have not been included in the timetable. Then it is  planned to submit the list to the command of the Northwestern  Group of Russian Forces and the Latvian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.</p>

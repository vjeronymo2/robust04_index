			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSICIANS WHO CARE PERFORM FOR GOOD CAUSES  </P> <P> Looking to its roots in the '60s protest movement, rock 'n' roll is again  becoming socially conscious, and more and more big names are getting involved.  Live-Aid, USA for Africa, Jackson Browne's recent benefit tour for the Christic  Institute, and Tom Petty's current tour with members of Greenpeace are just a  few examples.  </P> <P> According to Patricia Grimes, it's time lesser-known artists also get involved  as well. Grimes, 34, is the founder and co-coordinator of Musicians Who Care,  an all-volunteer organization with a goal of "bridging together music and  social services."  </P> <P> The 2-year-old group, based in Encinitas, is trying to get San Diego musicians  to care, both about themselves and about others.  </P> <P> To achieve the former, there are concerts showcasing local original-music bands  in area nightclubs, a bimonthly newsletter to publicize these bands' latest  deeds and accomplishments, a referral service to help them get gigs and a  lecture series to help them gain a better understanding of the inner workings  of the music business.  </P> <P> And to achieve the latter, there are benefit concerts and fund-raisers for the  homeless, the handicapped, local and national crisis-intervention hot lines and  various human-rights and environmental groups, like Amnesty International and  Clean Ocean.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is providing San Diego musicians with a multifaceted support  network to make sure they do get the recognition they deserve -- not only by  helping them, but by encouraging them to help themselves and become more active  in their own community," Grimes said.  </P> <P> At the same time, she added, "we're funneling some of this community activism  we're building among local musicians -- this sense of caring we're instilling  in them -- outside the San Diego music scene by supporting and raising money  for charities, social-service agencies and environmental groups.  </P> <P> "If you're not in a good place in your own life, you're not in a position to  help anyone else," she said. "You've got your own problems to overcome, and  without question, San Diego musicians have plenty of problems: not enough work,  low pay, not enough exposure.  </P> <P> "But once you start caring about yourself and find that by working together  many of these problems can be overcome, you tend to start caring about others  and their problems as well."  </P> <P> The dual focus of Musicians Who Care -- working to improve the lot of San Diego  musicians while simultaneously working to better the world around them -- is  reflected in the background of its founder.  </P> <P> Grimes, a native of Atlanta, spent the first half of her 34 years "immersed in  music," she said. "My mom said that when I was born, I came out dancing. I took  piano lessons, studied ballet and played flute and twirled the baton in my high  school marching band. I even had my own rock band, playing school dances and  parties."  </P> <P> By the time she graduated from high school, however, Grimes had been  brainwashed into believing "that music wasn't a very respectable career for a  young Southern lady," she said. So in 1974, she moved to Los Angeles and, after  earning a degree in community clinical psychology from Long Beach State  University, soon found work as director of a social-services agency in nearby  Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> For the next decade, Grimes continued to work in the field of social services,  winning national plaudits for the suicide-prevention hot line she manned for a  short time on Long Beach radio station KNAC-FM.  </P> <P> "I went to the top of my field, going on national speaking tours, lecturing at  UCLA, getting tons of publicity and making tons of money, and yet I wasn't  happy," Grimes recalled. "My first love was still music, and I desperately  wanted to find a way to somehow combine the two -- get back into music without  giving up my social work."  </P> <P> Grimes eventually found the way in 1987 when she moved south to San Diego and,  by chance, fell into a lengthy discussion with the manager of a local rock band  about the lack of cohesiveness on the San Diego music scene.  </P> <P> "We ended up concluding that something needed to be done," Grimes said, "and  after getting down all the logistics, we came up with this idea of forming some  sort of organization that would enable me to get back into music while keeping  me involved with social services; an organization of local musicians interested  not only in helping themselves, but in helping others.  </P> <P> "And that's exactly what Musicians Who Care has become, particularly since  (expatriate L.A. musician) Steve Saint signed on as co-coordinator a year ago  and brought with him years of experience and know-how, both as a musician and  as a social activist/environmentalist."  </P> <P> Grimes, who is manager of the La Paloma Theater in Encinitas, said there are  about 35 members in the organization.  </P> <P> "They were super when they helped us," said Frances Poe of the San Diego  Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "They organized a concert at UCSD in May. Our  main objective was educational, to try to get across the point that mental  illness is a curable illness, and we not only raised a couple of hundred  dollars, but we really raised the consciousness of everyone who attended."  </P> <P> The organization has also been involved with the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., the  Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless and Greenpeace.  </P> <P> In August, on a yet-to-be-determined date, the La Paloma Theater will host a  benefit concert for Clean Ocean. "We had a literature table at the Encinitas  Flower Festival this past spring," Grimes said, "and across the way from us  were the Clean Ocean people. One of our members is a surfer, so he went over  and started talking to them, and that's how we made the connection." Sharing  the bill will be three or four local rock bands.  </P> <P> Those appearances fulfill another goal for the membership organization:  providing notoriety for local bands.  </P> <P> "There's a great deal of talent down here that's not being recognized because,  for one thing, people have the idea that you have to run up to Los Angeles to  be discovered," said Grimes, who is focusing her energy on the organization and  is not currently in a band.  </P> <P> "We lose a lot of good musicians because of this perception, and it's  unfortunate, because what generally happens is that they run up to L.A., they  don't make it, and they end up working at some place like Burger King."  </P> <P> To strengthen the local scene, the organization is currently sponsoring an  ongoing "Industry Insider" lecture series. Last Monday evening, nearly 30 local  musicians, songwriters, managers and assorted hangers-on gathered on the patio  of the D.G. Wills Bookstore in La Jolla to hear promoter Bill Silva give a  two-hour rundown on the San Diego concert business.  </P> <P> Silva's talk, in which he touched upon such points as how acts are chosen, how  local upstarts can get a crack at opening shows for national headliners, and  what it takes to pull in a good crowd, was followed by another hour of  networking. Business cards were exchanged, lunch appointments were set,  contacts were made.  </P> <P> On Aug. 21, the third "Industry Insider" lecture will take place at a  yet-to-be-determined location. The speaker will be Lisa Fancher, founder and  president of independent punk-rock record label Frontier Records. She'll be  collecting demonstration tapes from local would-be's and discussing "what you  should and shouldn't do when you're trying to get signed," Grimes said.  </P> <P> Sometime in September, Musicians Who Care will release "The Care," a  compilation album featuring songs by 10 San Diego original-music bands. The LP  will be sent to college radio stations throughout the country, Grimes said,  "and with a little luck, there'll be enough momentum for at least one of these  songs to get on commercial radio and maybe even become a national hit."  </P> <P> And sometime in October, Musicians Who Care will produce "San Diego Music Expo  '89." The date and location have not yet been set, but the all-day event will  consist of various seminars and panel discussions, performances by local bands,  a rock 'n' roll fashion show, and exhibition booths leased by record companies,  radio stations and music stores.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that Musicians Who Care will be around forever, long after Steve  and I are gone," Grimes said. "Ideally, it will be a self-perpetuating thing.  And with enough musicians expending enough time and energy to fuel it, I'm  convinced it will be."  </P></p>

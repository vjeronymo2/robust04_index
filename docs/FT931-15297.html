			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Court challenge over SIB scheme INVESTORS BEGAN a High Court challenge yesterday to the investors compensation scheme, run by the Securities and Investments Board, over the method of assessing how much should be paid to victims of home income plans whose brokers or advisers become insolvent. In four test cases, solicitors Barnett Sampson, acting for about 450 people, said the ICS failed to comply with the relevant rules or acted unreasonably, making its decisions on payouts invalid. Home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as a means of releasing cash from the value of their properties.</p>

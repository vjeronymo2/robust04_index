			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, president of the  Colorado Party, last delivered an aggressive address during a  ceremony commemorating his party's victory in the 9 May 1993  elections. He warned that the "Colorado Party will do anything  necessary, during any emergency in which we are called, to  defend the legitimate right of the Colorado Party to govern."    The ceremony was held at the Colorado Party headquarters  with  the participation of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, ministers,  and the party's top leadership. Sanabria Cantero said that the  country is advancing "against what is written and proclaimed  through incomplete information."    He again warned those who speculate "that disorder, chaos,  and a public lack of tranquility are instruments of  destabilization, that they will never make the government slip  nor will they confuse the republican masses who remain firm, as  is their tradition, in the defense of order and lawfulness no  matter what they are called to defend."

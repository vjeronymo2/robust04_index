			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Despatches: Battle to save the condor - Bogota THE MIGHTY Andean condor has inspired songs, stories and even worship for more than 2,000 years. Swooping, gliding and soaring over high plains and craggy peaks, it is a symbol of power that adorns national coats of arms. But the condor is an endangered species, fast disappearing from the northern Andes. None has been seen in Venezuela for several years, there are only 40 in Colombia and fewer than 100 in Ecuador. Now, the world's biggest flighted bird is getting help from an unexpected source: the Bogota and Quito city water companies. Anxious to preserve what remains of the vegetation on Andean watersheds, they are teaming up with environmental organisations to protect the condor's haunts. 'There is a strong local commitment from the private and the public sectors to save one of the most important areas for bio-diversity in the world,' says Gregory Miller, of the Nature Conservancy. This US-based organisation has declared a 1.6m-acre 'Condor bio-reserve' on the eastern Andes of Ecuador, and also supports Colombia's Chingaza Natural Park where nine condors raised in the San Diego zoo in the US have been released. When the first five - all male  - were taken to Chingaza, they could barely fly. Gradually, they increased their range to 50 kilometres or more, always returning to a feeding platform high above a water reservoir where dead animals are left for them. Four females were released a few months ago, and now all nine - still with the immature brown plumage which will eventually give way to black and white feathers - can be seen circling over the platform when hungry. Immensely curious, condors often fly too close to humans for their own safety. At Chingaza, human contact is strictly forbidden, but transmitters fixed to the birds' huge wings allow biologists to keep track of them. The males fly together in a group but the females range off in different directions - mating begins only when the birds are about six years old. As the condors fly further afield over populated areas, they could be heading into danger. Many peasants believe the birds are all too ready to swoop down on a chicken or calf and carry it off. But their strength lies in their beaks (for tearing at carrion) rather than their claws. Unfortunately, their 10ft wingspan makes an easy target. Friedemann Koster, a zoologist living on the outskirts of Quito, is looking after two young condors in his back garden. One was shot down and both had been badly treated in captivity before they were brought to him. 'People are the threat for these birds,' he says. Andean condors have retreated to the heights, apparently to escape hunters. But the decimation of wild animals on the high plains has left them with little food. Experts agree that the giant vulture might now be driven to eating placenta and newborn calves, and that this has turned farmers against them. In 1990, seven condors were found dead on Mount Antisana, east of Quito in the bio-reserve. 'One of the condors was sent to a laboratory for analysis and they found it had been poisoned - a dead bullock had been put out with rat poison in it. There was another similar case when five condors died,' says Mauricio Guerrero, of the Ecuadorean Ornithological Corporation. 'We began a campaign to save the condor, and the president declared it a national symbol.' Condor folklore is not as strong in the northern Andes as it is in Peru and Bolivia, where the bird is more common: one Peruvian ritual involves a fight between a condor (symbolising the Indian) and a bull (representing the Spaniard). The legend of the young shepherdess carried off by a condor to its clifftop nest is common all through the Andes. In some versions, the girl turns into a condor; in others, she gives birth to a strange creature and returns home, shamed. In one of the villages on the lower slopes of Antisana, there is now an ecological group called Friends of the Condor. Members have been helping with studies on the birds and they may in future work as guides for people visiting the bio-reserve. The Antisana Foundation is preparing a management plan for the watershed there, with the support of the Nature Conservancy. 'It includes the protection of natural areas, eco-tourism, community education, sustainable harvest activities - fisheries, wildlife and agro-forestry - and research,' Miller explains. The water companies are also keen to find ways to combine conservation with other benefits; tourism is one, environmental education another. Buses full of students and schoolchildren visit Chingaza each week, and it is one of the few Colombian natural parks that generates income. But some economic activities, such as sheep and cattle grazing, will have to be curtailed. The Bogota water company employees spend weeks each summer putting out fires started by farmers who want to extend the pasture available for their animals. 'The condor is catching on as a symbol,' said one blackened firefighter at Chingaza. 'Maybe it will help people realise where their water comes from.'</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / People: CEGB sparks de Sausmarez' investment career The Central Electricity Generating Board would not seem to be the best starting block for a career in fund management. But it doesn't seem to have hampered the rapid rise of James de Sausmarez who has just got the job of running Henderson Administration's retail division. De Sausmarez, 35, joined the Touche Remnant investment trust group from the CEGB as company secretary in 1986 and was not appointed a manager in the investment trust department until April 1990. Following Henderson's acquisition of TR in December 1992, de Sausmarez was put in charge of the combined Henderson Touche Remnant Investment Trust operation and has been responsible for the rapid growth of one of the more successful parts of Henderson's Pounds 13.7bn fund management business. In some respects de Sausmarez is following in the footsteps of Paul Manduca, 42, the former head of Touche Remnant who was made managing director of Henderson's retail business following the takeover just under two years ago. Six months ago Manduca quit to head Threadneedle Asset Management. De Sausmarez will have the same title as Manduca but he has not been given a seat on the board and will not be in charge of Henderson's private client operations. He will remain in charge of Henderson's Pounds 3.7bn investment trust business and is adding overall responsibility for the Pounds 1.4bn unit trust operation headed by Richard Eats. Despite de Sausmarez's rapid rise, it is understood that he is unlikely to follow in Manduca's footsteps as the heir apparent to Jeremy Edwards, 57, Henderson's managing director who is expected to retire within the next two years. Henderson is understood to be looking outside for Edwards' replacement. David Watson, 35, formerly director, finance, at NatWest Securities, has been appointed to the same job at the M &amp; G Group. It is not a board appointment but Watson will be the group's senior financial officer. Caroline Baker, 40, head of personnel at Towers Perrin, Tillinghast, has been appointed head of personnel at M &amp; G.</p>

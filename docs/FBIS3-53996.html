To the righteous soul will be said: O thou soul, in complete  rest and satisfaction! Come back thou to Thy Lord, well-pleased  thyself, and well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou, then, among my  devotees! Yea, enter thou my heaven! [Koranic verses]    With resignation to God's will, and with immense sorrow and  sadness, President Hafiz al-Asad announces to the people the  death of his lost one, which is a loss to the dear homeland,  Staff Major and Engineer Paratrooper Basil al-Asad, who passed  away on the morning of Friday, 10 Sha'ban 1414 Hegira,  corresponding to 21 January 1994, as a result of a tragic  accident. His pure body will be laid to rest in al-Qardahah  after the noon prayers on Saturday 11 Sha'ban 1414 Hegira,  corresponding to 22 January 1994.    From God we come and to Him we return.</p>

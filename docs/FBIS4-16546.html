			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 17 (TASS) -- "Partnership with the  North Atlantic Alliance was our choice from the very outset",  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told reporters after  returning from a 24-hour trip to Belgrade.    "Two years ago, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a  letter  to NATO, offering partnership and close cooperation, and at  present we are seeking for the best ways of promoting these  ties", he said commenting on Russia's approach towards NATO's  partnership for peace programme.    We are ready to discuss whether a framework agreement should  be signed first, which is to be followed by a broader one, or  whether we should conclude a broader partnership pact, without  signing a preliminary agreement, Kozyrev noted.    "What is clear is that we want a more serious and  substantive  agreement adequate to relations that should exist between NATO  and the superpower of Russia...especially an agreement which  will exclude unilateral actions, particulary military ones, in  areas where we have to closely cooperate", he said.    The Russian Government has agreed in principle to join the  NATO plan, which offers East European and former Soviet states  cooperation but stops short of letting them join the alliance.    Kozyrev has postponed his visit to Brussels on April 21 to  sign the Partnership for Peace deal, apparantly angered by  NATO's air strikes on Serb forces in Bosnia.</p>

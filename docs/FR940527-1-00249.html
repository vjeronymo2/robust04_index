			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Medicare's contributions to the Academic Health Center Account would be less than the IME payments made under the current formula, with estimated budget savings of $17.8 billion over five years (1996 to 2000). This proposed reduction in Medicare payments reflects the Administration's estimate of the amount by which current IME payments exceed the additional patient care costs attributable to teaching activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Set at $2.1 billion in fiscal year 1996 and $2.0 billion in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, Medicare's contributions thereafter would rise at the same rate as the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers. The total size of the Academic Health Center Account, including contributions from the regional and corporate alliances as well as Medicare, would be $3.1 billion in fiscal year 1996, increasing to $3.2 billion, $3.2 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.8 billion in the succeeding years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many private payers now pay higher rates to teaching hospitals for patient care services. However, in an environment of heightened price competition, teaching hospitals may not be able to obtain payments that reflect their higher patient care costs. Thus, they will likely be unable to fund these with revenue from patient care services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission supports the explicit recognition by all payers of the higher costs of treating patients in teaching institutions and the separation of payments for these costs from the basic price of care. However, ProPAC has three concerns about the Academic Health Center Account proposal in the Health Security Act. First, the amount to be distributed through the account should adequately reflect the additional costs teaching institutions face. Relatively little is known about the overall costs associated with the activities that the Academic Health Center Account is intended to support. Both ProPAC and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have analyzed the relationship between the intensity of hospital-based teaching activities and the cost of treating Medicare inpatients. However, the relationship between teaching intensity and the cost of treating other types of patients_that is, Medicare outpatients and non-Medicare inpatients and outpatients_in hospitals and non-hospital settings is not known. Moreover, existing information may not be applicable in the environment of tight general funding constraints under health care reform. More analysis is needed to ensure that the account has sufficient funds to accomplish its purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the distribution of monies from the Academic Health Center Account should be equitable and encourage the efficient operation of teaching institutions. The proposed application of the Medicare IME adjustment to total patient care revenue may not be the most appropriate way to accomplish this objective. To allow for the proper distribution of available funds, further analysis should focus on what factors determine differences across institutions in terms of the costs these funds are intended to defray. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission is concerned about how the funding of the academic health center mechanism might affect access to services these facilities provide for Medicare beneficiaries and others. The funds available through the Academic Health Center Account must adequately reflect the additional costs of the services they are intended to support. Substantial reductions in the level of Medicare IME payments should not be made until other components of health reform are fully implemented. (See Recommendation 19). The impact of any changes in the level or distribution of payments among hospitals should be monitored carefully. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, distributing Medicare IME payments through the academic health center mechanism rather than as an adjustment to the Medicare payment rate would mean that the payment received for each Medicare patient would be reduced relative to its current level (which includes the 7.7 percent IME payment adjustment). Medicare payments are a smaller proportion of costs than private payer payments. Although ProPAC's preliminary analysis indicates that the current gap between Medicare and non-Medicare payments relative to costs would narrow rather than widen under the proposed approach, this issue should be examined closely as health care reform is implemented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 4: Graduate Medical Education Funding and Payment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC supports efforts to establish a funding mechanism for graduate medical education training programs that encompasses all payers, including Medicare. The Commission believes this mechanism should be separate from the payment received for patient care services. The level of funding and the distribution of payments should be determined according to the following principles: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Funding for graduate medical education should be consistent with national work force goals, with respect to both the number of residents trained and their specialty distribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Funding should support training for physicians and certain non-physician medical personnel who contribute to attaining these goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment should be made to the training program, whether it is based in a hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or other ambulatory setting. The optimal method for allocating and distributing such payments needs to be determined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Payment for graduate medical education should be based on a national per resident amount, adjusted to recognize regional differences in residents' salaries and other factors that, upon further study, are found to be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, funds should be available to recognize the additional personnel costs of hospitals that operate programs that lose specialty training positions as a result of the process described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Medicare program historically has paid hospitals for the costs associated with operating a residency training program. Costs for residents' salaries, faculty supervision, classroom space, program administration, and other related overhead were, until recently, recognized as a separate expense of which Medicare paid its share. Medicare is essentially the only payer that explicitly recognizes these expenses. Private insurers pay for these costs implicitly through the higher payments they make to teaching hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 changed Medicare's payment for these expenses to a hospital-specific per resident amount. This amount is equal to the hospital's audited per resident costs for the cost reporting period beginning during fiscal year 1984, updated annually by the increase in the CPI for all urban consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Health Security Act, there would be a fundamental change in financing for graduate medical education (GME). Both Medicare and the health care alliances (the entities responsible for coordinating the purchase of health insurance for the non-Medicare population) would contribute directly to a Health Professions Workforce Account. Initial funding for this account would be set at $3.2 billion in fiscal year 1996, rising to $5.8 billion in 1999 and 2000 and increasing at the same rate as the gross domestic product thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act would establish, within the Department of Health and Human Services, a new National Council on Graduate Medical Education. This council would determine the number and specialty distribution of residency positions to be funded. At least 55 percent of individuals completing eligible programs nationwide would be required to be in primary care, beginning with the class entering training in the 1998&hyph;1999 academic year. The primary care specialties to which the act refers are family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds would be distributed to the individual residency programs, rather than to the hospital. Each program would receive a per resident payment amount based on the national average per resident cost in the 1992&hyph;1993 academic year, trended forward by the CPI and adjusted to reflect regional differences in residents' wages and wage-related costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act would also establish a program with respect to graduate nurse training that parallels the one for physician training, with funding set at $200 million annually. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would be further required to establish or expand programs to train physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and other health professionals to improve the efficiency and availability of health care across geographic locations and settings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

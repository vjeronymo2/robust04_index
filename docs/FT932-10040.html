			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / French PM acts to curb deficit: Balladur moves to revive economy and bail out social security system MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, announced wide-ranging measures yesterday to rein in France's growing budget and social security deficits as well as giving its stalled economy a selective boost. Acting after only five weeks in office, Mr Balladur said: 'It is no longer possible to wait any more' before moving to reduce the deficits that would otherwise rise to more than FFr400bn (Pounds 48bn) this year  - 5.8 per cent of national output. With a FFr7.7bn increase in alcohol and petrol taxes and a FFr21.5bn reduction in current spending programmes, he said he hoped to restrain the budget deficit to FFr331bn this year, or 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product. At the same time, he is giving a FFr12.9bn boost to housing, public works and job-creating measures this year. The broadest increase will be in the contribution sociale generalisee (CSG), which taxes earned and unearned income. It is to rise from 1.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent, with much of its proceeds to be devoted to bailing out the social security system. Mr Balladur acknowledged the dilemma of increasing taxes during a recession, which the government estimates will reduce national output by 0.1 per cent this year. The prime minister was speaking after a cabinet meeting at which the government also approved the draft statute to give the Bank of France autonomy in monetary policy. At the cabinet meeting, President Francois Mitterrand questioned whether the constitution would allow the government to surrender control over monetary policy before the Maastricht treaty on European unity, which in the long term obliges it to give up that control, comes into effect. Mr Balladur conceded that it was 'a legally delicate matter', which would require careful consultation over the precise timing of independence for the French central bank. Mr Balladur warned: 'The exponential growth of the deficit and the debt risks deprive France of all margin of manoeuvre, in particular to pursue the lowering of interest rates on which we have embarked.' The new French conservative government inherited a budget that assumed 2.6 per cent growth this year. As a result, it overestimated revenue by about 10 per cent, or FFr124bn, and underestimated spending by some FFr44bn, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget minister, said. On the tax side, the government is counting on the increased CSG to bring in an extra FFr25bn this year, as well as FFr7.7bn from alcohol and petrol taxes.

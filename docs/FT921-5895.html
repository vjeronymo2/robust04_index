			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / India is dealt a make-or-break budget: But it is uncertain if the programme can be carried through AS OPPOSITION in India continues to grow against IMF-style policies, it seems increasingly uncertain whether the Congress party government of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao will have the stomach to carry through the programme on which it embarked last year - to open up the economy and strengthen market mechanisms. But the budget presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, along with the letters to the World Bank he was forced to disclose to parliament last week, make clear that India remains on track to implement the most radical changes in economic policy since it became independent in 1949. The measures announced in the budget went wider and deeper than most people had expected. Their boldness will also provide a boost to Dr Singh, who last week emerged battered from the drubbing he received in parliament. He was on his feet in parliament on Saturday wittily chiding opponents who hoped to force his resignation. He told them he had proposed tax concessions for the self-employed, because if the Opposition had their way, he would soon find himself in that category. Notwithstanding this bravado, he has by no means repulsed all attacks from inside the Congress Party and from the left and Hindu militant BJP party outside. The budget shows that, in its tactical handling of structural reform, the government has chosen to move at different speeds on different fronts. It surprised even the banking community by opting for a partial floating of the rupee, a move popular in India as partly dismantling much disliked foreign exchange controls, and well received abroad. The government is cautious about reducing India's customs tariffs (among the highest protective tariffs in the world) because it is worried by the loss of budget revenue and faces strong opposition from industry. The budget was most hesitant about tackling problems of overmanning in the public sector, of allowing private companies to retrench their labour forces or close, and of privatisation. It is here that the government fears the biggest backlash could occur from the left and the unions. Over the handling of macroeconomic policy, it is clear that the government has taken a risk. Dr Singh hopes to bring down inflation from its current 12 per cent to 6 per cent by the end of 1992-93. But he also hopes to lift industrial growth out of recession to achieve a 5 per cent rise in output next year. The danger is that higher growth could splutter out in worsening inflation and balance of payments difficulties. In opening up the economy both domestically and to foreign competition, the budget makes several strides. The main step is the announcement of partial convertibility, which will link the value of the rupee to a market rate. Under the system to come into force this week, foreign currency holders will be able to change 40 per cent of their foreign exchange at the official rate and 60 per cent at an open market rate. The government expects the market rate will carry a premium of about 15 per cent. Banks will in practice cash travellers' cheques or remittances at a weighted rate reflecting this ratio. The system will give Indians and foreigners greater freedom in handling their foreign exchange business in India. Indians will be allowed for the first time to keep 15 per cent of dollar earnings in dollar accounts. Apart from a restricted list of imports, including consumer goods and alcohol, they will be free to import what they want at market prices. Only oil, petroleum products and life-saving drugs can be purchased at the official rate. The effect of the partial floating will be to encourage exports through a 9 per cent depreciation, while acting as a deterrent to imports. The partially floating rate will replace the eximscrip, an instrument introduced last year to limit the volume of imports to the availability of foreign exchange. Officials said yesterday that freedom of capital movement, which would allow Indians to purchase fixed assets abroad, was 'not even on the horizon'. Two other areas opened up to foreigners are direct portfolio investment into India and foreign investment in the production, refining and marketing of oil and natural gas. On the first, the finance minister was more cautious, saying reputable pension funds would be allowed, provided there was no threat of them getting management control. On the second, foreign investment is being sought in an area of production and refining where expenditures are heavy and India lacks the funds. In line with the emphasis on opening up and encouraging market forces, Dr Singh announced several moves to strengthen the capital markets. Indian companies will no longer have to seek government permission to float an equity issue on the domestic markets or to get government approval for its pricing. The office of controller of capital issues has been abolished so that companies can determine when and at what price they approach the market. In a separate boost to the market, Dr Singh said that financial assets would be exempt from wealth tax, a move designed to shift savings from houses and jewellery to the corporate sector. Indian companies will also be formally allowed to float issues abroad, have more freedom to invest abroad, and to enter into ties with foreign groups. On the reduction of tariff duties, Dr Singh excused his caution by his difficulties in offsetting lost customs duties through other taxation and by the risks of a depressed world industry dumping in the Indian market. He lowered the maximum tariff rate from 150 to 110 per cent. He also reduced tariff duties on capital goods imports from 80 to 60 per cent with sharper cuts for electronics, oil and coal mining. But the tariff cuts are partly offset by the protective effect of the depreciation of the currency. The net effect of the cuts was to reduce revenue from customs by Rs20bn (or about 10 per cent of the level of last year). But he reaffirmed his pledge that duties would come down to internationally comparable levels in three to four years. He made the same promise to the IMF. In term's of India's own Byzantine tax structure, Dr Singh made a start at simplification. He announced a three-band structure with rates fixed at 20, 30 and 40 per cent. He accompanied this simplification by abolishing several exemptions. All these structural changes helped mask the weakness of the budget: that it combines probably irreconcilable goals of bringing down inflation while accelerating economic growth. Dr Singh embarked on his budget exercise with an economy growing more slowly than he had anticipated last July and with inflation stubbornly higher. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the financial year ending is likely to be about 2 per cent and inflation nearly 12 per cent. The response of the budget to this situation has been to provide a stimulus to the economy while seeking to curb inflation. The stimulus to the economy will come from a 1 per cent cut in interest rates announced yesterday by the minister and from tax cuts. Against this, the deflationary pressure from the budget will come from the continuing fall in the fiscal deficit. The deficit is scheduled to fall from 8.4 per cent of GDP in 1990-91 to 6.5 per cent in the past financial year and 5 per cent in the coming financial year. Most of the reduction in the deficit will come from cuts in spending, particularly capital spending and subsidies. If the government is able to achieve its goals of higher growth and lower inflation, it will have turned around the economy with minimal pain. But if inflation continues to remain high, the government is in trouble.</p>

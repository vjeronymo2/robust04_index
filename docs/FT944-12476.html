			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Merrill opens in Jakarta Merrill Lynch has set up a joint venture with Indonesia's PT Persada Kian Pasti Lestari, making it the first US-based securities firm to open an office in Jakarta. 'We have clearly identified Indonesia as probably one of the best opportunities in the world, if not the best opportunity, for our industry,' said Mr David Komansky, executive vice-president of Merrill Lynch. The office will deal with corporate finance, trading, underwriting, asset management and research and will be headed by Mr Mitchell Shivers, who is moving from Merrill Lynch's New York office. Merrill Lynch will own 80 per cent of PT Merrill Lynch Indonesia while the Indonesian company will own the remaining 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (7): Conquering the world - Frequent Flyer Programmes PASSENGERS like them. Airlines do not, but embrace them anyway. Frequent Flyer Programmes (FFPs) have spread from their humble beginnings in the US to conquer the world, despite the misgivings of industry executives who thought that giving away seats might be bad for business. Invented more than a decade ago in the US, they were designed to to create and maintain customer loyalty. The idea was for regular passengers to accumulate points which could eventually be exchanged for free flights. The cost of an FFP to the airlines, that of filling seats that would otherwise be empty, was marginal. Their success was staggering: American Airlines, which started its scheme in 1981, now has about 20m members. In recent months, some of the last pockets of resistance to this marketing tidal wave have surrendered. The likes of Air France and Lot Polish Airlines have joined in, Japan Air Lines has extended its FFP to Europeans, and British Airways this month opens its scheme to residents of Australasia, the Americas and South Africa. FFPs are now the airline industry's most tried and tested marketing tool. US members of FFPs have already earned more than 600bn miles' worth of free travel, according to one industry estimate, enough to fill more than 500,000 transatlantic Boeing 747 flights. Yet this very success brings problems. US airline executives acknowledge that accounting standards bodies are asking whether the financial liability tied up in seats owed should be included in company accounts. 'One of the big concerns is this contingent liability,' concedes Mr Richard Mound, head of relationship marketing at British Airways. Tax authorities, too, are looking at the value of the giveaways for both the airlines and their customers. The power of FFPs to attract members would be hit if passengers were taxed on the value of private flights they earned through company travel. Perhaps worst of all for the airlines is the clear risk that they will be forced to turn away fare-paying passengers to meet their obligations to travellers redeeming frequent flyer points. Airline executives are reluctant to concede publicly this danger to their revenues. However, some have already blamed low yields - low turnover per seat - on FFP members exercising their rights to free seats. Their concerns can be inferred from the structure of recently-launched FFPs. Lufthansa, the German carrier, is typical in stipulating a two-year time limit to control the flow of free seats. Passengers are also being dissuaded by a variety of means from cashing in their points for free flights. 'It would be highly desirable from our perspective if customers used their points to buy upgrades rather than free tickets,' says Mr Chris Gilbert, UK sales manager of American Airlines. The strategy seems to be working, according to Mr David Perkins, managing director of Carlson Marketing which operates several FFPs for airline customers. 'Almost half air miles points are now being used for upgrades,' he says. Some airlines offer rewards completely unrelated to air travel. KLM, the Dutch carrier, for example, offers two-day music master classes in Vienna and cordon bleu cookery classes. The search is also on to extract more value from the huge amount of information available from FFP databases. While airline tickets are anonymous, FFP databases allow airlines to find out who their passengers are and what are their patterns of travel. They can then use direct mail to send sales and marketing information to particular groups of customers. Airlines can also identify their best customers and tailor services to them. Many of British Airways' top 1,000 customers, who are estimated to spend on average Pounds 50,000 a year on air travel, now hold a BA Premier Card. This unpublicised card earmarks a group that BA consults directly about the services it offers. Smaller airlines can in principle make equally good use of such information but suffer from having a much smaller database to play with. Cross-airline allegiances are one solution: Virgin and British Midland share an FFP in the UK, while Singapore Air Lines, Swissair and Delta of the US have linked their FFPs across their respective continents. Cross-company links are being used by airlines big and small to extend the scope of their FFPs and with it their attractiveness to passengers. Car rental companies and hotel chains are among those to share FFPs and award schemes with airlines. Avis, for example, has agreements with 11 airlines ranging from Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, to Manx Airlines, a small UK regional carrier. Even Asia may eventually succumb. After years of decrying the idea, Cathay and Singapore are opening up their FFPs for Asian residents on intra-Asia flights for the first time. Airline executives are reluctant conquerors of the world with their double-edged marketing sword. Many hope that when all airlines have FFPs, their usefulness to distinguish one airline from another will diminish. They may have the help of the tax authorities, if the frequent flyer benefits become taxable. And companies, too, may press for better deals on fares and forego their frequent flyer points. But until then, the continuing advance of the frequent flyer programme seems inevitable.</p>

In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that it was unable to render a determination on the threshold issue of whether the withheld documents constituted ``agency records'' for purposes of the FOIA. Accordingly, the DOE remanded the matter to the Richland Operations Office with instructions to investigate and review the matter further and to consider several relevant inquiries raised by Cowles on Appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Requests for Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Marbob Energy Corporation, 3/28/94, LEE&hyph;0066  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Marbob Energy Corporation (Marbob) filed an Application for Exception from the requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;23, the ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves.'' Marbob claimed that it lacked the necessary technical personnel to provide the information requested in Form EIA&hyph;23. In considering the request, the DOE found that there were no technical personnel required to complete the form other than those already employed by Marbob. The DOE also concluded that the firm was not suffering a serious hardship and was not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different from the burden borne by similar reporting firms. Therefore, the DOE denied Marbob's Application for Exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Ward Oil Co., 3/29/94, LEE&hyph;0088  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ward Oil Co. (Ward) filed an Application for Exception from the provisions of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting requirements which the firm sought relief from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B, entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the request, the DOE found that the firm was suffering a gross inequity due to the long illness and death of the firm's office manager. Accordingly, the DOE determined that the exception request be granted in part and that Ward should be removed from the survey from March 1994 through December 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

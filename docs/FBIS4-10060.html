			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 6 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- According to  local media sources, Revolutionary Party Deputy Obdulio  Chinchilla was wounded today when unidentified persons shot him  as he was leaving a hotel in the capital. This is the second  attack against Chinchilla in less than a year.    The legislator, finance committee chairman, and chairman of  the commission studying reforms to the electoral and political  parties laws, was shot several times, but there is still no  information on the seriousness of his injuries, Radio Sonora  reported.    The motives of Chinchilla's attackers are still unknown.  Chinchilla was the target of another attack months ago which  caused him to lose one eye. This attack has occurred five days  after Constitutionality Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez was  assassinated in front of his house. No one has claimed  responsibility for that attack.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2342 GMT transmits a report which  states that "Chinchilla was transferred in critical condition to  a private hospital." The report adds that "one suspect has  apparently been arrested."]</p>

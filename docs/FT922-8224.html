			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Diploma holds steady at Pounds 6.2m despite sales fall DIPLOMA, the electronics, building components and special steels group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits marginally lower at Pounds 6.2m, despite a drop from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 61.9m in turnover. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that although it had 'been a long, hard recession exacerbated by many false dawns', he believed that conditions in the period under review were 'worse and more difficult to manage' than in the corresponding six months. On the building components side, IG Lintels achieved a 'marginal improvement' and Mr Thomas said that IG had increased its market share from 25 to 35 per cent in the past 2 1/2 years. Profits at Robert Lee, the distributor of plumbing fittings and 'as near to the high street as we get', were down by one third in the 'worst conditions in 20 years'. Witham's, in the steels division, was 'substantially down' though still in the black. It was hit by recession in France, where it has 25 per cent of its turnover, and by low spending in the oil sector. Mr Thomas said that in electronics 30 per cent of orders were now 'design won'. Macro had a good first half with sales up 10 per cent and a 25 per cent increase to the bottom line. Because of Diploma's good cash flow, Mr Thomas said he wanted to re-balance the interim and final dividends: so the interim is lifted to 2.75p (2.25p), payable from earnings of 7.3p (7.5p) per share. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.7m. Of this, Pounds 1.1m related to the loss on the disposal of the ECS stake and an equivalent amount is debited from shareholders' funds. The remaining Pounds 2.6m - goodwill which was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition  - is now written back.</p>

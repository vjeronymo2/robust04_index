			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / IRA puts pressure on London with ceasefire plan The Provisional IRA last night announced an unconditional, 72-hour ceasefire, starting at midnight next Tuesday, in an effort to force clarification of the Downing Street peace declaration. The move - announced as Mr John Major, the prime minister, flew to Northern Ireland for a short visit - is being seen as an attempt to expose any differences in strategy between the British and Irish governments. It is also intended to renew pressure on them to open a fresh dialogue with the republican movement. A statement issued last night in Dublin said that the IRA hoped the ceasefire would be accepted 'in the spirit in which it is offered' and called on the British government to take advantage of the new development. But Mr Major dismissed as 'cynical' the decision to call a ceasefire, describing it as a 'public relations gesture'. In a speech in Belfast, he told the IRA that they were mistaken if they thought the move would alter the situation. 'Temporary ceasefires are welcome for the peace of mind they bring for a period,' he said. 'But unless they become permanent and irrevocable, they will not end the conflict.' But Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, appeared more conciliatory. He described the IRA move as 'a very small step in the right direction. I am encouraged on the one hand but disappointed on the other, because while it is a small step it is only for a short period. 'What everybody wants to see are clear signs and signals that we are on the road to developing a permanent peace process.' Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said the ceasefire represented an important initiative and a chance to break the stalemate. He urged Mr Major to take the opportunity to open immediate, direct talks with Sinn Fein. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, declined to say whether he thought the British government should now hold talks with Sinn Fein but said 'no stone should be left unturned' in seeking an end to violence. He said that, if the IRA leadership were bluffing, they would 'be isolated in a way they've never been isolated before'. The ceasefire comes a few days after London and Dublin moved quickly to close an apparent split in attitudes over the likely response to a temporary ceasefire. Comments by Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, had suggested that Dublin might look more positively than London on a short-term halt to violence. Ulster Unionists were quick to condemn the IRA announcement. Mr Ken Maginnis, their security spokesman, said he believed the ceasefire was intended to portray Mr Major as 'intransigent and responsible for a carefully pre-planned return to violence'.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISCOVERERS OF AIDS VIRUS HONORED FOR WORK  </P> <P> The discoverers of the AIDS virus, Dr. Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer  Institute and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, were in Los  Angeles Thursday to receive an award at the annual meeting of the American  Assn. of Blood Banks.  </P> <P> Gallo said he was "optimistic" that improvement therapies against the AIDS  virus will be developed within the next five years, but added that he "will  never predict one way or the other when we will have a vaccine."  </P> <P> Montagnier elaborated on his controversial theory that a small microbe known as  a mycoplasma has a role along with the AIDS virus in causing the deadly  disease.  </P> <P> Gallo declined to comment on an ongoing National Institutes of Health probe of  possible scientific misconduct in some of the AIDS research in his laboratory  in the mid-1980s. "Wait a few months and I will have a lot to comment on and a  lot of things to release," he said.  </P></p>

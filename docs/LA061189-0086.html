			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COOPER NEEDS INFLUENCE WITH NBA AND SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> On Feb. 8, 1984, the Portland Trail Blazers beat the San Diego Clippers,  114-105, before a tiny crowd of 4,268 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> The loss dropped the hapless Clippers to 16-33. And when a fan saw Donald  Sterling, the team's owner, heading for the exit, he bellowed at him.  </P> <P> "Hey, Sterling!" the fan yelled. "You're a bozo!"  </P> <P> According to one newspaper account, Sterling "seemed momentarily wounded."  </P> <P> But, the report said, Sterling recovered in time to say, "I think he meant it  affectionately."  </P> <P> Three and a half months later, Sterling moved the Clippers to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Millionaire With a Mission  </P> <P> It has been more than five years since the National Basketball Assn. left San  Diego. And it may be five years or more before it returns, if ever. But if  Harry Cooper -- a La Jolla multimillionaire with a mission -- has anything to  say about it, the NBA will be back by 1992 to play in a 22,900-seat  multipurpose entertainment palace he plans to build with the help of private  financing.  </P> <P> Cooper's biggest problem is that he doesn't have much in the way of influence  with either the NBA or the city of San Diego. He's trying to change that.  </P> <P> But the city has been mostly indifferent to Cooper's building plans. And the  NBA will have expanded from 23 to 27 teams in two years with the addition of  Minnesota and Orlando next fall.  </P> <P> At its Board of Governors meeting April 25, the NBA's owners voted not to  consider any more growth. "Our league has absolutely no plans whatsoever for  expansion," said Brian McIntyre, an NBA spokesman.  </P> <P> That leaves Cooper the option of convincing an existing team to move to San  Diego, where the NBA has tried and failed twice.  </P> <P> All it takes is a simple majority of the league's 27 owners to approve a move.  But the league is enjoying unprecedented attendance success. And few teams  would even think about moving, much less to San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Rubber Stamp'  </P> <P> "We would have to review plans to relocate very seriously," McIntyre said.  "You're not dealing with just a team or a franchise. You're looking at a  community. It's not just a rubber stamp."  </P> <P> Many people inside the NBA say the league's commissioner, David Stern, is much  more interested in placing a team in Orange County because of its ideal  demographics. Anaheim recently offered Orange County $8 million for the land to  build an $85-million sports arena in that city, on a site previously proposed  for a jail.  </P> <P> Cooper and his partner, Richard Esquinas, insist that San Diego's potential as  an NBA market has changed dramatically in the five years since Sterling moved  the Clippers.  </P> <P> "I think the NBA realizes there was poor ownership here before, and that  dictated the flow of fan support, business support and community support,"  Esquinas said. "The citizens of San Diego don't want to be held liable for  their (Sterling's) errors."  </P> <P> Pleaded Cooper: "Don't hold us responsible for the mistakes they made."  </P> <P> Yet Cooper also says he is a friend of Sterling's. And he says Sterling is the  most likely candidate among NBA franchise owners to either relocate or sell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Place for NBA in San Diego  </P> <P> For his part, Sterling has taken every recent opportunity to emphasize that he  is not moving or selling the Clippers. But he does think there's a place for  the NBA in San Diego.  </P> <P> "There's no stigma on San Diego in the eyes of the rest of the league," he  said. "This is a business. What happened five or 10 years ago doesn't matter. A  lot of people have bad feelings about San Diego. They don't understand what  happened."  </P> <P> Bob Whitsitt, president of the Seattle Supersonics, agrees. "The knee-jerk  reaction is to say there is a stigma in San Diego. I don't think so. The NBA is  different than it was five years ago."  </P> <P> (The Supersonics are having trouble negotiating a new lease in Seattle, and the  team's owners looked briefly into acquiring the Sports Arena lease before it  was purchased by Cooper.)  </P> <P> It was 18 years ago that the Rockets left San Diego for Houston. The  now-defunct American Basketball Assn.'s Conquistadores (later renamed the  Sails) folded with a 3-8 record early in the 1975-76 season, their third year.  </P> <P> The Clippers arrived in 1978 and actually won four more games than they lost  that season. But they did not make the playoffs, and they failed to finish any  higher than fifth in their division in their five remaining seasons here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battle With Arena  </P> <P> Part of the problem with the Clippers and their community image was an ongoing  battle between the team and Peter Graham, the man who ran the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Among other things, the Clippers complained that Coach Jim Lynam couldn't be  heard by his players at halftime because of toilets being flushed upstairs.  </P> <P> Responded Sports Arena official Larry Patton: "Looking at the attendance  figures, there weren't enough people at Clipper games to make that much noise  flushing the toilets."  </P> <P> The Clippers also complained about a leaky roof, an inadequate locker room, a  faulty basketball floor, a poor sound system and lousy maintenance.  </P> <P> Cooper and Esquinas figure they will get a National Hockey League franchise in  San Diego before they get an NBA team. Their hope is to show the NBA the  success of hockey and the community enthusiasm for their proposed arena once it  gets built.  </P> <P> "The NBA wants to see a unified front in San Diego," Esquinas said. "More or  less, they are still waiting to see it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mystery Bankroller  </P> <P> Cooper has enlisted the aid of San Diego's own Bill Walton, the former UCLA  All-American and All-NBA center for the Portland Trail Blazers. Walton now  lives in Hillcrest.  </P> <P> And, Cooper said, "we've got a person who wants to bring a team here. He wants  to be an owner, and his bankers have assured us he's got the money."  </P> <P> Like the prospective NHL owner Cooper says he has waiting in the wings, he  chooses not to provide a name.  </P> <P> But it's clear that Cooper and Esquinas aren't convinced that Sterling wouldn't  sell the Clippers for the right price.  </P> <P> Said Esquinas: "I think there's some sentiment in the league that they kind of  messed up by letting Don get away with that. And I think (bringing the team  back to San Diego) would be kind of a way of patching it up."  </P></p>

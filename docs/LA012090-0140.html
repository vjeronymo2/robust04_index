			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY APPROVES FIRST ART UNDER '86 LAW  </P> <P> City officials this week approved the first project to meet the 1986 Art in  Public Places requirement.  </P> <P> The project, a tile composition by artist Marlo Bartels for the wall facing  Laguna Canyon Road at the corner of the Sawdust Festival grounds, was proposed  by the Sawdust Festival Board to satisfy requirements for the recent festival  remodeling.  </P> <P> The arts ordinance gives those who remodel or build commercial buildings and  multiunit residential projects the option of acquiring and installing artwork  or paying an art-in-lieu fee totaling 1% of the cost of construction, which is  to be used to place art in other public places.  </P> <P> Projects valued at less than $250,000 are exempt from the ordinance.  </P> <P> Should a developer choose to install art, the ordinance states that a building  permit will not be issued until the City Council approves the art.

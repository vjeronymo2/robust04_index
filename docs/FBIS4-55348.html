			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 12 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat Premier  Jadranko Prlic said on Thursday that neighbouring Croatia's new  currency, the kuna, would be used also in the Bosnian Croat  state of Herzeg-Bosna, Mostar-based Herzeg-Bosna Radio said.  Croatia will officially circulate the new currency on  Independence Day, May 30.    The currency has the same name -- the kuna -- as that used  in  the Nazi-puppet Independent State of Croatia during World War  Two.    Immediately after Croatia's secession from the former  Yugoslav Federation nearly three years ago, Bosnian Croats  embraced the breakaway state's then currency -- the Croatian  dinar -- thus making clear to one and all their ultimate  objective -- secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina and union with  Croatia. The Croatian news agency HINA has quoted Prlic as  admitting that there are forces in Herzeg-Bosna which oppose the  implementation of the Washington agreement on a Croat-Moslem  federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina. There are political forces  among the Croats which oppose the agreement, and there are also  those who have lost members of immediate family in the fighting  against the Moslems and do not want a union, Prlic explained.    Five-day U.S.-sponsored Croatian-Moslem talks at the U.S.  embassy in Vienna ended on Wednesday in an agreement on a  cantonal division of the future federation and the appointment  of the two nations' officials to top state positions by rote.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Royalties from licensing boost National Semi NATIONAL Semiconductor, the US chipmaker, reported its strongest quarterly earnings in seven years, boosted by gains from patent licensing royalties. But its operating performance failed to live up to Wall Street expectations, prompting a sharp decline in the share price. National was down Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 at midday yesterday. Net earnings for the second quarter, ended November 29, were Dollars 35.3m, or 27 cents a share, against Dollars 5.9m, or 3 cents, a year ago. Results included a net gain of around 15 cents per share from exceptional items. The company recorded a pre-tax gain of Dollars 18.1m, including a Dollars 31.7m from patent licensing fees, charges of Dollars 4.5m for legal expenses, and Dollars 9.1m for the costs of consolidating sales and logistics facilities for international operations. Analysts had expected net earnings of about 20 cents per share and were disappointed by after-tax earnings from normal operations of approximately 16 cents per share. Gross margins were also slightly lower than expected. The company attributed this trend to strong sales of its lower margin products. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 491.9m, up from Dollars 413.2m last time. The results represent National's fifth consecutive profitable quarter, said Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive. 'We are continuing to consolidate manufacturing facilities,' Mr Amelio added. 'We have agreed in principle with Defense Systems and Software of New Jersey, to form a joint venture to operate our facility in Migdal Haemek, Israel, as an independent operation. National will own less than 20 per cent of the joint venture. In the first half, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 57.2m, or 44 cents, on sales of Dollars 964.3m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 162.1m, or Dollars 1.61, after restructuring charges of Dollars 149.3m, on sales of Dollars 824.2m.</p>

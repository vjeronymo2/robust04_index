Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service will be the lead agency and is responsible for the preparation of the environmental impact statement.

Changes in the LRMP could be required if the transmission line is authorized across the Jefferson National Forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total length of the electric transmission line proposed by the Appalachian Power Company is approximately 115 miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original notice indicated that the dates, times, and locations for public meetings would be made known to the public through the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

Portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River (at Bluestone Lake), and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land (at Guyandotte River) would also be crossed by the proposed transmission line. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Studies conducted by the Appalachian Power Company and submitted to the Virginia State Corporation Commission, as part of its application and approval process, indicate a need to reinforce its extra high voltage transmission system by the mid-to-late 1990s in order to maintain a reliable power supply for projected demands within its service territory in central and western Virginia and southern West Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A study to evaluate potential route locations of the proposed transmission line has been prepared for Appalachian Power Company through a contract with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) and West Virginia University (WVU). The information gathered by VPI and WVU, along with other information collected during the analysis process, will be utilized in the preparation of the environmental impact statement. General information about the transmission line route proposal is available from the Jefferson National Forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decisions to be made following the environmental analysis are whether the Forest Service, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will authorize Appalachian Power Company to cross the Jefferson National Forest, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and the New River and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land, respectively, with the proposed 765,000-volt transmission line and, if so, under what conditions a crossing would be authorized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the environmental impact statement a range of routing alternatives will be considered to meet the purpose and need for the proposed action. A no action alternative will also be analyzed. Under the no action alternative APCO would not be authorized to cross the Jefferson National Forest, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River or R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land. The alternatives developed by VPI and WVU will also be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The federal analysis will include an analysis of the effects of the proposed transmission line along the entire proposed route as well as all alternative routes which are considered in detail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The significant issues identified for the federal analysis are listed below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

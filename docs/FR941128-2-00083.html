Within twelve (12) months after the date this Order becomes final, Respondent shall: (1) Grant a non-exclusive license, in perpetuity, and in good faith, of any technical information and patent rights included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraphs A &amp; C of Confidential Appendix A); and (2) provide samples for research, adequate to satisfy the needs of the Rotavirus Licensee, of any physical assets included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraph B of Confidential Appendix A) that are owned by AHP;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That such license shall be limited: (i) To use solely in developing, producing and selling a vaccine to protect humans against rotavirus disease; and (ii) to preclude its use to develop a vector for a vaccine intended to protect against a disease other than rotavirus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Respondent shall license Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research only to a Rotavirus Licensee that receives the prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose of the licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research is to ensure the continuation of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research as an ongoing research project for a rotavirus vaccine to be approved by the FDA for sale in the United States and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Upon reasonable notice and request from the Rotavirus Licensee, Respondent shall provide reasonable assistance to the Rotavirus Licensee regarding the Cyanamid Rotavirus Vaccine Research. Such assistance shall include reasonable consultation with knowledgeable employees of AHP and training at the Rotavirus Licensee's facilities or at such other place as is mutually satisfactory to Respondent and the Rotavirus Licensee for a period of time sufficient to satisfy the Rotavirus Licensee's management that its personnel are appropriately trained to proceed with the Cyanamid Rotavirus Vaccine Research. However, AHP shall not be required to continue providing such assistance for more than six (6) months from the date the licensing is finally approved by the Commission. AHP may require reimbursement from the Rotavirus Licensee for all its direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the assistance to the Rotavirus Licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Pending licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary to maintain the viability and marketability of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research and to prevent the destruction, removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research except for ordinary wear and tear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rotavirus Vaccine Research Trustee Exclusive Licensing Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is further ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. If AHP has not, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, complied with the requirements of Paragraph V of this Order, the Commission may appoint a trustee to (1) grant an exclusive license, in perpetuity, and in good faith, of any technical information and patent rights included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraphs A &amp; C of Confidential Appendix A); and (2) provide samples for research, adequate to satisfy the needs of the Rotavirus Licensee, of any physical assets included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraph B of Confidential Appendix A) that are owned by AHP;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That: (i) Such exclusive license shall be limited to use solely in developing, producing and selling a vaccine to protect humans against rotavirus disease; (ii) such license shall be limited to preclude its use to develop a vector for a vaccine intended to protect against a disease other than rotavirus; and (iii) AHP shall have the right to retain and use all of the Cyanamid Rotavirus Vaccine Research assets, including samples of the assets in Paragraph B of Confidential Appendix A, for the purpose of using them to develop a vector for a vaccine intended to protect against a disease other than rotavirus and for any other purpose other than developing and producing a vaccine to protect humans against rotavirus disease. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action against Respondent pursuant to section 5(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(1), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, AHP shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it, including a court appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5(1) of the FTC Act, or any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent to comply with this order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Rosyth fears loss of Trident repair contract THE MANAGEMENT of Scotland's Rosyth naval dockyard said yesterday it believed the Ministry of Defence favoured awarding crucial submarine work to the rival Devonport yard at Plymouth. But Mr David Batty, a Rosyth director, denied that it had received any formal indication of the ministry's conclusion. The future of the two government-owned yards, which are operated by separate private-sector groups, is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers next week. Mr Batty said it appeared that the government had no intention of closing either yard. He added: 'Rosyth really must have nuclear submarine refitting if it is to have any sort of viable future.' Signs were 'not at all that good' for Rosyth, he said. The yard is managed by Babcock Thorn, majority-owned and controlled by Babcock International. A Devonport official warned, however: 'It is far too early to celebrate. As far as we are concerned, a decision has not been taken.' DML, the management company, is a consortium of the Weir group, BICC and Brown and Root of the US. The Ministry of Defence also said that the decision, which was postponed at the end of last year, remained open. The government is expected to offer the losing yard guarantees of work on refitting surface ships over the medium term, but neither considers that it can afford to lose lucrative nuclear submarine work. A decision has been forced by naval cuts and the need for new docking facilities to accommodate the UK's large new Trident ballistic missile submarines. Rosyth sprang a surprise in December by tabling a fresh proposal which, like Devonport's, would be based on refurbishing existing docks rather than completing new ones. That would involve estimated capital expenditure of Pounds 147m, compared with the company's previous plan to finish a purpose-built dock complex for Pounds 267m. Three of Britain's biggest construction and engineering groups have filed protective claims approaching Pounds 200m against the Ministry of Defence to cover cost overruns on the Faslane nuclear submarine base on the Clyde. Trafalgar House, which is understood to have issued a writ for about Pounds 120m, said yesterday: 'These claims are essentially technical to protect the companies' position. Discussions are continuing with the Ministry of Defence to resolve any differences and are proceeding satisfactorily.' Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering is understood to have claimed Pounds 50m and Babcock Contractors about Pounds 20m. Proceedings have arisen because under Scottish law companies are required to file claims within five years from the start of a contract. Work started at Faslane in 1987 but has been seriously delayed. Up to 600 jobs are likely to be lost under Ministry of Defence plans to establish a single army personnel centre in Glasgow by 1995.</p>

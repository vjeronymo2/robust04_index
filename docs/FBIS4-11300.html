			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Apr (PL) -- Cuban emigrants today  expressed their confidence in the success of the process that  has just began, which seeks to normalize their relations with  the island. The group is currently in Havana to attend a  conference organized by the Foreign Ministry.    Luis Mendez, an investor living in New York, told PRENSA  LATINA that rejection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and support for  the conference continue to grow within the Cuban community  living abroad. This is a growing movement, even among those who  would never have spoken of any sort of change in relations with  the country two years ago.    Mendez left Cuba almost 30 years ago. He said a positive  result from this conference could lead to more talks with Cubans  living abroad. He added that it could also influence the  evolution of future relations with Washington.    The investor contended that many U.S. firms are interested  in  investing in Cuba, but the current restrictions set up by the  blockade disallow such activity.    He condemned the fact that after signing a letter of intent  he was not allowed to transfer funds to the Caribbean island.  The money was destined for family relief, but the U.S.  Government did not give its approval.    Mariana Gaston, a member of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in New  York, also believed the meeting to be a first step toward  continued conversations. Gaston was also a participant in the  talks held between Cuban emigrants and the government in 1978.    She highlighted the government's interest in seeking the  historically significant normalization of ties with the Cuban  community abroad that might resolve the worries or needs of that  portion of the Cuban family.    She pointed out the improved facilities for travelling to  the  island for family reunification, the solution of communication  problems, and the improvement of migratory regulations in  general as examples of that intention.    She added that some of those living abroad try to mobilize  the sometimes intimidated voices of those who want normal  relations, despite the threats of terrorism.    Such mobilization must have an impact on the U.S.  Government,  she concluded, from the President to Congress to local  authorities, demanding that the United States change its  outdated policy toward Cuba.    Vicente Dopico, another emigrant and a member of the Cuban  Change organization in the United States, said the very fact  that Cuba has called the meeting, which begins tomorrow, proves  the Cuban Government's intentions regarding its relations with  the emigrant community. I believe the meeting will have positive  results, although we all realize that some things may not be  attained immediately, he explained.    Dopico affirmed that the conference in Havana and the  presence of groups within the United States that defend this  type of relationship between the two parties, demonstrates the  possibility of a future.    This future means the normalization of a nation with more  than 1 million of its citizens living abroad. This feeling is  always growing among those who agree with the need to establish  a stable bond and a relationship of mutual respect for the good  of the country, he concluded.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Canning's Pounds 1.4m Italian costs W Canning is to make a special provision in its 1993 accounts of up to Pounds 1.4m for bad debts, in respect of certain substantial customers of its Italian electronic components business. The Birmingham-based company, which also has speciality chemicals interests, said the provision would be out of a total exposure of Pounds 1.93m. After tax and minorities, it will reduce attributable earnings by about Pounds 500,000. Canning said that overall sales and orders in its electronics components business continued to be very good and it did not, therefore, anticipate that sales or operating profits would be materially affected in 1994 by the Italian problems. The shares, however, fell 8p to 185p yesterday. A maintained final dividend of 4.35p is forecast, making an unchanged total of 7.29p. Interim pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 3.02m) after an exceptional charge of Pounds 942,000 relating to the sale of an offshoot. Final results are due to be announced on March 23.</p>

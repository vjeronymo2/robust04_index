			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic </F> by Dubravko Merlic; from the "Slikom na Sliku" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Merlic] Good evening, esteemed viewers, and  welcome to this evening's Slikom na Sliku program. As we  announced earlier, our guest this evening is Mate Granic, vice  prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. Good evening,  and welcome back from your successful diplomatic tour.    [Granic] Good evening.    [Merlic] [passage omitted] Mr. Granic, I am under the  impression that the vast majority of reactions to the  preliminary agreement signed in Washington are extremely  favorable, except for a few unfavorable or restrained reactions  from Serbia. What is the true situation on the ground, and do  you have any information from Herceg-Bosna? I hear that  politicians and people in Herceg-Bosna are finding it difficult  to accept this agreement. It seems that the wounds sustained in  this serious Muslim-Croat conflict have not yet healed.    [Granic] There are fears, and one should be understanding  and  make explanations patiently. I think this is our reality. I  believe that people will accept the agreement, but we must be  patient in explaining all the advantages the Croatian people  will gain by this agreement in both Herceg-Bosna and in Croatia.    [Merlic] What was particularly well stressed in President  Tudjman's speech, I think, was that this proposal--this  agreement-- would not be accepted only by narrow-minded  nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists. How realistic is  this, given the situation on the ground?    [Granic] The president gave his assessment of the agreement  today. You said that 60 countries requested permission to  broadcast his speech immediately. It is quite certain that many  other countries will make such a request. This has been a  number one topic in the world and on all TV stations over the  past three days. I believe there will be a lack of understanding  initially. I believe there will be fear, but I also believe  that once it is all over, and when not just a preliminary but  also a final agreement are signed, the people will accept it.    [Merlic] In the past few days politicians from Herceg-Bosna  expressed their views and sharp criticism, saying that they  could not accept an agreement which contains no guarantees of  territories, of the territorial integrity of this Croatian part  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are these fears justified?    [Granic] We have received guarantees at different levels  with  this agreement. On the one side, from the geopolitical,  geostrategic, and economic point of view, Croatia has every  interest in a confederation based on a modern union: a customs,  monetary, and economic union and a defense alliance, with a  shared command, confederal council. On the other--as far as  Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina are concerned--all Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be included in this agreement. [passage  omitted]    [Merlic] Talking about the cantons--or as they will be  called in Croatian, grand counties [velezupa]...    [Granic, interrupting] President Tudjman said that today,  and  we will probably propose that name....    [Merlic, interrupting] You said that the cantons will be  sovereign. What duties will lie with the cantons? Will the  cantons have armies and police?    [Granic] You see, it says here that the cantons will have  jurisdiction over police, education, culture, housing issues....    [Merlic, interrupting] Talking about the police, will they  have different uniforms in different cantons, or will they be  the same?    [Granic] The uniforms will be the same, but the insignia  will  differ from canton to canton. That has been agreed upon.  Therefore, certain tasks will be carried out at the level of the  federation, there will be joint tasks, and some tasks will be  exclusively under the jurisdiction of the cantons. The basic  aim was to set up a federation that can function on the one  hand, and on the other hand, to secure a high level of  decentralization in the form of cantons which are inherently  sovereign, and which are federal units.    [Merlic] The army will be at the level of the federation.    [Granic] There is a final solution and a solution for the  interim period. Nothing will change in the interim period;  things will only be coordinated. The final solution envisages  the army to be at the level of the federation. I will read it  out: joint command, joint military system within the  confederation and the protection of borders. That will be at  the level of the federation, at the level of the cantons.  [sentence as heard]    [Merlic] It could be irresponsible to mention this now, but  a  prominent leader of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA -  Stranka demokratske akcije] of Croatia spoke on the TV  Parliament program last week about the navy in Neum. Is that  irresponsible, or is he well informed?    [Granic] I think that is irresponsible. As I said, we will  have coordination at the level of the confederation [as heard].  Therefore, this has never been mentioned. We do want  coordination because we have the same strategic interests in  having a defense alliance and coordination at the level of the  confederation. But of course such ideas were not discussed.    [Merlic] Let us go back to the Croat-Bosniak federation  briefly. What seems to me the greatest problem that needs to be  dealt with in the future is the territorial division. It is not  mentioned anywhere how many and which cantons there will be and  which territory they will cover.    [Granic] There are proposals, but there have been no  official  talks on that issue yet.    [Merlic] Do we know how many cantons there will be?    [Granic] It is certain that Hercegovina will be a separate  canton, as well as western Bosnia and Posavina. There are  various possibilities for central Bosnia.    [Merlic] Will central Bosnia perhaps be a mixed canton?    [Granic] There have been proposals to make central Bosnia  one  big mixed canton with two sub-cantons, one of which would be  Croat and one Bosniak, or perhaps to have two separate cantons.  No agreement has been reached on that. The exact number of  cantons will be discussed over the next 10 days. No agreement  has been reached so far. [passage omitted reiterates Serbs  should give up 20 percent of their territory through  negotiations; summary of Russia's involvement in solving the  Bosnian crisis over the past 10 days] I was invited to go to  Moscow today, but that was not possible because of my visit to  Paris. I will go to Moscow next week.    [Merlic] There are several options for the Bosnian Serbs.  They can say no, they can yield territory, or they can join in  and remain in Bosnia-Herzegovina in one way or another. What  seems the most likely possibility to you?    [Granic] As it has been said, they will be invited to join  in  under the same conditions.    [Merlic] On the federal principle?    [Granic] Yes, that is right. They will be invited to join in  on the federal principle--after the principles are agreed upon,  of course. That is the first option. The second option is for  them to remain in some kind of relationship with the federation,  as the European Union has suggested--the (?division between) the  federation and the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is one of  the possibilities. In any case, they would not be allowed to  leave now. [passage omitted]    [Merlic] If the Bosnian Serbs decide to remain in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, either on this federal principle, or on some kind  of confederal principle, does that mean that Croatia would still  form a confederation with that kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Granic] Croatia has political, strategic, and economic  interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is perfectly clear today  that this is also the West's strategic interest. This has never  been defined more clearly than now. I believe that Croatia has  firmly decided to take that step -- both by signing and by  today's statement by President Tudjman, which has been well  received throughout the world.    I can say that in the United States the news about the  signing [the agreement on confederation] met with almost  unanimous approval -- among diplomats, in the Security Council,  and in the United Nations. We will continue along this path.  It will not be easy. As you can see, there are a lot of  obstacles that need to be overcome successfully, and this is why  we said that this was the first -- important and historic -- but  only the first step.    [Merlic] To end this interview, I have a question about the  guarantees and promises that the United States and the  international community have made to Croatia. Primarily, the  most interesting one is a certain guarantee that the occupied  areas of Croatia will be returned under Croatia's sovereignty.  There is also financial assistance and the cooperation in  military issues, namely, membership in NATO's Partnership for  Peace. Have any of these guarantees been put down on paper?    [Granic] The guarantees have not been put down on paper, but  they are being discussed. In the talks I have had with Vice  President Gore, General Shalikashvili, Defense Secretary Perry,  and State Secretary Christopher, we discussed all this in more  detail than you mentioned here. This is not all. Access to  financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, will  be opened up to us. The public knows that some loans have been  blocked for political reasons. That is one group of offers.  The other one is the European Union. Talks on this are under  way; very intensive talks. [passage omitted: EU to discuss  Bosnia on Monday]    [Granic] What is the most interesting for us, of course, is  the reintegration of the UN protected areas into Croatia's state  and legal system. I discussed this with the UN secretary  general. We will put our proposal in writing by mid-March, and  demand guarantees and support from the United States and EU,  from all important international factors. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Observer: Falklands salute The new year might strike fear and loathing into many stout hearts of oak but not those in the most southerly outposts of the British empire. Falkland Islanders, who are among the world's wealthiest people per capita thanks to fishing licences, are preparing for a year of celebrations; 1992 is the islands' 'Heritage Year'. Various beanos will commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first sighting of the islands; the 100th anniversary of the consecration of Christ Church Cathedral; the 100th anniversary of the Falkland Islands Volunteer Defence Force; and the rather touchy 10th anniversary of the British victory over Argentina in the 1982 Falklands war. Many of the great and good - including the Archbishop of Canterbury next month - are due to visit Stanley in 1992. Sadly, Prime Minister John Major has already cried off. In his Christmas message to the Falklands he pleaded a full diary - 'getting away from Downing Street even as far as Chequers is quite an achievement these days.' Perhaps Mrs Thatcher could be asked to stand in?</p>

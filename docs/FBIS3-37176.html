			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Up to the present date, three out of 14 generating  sets at Ukraine's nuclear electric stations have found  themselves on the verge of a stoppage due to the insufficient  amount of nuclear fuel available. In the words of Nur  Nihmatulin, the first deputy chairman of the State Committee for  the Use of Nuclear Power [DerzhKomAtom], problems with the  supply of nuclear fuel from Russia have to do with the lack of  funds to pay for energy carriers. In order to provide Ukraine's  nuclear electric power station's with fuel and spare parts for  this year, 350 billion rubles are needed. So far, DerzhKomAtom  has no such a sum. The leadership of the committee sees the  settlement of this issue in putting into practice the trilateral  agreement signed in Moscow.</p>

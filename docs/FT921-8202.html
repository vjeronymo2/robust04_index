			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Milken lawsuits deal proposed MR MICHAEL MILKEN, the former junk bond king, will pay an additional Dollars 500m (Pounds 276.2m) into a fund to compensate the victims of his securities frauds under a proposed outline settlement of civil lawsuits stemming from the collapse of the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank. Mr Milken - who built up and headed the high yield bond department at Drexel  -has already put Dollars 400m into the fund. Other officials of Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February 1990, would contribute Dollars 300m in aggregate under the proposed deal. Drexel's insurers would reportedly add another Dollars 100m. Mr Milken faces suits from small investors as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation acting on behalf of savings and loan organisations which were big Drexel clients. There has been much recent speculation that he would try to settle the civil actions. The FDIC, which oversees the banking and thrift industries in the US, yesterday declined to say whether it was satisfied with the proposed settlement package. Yesterday, Mr Milken's spokesmen - along with the FDIC - pointed to a 'gag' order insisted on by Judge Milton Pollack, overseeing the Drexel bankruptcy, and declined to comment. There has been considerable pressure from Judge Pollack to reach settlements in the wave of litigation which followed Drexel's collapse, and thus to avoid courtroom battles which could drag on for years. His urgings had already prompted a settlement in the Drexel bankruptcy proceedings, with securities litigants and traditional creditors agreeing to split the spoils.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Chulin Laksanawisit said  there should be no effect from the United States keeping  Thailand on its priority watch list for trade retaliation. He  said the United States will not be able to take retaliatory  trade measures now that international trade will be overseen by  the World Trade Organization set up under the GATT agreement.  Besides, in the announcement, the United States said it would  like to see Thailand's copyright act passed by the Thai  parliament first before removing Thailand from the list. Chulin  said the copyright law is now being scrutinized by a special  committee of the House of Representatives pending the second and  third readings of the bill, which are expected to take place in  May or June.</p>

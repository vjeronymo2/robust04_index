			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas flickers Third-quarter results from British Gas, usually regarded by the market as price insensitive, came in worse than market expectations and triggered a bout of underperformance by the share price. At the close of trading the stock was 3 1/2 cheaper at 325p, a fraction above the day's low point, after good turnover of 11m shares. Dealers said the market was worried that a series of earnings forecast cuts could be under way and that the company might be forced into announcing very heavy job cuts if the government accepts the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendation to break up the group. Nomura has long adopted one of the market's most bearish viewpoints on Gas. Mr Steve Turner, the broker's Gas analyst, said: 'The figures were well below expectations despite a Pounds 40m boost from colder weather and the utilisation of Pounds 25m worth of provisions.' He reduced his full year forecast from Pounds 950m to Pounds 925m.</p>

During the exercises,  methods of cooperation between ground forces and the Baltic  Fleet will be worked out. A large group of generals and  officers of the Russian Defense Ministry have been sent to the  region to prepare for the exercises.    In the opinion of Konstantin Kobets, Russia's chief military  inspector, it is necessary to check the combat capabilities of  the troop structures that previously had powerful rear cover but  which are now surrounded by states whose policy toward Russia is  not always clear. In his opinion, the group of forces in the  region should reliably ensure the defense of Russia's western  borders.</p>

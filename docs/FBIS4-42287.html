			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xavier Gautier: "Franco-German Tandem for </F> Europe"]    [Text] Mulhouse -- "France and Germany will be responsible  for the presidency of the European Union [EU] in succession  until June 1995. I think that we should link our work to give  the impression that there will be a common presidency, or at  least a continuous presidency, for 12 months."    The remark was made yesterday by Francois Mitterrand during  the press conference held during the 63d Franco-German summit in  Mulhouse. Sitting at his side, Chancellor Kohl confirmed: "We  intend to work with the French to ensure that our two terms as  president turn into one period of 12 months."    The two heads of state and of government thus clearly went  further than French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wished. The  previous day the latter used a spokesman to describe the  Franco-German tandem as a "dual presidency making it possible to  link work over a year through joint operations and projects."  Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand insisted: "Europe will never  have experienced such a long period of continuity."    Paris and Bonn have already prepared for this term of office  which starts on 1 July. For two days, the Franco-German  partners reviewed the problems of security and stability in  Europe, the problems of immigration, and the strengthening of  Community institutions, the fight against unemployment, and  economic recovery.    One of the high points of this meeting, which distinguished  it from the "previous 62," according to Mr. Kohl, was the fact  that the two "locomotives of Europe" wanted to settle the issue  of the eastern and southeastern high-speed trains.    In reply to the impatience of the Central and East European  countries which want to join the EU, Francois Mitterrand said:  "I see no obstacle to speeding up the membership process for  newcomers, provided the European rules are respected. There are  no preset limits on European expansion."    But, both Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl stressed that  "the important thing is that the interests of the candidates do  not conflict with our achievements, and that Europe should make  progress."    Anxious to stress this "harmony," Chancellor Kohl welcomed  "the remarkable atmosphere of the Mulhouse summit. The problem  with this type of consultation is that it often leads to nothing  spectacular. But the sensational thing is precisely this  normality in Franco-German relations within the framework of  European developing European unity," he noted.  <H5>  Musical Chairs </H5>   This perfectly rehearsed duet also applied to the candidates  for the mandates which are expiring in European and  international organizations. With regard to the replacement of  Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Francois  Mitterrand explained: "The exchanges of views will continue  until the Corfu summit (on 24 and 25 June -- LE FIGARO editor's  note). We will probably be ready to support the same candidate  after consultations with our 10 partners." The chancellor  smiled knowingly.    European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan will be nosed out by  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The British candidate  could inherit the post of secretary general of the World Trade  Organization, which will take over from GATT. Paris would  apparently not oppose that.    Unless, members of the entourage of one French minister  stressed, he insists on replacing Jean-Claude Paille, whose  mandate as secretary general of the OECD is coming to an end.  Paris would like Mr. Paille to be given another term of office.    This huge game of musical chairs is far from being settled.  Another position to be allocated is that of secretary general of  the Western European Union, and that of secretary general of  NATO.    The Germans and French have drawn up a list of names with a  view to the Corfu summit, while "avoiding giving the impression  of imposing their candidates on the other Europeans," one of the  French prime minister's advisers explained.    Far from these negotiations, the French president finally  issued an invitation to Germany: "I announced today that I had  the intention of inviting the European Army Corps to the 14 July  celebrations. And, consequently, the German, Belgian,  Luxembourg, and Spanish officials who are already part of or  about to become part of the corps." Chancellor Kohl immediately  "accepted" this invitation "with gratitude," indicating his  intention of being present on the Champs-Elysees on France's  national holiday.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks down A stronger pound hit big dollar-earning stocks. Having failed to benefit from Thursday's cut in the German discount rate, the dollar was weakened by a 3.7 per cent fall in US durable goods orders. The pound was stronger in its own right and closed in London almost three cents higher against the US currency. The currency shift prompted a sharp reversal in the recent strong performance by the oil majors. Shell Transport fell 14 to 566p and BP dropped 10 1/2 to 289 1/2 p. However, the pharmaceuticals sector, which had seen the timid return of some US buyers, suffered most heavily. Glaxo was the hardest hit stock in the FT-SE 100 index of leading companies with the shares falling 27 to 575p, Wellcome shed 24 to 736p and SmithKline Beecham crumbled 15 to 449p in the 'A's. With one foot in the drugs sector ahead of the impending demerger of its bioscience arm, ICI lost 31 1257p but still closed comfortably up on the week. Next Thursday the group will announce first quarter results that are expected to come in around Pounds 180m, down from the same period last year but better than earlier forecasts.</p>

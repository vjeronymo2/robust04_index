			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Hong Kong rejected U.N. criticism that it has mistreated some of the 50,000  Vietnamese "boat people" who have flocked to the British colony. A team from  the Geneva headquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had warned  that serious overcrowding would lead to fresh outbreaks of violence among  frustrated inmates of refugee camps. "The space is less than the space given to  people in prison here. It is even less than what is supposed to be given here  for a dog," Omar Bakhet, head of the agency's technical support unit, said on  local radio. However, Hong Kong's refugee coordinator, Mike Hanson, called the  criticism "entirely unreasonable" and noted that "we can't build new  accommodations overnight."  </P></p>

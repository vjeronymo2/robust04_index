			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (5): Donors face up to the realities - The Economy, In trouble but not yet in deep crisis LISTENING TO donors and some Kenyan businessmen, it is easy to believe that the Kenyan economy is in deep crisis. It isn't yet, though it could well become so if the political situation continues to sour. The truth - which almost all donors have denied until recently - is that the economy has been in trouble for some years, but it was neither politic, nor fashionable, to say so. That it has become so, especially in the last year, reflects a sea-change in donor opinion. There are three clear strands to this: post-1989 focus on human rights and governance is arguably the most important, especially for Kenya, whose record in the field of pluralism, transparency and accountability is abysmal. Corruption has escalated and is a significant part of the country's economic and political difficulties. Two other influences have been at work. One is the spurned suitor syndrome: donors have lost patience with the African country, for so long their favourite son, reacting with indignation at what they see as betrayal. The fact that it took them so long to recognise that their money was failing to achieve the desired result is a sorry commentary on the quality of donor decision-making. As one businessman puts it: 'The donors went on taking Kenyan promises at face value for too long, while at the same time kidding themselves that reform was on track.' Thirdly, the theology of structural adjustment has changed. In Kenya, progress in the financial sector, in the decontrol of prices, agricultural marketing and trade liberalisation has been undermined by a deteriorating public sector. Getting half the equation right is not good enough. Mr Lucas Ndungi, chairman of Nestle in Kenya and president of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, sums it up: 'The private sector cannot move faster than government.' In the public and parastatal sectors a gap separates promises from performance. The absence of political commitment, the sense that no-one is wholly in charge of economic strategy, the determination of 'rent-seekers' to secure their unwarranted slice of the action, and the familiar problem of motivating a bloated bureaucracy to push through politically unpalatable policies have combined to create the feeling of an economic crisis. That a country whose economy has been growing at 4.9 per cent a year since 1985, and which has outperformed virtually all other African countries, is now deemed to be in crisis is hard for the outsider to grasp. At first glance, it appears to have achieved far more than most other African countries, judged by the normal yardsticks of economic performance. A comparison with Zimbabwe - a country widely regarded as another African top performer - illustrates the point. However, Zimbabwe climbed on to the structural adjustment bandwagon only a year ago, while Kenya has been on it for six years. Moreover, Kenya's performance is visibly deteriorating, while Zimbabwe's experience with reform is too shortlived for any meaningful conclusions to be reached. Also, Kenya has become increasingly aid-dependent in recent years, while Zimbabwe's aid reliance is among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa. Above all, there is the sense that, should Kenya, with its impressive growth record, be in danger of slipping into the crisis category, that is largely of the government's own making. But this is less than fair, given the one-third deterioration in the terms of trade since the mid-1980s. Four problems loom when assessing economic prospects: public sector reform, aid dependence, export expansion and unemployment. The most urgent is that of restructuring both the parastatal sector and central government. The country's near-term stabilisation difficulties have their origins in excessive public spending. Inflation, which averaged 20 per cent on the revised retail price index last year, is at its highest level for a decade - the result, mainly, of rapid monetary growth of 20 per cent annually in the last two years, currency depreciation, increased fuel prices and the decontrol of prices. The main cause of money supply growth was government borrowing to fund the budget deficit of 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. The authorities are committed to reducing this to only 2 per cent in the fiscal year to June, but that target looks optimistic and about 4 per cent seems more likely. The problem is partly structural - too many ministries, too many civil servants and too much spending on wages rather than goods and services. The result - a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy. Parastatals are a big part of the problem. Over the years the government built up a portfolio of investments ranging from horse-breeding to Kenya Airways. Ten years ago a government report found that the state was earning a return of a mere 0.2 per cent on its Dollars 1.4bn parastatal investment. If the profits of the central bank are excluded, the parastatal sector is costing the government KPounds 2.9bn or almost 1 per cent of GDP. Elimination of the parastatal deficit is central to balancing the budget. While 139 non-strategic enterprises were listed in the July 1991 budget as privatisation targets, little progress has been made. This is the root cause of donor disillusionment. It also helps explain Kenya's difficulties in meeting targets set under the current loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Today, Kenya can afford neither the financial burden of an inefficient public sector, nor donor disapproval. In the last five years, the balance of payments has been in surplus only twice - in 1986, when coffee prices were buoyant, and again in 1989 when there were substantial aid inflows. Over that period aid grants averaged 2.5 per cent of GDP, while foreign capital inflows have financed more than 20 per cent of total investment. The growth in aid dependence is reflected in the sharp rise in the ratio of grants to GDP - from 1 per cent in 1986 to more than 3 per cent in 1990. In a world of capital shortages and heightened competition for the donor dollar, Kenya needs to improve its image with the donor community while reducing aid dependence. This will be difficult. Kenya's trade policy reforms, designed to increase domestic efficiency and encourage exports have had little impact. Exports increased 10 per cent in the four years to 1990, while imports grew twice as fast, rising 23 per cent. Even after grants averaging Dollars 365m a year the current account foreign payments deficit averaged Dollars 500m in 1989-90. While tourism, whose 1990 earnings of Dollars 465m matched those of tea and coffee combined, is partially financing the trade deficit, its growth is likely to slow, underscoring the urgency of an early, powerful export response. The pieces are in place - strengthened export incentives, the launch of export processing zones, tariff reform and shilling depreciation - but Kenyan industry does not have an export culture and it will be competing against in a world where dozens of developing countries have similar strategies and where cost-leadership is not enough. Quality is vital. Horticulture has set a precedent, demonstrating that an export culture can be created and high quality achieved. Kenya needs to create 400,000 jobs a year to keep pace with a population that will double over the next 17 years. There is a large pool of unemployed, with urban unemployment estimated at 16 per cent. In the last four years, formal sector job generation has averaged 90,000 a year, with the bulk (48,000 a year) occurring in small-scale enterprises. Official figures point to the creation of more than 400,000 jobs in 1990 in the informal sector, but because informal sector incomes and productivity are not growing, this - in the words of a Kenyan report - is 'neither growth nor development'. Privatisation and fiscal stringency mean that the public sector, which accounts for virtually half wage employment, will make little contribution to employment expansion. The fact that unemployment has risen rapidly in spite of economic growth of 5 per cent headlines the need for significantly faster expansion in the 1990s if a socio-political crisis is to be averted. But for the economy to grow more rapidly, the inter-related balance of payments and investment constraints must be loosened, underscoring yet again the need for Kenya to pursue an export-led growth strategy while making its peace with the donor and foreign investor communities.  ------------------------------------------------------ THE ECONOMIES COMPARED  ------------------------------------------------------                                    Kenya     Zimbabwe GDP growth (1985-90)                4.9%      3.4% Inflation (1991)                   20.0%     23.0% Budget deficit (% of GDP) 1990-91   5.6      10.8 BoP deficit (% of GDP) 1991         5.5      10.0 Wage employment growth (1985-90)    5.4%      2.5% Aid dependence (1998-99)           11.1%      4.6%  ------------------------------------------------------ Source: World Bank and National Accounts  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

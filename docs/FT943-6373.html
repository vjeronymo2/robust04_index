			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Asian fleets roam in search of bluefin tuna Claims by environmentalists that New Zealand's valuable deep water fisheries are being over-exploited has led to a row with the government and fishing companies over the future of the NZDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 469.5m) export industry. Last week, environmental group leaders stormed out of a special conference called by fisheries minister Mr Doug Kydd on the future of the industry. The government is trying to put in place a new control mechanism which will give the fishing companies more say in establishing sustainable quotas. One of the most prominent issues in the region is the chronic over-fishing of southern bluefin tuna. Until the late 1960s the fish were plentiful, but then a global decline became apparent as Japanese companies increased their presence in the region. Today, after intensive negotiations, the fishery is managed under a trilateral quota system between Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Japan pays an access fee to Australia, allowing it to catch part of its quota in Australian waters. A big remaining worry is the rate and price at which the large Asian fishing nations, notably Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, are harvesting tuna in the 20m square kilometres of ocean controlled by the Pacific island countries. This area provides around 50 per cent of the Japanese tuna catch. The Honiara-based Forum Fisheries Agency has calculated that access fees paid by the big Asian countries under bilateral agreements were only ADollars 74m (Pounds 35.2m) in 1993, while the market value of tuna taken from Pacific waters was more than ADollars 2bn. Given the importance of revenue from fisheries access to some of the island economies - it accounts for 40 per cent of Kiribati's gross domestic product for example - deals struck under bilateral arrangements look low. The problem, moreover, may be compounded by significant under-reporting of catches from these waters. Accordingly, there is a push, encouraged by Australia, to get the South Pacific nations to take a multilateral approach. A communique coming out the South Pacific Forum, an annual meeting of island nation leaders, approved the idea in principle this month, and fisheries ministers are due to meet later this year.</p>

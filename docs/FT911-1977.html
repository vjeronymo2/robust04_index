			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (5): Deal yet to be reached with Soviet Union THE SITUATION vis-a-vis the Soviet Union is complex in different ways. At present, Poland owes the Soviet Union 4.7bn transferable roubles and Dollars 1.7-1.8bn in convertible currency, while the Soviet Union owes Poland 7.7bn in transferable roubles and Dollars 300m in convertible currency clearing balances (up to the end of the first quarter of 1991). Poland argues that its net claims of 3bn transferable roubles should more than offset its net debt of Dollars 1.4-1.5bn. If recent precedents with Hungary and Czechoslovakia were followed, Poland would finish up as a substantial creditor. But agreement has yet to be reached.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] says it will  not halt its Jihad against Israel in exchange for the release of  its leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin. Hamas is awaiting Israel's  decision to release Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas  prisoners. Hamas functionaries talk about accepting the  Israel-PLO agreement, while its military arm insists on  continuing the struggle against the occupation. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports:    On the eve of the signature of the agreement with the PLO,  and after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has already withdrawn  approximately 90 percent of its forces from the Gaza Strip and  redeployed in the Qatif Bloc, the question remains, what will  Hamas do? Over the last few months Israel has tried -- via IDF  officers -- to open a sort of dialogue with Hamas. Major  General Matan Vilna'i, commander of the Southern Command, and  Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of the IDF forces in  the Gaza Strip, have held several meetings with some Hamas  leaders in the area. The two tried to come to an understanding  of Hamas, attempted to soften it, occasionally resorting to  threats -- but without much success.    Yesterday Hamas disgustedly rejected Foreign Minister Peres'  proposal to release Hamas leader Ahmad Yasin in exchange for a  call on his people to halt the acts of terrorism against Israel.  Sources in the Gaza Strip say that apparently Israel does not  realize that Yasin can no longer issue such an order to  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm. They claim that  there is a growing rift within Hamas between some of the  spiritual leaders and functionaries, and the fighters in the  field, after agreement between the PLO and Hamas was signed.  This agreement, which calls for cooperation in many areas, was  signed by Rashid Abu-Shabak, leader of the Fatah Hawks, and  Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is considered to be the leader of 'Izz-al-  Din al-Qassam. Sources in Gaza say that since this agreement  was signed, differences of opinion have surfaced between the  fighters in the field and the organization's spiritual  leadership, with the former complaining that Fatah is removing  them from work places, such as the busy works which Israel is  financing in the territories.    Despite all the denials coming from the direction of Fatah,  and the calming statements issued by Musa Abu-Marzuq, a Hamas  functionary residing in Jordan, it transpires that the limited  agreement between the PLO and Hamas will not prevent attacks in  Israel and in the territories, excluding the areas of Gaza and  Jericho which will be under the PLO's control.</p>

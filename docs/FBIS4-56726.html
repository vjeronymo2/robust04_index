			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Samuel Lewis Galindo and Ernesto Perez </F> Balladares, presidential candidates of the National Accord  Alliance and the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD,  respectively, with unidentified reporters at PRD headquarters in  Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] [Lewis Galindo] ...all of us, the six losing  candidates, have won because we contributed to raising the civic  level of Panamanian politics and, through our efforts, we have  strengthened the incipient Panamanian democracy. It is now up  to Dr. Perez Balladares to reinforce this democracy and set in  the future an example similar to the one set by President  Endara, for whom I publicly express appreciation.    [Perez Balladares] I also wish to join Mr. Galindo in this  recognition because it is reality and represents truth. We have  held very pure elections in Panama, despite some minor  incidents. I acknowledge President Endara's efforts. I also  make a public pledge that the 1999 elections will be at least  this honest. I will not intervene in the 1999 elections. The  Panamanian people can rest assured that on 1 September 1999 I  will hand over office to whoever wins the elections. In the  next five years, we expect to improve democracy in Panama, which  starts today.    [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, do you acknowledge Dr. Perez  Balladares' victory?    [Lewis Galindo] Definitely. Our reports, which are ahead of  the Electoral Tribunal's results, indicate that Dr. Perez  Balladares has won by a wide margin. For this reason, I have  come to congratulate him in the name of my party.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Perez Balladares] The same message we have been  transmitting  throughout our campaign. It is a message of reconciliation, of  national unity, the message that 8 May, election day, will be  over in a few minutes. When this day is over, we will turn a  glorious page with the beginning of a participative democracy,  which we all now pledge to perfect. In addition, I am inviting  all of my adversaries to unite with us in a single purpose so we  can attain the national objectives, for which we intend to  struggle in the next five years.    [Lewis Galindo] I am very pleased by Dr. Perez Balladares'  remarks on the day of his victory. This reassures the  Panamanian people that all of the electoral promises made by the  now victorious candidate will be fulfilled. The Panamanian  people should be pleased with this and should stay alert to make  sure he keeps his word.    [Perez Balladares] I would like to add something else, which  I think is very important. As we have said before, our  government will be one without hatred or resentment, without  revenge or grudges, without a return to the past, but with its  eyes set on the future for our young people and children.  Thanks. [applause]</p>

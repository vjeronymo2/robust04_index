			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 4 Jan, (JANA) -- Voice of America [VOA] has  relayed a commentary in which it attacks the brother leader of  the revolution and distorts his addresses to the masses who  rushed to receive him everywhere in the Great Jamahiriyah. In  its commentary, which expresses the views of the U.S.  Government, VOA piled accusations against Libya irresponsibly  and without any proof.    JANA's political editor has commented on this. He says:  This commentary could be explained on the basis of two facts:    First, it is a hysterical reaction to the huge  demonstrations  of anger and defiance that erupted everywhere in the Great  Jamahiriyah, and to the scenes of the human flood in which the  masses joined their leader, declaring the historic decision of  the Libyan people to defend their sovereignty and right to an  independent honorable life.    Second, it is an attempt to overtake and cover-up the new  evidence that has appeared recently, which confirmed Libya's  innocence to the accusations of the so-called Lockerbie case,  and also to overtake and cover-up the exposure of the political  aims beyond these accusations.    The editor added:    The irresponsible attack on the existing Jamahiri system in  Libya is an attack on the options chosen freely by the Libyan  people, and in which they have become the first people in  history to declare the people's authority. This marked the  start of the era of the masses in which the people can control  their authority, wealth, and weapons, and decide their own fate  directly, without being represented by anyone.    As for the quotations taken from the leader's addresses --  used by the commentary in order to support the accusations  directed by the VOA -- as usual, they deliberately distorted  these addresses and cut them to fit these accusations. VOA  forgot that all the speeches that it quoted were made in public,  were relayed by radio and TV, and the whole world heard them.    The U.S. Government, whose official views are expressed by  VOA's commentary, understands, perhaps before anyone else, that  Libya is innocent of all the accusations directed by the radio  in its commentary. The American Government and the world know  that Libya has condemned terrorism and no longer allows any  organization suspected of connections with terrorism to be  present on its territories. Libya has invited the UN secretary  general to send a commission to confirm that Libya is free of  any alleged camps for training terrorists, but there was no  response to this invitation.</p>

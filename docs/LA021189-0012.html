			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS TOWN SHUTS INS OFFICE, CHARGES FILTH, CROWDING  </P> <P> City officials on Friday evicted the Immigration and Naturalization Service  from a building where thousands of Central Americans apply for asylum each  week, accusing the INS of not complying with the fire code and failing to clean  up litter and human waste around the building.  </P> <P> The fire marshal and police officers cleared the building, then locked the two  main entrances and sealed a third with duct tape. A notice was put on the  building saying that it is not safe for habitation. About 100 Central Americans  and some INS employees stood outside the padlocked building as policemen turned  away arriving immigrants.  </P> <P> The city was later granted a temporary restraining order forbidding the INS to  reopen the center or any other facility in Harlingen "in such a manner as to  constitute a nuisance and threat to public health and safety."  </P> <P> On some nights, scores of Central Americans have slept outside the building to  retain places in line for the next morning. Four portable toilets at the side  of the building have been allowed to overflow, the lawsuit says, and the  parking lot and nearby vacant lots are littered with trash and rotting food.  </P> <P> The INS kept a fire exit at the center locked and had seating for 450 people in  a building that, under the fire code, has a maximum occupancy of 196, the suit  says.  </P> <P> The INS has not performed any health screening of the asylum refugees for  communicable diseases, the lawsuit charged, and local health officials have  reported an increase in hepatitis.  </P> <P> INS officials said they have been working to improve the center. The agency has  resolved two of the three fire code violations brought to its attention and was  reducing the seating capacity, INS attorney David Ayala said.  </P></p>

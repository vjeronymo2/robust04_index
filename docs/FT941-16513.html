			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Discount time Some US airlines cut fares by as much as 45 per cent last week. The cuts were triggered by Northwest Airlines, which reduced prices on flights in the US, Canada and the Caribbean between January 18 and April 15. American Airlines, United, US Air, TWA, Continental and Delta, all followed, but did not cut prices in all regions. Discounting among US airlines is common in January but rarely on this scale.</p>

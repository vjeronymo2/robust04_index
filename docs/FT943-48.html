			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (24): Farmers are waiting for ratification - Agriculture / Alan Swinbank examines the effects of the Uruguay Round agreement Throughout the post-war period, while western governments progressively liberalised world trade for industrial goods, most countries protected their domestic farm sectors. As a result world markets for agricultural and food products suffered from depressed and destabilised prices. In large part, this stemmed from deviations from the normal rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which had been obtained by the US in the 1950s. These provisions allowed import controls and export subsidies to be used in conjunction with domestic farm policies when such trade measures would have been unacceptable for manufactured goods. Subsequently, with the formation of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of today's European Union, and the development of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU's intransigent defence of the CAP has been a significant disruptive force. As the world's largest importer, and second largest exporter of agricultural products, the EU's policy stance was bound to have important ramifications for world agricultural trade. In the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations, agricultural protectionism was seriously addressed. Assuming that the agreement of December 1993 is ratified later this year, the Gatt contracting parties will start to dismantle their protectionist farm policies next year. The agreement is complex, but in essence all existing import controls must be converted into conventional import tariffs, a process known as tariffication. The developed countries of the world then have six years to reduce tariffs by 36 per cent on average. Export subsidies must also be reduced by 36 per cent, the volume of subsidised exports by 21 per cent, and the overall level of farm support by 20 per cent. Certain policy measures deemed to have no impact upon production levels are exempt from control. Some observers believe that this agreement will sweep aside the livelihoods of European and Japanese farmers, leaving the countryside depopulated, the environment despoiled, and citizens dependent upon imported supplies. Greater malnutrition and starvation may occur in low-income countries unable to afford the increased import bill for food supplies. Others suggest that the agreement will not have these dire consequences, but will result in some improvement in agricultural trade. It is expected that world prices will rise, but these increases will be much less than the efficient agricultural exporters such as Australia might hope for, and the low-income food importing countries might fear. An Australian study of the agreement suggests that, once the full impact of the changes is felt, well into the next century, world wheat prices might be 8 per cent higher then they would otherwise be, those for dairy products 4 (butter) to 20 (cheese) per cent higher, with meats increasing by 3 to 7 per cent. Even these modest estimates may be too high. While sticking strictly to the letter of the agreement, countries have the right to minimise its impact on their own farm policies; and it is expected that most of them  - certainly the EU - will do so. Furthermore, in many instances tariffication has produced highly protective import barriers which, even when reduced by 36 per cent, will result in little import penetration. Developing countries dependent upon imported cereal supplies will see an increase in the cost of imports. However, many development economists have argued that the microeconomic incentives that this world price increase will bring to bear on governments to change their policies, and farmers to increase supply, will outweigh the macroeconomic burdens borne by the economy. Fears that food aid will be more difficult to obtain are probably misplaced, because intervention stocks in the subsidised exporting regions of the world are likely to increase as a consequence of the Gatt limits on subsidised exports. When currencies are non-convertible, foreign exchange in short supply, and distribution systems poorly developed, then food supplies are heavily dependent upon the productive capacity of local farmers. While this is undoubtedly true of many regions of the world, such a situation does not prevail in western Europe, where international buying-power and modern distribution systems mean that a cornucopia of food products can be delivered to food stores. The CAP indisputably affects the price, quality and origins of the food Europeans eat, but it is a fallacy to believe that they are dependent upon the CAP for food supplies. Short of a calamitous disruption to the world food system, European food stores will remain full even if the GATT deal does result in a significant fall in EU farm production. But the output of European agriculture is unlikely to collapse; first, because of the continuing productivity growth, which will result in ever-increasing yields despite the yield-reducing effects of price cuts; and second, because the land and labour, on which European agriculture depends, will be encouraged to remain in the sector, so that it can benefit from the continued payment of Gatt-exempt taxpayer-funded subsidies. Yet, while the overall impact, for good or ill, of the Gatt agreement is unlikely to be dramatic, it would be wrong to dismiss it as being of little relevance. It took many years, and several Gatt deals, to reduce significantly trade barriers on manufactured goods, and it would naive to presume that faster progress could be achieved in the more heavily protected agricultural arena. The Uruguay Round is a success in that it extends Gatt disciplines to agricultural trade, and increases the transparency of the support mechanisms in place. In accordance with the agreement, new negotiations are to be embarked upon before the end of the decade with the express intent of securing further substantial reductions in farm support. This timescale will allow farm and other rural businesses to undertake gradual adjustment, and governments to pursue policies which facilitate global food security and environmental protection. The danger is that governments will attempt to backslide from their recent commitments to reduce agricultural protectionism, and in the pursuit of unsustainable policies generate greater uncertainty for agricultural trade. If the EU, for example, falters in its resolve to reform the CAP, a new budgetary crisis could result in the abrupt abolition of farm support, resulting in a mass of bankruptcies in farming and related industries, and a destabilising shock to world agricultural prices.

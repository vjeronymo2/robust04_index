			<p>BFN     [Text] The Slavic Assembly Belaya Rus wrote a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali who is staying in Minsk in  which it expressed its concern over the fact that the UN is  being transformed from a peacekeeping organization to a world  judge and gendarme. It has become common for the UN to use a  dual approach toward resolving international conflicts, the  letter reads. The UN is becoming a conductor of wishes of a  narrow group of states with the United States at the top. The  Slavic Assembly demanded that violent interference in the life  of the peoples of Yugoslavia be halted. The letter [passage  indistinct] an aggression against Iraq and murder of Somalia  citizens were initiated. [words indistinct] Military  interference with the affairs of some states and indulgence to  other states become key mechanisms of the UN activities.</p>

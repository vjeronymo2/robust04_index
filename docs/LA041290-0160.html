			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAIL PUT IN 'LOCK DOWN' FOR 2ND TIME IN 3  WEEKS  </P> <P> The Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles was "locked down" Wednesday  afternoon for the second time in three weeks as sheriff's deputies once again  searched the nation's largest jail for a gun that they believed had been  smuggled in.  </P> <P> No weapon was found during the lock down, which began at noon and ended at 3:30  p.m. The move came after bailiffs found bullets in a bag containing the  belongings of an inmate who had been transported from the jail to Los Angeles  Superior Court in Torrance, said Asst. Sheriff Richard Foreman, who oversees  county jails.  </P> <P> Foreman said deputies became suspicious because the inmate, who was not  identified, is housed in the same area where deputies found marijuana, money  and a handmade knife -- but no gun -- during a search three weeks ago. As it  turned out, the bullets were never inside the jail. Foreman said they were  confiscated when the inmate was arrested and had been placed in the property  bag.  </P></p>

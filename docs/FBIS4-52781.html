			<p>BFN     [Text] The Muslim position is expected to be further  strengthened in the ongoing peace talks with the government.  This expectation is anchored on the talks held for the first  time by the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] and the Moro  Islamic Liberation Front on 7 May in Cotabato City.    MNLF spokesman Zain Jali said that the talks addressed the  formation of an alliance between the two groups to adopt a  unified position in the peace talks with the government. The  two Muslim groups seek autonomy for 13 provinces and four cities  in Mindanao.</p>

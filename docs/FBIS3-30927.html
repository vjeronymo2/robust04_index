			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic said peace may be at hand this time in Bosnia.    "There is a line that has been crossed," he said, the line  being the willingness to use force as NATO issued an ultimatum  Wednesday [9 February] for an end to shelling of Sarajevo and  withdrawal of heavy weapons.    It "might be the first step towards disengagement," he said.    Asked by AFP at his hotel here if the peace initiative would  really work, after so many have failed, Silajdzic said: "I  think it will."    Silajdzic is in Geneva for a Bosnian peace conference  opening  Thursday.    He said the withdrawal of the artillery of the besieging  Serbs from around Sarajevo would not change the strategic  balance since it is "not true you can protect troops with  artillery." He said the only purpose of the Serb artillery was  "to attack civilians."    Military experts in Sarajevo consider, however, that the  Serbs' artillery advantage enables them to offset the numerical  superiority of the mainly Moslem Bosnian troops defending the  city against a 22-month Serb siege.    Silajdzic said that the NATO ultimatum could lead to a  "balance of power and with a balance of power you will have  peace." He denied that the Bosnians were outnumbered since he  said they were fighting not just Bosnian Serb forces but troops  from Serbia. "They can bring out more troops at any time,"  Silajdzic said.</p>

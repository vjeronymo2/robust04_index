			<p>BFN     [Text] Iquique (Chile), 16 Jun (EFE) -- The need to fight  against drug trafficking and consumption and the replacement of  coca plantations in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru through  international aid are the proposals the Latin American  Parliament (Parlatino) began to debate today, 16 June.    The meeting began today in the Chilean port of Iquique,  1,857  km north of Santiago, and will end tomorrow, 17 June, with the  release of conclusions on subjects such as drug trafficking, the  foreign debt, energy and mines, economic matters, and  international law.    Bolivian Deputy Guido Camacho, president of the  Antinarcotics  Defense Commission [Comision de Defensa en la Lucha Contra el  Narcotrafico], told EFE that the international community must  participate in coca replacement policies in Colombia, Peru, and  Bolivia, given that this agricultural product generates revenues  in those countries.    He said there is the legal consumption of coca, especially  by  Bolivian and Peruvian peasants as part of their daily diet.    The Parlatino members pointed out that excess coca goes for  the production of cocaine, which leads to drug trafficking.    Camacho added that measures must be adopted to prevent this  from happening. Enforcement policies must be reinforced with  preventive measures, related to the need to replace the coca  plantations with alternative crops.    This must be done within a plan to improve highway  infrastructure and other measures to pave the way for a more  adequate trade of agricultural products, Deputy Camacho said.    He added that the proposal to legalize the use of cocaine in  Colombia will be discussed at the meetings to be held on Friday.    Among the proposals is one submitted by Chile demanding  punishment for drug traffickers and also for consumers.    When asked about the validity of the conclusions released by  the Parlatino for the governments, the Bolivian deputy explained  that the resolutions will approved by consensus of the Parlatino  members who will then take these ideas to the congresses of  their respective countries to turn them into laws.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Barclays loses finance director MR PETER WOOD, finance director of Barclays, is to leave the UK bank and join Standard Chartered, Barclays said yesterday. The announcement came the day after Barclays had disclosed it intended to appoint a chief executive from outside. Mr Wood, 50, who would have been a contender to take over as chief executive of Barclays if it had wanted an internal appointment, made no comment on the reason for his departure. Both banks said he had been talking to Standard since January. Barclays appointed Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director of its BZW investment banking division, to succeed Mr Wood from May 1. Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman and chief executive, said the bank was 'sorry to lose' Mr Wood. Mr Wood will succeed Mr Richard Stein, who is retiring as a director from June 30. Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard chairman, welcomed Mr Wood's 'wide and varied experience in one of the world's leading banking groups'. Barclays emphasised yesterday that talks about Mr Wood's appointment had predated its announcement on Wednesday that it will undertake a worldwide search for someone to take on Mr Buxton's role as chief executive while he remains chairman. Mr Wood's approach to Standard came after Mr Buxton disclosed that he intended to split his two roles, and might seek a chief executive from outside. Institutional shareholders had pressed for a division of roles. 'I would like to do it as quickly as we can, but it is not going to be that easy. There are not that many candidates,' says Sir Denys Henderson, the non-executive director of Barclays Bank who is leading the effort to find a new chief executive. Sir Denys says the bank has 'some very competent' people at the top. But the decision to look outside sends a signal to the heads of Barclays' three divisions. These are the huge banking division, which has Pounds 98bn (Dollars 145bn) of the bank's Pounds 149bn assets, the BZW investment bank, and service businesses. Other internal contenders to become chief executive would have been Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the banking division, and Mr David Band, head of its BZW investment bank. Sir Denys believes the successful candidate will probably come from a bank or a financial services company. 'If some genius appears who had done a good job elsewhere, and could cope with the change of industry, then we would consider him,' he said. Appointing someone from a competitor would carry a serious risk of offending the remaining senior managers. That might make it tempting to bring in the senior manager of a large US bank that has already recovered from similar difficulties with property-related lending. Barclays' ordinary shares closed 1p down at 414p, and Standard's fell 3p to 710p. Observer, Page 15</p>

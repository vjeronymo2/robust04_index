			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 5 Jan (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Benrd  Niehaus said today the Costa Rican Government will not allow  local groups to recruit men to reinforce the rebels who began a  rebellion in southern Mexico on 1 January.    Niehaus downplayed the importance of an announcement  released  by the self-styled Autonomous Movement of Guanacaste for Bread,  Work, and Dignity [Movimiento Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan,  Trabajo, y Dignidad], which said it was willing to recruit  fighters to go to that country.    The foreign minister, remarking that the group is  meaningless  in Costa Rica, said "the statement lacks seriousness."    Nevertheless, he warned that if evidence should indicate  that  any Costa Rican organization is involved in plans to support the  armed conflict in Mexico, the government will order the  appropriate investigations.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Free markets better than political intervention Sir, Joe Rogaly might be correct in assuming unfettered and unregulated free trade may have some disadvantages in the baby milk market ('Sour milk and apple pie', December 7). But, leaving aside the argument that European mothers are capable of making their own choices without being nannied by politicians, are not trade barriers also responsible for many problems? According to the World Bank, richer countries' trade restraints against products from poorer ones cost the latter more than they receive in aid. European quotas on Japanese cars effectively prevent the import of small, low-cost, economical and low-pollution micro-cars of the type which no European manufacturer produces. The Common Agricultural Policy pushes up food prices in a way which disproportionately hits poorer people. Britain's protection of the indigenous coal industry has exacerbated air pollution and harmed peoples' health. The point is that while free markets may not produce perfect outcomes, they tend to be a great deal less imperfect than intervention by politicians, however well-meaning.

Helmut Steinel, who is responsible for relations  with the Council of Ministers in the Secretariat General, gives  two main reasons for that: The Bundestag elections in the  middle of the term of the presidency, which goes to Bonn during  the second half of the year as part of the rotation, and the  problems of scarce funds.    Steinel sees virtually no chance until the year 1999 for  reducting the German net contribution to the European Union --  according to the Commission, all in all about 23 billion German  marks [DM] -- that FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel has  demanded. Until then, the financial distribution is determined  by the decisions made at the summit in Edinburgh at the end of  1992. Only afterwards could there be an easing of the burden on  the Germans, in particular when the transition period expires  for the four would-be members (Sweden, Austria, Norway,  Finland), during which their usual net contribution (about DM3  billion) will be halved.    In Steinel's view, until then German payments to Brussels  can  be reduced only by saving more than in the past in the European  Union. However, the Commission official is "skeptical regarding  the will" of the 12 members "to save." For him it would already  be a "success" of the German presidency, "if no new items for  expenditure would be created."    This, however, is in contradiction with the central tasks in  the second half of the year: The implementation of the  proposals by EU President Jacques Delors (white paper) to combat  unemployment. With regard to the planned infrastructure  projects, Steinel primarily expects "financing by the private  sector" with, at best, minor interest subsidies from Brussels'  coffers. In total, the preliminary draft of the Commission for  the 1955 EU budget (German share: 28.4 percent) contains only  ECU300 million (about DM550 million) for the white paper  project. The budget, which amounts to DM137 billion this year,  is to increase by 3.4 percent in 1995. A total of 58 percent of  that is allocated to agricultural policy.    Regarding this by far largest block of expenditures in  particular, Bonn has "not always advocated saving" in the past.  Thus, the protection of German farmers from the effects of the  currency turbulence on agricultural prices last year cost the  European Union about DM2 billion.    Steinel does see one initiative to be started by future EU  President Helmut Kohl: The chancellor wants to make his  European affairs adviser Juergen Trumpf, state secretary in the  Foreign Ministry, the new secretary general of the Council of  Ministers -- "a very influential position."</p>

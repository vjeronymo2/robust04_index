			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Claude Juncker, minister of finance, </F> budget, and labor: "Dreams and Objectives"]    [Text] The hypothesis being advanced by growth fanatics  that 3 percent growth is sufficient to overcome unemployment is  not one with which we can go along. Unless there is strong  growth, the labor market will not recover. However, an increase  in growth alone will not be enough.    In addition, we partly rebuff the view -- widespread in  employers' circles -- that only a radical reduction in wage  costs might result in an increase of jobs. On 1 July,  incidental labor costs will be reduced by 2 billion Luxembourg  francs [LFr] a year. Reductions in taxes and incidental costs  will mean a saving of LFr30 billion over the next five years,  and taxes are not expected to rise. However, managing costs  alone will not be enough either.    Strong economic growth and low incidental wage costs are the  preconditions for preventing any further deterioration of the  labor market. Consequently, only those parties with proven  economic and financial competence may be allowed to come to  power and form a government. Small parties with half-baked  platforms and unrealistic concepts may enable irritated voters  to vent their dissatisfaction, but if they come to power, our  country will be worse off.    Economic growth and a healthy cost-related situation cannot  stem the tide of unemployment by themselves. What is required  in addition are complementary policies of the kind called for  not only by the government, but by all the partners.    In the first instance, we must help existing labor market  policy instruments to make speedy progress. There is no use in  repeatedly adopting new laws and offering fresh forms of support  for the labor market. We must make greater efforts to bring the  broad-ranging series of instruments at our disposal into effect.  We must be more efficient in informing employers about the  forms of aid available to them when they hire unemployed  individuals. In recent years -- and I say this quite  self-critically -- the efforts made by the Ministry of Labor to  provide such information were insufficient.    Many employers still do not know that they can apply for the  reimbursement of their ancillary labor costs if they take on  older, jobless individuals or the long-term unemployed. Many  employers still do not know about state contributions to wages  when they sign up young, unemployed people.    We shall make every conceivable effort to bring unemployed  people in out of the cold. We will provide better information,  but employers must also react more positively. Our unemployed  should first be given a chance, before the labor markets in the  border region have been emptied of their potential.    In order to give our unemployed greater opportunities, we  will extend the offer of retraining and specialized training  courses. At present 400 unemployed individuals are undergoing  retraining. This figure must be increased. We shall see that it  does. We will not tolerate seeing unemployed people turning a  deaf ear to this extended offer.    However, we must also go down new avenues. Part-time work  needs a considerable shot in the arm. When full-time jobs are  shared new employment opportunities are created. We must be  open to all kinds of part-time work: half-time work, the  four-day workweek, the six-hour day, the eight-month working  year, etc. Many people here in our country are waiting for  offers of part-time work. Employers must create them, and the  trade unions must include them in their lists of demands. The  state must help part-time work -- and not just half-time work --  to make a breakthrough in all sectors of public service.    Remote working [Tele-Arbeit] and distance working  [Fernarbeit] -- i.e. working at home -- must gain a foothold in  our economic system, for it gives employees, especially parents  bringing up their children, the chance to go about their work  within their own four walls. It also enables employees in rural  areas to overcome the mobility barrier. We will award distance  work fiscally and protect it under labor law against abuse.    Moving into new territory also means that we have to provide  the labor market with the satisfaction of modern requirements.  Jobs, new jobs are everywhere: Employment opportunities in the  socially relevant fields of care for the elderly, neighbor  support, child care, and recreational activity have been  unnoticed for years    Moving into new territory also means securing work for those  who gain no professional qualifications, in spite of all the  school reforms. For decades we have been replacing people by  robots. In so doing, we have pulled the carpet from underneath  the feet of the nonqualified worker. We must gradually start  replacing robots with people who need work, thereby putting them  back on their feet again.    We will certainly not manage to restore full employment by  the end of the decade. As desirable as this objective of work  for all may be, it will remain an unfulfilled dream. However,  our concern for people and respect for their dignity obliges us  all to work untiringly toward this goal.    All our concerns are important, but none is as important as  this one.</p>

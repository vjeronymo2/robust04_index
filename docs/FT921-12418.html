			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Justinian: Limits of criminal justice When the Lord Chief Justice observed that three officers from the Surrey police who in 1974 were involved in the arrest and questioning of the Guildford Four 'must have lied' about their recording of the accused's confessions to the planting of bombs in two public houses in Guildford and Woolwich, there was a reflex public reaction. The general mood was that the three police officers should instantly be prosecuted for a wicked offence. The prosecuting authority responded by charging them with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The decision of a Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate that inordinate delay  -17 years - in bringing the officers to justice, combined with contemporary prejudicial publicity, would render any trial unfair was reversed last week by the High Court. It held that the decision of the magistrate was so unreasonable that no reasonable magistrate could sensibly have so decided. It ordered the reinstatement of the charges and directed Bow Street magistrates' court to go ahead with committal proceedings. If committed for trial, the officers case should be heard by judge and jury before the end of 1992. Irrational as the decision of the magistrate might have been, there is no guarantee that the jury at trial may not share the magistrate's instinctive revulsion at the prospect of justice being far too long delayed for the comfort of a civilised society. The jury's verdict - irrational or not - will be unassailable. The magistrate's decision is judicially reviewable; a jury's verdict is not. The police officers will face one of two outcomes: conviction or acquittal. Is criminal justice a sensible instrument to deploy to find out precisely why the 1974 prosecution produced such a substantial miscarriage of justice? Long before there was ever any question of a criminal prosecution of any police officer, the government had ordered a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the convictions arising out of the bomb attacks in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Sir John May, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, began the inquiry and in July 1990 published his interim report. In it he concluded that the scientific evidence at the trial was flawed in ways which seriously undermined the prosecutions. The prosecution had been based almost entirely on forensic evidence which sought to establish that there were traces of nitro-glycerine on the hands of six of the accused, and on the gloves of the seventh. It sought to prove that the presence of such traces was consistent only with the deliberate handling of explosives. Sir John May recommended that the Home Secretary should refer the convictions to the Court of Appeal. This was done on July 12 1990. When the case was heard by the Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions conceded that on the issue of innocent contamination, the convictions could not be sustained. The appeal hearing led inevitably to the quashing of the convictions, in the course of which the authenticity of the confessions was challenged by the appellants. Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, made the statement that prompted the prosecution of the three police officers. Simultaneously, Sir John May re-opened his inquiry. In June 1991 he began public hearings with a view to identifying areas of potential criticism of the Home Office in relation to its handling of the case. He pointed to the requirement of the Home Office to refer cases to the Court of Appeal only where there was new evidence or a new consideration of substantial significance. He questioned the practice of limiting any review of alleged miscarriages of justice. The Home Secretary at the time, Mr Douglas Hurd, gave evidence last year to Sir John May in which he readily conceded that the system of executive review by the Home Office was less than satisfactory. Throughout the public hearings, and in his own private deliberations, Sir John was forced to exclude from his inquiries anything that touched on the criminal investigations which had been undertaken by the Surrey Police in 1974. To have done so would have been regarded as potentially influencing the outcome of the prosecution of the three police officers. Sir John was bound to defer any consideration of the serious allegations about police intimidation of witnesses and the suppression of alibi evidence. But by the time the police officers are tried, the public's taste for yet another trawling over the criminal investigations and the final reporting by Sir John May - by then probably 20 years after the event - will have been satiated. And if the officers are acquitted, who would favour a rerun of the events which have been scrutinised by the jury? Is there not a strong case for the thoroughness of a public inquiry, uninhibited by the elaborate procedural safeguards of a criminal trial, rather than the use of the heavy hand of a criminal trial? Criminal justice is a cumbersome and costly process, designed to punish the perpetrators of crime. It satisfies a proper public desire to control crime by way of focusing on defined criminal events, but its function involves only a limited exercise in determining individual criminal responsibility. The criminal trial is unconcerned with unmasking the often troubling circumstances that relate to the conduct of public authorities and agencies in the prosecution process. Public disquiet about such matters can be allayed only by processes other than those of criminal justice. Is there not a strong case for the thoroughness of a public inquiry?</p>

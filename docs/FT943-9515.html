			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Cuts promised in electricity prices: Consumer bills set to fall by Pounds 2.5bn over five years under power revenue controls Savings totalling Pounds 2.5bn for electricity users in England and Wales over the next five years will be promised today by the industry's regulator as he unveils price controls that are likely to disappoint consumer groups but please investors. Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the regulatory body Offer, says his proposals imply reductions of Pounds 12-Pounds 16 in average household electricity bills in the year from next April. This is equivalent to at least 4 per cent. The controls will cut allowed charges in the 12 regional electricity companies' distribution businesses by 11-17 per cent in the year from April 1995, or an average of about 14 per cent, and will restrict price rises to 2 percentage points below inflation in each of the following four years. Distribution charges make up more than a quarter of the typical electricity bill. Analysts were last night predicting that share prices of most of the 12 companies would rise since the controls were less severe than many had feared. Most believe it unlikely that any of the companies will challenge the price formulae through the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Prof Littlechild's price restrictions represent a significant tightening of the controls that have been in place since the industry's privatisation four years ago. The controls have allowed the regional companies to increase distribution charges by up to 2.5 per cent above the rate of inflation. Leaked letters from Prof Littlechild's office in the spring prompted analysts to suggest that allowed charges could be cut by as much as 30 per cent next April with rises in subsequent years restricted to inflation minus 4 percentage points. In his 118-page report, to be released today, Prof Littlechild says tightening of the controls will lead to savings of about Pounds 70-Pounds 90 over the five-year period for the average household. The Pounds 2.5bn he says will result from the control changes will be shared by all consumers, including large companies. Prof Littlechild also argues that the companies whose allowed revenue will fall by 17 per cent in the first year will then be on the equivalent of an inflation minus 7.5 percentage points formula over each year of the five-year period. The companies suffering an initial 14 per cent reduction in allowable revenue will be on the annual equivalent of inflation minus 6.5 percentage points, and those suffering 11 per cent cuts will be on the equivalent of inflation minus 5.5 points. Electricity companies will use these figures to argue that their formula is one of the toughest reviews by a regulator. But consumer organisations and opposition parties are likely to feel the controls fail to redress the balance between power users and shareholders who have benefited from profit growth. The stock market is initially likely to identify Manweb in north-west England, Newcastle-based Northern Electric and Swalec in south Wales as the losers since their allowed revenues are being cut by 17 per cent.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / People: Thorn executive switches to B&amp;J After the shareholder-inspired board room shake-up at Brown and Jackson in February, the group, which runs the Poundstretcher discount retail chain, has now appointed a new finance director. He is Robert Ellis, who used to work for the rental division of Thorn EMI, the consumer electronics company. It can be no coincidence that Ian Gray, who was brought in as chief executive in February by institutional shareholders, was formerly in charge of Thorn's UK rental division. Gray says B&amp;J now has 'the management structure, the skills and the experience' to exploit the group's strengths. The former finance director, Mike Kerrison, is staying on the board, and Henry Bliss is dropping the post of corporate development director but taking up a new role in the group.</p>

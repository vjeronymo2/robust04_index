			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Kiss goodbye to the Christmas holly, too Sir, Reflecting on David Richardson's informative and amusing article (Farmer's Viewpoint, December 20) on the rise and fall of the mistletoe futures market, I suggest it may spark off frantic scenes at Tenbury Auction during the run-up to next Christmas - international traders talking urgently into their mobiles and giving knowing winks towards the gavel as another couple of pounds of the precious twigs and berries pass over the trading floor. Aside from all that, I wonder if Mr Richardson could enlighten me on any EU rules regarding the possibility of grubbing up my holly bush. This is the second year in a row it has failed to produce a single berry. I am seriously considering a set aside policy for that part of the garden. This Christmas we have again had to buy the stuff. French, I suspect] Oliver Chastney, 53 Keswick Road, Cringleford, Norwich, Norfolk</p>

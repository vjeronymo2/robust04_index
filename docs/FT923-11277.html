			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: An option to share THE SAVINGS product with the best risk/reward ratio of all will be losing a little of its glitter on October 1. This nonpareil is the little-publicised savings-related share option. With Inland Revenue approval, employees are offered options to buy shares in their company at a price fixed when the options are granted and which is usually 80 per cent of the market price at that time. The options become 'exercisable' - convertible into shares - either five or seven years later. As a condition of receiving this option, an employee must enter into a savings contract, the ultimate proceeds of which will pay for the optioned shares at the 80 per cent initial price. Under these SAYE contracts - offered by a range of building societies and banks as well as the Department of National Savings - monthly contributions are deducted from salary for five years. The saver must decide at the outset whether he wants to withdraw his money at the end of that period or leave it in for a further two years to accrue extra interest. Either way, the related share option can only be exercised in the six months following the cash withdrawal date. Interest on the SAYE contract is paid in the form of a tax-free terminal bonus. This currently amounts to 15 monthly contributions after five years and 30 if the money is left in for a further two years, working out at compound annual rates of return of 8.86 per cent and 9.15 per cent respectively. The Government has now decided to pare back on this terminal bonus. Employees who sign up after September 30 will find the bonus cut from 15 to 12 monthly payments after five years and from 30 to 25 after seven years. This will equate to annual interest of 7.5 per cent and 7.38 per cent - much more in line with prevailing market rates. For a stand-alone investment these would be generous yields. Perhaps the best comparison is with the National Savings Yearly Plan which pays out 8 per cent per annum at the end of a five-year period - but the overall attraction is enormously enhanced by the added component of the linked share option. If the share price performs so dismally that by the time of exercise it has fallen below the 80 per cent starting mark, then the holder will allow the option to lapse and be content with his tax-free bonus. But, as the table shows, even if the price has done no more than tread water during the option period there will be a useful capital gain to add to the overall return. And if the shares actually move ahead, the employee's pay-off goes into overdrive. Wellcome provides a topical example. Wellcome employees in 1986 were offered options to buy shares five years hence at Pounds 1.29. Saving at Pounds 50 per month cost Pounds 3,000 in total, and rendered a fund of Pounds 3,700 - and therefore a right to buy 2,868 shares. That means that Pounds 3,000 bought those lucky employees the right to buy shares currently worth around Pounds 24,000. Investors who hope to lock-in to the current rates of return before September 30 are likely to find that the matter is out of their hands. More than 1,000 companies operate savings-related share option schemes and, in the past three years, 1.3m employees have been granted options over shares worth Pounds 2.1bn. Far more could have taken advantage of this gilt-edged opportunity. Participation is open to all full-time staff who have completed a qualifying period of up to five years employment but in practice, take-up rates tend to be well below 50 per cent and often as low as 10 per cent. Those who do seize the opportunity rarely make the most of it. The average contribution is less than Pounds 50 per month whereas the statutory maximum was raised last year from Pounds 150 to Pounds 250. So a top saver can pay in Pounds 15,000 (60 x Pounds 250) which, if left for the full seven years, will currently attract a bonus of Pounds 7,500 (30 x Pounds 250). Assuming the usual 20 per cent price discount, this Pounds 22,500 cash fund will allow for an option over Pounds 28,125 worth of shares. The new rates will reduce this to Pounds 26,562. The only section of the workforce which can almost always be relied on to save to the hilt is the board of directors. Directors and other senior managers will usually participate in their own exclusive executive option scheme, but they can top up with savings-related options. Although executives earning more than Pounds 25,000 pa cannot hold options over shares worth more than four times salary, savings-related options fall outside this limit. Hence, there is nothing to stop a director on a Pounds 50,000 salary from being granted a Pounds 200,000 executive option and, in addition, a Pounds 28,125 (reducing from October 1 to Pounds 26,562) SAYE option. Companies contemplating an imminent issue under a savings-related scheme would be well-advised to try to beat the October 1 deadline. By doing so they will enhance staff benefits at no cost whatever to themselves. But sadly many will be constrained by scheme rules. David Cohen is a partner in the City law firm Paisner &amp; Co.</p>

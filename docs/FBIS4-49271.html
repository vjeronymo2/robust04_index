			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Bill Hayden,  governor-general of Australia, said here today that he was  deeply impressed by the great achievements that China has scored  in its drive of opening to the outside world and economic  reforms.    Hayden said this in a meeting with visiting vice-chairman  Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), who  is leading a NPC delegation on a visit to the South Pacific  nation.    Hayden said that he hoped China would continue to cooperate  with Australia in the fields of agriculture and husbandry and  increase its trade volume in agricultural produces.    The Australian governor-general just returned back from his  nine-day official visit to China, where he had meetings with  President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders.    Tian, expressing his appreciation for the contributions  Hayden has made to the Sino-Aussie friendship, said that Hayden  is an old friend of the Chinese people.    Tian said that both China and Australia are big countries in  the Asia-Pacific region and can play an important role in  development and in safeguarding peace and stability in the  region.    He also said that the potential for cooperation is great  between the two countries as China is a large nation with over a  billion population and Australia is a large country boasting  rich resources.    Tian said that the deepening of China's reforms would offer  opportunities for further increasing bilateral trade.    Tian also conveyed regards from Chinese President Jiang  Zemin  to Hayden, who asked Tian to convey his best wish to Jiang.    Tian arrived in Australia on Tuesday [3 May] for a week-long  visit to the country, the last leg of his four-nation  South-Pacific trip, which has already taken him to New Zealand,  Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea.    In the morning today, Tian also had meetings with Rick  Farley, executive director of the National Farmers' Federation,  Andrew Peacock, shadow minister for foreign affairs of the  opposition, and Tim Fisher of the leader of the National Party.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MANDELA MEMOIR RIGHTS BOUGHT  </P> <P> The world rights to Nelson R. Mandela's memoirs have been acquired by Little,  Brown and Co., the company said today.  </P> <P> Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was released from a  South African prison three months ago after nearly 28 years in jail.  </P> <P> A week and a half after his release, he met at his home in Soweto with William  D. Phillips, vice president and editor in chief of Little, Brown, the company  said. Mandela's lawyers, the London firm of Meer, Care and Desai, then  negotiated on Mandela's behalf to conclude the agreement.  </P> <P> Phillips said in a statement that the book, not yet titled, will be a political  memoir about his fight against apartheid and a personal story. It is planned  for publication in 1992.  </P> <P> "We don't know how or where this book will end," Phillips said. "This is not a  man in retirement."  </P> <P> The statement did not say how much Mandela would receive for the memoirs.  </P></p>

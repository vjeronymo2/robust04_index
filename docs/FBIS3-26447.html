			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149  1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (XINHUA) -- The national conference  on propaganda and ideological work ended in Beijing today after  a six-day session. The meeting pointed out that we must firmly  adhere to the basic guideline -- namely, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics --  focus on economic construction, obey and serve the general  requirements set for the whole party, and carry out all  assignments for the propaganda and ideological front so as to  provide powerful ideological support and a good environment  needed to speed the establishment of a socialist market economic  system; achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic  development; maintain political stability; and accelerate  progress in all sectors of society.    Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat  of the CPC Central Committee and head of its Propaganda  Department, addressed today's session, which was chaired by Li  Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  and state councillor.    In his speech, Ding Guangen pointed out: The conference on  propaganda and ideological work held at this crucial period has  a significant bearing on the overall situation. It is a meeting  held at a time when the Central Committee, following the  principle of being firm in attending to ideological and  political work while proceeding with economic construction, is  mobilizing the whole party and all propaganda and ideological  workers to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts,  intensify and improve propaganda and ideological work, and do an  even better job in expediting socialist material and spiritual  construction. This meeting has helped us to understand the  situation more clearly, heighten our awareness, achieve a  consensus of views, understand our assignments, and increase our  confidence. We believe that this meeting will have a positive  and significant impact on improving our propaganda and  ideological work, creating a new situation, and accomplishing  the Central Committee's assignments more effectively.    Ding Guangen said: The basic guidelines, basic principles,  concept of work, major tasks, and plans for propaganda and  ideological work today and in the time to come are clear. The  key requirement now is to make earnest efforts to comprehend and  implement the guidelines in the important speeches given by  leading comrades of the Central Committee, work earnestly, and  firmly accomplish all assignments.    Ding Guangen said: At this conference General Secretary  Jiang    Zemin has further expounded the main assignments for  propaganda and ideological work. He pointed out that comrades  on the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to  the basic guideline -- building socialism with Chinese  characteristics -- and underscore work in four areas: theory,  the media, ideological education, and the main theme [zhu xuan  lu 0031 2467 1774], namely the work of "arming the people with  scientific theories, guiding them with correct public opinion,  moulding them with lofty spirit, and inspiring them with  outstanding works." He said: The concept of "one basic  guideline and work in four respects" which Comrade Jiang Zemin  presented is the general plan and strategic thinking for  intensifying propaganda and ideological work while building a  new socialist market economic system. This concept embodies the  past and present experiences China has gained from doing  propaganda and ideological work during the period of socialist  construction, it expounds the objective requirements which the  law for socialist modernization has set for propaganda and  ideological work, and it firmly grasps major propaganda and  ideological issues having a close bearing on the overall  situation. As far as the propaganda and ideological front is  concerned, the basic guideline is the soul that sets the course  of all our work, and the work in four areas is characterized by  the four major construction projects embodying the basic  guideline and projects that enable this guideline to succeed.  When they uphold this basic guideline and accomplish the four  major construction projects, departments in charge of propaganda  and ideological work can accomplish their important missions  more effectively; correctly publicize the party's theory, lines,  principles, and polices; vividly reflect the people's great  accomplishments; and unite all forces that can be united to  fight and achieve the magnificient objective of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Ding Guangen noted: To accomplish the assignments of the  propaganda and ideological front and upgrade our work, we must  continue to emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, and  follow the course of reform and opening up. The reform of  propaganda and ideological work should be compatible with the  requirements for developing the socialist market economy and  socialist modernization, and it should be in line with socialist  spiritual construction and the law of the development of  propaganda and cultural undertakings themselves. Many things  should be done in reforming propaganda and ideological work. In  light of the current situation, it is urgent that we work hard  in the following areas: First, we must uphold the principle  that, in spiritual construction, we must place emphasis on  construction instead of "launching movements" and carrying out  "mass criticism" as in the past. Second, we must implement the  principle of doing our work democratically and providing  guidance. This means that we must respect people, understand  them, and care about them so that we can arouse their  initiative. Third, we must fully count on social forces and  take advantage of the modern mass media. Fourth, we must  intensify macroscopic control of propaganda and cultural  undertakings, paying attention to guidance, total supply and  demand [zong liang 4920 6852], mix of undertakings, and results,  so that propaganda and cultural undertakings can be even more  compatible with the needs of society. Fifth, we must make  positive efforts to develop a socialist cultural market and make  sure that it will develop healthily and thrive. Sixth, we must  pay attention to research, and we must learn from foreign  countries' outstanding cultures, achievements, and experiences  in managing their cultural undertakings. Seventh, we must  reform the management of our propaganda and cultural  undertakings. Eighth, we must be more management conscious and  speed the institutionalization and standardization of propaganda  and cultural work so that there are regulations to follow. In  short, the reform of propaganda and cultural undertakings must  be conducted in a manner that enables the party to strengthen  and improve its leadership over propaganda and culture, enables  propaganda and cultural workers to bring their initiative and  creativity into play, that furthers the prosperity of propaganda  and cultural undertakings, and that furthers material and  spiritual construction.    To implement effectively the guidelines laid down by the  conference, Ding Guangen stressed: We should assist propaganda  and ideological work and not create trouble for it, sing the  main theme and not create "noise," pay attention to social  results and not to gains at the expense of integrity, abide by  propaganda discipline and not do things our own way, centralize,  not decentralize, our efforts, and do solid, not superficial,  work.    Ding Guangen pointed out: To carry out all assignments put  forth by the party Central Committee, the propaganda and  ideological front must have a contingent of good cadres. To be  qualified propaganda and ideological cadres, we must have strong  enterprising spirit and a high sense of responsibility. We must  keep firmly in mind the need to consider Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the  basic guideline, uphold the party's basic line without wavering,  and maintain unity with the party Central Committee politically  and ideologically as well as in action. We must consider the  interests of the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly. We  must be politically sharp, sober-minded, and take clear-cut  stands. We must uphold dialectical materialism and guard  against one-sidedness. We must be involved in discussing and  handling important matters and keep the overall situation in  mind. We must be broad-minded and able to promote unity. We  must conduct in-depth investigation and be good at summing up  experiences. When we work, we must make sure that actual  results will be achieved. We must be strict with ourselves and  perform our duties honestly. We must study hard and think  diligently.    Ding Guangen stressed: Comrades working on the propaganda  and ideological front must rally closely around the party  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, persist  in regarding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the basic guideline,  uphold the party's basic line for 100 years without wavering,  strive to achieve unity and stability, exert great efforts, and  do our work pragmatically. We must have a clear idea of  general requirements, seize opportunity, boost morale, and  proceed with an exploratory spirit. We must emancipate our  minds, seek truth from facts, be down to earth, and work hard so  that our propaganda and ideological work can reach a new level  and can can create a new situation and make fresh contributions.    When the conference was in session, those in attendence  studied the important speeches of Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,  and Zhu Rongji, studied Deng Xiaoping's expositions on socialist  spiritual construction, and discussed propaganda and ideological  projects for 1994.    Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, and other leading comrades  attended  today's session.</p>

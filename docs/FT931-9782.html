			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roller-coaster ride in Italian equities POLITICAL trepidation in Italy, and French interest in the recently-embattled Euro-equity stocks were the main features in bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN calmed itself at the start of the new trading day with domestic institutions and overseas investors apparently ready to put Wednesday's traumas behind them. But prices again turned down as the market was convulsed by rumours that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato was under investigation in the political corruption scandal that forced Mr Claudio Martelli to resign as justice minister. A firm denial of the story by the Milan magistrate who heads the investigation enabled prices to pick up from their lows, but it did not overcome renewed nervousness in the market and the Comit index fell again, closing 8.63 lower at 487.52. The roller-coaster ride taken by the Fiat share price tracked the day's political events. The shares picked up to an early high of L4,625 before easing back to fix L10 firmer at L4,591. In after-hours trading, the price dipped to a low of L4,460 at the height of the Amato rumours before pulling back up to L4,520. State groups facing privatisation were also hit by the spectre of political instability that could put the government's programme in jeopardy. Credito Italiano fell L200 or 6 1/2 per cent to fix at L2,853. PARIS recovered the 1,900 level with interest centred on Euro Disney and Eurotunnel, the latter having shown strong volume all week. The CAC-40 index closed up 12.20 at 1,905.27, after a day's high of 1,920.07, in good turnover of FFr3.5bn. Euro Disney attracted investors in spite of comments from the group that it expects a 'substantial loss' for fiscal 1992/93. However, some analysts said that many institutions were now looking further ahead and saw the group benefiting from lower European interest rates. The shares rose FFr1.40 to FFr76.00, but off the day's high of FFr77.90. Eurotunnel gained FFr1.25 to FFr38.15 in good volume. Bancaire came off early lows after reporting a 57 per cent decline in 1992 net attributable profit to finish up FFr12.50 at FFr462.70 as investors turned their attention to the current year. The financial sector was generally firmer on expectations of privatisations, should there be a change of government next month. Societe Generale gained FFr14 to FFr630, Paribas rose FFr8.30 to FFr406.50 and Suez advanced FFr2.30 to FFr286.90. FRANKFURT edged up to its highest close since last July 21, the DAX ending 1.24 better at 1,651.05. Of the 30 DAX shares, 15 were higher by Thursday's closing, while 14 were lower and one was unchanged. Turnover was DM6.5bn down from Wednesday's DM8.2bn. The DAX got its impetus largely from carmakers, engineers, and steels, all of which have seen downbeat comment from analysts in recent days. As BMW rose DM4 to DM514.50, and Volkswagen DM2.40 to DM294.90, James Capel was sending out a morning letter which commented on the collapse in European January car registrations: while the sector has outperformed since end-December, it said, trading conditions in the automotive industry are deteriorating faster that any time during the current recession. Engineers included a DM8.50 gain to DM779 for Linde while steels saw Thyssen DM3.20 better at DM180.20. According to Mr John Longhurst of James Capel, all empirical evidence suggests that although the fall in foreign demand for capital goods is showing signs of stabilising at a lower level, domestic demand - where margins are high - continues to deteriorate, and rapidly. MADRID returned to the upgrade on growing expectations of an interest rate cut, the general index closing 3.28 higher at 237.54. Turnover was around Pta28bn and gains included Pta35 to Pta1,355 for Telefonica and, among the debt-burdened electrical utilities, Endesa Pta205 higher at Pta4,220. Banesto reversed on consideration of its rights issue terms, losing Pta120 at Pta2,315. ZURICH struggled to find direction before some late buying took the SMI index 7.1 higher to 2,127.9. AMSTERDAM improved as investors again bought Royal Dutch and Akzo. The oil group, up Fl 1.30 at Fl 156.80, has been helped by speculation ahead of Saturday's meeting of Opec. Akzo rose another Fl 3.10 to Fl 149.50 on a number of buy recommendations. ISTANBUL was active in the electricity sector and the 75-share index closed above the 5,000 level, up 190 at 5,133.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 11                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1124.78      1123.88     1121.94     1122.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1176.43      1175.99     1174.03     1176.27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1123.57      1124.13     1127.67     1126.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1176.77      1175.21     1178.66     1175.45  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 10     Feb 9     Feb 8     Feb 5     Feb 4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1121.50   1124.14   1131.12   1129.52   1113.35 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1171.08   1177.40   1190.15   1189.21   1183.60  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1127.67; 200 - 1178.78 Low/day: 100 - 1121.15 200 - 1173.63.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

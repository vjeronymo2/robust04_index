			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japanese Naval `Self-Defence Force' Brings Fleet Close to </F> Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Naval  "Self- Defence Force" is reportedly moving its fleet to Kure  Port in the western part of Japan from Yokosuka Port on the  Pacific Coast.    The U.S. paper DEFENSE NEWS May 9, reporting this, said that  this is designed to make a thrust without difficulty on the East  Sea of Korea "in case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula.    The Japan Defense Agency officials tried to find an excuse  for this, saying that "part of the warships are being  transferred because of a jam at Yokosuka Port", but military  experts view that the transfer of the fleet was aimed at an easy  access of the fleet of Japan to the East Sea waters of Korea in  "the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, the paper  said.    The paper disclosed that the Japanese Dietmen are expected  to  deliberate on an amendment to the "law on the Self-Defence  Forces" allowing the deployment of Armed Forces on the Korean  peninsula under the pretext of protecting the Japanese residents  in South Korea in "the event of contingency" on the Korean  peninsula.    The Japanese reactionaries are now steeped in the moves to  stifle the DPRK in league with the United States over the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, working hard to realise its design  to stage a comeback to Korea.</p>

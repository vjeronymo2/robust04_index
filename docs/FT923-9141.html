			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Shell income tumbles by 26% ROYAL Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, yesterday reported a 26 per cent fall in second-quarter net income to Pounds 481m (Dollars 918.7m) excluding inventory gains and losses. Over the first half, net income measured on the same current cost basis fell 24 per cent to Pounds 1.44bn, on sales down 4 per cent at Pounds 34.43bn. A second-quarter improvement in upstream profits from a higher crude oil price was offset by a reduction in downstream margins and further falls in chemicals as a result of weak economic demand. The figures included Pounds 216m of non-operating profits, most of which related to sales of assets and the settlement of tax affairs in the US. These special gains were only partly offset by foreign exchange currency losses of Pounds 102m which were also included in the net income figures. The comparative figures for the second quarter of 1991 were a Pounds 21m gain from special non-operating profits and a currency gain of Pounds 120m. Royal Dutch/Shell said these special benefits were exceptionally high and unlikely to be repeated this year. The group's net income including inventory gains rose 8 per cent in the second quarter to Pounds 576m and 4 per cent over the first half to Pounds 1.44m. Royal Dutch's share of group net income in the first half rose from Fl 5.60 per share to Fl 5.71; Shell Transport's share rose from 14.3p to 14.8p per share. The dividends for the two parent companies will be set on September 10. Cash flow from operations in the first half fell from Pounds 3.73bn to Pounds 3.06bn, with the swing arising largely from a sharp increase in working capital utilised. Capital spending and exploration costs in the first half fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn. The group's share of crude oil production from its own and shared ventures rose 7 per cent to 2.15m barrels a day while natural gas volumes were 8 per cent higher at 7.1bn cu ft a day. In chemicals, group earnings fell from Pounds 101m to Pounds 3m in the first half with the main losses outside the US and heavy inventory losses in both quarters. Lex, Page 14</p>

Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds spoke in positive  terms when commenting on the state of the negotiations after  discussions with Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) in  Dublin. Aho began the official part of his visit to Ireland  yesterday.    Reynolds admitted that problems had arisen in the  negotiations, but that they are no different from those of other  countries. In his view, the negotiations have progressed well.    The negotiations must be completed by the end of February at  the latest if Finland and the other aspiring members are to be  able to become members of the EU at the beginning of next year.  Reynolds told FINSKA NOTISBYRAN that the timetable is a tight  one. However, he considers that enough has already been  achieved in the negotiations with the result that people are  bound to be able to find solutions to the remaining problems.    The trickiest issue in Finland's EU negotiations is  agriculture. Reynolds considers Finland's aims moderate. In  his view the EU Commission has produced a good analysis of the  problems and that it will be possible to find a solution on the  basis of this.    Ireland is a warm supporter of an enlargement of the  European  Union. Reynolds believes that the Union should not be  restricted to embracing only 12 members.    Aho's visit is official. The welcoming ceremony at Dublin  airport was reminiscent of the reception given to heads of  state. This can be explained by the fact that the prime  minister, "Taioseach" in Irish, is in practice head of state in  the Irish political system.    Immediately after his discussions with Reynolds, Aho held  talks with Industry Minister Ruairi Quinn, who is the foreign  minister's deputy. In the afternoon Aho had several meetings at  the parliament building. In the evening he delivered an address  on Finland's traditional international position at a gathering  at the Irish Institute for European Policy.    In addition to his discussions Aho also had a more  lightweight program. He visited a genuine Irish public house  and was given a glass of Ireland's "national drink," Guinness.</p>

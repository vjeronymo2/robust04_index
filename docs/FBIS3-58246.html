			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Deane, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] A joint Army and police base in Northern Ireland was  rocked by an explosion early today (Tuesday).    A number of people were injured in the blast at the base at  Crossmaglen, South Armagh, at around 12.20 am.    No further details about the casualties were immediately  available, the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] said.    Yesterday evening a mortar bomb exploded at the base.    No-one was injured in that attack, but the area around the  heavily-fortified post was sealed off while Army bomb experts  carried out a search. The base was not evacuated.    Later an RUC spokesman said the blast came as military  personnel were attempting to recover the vehicle used in the  earlier mortar bomb attack.    The explosion happened inside the base. It is believed two  soldiers were injured in the attack, but the extent of their  injuries is not yet known.</p>

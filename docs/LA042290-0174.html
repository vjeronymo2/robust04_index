			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHICH IS THE BETTER INVESTMENT, REAL ESTATE OR THE STOCK MARKET? THE DEBATE  CONTINUES  </P> <P> Regarding "Real Estate vs. Stocks: Which is Better," no argument when you buy  rental property so that the rents always cover the debt service and you have  tax benefits from the debt service and depreciation.  </P> <P> However, one gives up liquidity to own real estate, which makes it sometimes  totally out of the question for retirees, small pension plans, etc. Also, if  the rents don't cover the cash flow or are interrupted, you have negative cash  flow. That's like buying IBM stock and paying them the dividend while you hope  it goes up in value. It also assumes one always "qualifies" for the loan, which  is not necessary with buying stock or mutual funds, let alone the hassles of  being a landlord.  </P> <P> Surveys point out that few people in this area can afford to buy a home. Couple  that with the downsizing of the defense industry employers and you have a  serious question about the (real estate) demand factor. Assumptions about  break-evens in rents or appreciation may not be as well founded as in the past.  Tried to sell a house lately?  </P> <P> RON SMITH  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

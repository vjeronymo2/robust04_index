			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Medeva There is more than one reason to be cautious about Medeva. Management is taking the right steps to prove that its recent profits warning was an isolated incident and to satisfy the US Food and Drug Administration that production facilities are up to scratch. But yesterday's figures show that Medeva is not immune from the problems afflicting its more established rivals. Prices paid by big US customers of its IMS subsidiary were lower in the first half of this year than last. The steady price cuts demanded of all drugs companies by the NHS will act as a drag on profits growth in the UK. Competition from cheap generic products held back profits in the first half. Even if Medeva can finally convince there is no chance of another nasty shock, these are reasons not to send the shares back to the dizzy multiple of old.</p>

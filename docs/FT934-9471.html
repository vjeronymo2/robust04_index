			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC set-aside policy not working say landowners THE European Community's policy of setting aside arable land to reduce cereal production is not working in many member states and is unfairly penalising countries like the UK, representatives of Britain's landowners said yesterday. The Country Landowners' Association (CLA) cited European Commission figures obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture showing that the EC grain harvest this year had fallen by just 1.1 per cent, even though the 1992 Common Agricultural Policy reforms required arable farmers to leave 15 per cent of their land idle each year to cut production. 'These figures show there's something seriously wrong with the policy,' said Mr George Dunn, the CLA's economist. A Commission official said latest estimates from EC grain producers showed the overall harvest down 1.4 per cent, with several countries showing an increase in production. He admitted: 'It's a mess.' The variations across the EC are huge. The UK cereal crop fell 11 per cent this year, while Irish output was down 16 per cent and French production fell by 8 per cent. But output was up 22 per cent in both Denmark and Spain, and German production rose nearly 3 per cent. The CLA said some of the variations could be explained by the fact that states like Denmark suffered very poor cereal yields last year. But the main problem was the exemption from set-aside of small farmers producing less than 92 tonnes of cereals a year, it said. 'We'd like to see the (European) Council (of Ministers) seriously considering reducing the 92-tonne limit so that the burden of set-aside would be shared more equally,' Mr Dunn said. 'The UK has a large proportion of large farms and its efficiency in farm structure is working against it.' The Commission argues that the exemption for small farmers is essential to prevent them from being driven off the land by falling incomes. Although Britain opposed the exemption at the time of the reforms, a senior official said yesterday that it was part of the deal and had to be accepted. He said the effectiveness of set-aside would be more fairly judged by taking an average of three to four years' post-reform production compared with a base period of, say, 1989-1992, rather than by comparing just two consecutive harvests. The first year of the five-year rotational set-aside scheme was expected to have less effect than subsequent years, since farmers initially leave their worst land fallow. The CLA said it was studying alternatives to the set-aside policy, which would move the farming industry towards a free market. One idea it is pursuing is the 'Tangermann bond', a lump sum payment that would mark the end of price support. Existing farmers would be entitled to receive the payment in the form of an annual allowance to supplement their income for a certain number of years. Alternatively, they could sell it to other farmers if they wished to leave the industry, the CLA said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Teach Eaglets To Fly"] </F>   [Text] Today is "1 June" International Children's Day, and  to our young friends in the country we send our warm  congratulations! We pay the highest tribute to the teachers,  parents, and persons in various circles in society who have  worked hard for the healthy growth of children!    In this joyful time as we celebrate "1 June" International  Children's Day, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has written an  inscription for the Young Pioneers of our country: "Learn  knowledge yourself, manage yourself, protect yourself,  strengthen yourself, discipline yourself, and be a qualified  builder of the socialist undertaking, as well as a successor to  it." This fully indicates the ardent expectations the CPC  Central Committee and the old revolutionaries have regarding the  next generation, and enables Young Pioneer workers in the whole  country to further pinpoint the duty and orientation of  education.    If China is to gain an edge in the trans-century  competition,  if the Chinese nation is to rise, and if millions of people are  to realize the great aspiration of building a strong and  modernized socialist country, the ultimate factor is the  emergence of millions of various kinds of professionals who have  integrity, knowledge, and good physique. In a modern society  where science and technology develop rapidly and competition of  various kinds is intensifying, people have a new understanding  of a capable person. A capable person's integrity includes not  only political awareness, of which the basic requirement is to  uphold the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points,"  healthy thinking and sense, and good morals and integrity, but  also a strong will, positive and rich sentiment, and voluntary  behavior conforming to legal and social norms. By knowledge we  mean that this can no longer be purely measured by the degree of  knowledge we possess; that is to say, one must not only have  extensive knowledge, but must also have the ability to acquire  knowledge and to transform knowledge into real productive  forces. By physique we do not merely mean the concept of a kind  of physical strength, but also include the strength to struggle  courageously, as well as a tenacious ability to endure.    However, real life is obviously different from people's  wishes and demands. Among some young students, there are still  certain acute problems and weaknesses, which cause concern  throughout society. Therefore, the topic of how we can follow  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's demand that "education must face  modernization, the world, and the future," to cultivate  students' all-round quality and enable them to shoulder the  important trans-century duty, is a strategic topic which badly  needs attention.    Precisely based on this kind of understanding, the All-China  Children and Juvenile Work Committee has launched a "Five  Self's" campaign among Young Pioneer organizations. "Five  Self's" means: Learn knowledge yourself--the cultivation of an  ability to voluntarily study and to acquire knowledge to become  a master of knowledge; manage yourself--learn how to  independently solve problems and difficulties in daily life and  to possess the basic ability to make a living and work; protect  yourself--understand the law, social norms, and common knowledge  of life so as to be able to protect one's legitimate rights and  intelligently and bravely handle difficulties and even dangers  one might run into; strengthen yourself--be adventurous and  confident, have a strong and persistent will, and have the  courage and ability to overcome difficulties; and discipline  yourself--voluntarily observe the standards of behavior of  primary and secondary school students and possess the ability to  restrain, regulate, and control one's own behavior.    Launching the "Five Self's" campaign is a basic project for  training of capable persons. It meets the characteristics and  needs of youngsters, and is needed for their healthy growth in  the future. Its direct purpose is to help children and  youngsters to learn how to become young masters of daily life  and to upgrade their sense and ability of living, learning,  working, and creating. "Five Self's" activities are activities  belonging to the children and youngsters themselves and is a  kind of training and learning, and its main principle is  practice, through which improvement is sought. Children and  youngsters are the main body and master of activities, and what  schools, teachers, and Young Pioneers workers have to do more of  is guidance work and work to pave the road and build bridges.    We believe that the inscription written by General Secretary  Jiang Zemin will certainly further arouse enthusiasm among  children and youngsters for participation and will enhance their  rich imaginations, positive enterprising spirit, and potential  for learning and creation; it will certainly enable the "Five  Self's" activities to become rich and colorful and score  numerous great results. We sincerely wish the broad masses of  children and youngsters who start from here drill to harden  their wings and soar to great heights.</p>

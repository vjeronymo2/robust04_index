			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (19): Luxury sector has gained importance rapidly - User Profiles / Japan THE NATION that leads the world in providing innovative, high-quality cars for the common man is beginning to nurture the sort of executive luxury car market at home that for decades has been the mainstay of companies such as Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz in Europe, and Cadillac in north America. Rather than big business, it is the the movers and shakers of small and mid-sized companies situated in the nation's leading metropolitan areas who increasingly are expressing themselves through luxury cars, industry executives say. 'This market is beginning to take off,' says Mr Hiroo Watanabe, managing director of Honda's Wako research and development centre, but he admits that Japanese luxury cars still have to develop a distinct identity. So far, relatively small luxury models have witnessed the strongest sales growth, with the typical executive buyer owning his own business and interested in a self-driven car for work and play, Mr Watanabe says. Such customers are enticed into the luxury market by the significant tax advantages of owning a car through a company, he adds. A tax change implemented two years ago under heavy pressure from foreign car makers dramatically lowered levies on so-called three-number vehicles (those with 2,000cc and larger engines) and is also propelling sales. Sales of cars with 2,000cc and larger engines increased each month in 1991 for a total annual gain of 42 per cent to 724,406 vehicles, marking the sector's sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. That contrasted with overall declines of 4.6 per cent in total domestic passenger car sales and 1.8 per cent in production. Indeed, the luxury sector has gained importance rapidly over the past few years and in 1991 accounted for 9.8 per cent of the domestic passenger car market, compared with 2.3 per cent three years earlier, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Toyota was the 1991 luxury market leader with a 44.8 per cent share, while Nissan came in a distant second at 21.6 per cent. Honda's line-up of relatively small luxury cars put in a strong showing with a 230 per cent sales gain to 52,166 units, or 7.2 per cent of the luxury market. The combination of pizzazz and practicality displayed by many of these cars contrasts sharply with the top end of the executive car market, where little has changed in decades, and style still takes a back seat to status. Despite US President George Bush's hard-sell for American car makers earlier this year and the high-profile delivery of a General Motors Cadillac (with the steering wheel on the wrong side) to Chief Cabinet Secretary Mr Koichi Kato this month, the boxy Toyota Century and Nissan President still overwhelmingly line the traffic corridors of power, where chauffeurs work away with feather dusters on their already gleaming black exteriors. 'Most executives don't have a say in the car. 'This is the company car and you get to ride in the back of it,'' is how Baring Securities (Japan) auto analyst, Mr Neal Doying, describes the Japanese attitude toward company fleets. 'If you look at what are considered corporate cars in Japan, the old Toyota Century and Nissan President, you would not consider them attractive,' he adds. 'But if you ride around in the back of one that means you have arrived. In the US it (the company car) is more of personal statement.' Imported luxury cars have been among the most favoured forms of auto expression in recent years, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW leading the way and foreign makers together accounting for the third largest share of the luxury market. However, deflation of Japan's so-called bubble economy sparked a 2 per cent decline in 1991 import sales and a more worrisome plunge in luxury market share to 14.7 per cent from 21.3 per cent the previous year, when there were roughly 1m imported passenger cars plying Japanese roads. The Japan Automobile Importers Association is still counting on the popularity of these high value added vehicles eventually to help it win away 10 per cent of the Japanese car market, compared with 4.9 per cent last year but it expects sales to pick up only modestly in 1992. The sole bright spot in the import market involved America's 5.3 per cent increase in exports to Japan to 30,128 units - roughly what Japan exported to the US every 5.2 days. While individual car companies are understandably reluctant to detail their luxury car customers, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association released a study last year outlining trends consistent with industry executives' comments about the luxury car market as a whole. The study shows the average age and income of imported car buyers has been declining as such vehicles become more affordable. The largest group comprised buyers 25-39 years old, while 57 per cent were salaried workers in the 1988-1990 period studied. Meanwhile, the ratio of independent enterprise owners and freelances fell sharply to less than one quarter since the previous study of buyers in the 1983-87 period, the association said. Another notable feature of the import market was an increase in average car size to the 2,000cc class. Cost-performance considerations also increased, while buyers cited external appearance, and safety as leading priorities in selecting a vehicle.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Southmark Sets Deal With Creditors: Southmark Corp., a Dallas-based real estate  holding company that filed for bankruptcy protection last July, said its  unsecured creditors agreed on a new reorganization plan calling for a quicker  payout to creditors than the company offered in its original reorganization  proposal. The agreement, to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas,  also restructures some securities and proposes a reduction in payout to  Southmark's equity holders, the company said.  </P></p>

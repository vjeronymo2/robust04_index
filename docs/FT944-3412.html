			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: English bees in quarantine as disease spreads Honey bees are to be kept in quarantine across most of England in an effort to control the spread of a disease that can wipe out whole colonies, the UK government announced yesterday. Varroa, a parasitic mite that weakens bees, first arrived in England in the spring of 1992. In November that year, the government introduced controls on the movement of bees in the greater London area and 22 mainly southern counties. The disease was subsequently found in six more counties, prompting an intensive search for the mite across the whole country by scientists from the Ministry of Agriculture's National Bee Unit in Warwickshire. Their minute investigations of over 5,000 bee colonies uncovered varroa in 75 apiaries in a further eight counties. That took the total of affected metropolitan and shire counties in England to 36 out of 45. From January 1 next year, beekeepers in the 14 more recently affected counties will be subject to the 1992 restrictions. They will only be able to move their charges, and any hive frames containing honeycomb, into or out of the infected areas if they have licences. Movement of bees and frames within the infected zones will remain unrestricted. Despite the spread of the disease, Mr Michael Jack, junior agriculture minister, expressed confidence yesterday that the country's beekeepers were learning to control varroasis with pesticides and that 'we shall retain a healthy bee population in the UK'.</p>

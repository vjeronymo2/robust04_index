The proposed action is necessary because the NRC intends to reduce the publication of the NRC Regulatory Agenda from quarterly to semiannually as the status of rulemaking actions and petitions for rulemaking is not subject to frequent change. The proposed rule is intended to reduce the level of NRC staff effort, paperwork, and distribution costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comment period expires June 10, 1994.

Husemeyer submitted a petition for rulemaking with the NRC. The petition was docketed as PRM&hyph;2&hyph;4, and a notice of receipt was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of February 24, 1977 (42 FR 10911). The petitioner requested that the NRC annually review each petition having a docket number. The petitioner also requested that the status of proposed rule changes be made part of an administrative report that would be subject to public review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to this petition for rulemaking, the NRC amended its rules of practice governing the receipt and processing of petitions for rulemaking on October 31, 1977 (42 FR 56950). In the final rule, the NRC stated that it would prepare a summary report on the status of petitions for rulemaking on a quarterly basis and make this report available for public inspection and copying in the Public Document Room. The provision concerning the preparation and availability of the summary report on petitions for rulemaking is codified at 10 CFR 2.802(g). This report was published under the heading ``NRC Petitions for Rulemaking'' until April 29, 1982, when it was incorporated into the NRC Regulatory Agenda and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (47 FR 18508).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 9, 1979, the Commission also requested that a quarterly summary be prepared for rulemaking efforts not associated with petitions for rulemaking. The NRC staff prepared a report that indicated the status of proposed rules and advance notices of proposed rulemaking for the period of January through March 1980. Although this was a one-time report, the Commission later recommended that the report be updated each quarter. This report was published under the heading ``Status of Proposed Rules.'' It was subsequently replaced by the NRC Regulatory Agenda, first published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on October 29, 1981 (46 FR 53594).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

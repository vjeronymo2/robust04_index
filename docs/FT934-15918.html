			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar stalled ahead of job figures DEALERS hung fire over the US dollar yesterday having already taken up their positions ahead of crucial US employment data today. The concentration on the latest non-farm payroll figure meant that other issues took second place. The Tory party conference in the UK, the Bundesbank council meeting in Germany and possible central bank intervention in Belgium, all had a muted impact on the relevant currencies. Economists are looking for a rise of between 150,000 and 200,000 in US employment as a signal that the country's fragile economy might be regaining some stamina. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency analysts with UBS, said: 'If we get a figure above 175,000 the economy is back on track and the mentality of the market shifts. Under 100,000 and the gloom intensifies.' That nervousness left the dollar unchanged against the D-Mark at DM1.6230 by the close in London. Against the Yen it fell slightly to Y105.10 from Y105.60 against the Yen. The worries allowed the German currency to appreciate quietly against a range of European currencies. The fact that the Bundesbank kept its floor level discount rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent and its upper level Lombard rate flat at 7.25 per cent was neither here nor there - the market would have been stunned if Mr Hans Tietmeyer had made any change at his first meeting as head of the German central bank. But doubts over the US economy have given investors more reason to back the D-Mark. The currency has been further helped by other European central banks rebuilding reserves that were severely depleted out by the exchange rate mechanism crisis at the beginning of August. The D-Mark climbed against the French and Belgian francs and the Spanish peseta. Outside the ERM it rose against the Swiss franc and Italian lira. The French franc was further overshadowed by disappointing statistics on the Bank of France reserves. A number of economists had expected that it might have recovered a large chunk of its reserves lost during the the crisis at the start of August. In the event, the latest figure showed that the Bank only rebuilt by FFr9.3bn last week, the lowest weekly figure since the crisis. That still leaves it with an estimated FFr57.7bn shortfall. The Belgian franc suffered from continuing worries over the state of the economy and the government's ability to shoulder through its social pact. The currency hit BFr21.77 against the D-Mark at one stage and dealers said the central bank was intervening to support it; the central bank denied the claims. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.70 down from BFr21.67 previously. Sterling held on to gains notched up earlier in the week in spite of some disappointment that Mr Kenneth Clarke the Chancellor refused to scotch speculation of an early interest rate cut.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Roll out timber carpet A US carpet company, Collins and Aikman, has turned the messy business of carpet recycling on its head. Instead of labouring to separate the components of a carpet, which often include wool, nylon and latex or bitumen and several years of grit, the company has found a way to grind up old carpet and add a catalyst to create a synthetic timber. The market for recycling carpets is potentially huge. Millions of tonnes of carpets are dumped each year in landfill sites in Europe and North America. Dumping costs up to 75 cents a yard, according to US chemicals company Du Pont. It may not even be an option for much longer: in Germany, for example, proposals are being considered to force manufacturers to take back old carpets. Recycling has proved impossible. Like unscrambling an egg, it is tough to separate a carpet into its original components. Collins and Aikman's solution is to granulate the carpet, backing and all, and then mix and extrude it with a catalyst. The resulting material can be mixed with other waste plastics before being moulded into a range of products including chairs and tables, marine timber, toothbrush handles and weatherproof flooring. A park bench made from recycled carpet is already on sale in the US at Dollars 240 (Pounds 150). The catch is price. The synthetic wood is two to three times more expensive than timber. But the company argues that buyers of the carpet would save money through not having to pay for incineration or landfill charges, while buyers of the synthetic wood benefit from a material which lasts 15 to 25 years instead of five for treated wood. The company has spent Dollars 8m on new production equipment at its plant in Dalton, Georgia. 'We will recycle any vinyl-backed carpet free of charge.' says David Pyles, managing director of international sales at Collins and Aikman. 'We'll need all the carpet we can get.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Moscow Air Defense District </F> Command Holds Open Day at Secret Facility"]    [Text] The Moscow Air Defense District's main command post  is situated among new buildings in Moscow's residential district  of Anino. Quite recently it was a facility surrounded by barbed  wire, which even some of the commander's deputies were  prohibited from entering. But after it was visited by the U.S.  secretary of defense and by FRG, Chinese, Indian, and North  Korean delegation heads, it was the turn of journalists.  Admittedly, Russian journalists, not foreign journalists  contrary to the present tradition.    What is the Moscow Air Defense District command post? The  three-story bunker buried 20 meters in the ground with a  two-story building on top resembles an officers' club. The  command post can withstand a direct hit by an atom bomb, and can  operate on stand-alone for 10 days without depending on the  city's electricity and water supply networks.    According to Lieutenant General Pavel Kuznetsov, Moscow Air  Defense District chief of staff, the district monitors an air  space of 1.3 million square km, the territory of 24 Russian  oblasts, the district's 4,000-km border, and over 140 highly  important military-state command and control and economic  facilities, including those where there is a danger of  radiation. There are eight of them -- nuclear electric power  stations. It can track and fire on 500 targets in flight at  once.    Although during a conversation with journalists Colonel  General Anatoliy Kornukov, commander of the Moscow Air Defense  District, attributed the unusual openness of the district's  secret installations to the military's sincere desire not to  keep secrets from their people where there should be none and to  the traditional meetings with the public on the eve of Air  Defense Day, there is another reason for the journalists  visiting the main command post. There has been talk that air  defense is unnecessary and of the need to cut the already small  military budget by disbanding the Air Defense Forces.    Gen. Korunkov said that no one has any intention of  disbanding the Air Defense Forces. Strangely enough, it is far  cheaper to keep them in a state of high combat readiness today  than to cut them, and the need for them still exists.</p>

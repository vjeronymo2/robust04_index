			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Vesteys to put half of NZ meat group up for sale WEDDEL New Zealand, the meat company owned by the Vestey family of the UK though their Union International group, plans shareholding changes including a search for a new large shareholder. This follows a decision by the Vesteys to sell assets to restructure their businesses. Mr John Prendergast, Weddel managing director, said the family planned to sell about 50 per cent of the company, which is the fourth largest in New Zealand. One option was to find an overseas investor to buy 30 per cent of the company, and sell the remaining 20 per cent through a public flotation in New Zealand. Weddel has appointed Buttle Wilson, a New Zealand sharebroking firm, and SG Warburg of the US to advise on a trade sale, and Cavill White Securities, another New Zealand broker, to advise on a public flotation. Mr Prendergast said the flotation would be scheduled for the last quarter of this year with Cavill White as lead broker and manager. Weddel operates five large processing plants in the North Island. In 1992, it recorded sales of NZDollars 563m (Dollars 296.3m). It processes and markets 11 per cent of the country's mutton and lamb, 17 per cent of its beef, and 27 per cent of its veal. Mr Prendergast said most of its products were sold internationally through the Weddel brand, the world's largest and most recognised internationally traded meat brand. The company has shareholders' funds of NZDollars 70m, and has operated in New Zealand since 1900. Mr Prendergast said the capital raised would enable it to undertake a number of projects. Mr Terry Robinson, Union International chief executive, said Weddel had traded successfully and because it held an important part in the global meat market, Union International was keen to retain a large strategic shareholding. Weddel's position would be enhanced by winning an appropriate partner and from additional funding. 'This proposed restructuring would enable Weddel to optimise its trading opportunities from the increasingly competitive position of the New Zealand meat industry and from improving prospects of global trade arising from the Uruguay round of Gatt negotiations,' Mr Robinson said.</p>

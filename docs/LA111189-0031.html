			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S GETTING DIFFICULT FOR THESE RAM FANS TO REMAIN DEDICATED  </P> <P> Who does the public relations work for Fritz Shurmur? Whoever it is, give 'em a  raise because they're the best in the business.  </P> <P> How else can you explain Shurmur's tenure? Year in and year out, his soft zone  defense allows teams to march down the field. And that's with time on the  clock. Give a team only a minute or two and Shurmur really softens it up.  </P> <P> We're accustomed to it, of course. But Sunday's choke was still something  special. They only had to hold the lead for 28 seconds!  </P> <P> It has never been easy to be a Ram fan. Now, it's impossible. Where do we turn?  </P> <P> Forget it. It's basketball season.  </P> <P> JIM ESTERBROOKS, Del Mar  </P></p>

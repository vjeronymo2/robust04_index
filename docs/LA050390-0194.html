			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> HE KNOWS HOW TO BEAT TRAFFIC AT STADIUM  </P> <P> Until the manufacturers built the Grand National sport truck class into stadium  off-road racing's most-talked-about event a few years ago, the No. 1 attraction  was the single-seat buggies.  </P> <P> Frank Arciero Jr. -- Butch to friends and associates -- is the all-time  winningest driver in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix, and most of his  success has come in the desert buggies. Arciero, 43, of Laguna Hills, has won  14 stadium races -- three in unlimited single-seaters, which no longer are  running in the stadiums, 10 in Super 1600s and one in a Grand National truck.  </P> <P> When Arciero won the Super 1600 main event in the Thompson season-opener  January in Anaheim Stadium, he broke out of a tie with Glenn Harris of  Camarillo, whose 13 victories also included a variety of equipment.  </P> <P> Saturday night in the Rose Bowl, in the sixth round of the Mickey Thompson  series, Arciero and Harris both will be driving -- Arciero in his Super 1600  and Harris in a Jeep Comanche as a teammate of Walker Evans.  </P> <P> A Super 1600 is the same open-wheeled desert racing machine as an unlimited,  except that its power is limited to rear-mounted 1600cc engines, usually  Volkswagens or Toyotas.  </P> <P> "Competition is getting tougher every year," Arciero said in discussing the  Super 1600 Rose Bowl race. "Bobby Gordon and Mitch Mustard are tough in every  race. Bobby is my desert racing partner and has been driving stadium races  nearly as long as I have."  </P> <P> Gordon won in Seattle and Mustard, the defending champion from Arvada, Colo.,  won at Phoenix.  </P> <P> "Greg George, in the new Sage Council team, is coming on strong, too," Arciero  said. "He led half the race at Anaheim before I passed him, and then he won in  San Diego. He was a big winner in ultrastocks and now he's doing real well in  the 1600s."  </P> <P> George, from Colton, Calif., won seven ultrastock races, including the Rose  Bowl in 1986.  </P> <P> Arciero's father, Frank, has fielded Indy cars and sports cars for five  decades. His drivers have included Dan Gurney, Jimmy Clark, Bobby and Al Unser,  Parnelli Jones and Michael Andretti. However, when Frank Jr. was young, his  interest was baseball.  </P> <P> "I played third base at Cantwell High and Long Beach State and summers for a  Red Sox semipro farm team in Montebello," Arciero said. "My brother, Arthur,  was the one who loved cars. He was always in the shop, working with the  mechanics, but I spent my time on the ball field."  </P> <P> When Butch decided his future lay more with the family construction business  than with professional baseball, he was working as a laborer one day in San  Fernando when the job foreman learned he was an Arciero and wanted to talk  off-road racing.  </P> <P> "We became friends and before you knew it, he had Arthur and me over to his  house to sell us a racing buggy," Butch said. "Arthur prepared it and we raced  for the first time in the (1971) Mint 400. My big thrill was being bumped by  Parnelli Jones. He ended up winning and I ended up stuck out in the middle of  the mountains with no radio communication. I just sat there until about 2 in  the morning when I heard my dad's voice. He'd come looking and stumbled onto  our car."  </P> <P> Butch and Arthur became regulars on the desert racing scene. When Thompson  started his stadium racing series in 1979, the Arcieros built their own  practice track in Diamond Bar, where they could simulate racing in stadiums.  The course was recently closed because of encroaching housing developments.  </P> <P> "By the time I got hooked on racing, I was nearly 30. So there was no chance  for me to move on to Indy cars or anything like that, but I still enjoy racing.  I'll do two or three desert races with Bobby Gordon and the stadium series.  We're still going to beat Ivan (Stewart) before the year is out."  </P> <P> Stewart, driving solo in a Toyota truck, has won the last two Mint 400s. Each  time the Arciero-Gordon car was second.  </P> <P> "We had him beat this year -- we had eight or nine minutes on him -- when we  had an electrical problem. Before we could fix it, Ivan was by us. It was  really frustrating, but there's still the Firecracker 250 and the Baja 1000 to  get him."  </P> <P> Ron Hornaday Sr. won the Winston West stock car championship twice, in 1963 and  1964, and now Ron Jr. is going after the NASCAR Southwest Tour title.  </P> <P> After two of the 18 races, Hornaday holds a 28-point lead and the next race is  on his home track, Saugus Speedway, on Saturday night. Hornaday, a 31-year-old  mechanic from Palmdale, won the 1987 modified championship at Saugus and races  there regularly when there is no Southwest Tour event.  </P> <P> "I love running Saugus," he said. "There's no other track I'd rather go to.  It's so flat and hard to drive that if you master it, you'll be able to master  any other short track around here. That's why the Saugus guys do so well in the  Tour."  </P> <P> Dan Press, a two-time Saugus modified champion, is defending Southwest Tour  champion. Two other former Saugus drivers, Dennis Dyer and Ray Hooper Jr., are  second and third behind Hornaday in this year's standings.  </P> <P> Press won both Southwest Tour races last year on the one-third mile Saugus  saucer. If he can win Saturday night's Miller Genuine Draft 100, he will become  first Tour driver to win three consecutive races on the same track.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt Dan is the one to beat because he's got his act together and  he runs real strong, but that doesn't mean we can't do it," Hornaday said. "Dan  intimidates a lot of people by coming up behind them and tapping their bumper.  He hopes it gets you out of the groove enough for him to get hard on the gas  and slip underneath.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys do that, but Dan's absolutely the best at it. I've run with him  enough that it doesn't bother me. In fact, I'm getting to have the same sort of  reputation that he does, but you have to have an edge, especially at Saugus.  </P> <P> "That's why the stands are always packed there. The fans know they're going to  get an exciting bump-and-run show."  </P> <P> INDY CARS -- Robby Unser, son of Bobby, and his cousin, John, son of the late  Jerry Unser, will race against one another Sunday in the opening race of the  Machinists Union American IndyCar series at Willow Springs Raceway. Robby won  12 of 16 races last year to win the series. The championship race of 25 laps  around the 2.5-mile track will be Sunday at 4:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Also on the two-day program, which includes AIS qualifying Saturday, will be a  full Sports Car Club of America regional race schedule, round three of the  Toyota Super Production Unlimited series and the first running of the Police  Chiefs Racing for Drug Education race. In the latter race, members of police  and sheriffs departments from Southern California will compete.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- Teen-ager Jeff Gordon of Vallejo, one of the best young drivers in  the country, will be on center stage Friday night at Ascot Park when the last  of five races for U.S. Auto Club midgets will be held as part of ESPN's Thunder  Series. Gordon's victory last week gave him the lead in the race for the  STP/GEO crown at Ascot. Three-quarter midgets, headed by Page Jones, last  week's winner and Parnelli's youngest son, and points leader Rob Hansen, will  also be on the program.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- John Borneman, a two-time Cajon Speedway champion, is off to a  fast start in quest of a third title. The veteran from Ramona has won the last  two sportsman main events at the Gillespie Field oval and will be favored again  Saturday night. . . .

Dirt cars will run Saturday night at Santa Maria Speedway and street stocks  will race Friday night at Ventura Raceway.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY BIKES -- National champion Bobby Schwartz will open defense of his  Ascot Park track championship when the 1990 season gets under way tonight at  the South Bay Stadium. . . .

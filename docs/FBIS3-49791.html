			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by unidentified </F> correspondent; place and date not given; from "The Week"  program; recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] There are various  interpretations at home and abroad. After the NATO summit and  the top level meetings in Prague, does Hungarian diplomacy  regard the developments as a success or fiasco?    [Boross] [passage omitted] There was plenty of pouting in  the  foreign and domestic press. However, what happened means  significantly more. It allows us to hope that if we meet certain  conditions, the path may lead to NATO and security.    [Correspondent] Was this optimism confirmed by personal  meetings, too, first and foremost, of course, with U.S.  President Clinton?    [Boross] Yes. He is a politician of very cordial voice and  informal style. The discussion had a pleasant atmosphere and  was very rich in content.    A new element evolved, and it is very important. U.S.  intentions for Central Europe's economic support were voiced.  When President Clinton told us he would convene a conference in  the United States as early as this year to facilitate the  region's economic development, we learned about an initiative of  the President that is destined to stimulate U.S. investment  endeavors. Thus, the clear intention now seems to be to promote  economic stability.    [Correspondent] Together or individually -- it is obviously  a  big question in such an economic rise.    [Boross] During my talks in Prague I had the opportunity to  stress to various negotiating partners that, quite peculiarly,  the forces that shape world politics think very much in terms of  regions, most of the times not in terms of individual countries,  but a series of linkable countries, that is regions.    However, it is also clear from the statement that joining  NATO, the progress, rapprochement to NATO, or becoming a NATO  member are subject to the countries' individual performance. We  would like to sign the document in Brussels on joining, which,  we hope, will be followed by a couple of months work to prepare  a working program. It will presumably include several compulsory  elements regarding requirements related to the Armed Forces'  armament, education, and skills, perhaps language knowledge.    It shows by itself that at present the political desire that  we should immediately write a letter and ask for NATO admission  is absolutely unreal. [passage omitted -- Boross says two years  ago, when Socialist chief Gyula Horn raised the idea of joining  NATO, Hungary's application would have been rejected]    [Correspondent] Obviously, every proposal is related to  increasing the country's defensive ability, and in general  matters regarding the country's stability. Now, after these  talks, is Hungary in a significantly more favorable situation  from this viewpoint than it was, let's say, two or three weeks  [as heard] ago?    [Boross] God forbid [ne adja a sors] that we have to test  how  NATO would react if some more serious danger threatened us.  However, I am convinced that this initiative and also its  textual content means a more favorable security situation to us  than two or three years ago. However, it does not yet mean  absolute security; the security that one can achieve with NATO  membership.    [Correspondent] Have these talks between the Visegrad  countries brought about new tensions or, perhaps, have old ones,  which have to be settled, been raised? It is a permanent  problem, question, that the Hungarian Government does not  eliminate but increases these tensions. I mean by this the  prime minister's meeting with Prime Minister Meciar where the  issue of Gabcikovo-Nagymaros [hydroelectric power plant and dam]  and the minority issue were again raised.    [Boross] I have to say that the main emphasis was on  cooperation at all three talks, including my talks with Mr.  Meciar. There are problems and we are aware of them. However,  it was not possible to solve or to make an attempt to solve them  during this time. In spite of this fact, we have a lot to do in  the field of economic relations, for example in strengthening  free trade relations. As soon as I returned home, this free  trade issue, the question where we really stand in this matter,  was put on my desk.    The Hungarian Government does not worsen these relations.  However, the Hungarian Government lives with a historic  situation. A Hungarian Government cannot be indifferent to  Hungarians living beyond its borders -- if it respected itself  and called itself a Hungarian Government. The allegation that  the Hungarian Government took steps that made the situation more  tense then desirable I consider impossible. We have to take  exception with those who think that if any kind of atrocity or  disadvantageous step affected the Hungarian community in a  neighboring country, the government should stay silent. Well,  it cannot stay silent.    [Correspondent] To what extent will the agreements, which  have been or will be concluded in the form of agreements in the  course of talks, influence the relations of the region's  countries with Ukraine and Russia, the Russian territories. [as  heard]    [Boross] I have to say that the Partnership for Peace  initiative can be a kind of spiritual familiarization for those  who have been frightened or received this initiative unfavorably  or with criticism. Therefore, the fact that here, in this  region, only endeavors for security, and not preparations  against the domination of somebody, can be proved by a series of  facts.    Ukrainian and Russian relations are extremely important to  us. I hope we can soon welcome the Russian prime minister in  Budapest. And here, in this place, realistically assessing where  the storm of history has placed us, we have to declare that,  yes, our orientation is indeed trans-Atlantic from the security  point of view, but our relations toward the eastern region can  be described with peaceful intentions, friendly motivations, the  strengthening of political ties, and the prosperity of the  economy in a way that, in the current market situation, can be  really imagined only with a strengthening eastern market.    [Correspondent] Should we not bother about the message of  the  victorious Russian -- Zhirinovskiy -- sent almost every day that  we should remain neutral and not to get closer to NATO.    [Boross] Well, to be honest, I hear and read different  things, not only because I do not speak Russian, but for other  reasons as well. [passage indistinct] The aforementioned  gentleman has bewildering manifestations. If he said this, I  have to qualify his manifestations as very immature. However, I  hope that it cannot be considered as the Russian policy. This  is a kind of peripheral phenomenon, if there were indeed voices  like this. [passage omitted]</p>

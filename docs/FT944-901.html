			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Drug rules to be relaxed Pharmaceutical companies will no longer have to conduct human clinical trials to prove a proposed product could become a useful drug, the US Patent and Trademark Office announced yesterday. Mr Bruce Lehman, commissioner of patents and trademarks, said new guidelines for reviewing biotechnology patent applications change the yardstick by which examiners will determine if a drug could be useful. Mr Lehman said examiners had required that drugs undergo extensive human clinical trials before the patent could be granted. Now, he said, a drug company applicant can use 'any kind of evidence' to prove the usefulness, or utility, of the invention. The new guidelines would go into effect immediately, he said, but the agency would accept public comment on the issue until February 24 and a 'finishing gloss' would be put on the guidelines in March. Officials of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation, an industry trade group, said the new requirements would make it easier for small companies to protect drug inventions.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: Rolls-Royce defeated by shareholders - Legal briefs An attempt by Rolls-Royce to buy out the listed preference shareholders in one of its member companies, Northern Engineering Industries, against their will, has been defeated in the Court of Appeal. Rolls bought Northern in 1989. In January last year it called an EGM to authorise a reduction of its share capital by repaying and cancelling its preference shares. Rolls, as the holder of all ordinary shares, passed the resolutions. Commercial Union, which held some preference shares through a nominee, objected. The Appeal Court upheld that objection. It said the attempt to buy out the preference shareholders was not in accordance with their rights. The case hinged on Northern's articles of association, which entitled preference shareholders to a separate class meeting to approve any 'reduction in capital'. Northern argued that repaying the whole of the paid-up capital on the preference shares was not a 'reduction'. The court disagreed. Mr Edward Walker-Arnott, senior partner of City solicitors Herbert Smith, said the case had established 'an important point of principle for all institutional shareholders'. Many listed companies have articles protecting preference shareholders' rights.</p>

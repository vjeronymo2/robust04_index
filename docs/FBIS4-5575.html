			<p>BFN     [Text] Taegu, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Former opposition leader  Kim Tae-chung said Saturday that hard-liners in Seoul, Pyongyang  and Washington are hampering solution of the North Korean  nuclear dispute.    Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the  Asia- Pacific Region, told nearly 150 supporters here that the  government should adopt a soft policy toward North Korea in  order to bring about change.    "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing  division  of the Korean peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North  Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into  third- rate countries," he warned.    Kim called on the government to solve the nuclear problem  through a "package deal," under which Western countries would  recognize the Pyongyang Government while North Korea gave up  nuclear weapons. In doing so, the government should secure the  cooperation of China, he said.    "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear weapons and the  United States will establish an embassy in Pyongyang," he  predicted.    This was Kim's first visit to Taegu since he was defeated in  the presidential election in December 1992.</p>

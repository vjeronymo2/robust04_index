			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / FT Guide to the Week: Other economic news Monday: Japan and the US will be key focuses of market attention this week, with a spate of statistics for economists to feed on. Japan's trade balance for the first 10 days of June today will be watched with interest in light of the ongoing weakness of the dollar against the yen. Tuesday: On the domestic front, Japan's coincident and leading diffusion indexes for May, published today, should provide further indication that business sentiment is improving. In the US, July's consumer confidence data is likely to show confidence flattening out, albeit at high levels. Wednesday: More indications about the strength of the US economic recovery will emerge today with the publication of June durable goods data. In Japan, June's retail sales are expected to show a year on year fall, albeit at a slower rate than last month. Friday: More US and Japanese data round off the week, with Japan's construction data expected to indicate a slow pick-up in this sector. US advance GDP data are forecast to show a rise, year-on-year, of 3.65 per cent for the second quarter of this year, up from 3.4 per cent in the first quarter.</p>

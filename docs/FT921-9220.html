			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Cut in interest charges helps lift Iberdrola IBERDROLA, Spain's biggest private sector electricity utility, reports a 31.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1991, to Pta87.6bn (Dollars 876m). It follows a sharp cut in interest charges, down nearly 6 per cent to Pta199bn. In its first result since the merger last year of the country's two leading private utilities, Iberduero and Hidrola, Iberdrola said it had finished the year in better shape than it had expected. Cutting interest payments has become critical for Spain's heavily-borrowed utilities, as they are about to begin a series of generating plant investments to fulfil government energy requirement forecasts for the end of the century. Iberdrola reported income of Pta787bn, up some Pta66bn from 1990. It said it had improved the quality of its profits by cutting deferred costs by Pta5.1bn to Pta18.5bn; capitalising some Pta10bn worth of debt in mothballed nuclear plant; and by raising provisions by Pta11bn.</p>

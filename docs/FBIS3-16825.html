I have three tasks  to fulfill during my visit to Ukraine, stated U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry at Borispol airport. The first task is  to strengthen and renew relations with our old friends; second,  is to continue working with the Ukrainian Government and the  Defense Ministry to step up the implementation of the very  important trilateral Ukrainian-Russian-U.S. agreement signed by  Presidents Leonid Kravchuk, Boris Yeltsin, and Bill Clinton in  Moscow in January of this year; and my third task will be to  cooperate with the Ukrainian Government within the framework of  the program of economic development and conversion of military  industrial enterprises.    The U.S. delegation is planning to visit Pervomaysk and  acquaint itself with how a variety of programs on dismantling  nuclear weapons according to the Moscow trilateral agreement are  being implemented. After that, Secretary Perry will visit a  classified site in Dnepropetrovsk, the biggest production  complex specializing in missile equipment production. For the  first time in the history of such enterprises, the Pentagon  chief later emphasized, a U.S. secretary of defense will have  the opportunity to personally observe operations at one of these  sites.</p>

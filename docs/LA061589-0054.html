			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAGON PENN ADMITS DAMAGING MOTORCYCLE; OTHER COUNT DROPPED  </P> <P> Sagon Penn pleaded guilty Wednesday to misdemeanor vandalism and was ordered  released from County Jail after serving 15 days after assaulting his  ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.  </P> <P> The conviction is a far cry from the felony attempted-murder charge under which  Penn was originally booked by San Diego police when he was arrested May 31 at  the ex-girlfriend's Normal Heights apartment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victim Snagged Case  </P> <P> City Atty. John Witt said the reduced charge was agreed on after the victim  declined to cooperate with prosecutors.  </P> <P> "It's a major problem in any kind of prosecution like this," Witt said in  describing Roger Worshim's unwillingness to follow up with the case against  Penn, 27.  </P> <P> "You can go ahead with it," Witt added. "And we often do, particularly in cases  of spousal abuse. But we felt that, under the circumstances, this was a very  fair settlement to the people involved. We feel that we accomplished what could  be expected."  </P> <P> Penn's attorney, Nanette Monson, said the plea-bargain arrangement was in her  client's best interests.  </P> <P> "The city attorney definitely had problems with this case," she said. "Mr.  Worshim had no intention of cooperating.  </P> <P> "But the city attorney also had some independent witnesses, and it's their  intention to prosecute all the way and never drop cases. So I think this  arrangement worked out very well for Sagon. It worked out to his advantage."  </P> <P> In two long, highly publicized trials, Penn, who is black, was twice acquitted  of killing a white San Diego police officer and wounding another, along with a  civilian ride-along. Since then, he has surfaced several times in  domestic-disturbance incidents in which police have been called.  </P> <P> In the May 31 incident, Penn went to Donna Parks' apartment and allegedly  grabbed Worshim and tried to choke him. He also damaged Worshim's motorcycle,  which was parked outside.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, police officials defended the original attempted-murder citation  under which Penn was jailed in the current case, saying it is normal procedure  for authorities to detain suspects on the highest possible offense.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Deadly Force Involved  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said: "It's not unusual for charges to be  reduced in our criminal justice system. I don't know the intricacies of this  case, but the district attorney and the city attorney know what they're doing."  </P> <P> After reviewing the case, the district attorney decided not to pursue felony  charges in the matter because it did not involve a deadly weapon or cause  serious bodily injury. The case was then referred to the city attorney's  office, and Penn was charged with misdemeanor battery and misdemeanor  vandalism.  </P> <P> Witt said that under the terms of the plea arrangement, the battery charge was  dismissed in return for Penn's pleading guilty plea to vandalizing the  motorcycle.  </P> <P> Penn was ordered released from jail and placed on three years' probation. He  was also ordered to undergo periodic psychiatric evaluation, a requirement  apparently sought after two courtroom outbursts in which he rambled about his  love for Parks.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Linda Quinn was advised that Penn had already given Worshim  $1,500 for the motorcycle damage.  </P> <P> Even though the guilty plea means a conviction for Penn, Monson said it was the  best course to follow.  </P> <P> "For a lot of reasons, it was the safer route," she said. "He was facing a  maximum of a year and a half in jail, and he already did 15 days actual time.  So it seemed to be the appropriate move."  </P></p>

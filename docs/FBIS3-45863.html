			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today criticized Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's  comment that Moscow should maintain a military presence in the  Baltics as "at odds with" a recent joint U.S.-Russian statement.    "If they are accurate, we certainly will seek clarification  from the Russian Government," State Department spokesman Michael  McCurry said in reference to remarks reportedly made by Kozyrev  to the Russian ambassadors to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.    Moscow has withdrawn all troops from Lithuania, but not from  Latvia or Estonia. The three Baltic nations were under the  jurisdiction of the former Soviet Union, but Washington had  never recognized the legitimacy of this arrangement.    "Foreign Minister Kozyrev's comments are certainly at odds  with statements signed by (Russian) President (Boris) Yeltsin  and (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton in Moscow," McCurry said.    McCurry's remarks came only hours after Kozyrev reportedly  said that if Russia withdrew its troops, it would create a  security vacuum in the region.    While asserting that the rights of ethnic Russians in the  Baltic countries should be protected, Washington has all along  demanded that Moscow pull its troops out quickly.</p>

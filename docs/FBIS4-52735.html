			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday ruled out the  extradition of Thanong Siriprichaphong to the United States,  where he is wanted on drugs charges.    Chuan said the police or the Office of the Narcotics Control  Board (ONCB) can take legal action against the Chat Thai MP in  Thailand if they have sufficient evidence from the United States.    Chuan insisted that any action against Thanong, who has been  accused by the U.S. of conspiring to smuggle more than 45 tones  of marijuana into the United States, should be in a Thai court  rather than overseas.    A U.S. indictment, revealed on Tuesday, charges Thanong with  smuggling, conspiracy and operating a continuing criminal  enterprise between 1973 and 1987.    The U.S. Justice Department announced early this week that  it  will seek Thanong's extradition under a treaty with Thailand.  But Thai officials insisted the treaty did not oblige  extradition of Thais to the U.S. and vice versa.    "If police or the Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB)  have enough evidence, they can take legal action against  Thanong," Chuan said. "They can request evidence from the U.S.."    Chuan said investigators must have sufficient evidence  before  taking criminal cases into court.    "The government's duty is to ensure justice prevails in our  society. Any allegations against Thais should be tried in a  Thai court," he said.    The government was also willing to comply with a Chat Thai  request to provide a party fact-finding committee with all  information relating to the charges against Thanong.    Other senior government MPs yesterday were also insisting  that any action against Thanong should be in Thailand.    Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said: "We will  never send Thai people to stand trial in a foreign country. We  will take legal action against a culprit according to evidence  we have and under Thai law."    He said the Foreign Ministry was in contact with the U.S.  authorities and was seeking more details of the evidence against  Thanong.    Aphisit believed Chat Thai's fact-finding committee would be  neutral and take action against Thanong according to the  evidence placed before it.    Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees the ONCB,  said the agency had a policy of cooperating fully with the U.S.  in tracking down drug trafficking activities. It would not  protect Thanong if there was evidence against him.    Amnuai would not commit himself on the issue of Thanong's  extradition to the U.S. but said Thailand had a discretionary  right to prosecute its own citizens.    Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said Thanong would be  immediately prosecuted in Thailand if police had sufficient  evidence.    "Police are waiting for more evidence from the U.S.    "If they get enough evidence to substantiate the charges  against Thanong, the prosecution will proceed," he said.    Parliament President Marut Bunnak said that in practice  Thailand would not allow the extradition of its citizens to  stand trial in a foreign country.    The U.S. Embassy, meanwhile, has offered to help make  possible a visit to the United States by Thanong.    The embassy also announced that it "is working closely with  the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue, and is  providing a complete text of the indictment to the ministry".    Thanong has denied the U.S. charges and announced his  willingness to travel to the US, if necessary, to defend himself.</p>

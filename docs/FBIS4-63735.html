			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pilat under the "In Brief" rubric: </F> "The Grivna To Replace the Karbovanets"]    [Text] NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has learned from sources close  to Ukraine government circles that a new monetary unit -- the  grivna -- is being introduced on all the territory of Ukraine as  of 25 (or possibly 26) May to replace the Ukrainian  karbovanets-coupons. It is assumed that the rate of exchange is  100 karbovanets for one grivna. The dollar rate has shot up at  Ukraine's exchange offices. Whereas one dollar could be bought  for 47,000 karbovanets on 23 May, it cost more than 60,000  karbovanets and between 66,000 and 70,000 in Kiev, Lvov, and  Crimea on 24 May.</p>

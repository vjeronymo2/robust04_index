			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Caracas considers sell-offs within state group THE Venezuelan government may extend its privatisation programme to companies in the state-owned CVG (Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana), which controls the country's heavy industry, writes Joe Mann in Caracas. CVG, whose activities include steel, aluminium smelting and products, mining, and hydroelectric power, has not previously figured in the three-year-old privatisation programme. But a projected fiscal deficit this year has caused the government to consider privatising parts of CVG, which includes companies fully owned by the state as well as joint ventures.</p>

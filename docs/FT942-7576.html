			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Cook says 'bankrupt' scheme will soon lose gloss - Opposition rection Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, denounced the competitiveness white paper as a 'bankrupt statement from a government on the verge of liquidation'. To cheers from Labour backbenchers who mocked and ridiculed Mr Heseltine throughout his statement, Mr Cook maintained that there was not one new idea in the 160 pages. He said the need to restore the competitiveness of industry exposed the 15 'wasted years' of Tory rule. Mr Cook acknowledged that glitzy presentation had put the white paper in the 'coffee table class', but forecast that the gloss would rub off very easily. He complained that the document did not contain one new measure to stimulate research and development, and did nothing to tackle the crisis in the defence industries by helping them to convert to civilian output. The statement was also rated a flop by Mr Don Foster, for the Liberal Democrats, who suggested that the manner in which it had been delivered must have damaged Mr Heseltine's leadership ambitions and provided some short-term security for Mr John Major. Mr Foster said the white paper offered no substantial support for small businesses, which arethe engine room of recovery. Mr Heseltine told his critics the white paper built on economic strengths which did not exist in the early 1980s. Mr Cook also condemned cuts in health and safety provision and insisted 'competitiveness cannot be built on taking greater risks with the workforce'. This charge was rebutted by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who stressed that the government was implementing recommendations agreed by representatives of the TUC serving on the health and safety commission.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UAL STOCK SOARS ON NEWS OF NEW BUYOUT OFFER FROM BOARD  </P> <P> UAL Corp. stock rose sharply this morning after a union official said the  parent of United Airlines will present a new proposal for a buyout of the  airline company to its flight attendants union on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "The company has said that it has a presentation to make to the unions about a  new buyout. . . . They are going to make that presentation on Wednesday, Dec.  6," said Pat Friend, outgoing president of UAL's flight attendants union.  </P> <P> "We have no idea what it is," Friend added.  </P> <P> UAL's management has been struggling to put together a new buyout for the  Chicago-based airline company since a planned $6.75-billion management and  pilots buyout collapsed in October when the group failed to secure bank  financing.  </P> <P> Management is under pressure to shape a new buyout because Coniston Partners, a  New York investment firm, has said it plans to take control of the board and  push through a new transaction to lift the company's stock price.  </P> <P> Expectations that a revised bid will be forthcoming sent UAL stock sharply  higher this morning. It surged $5 to $179 a share by noon on the New York Stock  Exchange, adding to Friday's jump of $12.50.  </P> <P> Condor Partners LP, a holding company controlled by Coniston, said in filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it raised its holdings in UAL  to 11.8% from 9.7%.  </P> <P> Wall Street traders said they are encouraged by the news that Coniston had  purchased more shares.  </P> <P> "Coniston's buying more stock is great," one Wall Street trader said today.  "They're putting their money where their mouth is."  </P> <P> Flight attendants leader Friend also said her union is scheduled to resume  labor negotiations with UAL on Wednesday. The union has been working without a  contract since Nov. 1, 1987.  </P> <P> A spokesman for UAL's pilots union said he was not aware of any meetings  scheduled between the pilots union and the company. UAL's machinists were not  immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Coniston last month said it plans to oust UAL's board through a consent  solicitation, a direct appeal to stockholders that needs a majority vote in  favor to be carried, and to pursue moves to raise UAL's stock price.  </P> <P> Friend said that while a revised buyout plan may be presented at Wednesday's  meeting, "We're a long way away from an agreement that would require a vote."  </P> <P> Louis Marckesano, of the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,  said the "odds are pretty good" that UAL is working quickly to wrap up a new  deal with employees.  </P> <P> The resignations this weekend of two officers of the flight attendants union --  Friend and Vice President Carol Holmes -- could also mean a deal is near,  Marckesano said.  </P> <P> "The flight attendants have not been as cooperative under (Friend and Holmes),"  Marckesano said in a telephone interview. "This may be a sign that perhaps they  are easing their stance."  </P></p>

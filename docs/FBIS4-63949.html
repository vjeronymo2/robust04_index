			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated "Statement by the Press Center of Ukraine's </F> Ministry of Foreign Affairs"]    [Text] On 20 May 1994, the Crimean Supreme Council adopted  the law "On the Restoration of the Constitutional Principles of  the Crimean Republic's Statehood" having thereby made an attempt  to restore the Crimean Constitution in its 6 May 1992 variant.  This law is unconstitutional and illegal. It leads to an  exacerbation of interethnic tension on the peninsula and in  Ukraine as a whole and raises the question of the legal status  of the Crimean Republic as a constituent part of Ukraine. This  creates a direct threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity and  peace and stability in the region.    In this connection, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs  A.M. Zlenko sent letters to the UN secretary general, the  chairman of the Security Council, the chairman of the CSCE,  NATO's general secretary, leaders of other international  organizations, and ministers of foreign affairs of foreign  countries. In his letters, the head of Ukraine's external  political department stresses, in particular, that this illegal  decision, provoked by the irresponsible course pursued by the  present Crimean leadership and aimed at undermining Ukraine's  constitutional power and its territorial integrity cannot be  qualified in any other terms than an open attempt on the part of  separatist forces to weaken the internal political stability in  Ukraine and provoke tension in the Ukrainian- Russian relations.  This creates a threat to peace and stability in the region and  in the whole of Europe, something which may have far-reaching  negative consequences, in view of the present complicated  situation in this part of the continent.    Today those European countries, which are participants in  the  CSCE, have admitted the exceptional importance unconditionally  to maintain and strengthen the principles of territorial  integrity and inviolability of existing borders, as a guarantee  for European peace and security. Such separatist aspirations on  the part of the leadership of the Crimean Republic may result in  further erosion of these fundamental principles underlying  European stability. In the case of a further escalation of the  situation as a result of the irresponsible steps by the  extremist forces in the Crimea, Ukraine reserves the right to  take all the necessary measures for an unconditional protection  of the state's territorial integrity in conformity with its  constitution and current legislation and with an adherence to  the norms of international law.</p>

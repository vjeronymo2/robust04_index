			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Flicker on the big picture: Films have had a good year, but costs are rising When 20th Century Fox released Miracle on 34th Street last month, it hoped the film would be a Christmas hit. But last week, Fox was forced to offer 'your money back if you don't enjoy it' in a desperate attempt to persuade US cinema goers to see it. Miracle is now vying with Kenneth Branagh's critically slated Mary Shelley's Frankenstein for the dubious honour of becoming the celluloid turkey of Christmas 1994. Both have flopped badly in the US in a prosperous period for the movie business, as hit films such as Interview with the Vampire, Star Trek Generations and The Lion King break records at the box office. Yet concern is mounting in the industry about the spiralling cost of film-making and declining profitability. Hollywood was shocked by the recent announcement that Sony, the Japanese electronics group, had fallen into the red in the first half of this year after making a Y265bn (Pounds 1.7bn) write-off on its US film interests. Sony apart, 1994 has been a good year for the industry on the revenue front. The US box office has taken more than Dollars 4.5bn so far this year against Dollars 4.35bn in the same period of 1993, according to Variety, the industry magazine. Christmas looks set to continue this success, with the top 30 US films having taken Dollars 100m during last weekend's Thanksgiving Holiday, ahead of 1993's Dollars 82m. Business is similarly buoyant in other countries with cinema attendances rising in new markets in Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America, as well as in western Europe where there has been heavy investment in new cinemas and multiplex complexes. Industry estimates suggest that markets outside the US now represent 60 per cent of box office returns, against 40 per cent 10 years ago. Despite this, success in the US is usually critical in determining a film's long-term prospects in other countries. 'This industry is glued to the Variety league tables,' said Mr Michael Kuhn, chairman of PolyGram Film Entertainment. 'If a movie isn't a hit when it opens in the US, it generally won't succeed elsewhere.' The rewards for successful films are higher than in the past, thanks to the growth in additional income from video, television and computer games. A Hollywood blockbuster now makes roughly 40 per cent of its total income from video, 20 per cent from television, 10 per cent from other sources and just 30 per cent from the cinema. The studios expect continued growth in these areas. They also hope for a further boost from video-CDs, which should be widely available by the end of 1995. With image and sound superior to cassettes, they could stimulate video sales just as compact discs boosted recorded music. This outlook has brought a flood of new investment to Hollywood. Mr Ted Turner, the cable TV entrepreneur, and PolyGram, the UK music group, have increased their film interests in the early 1990s by start-up and acquisition. Both had hits this year - Mr Turner with The Mask and PolyGram with Four Weddings and a Funeral - and are now moving on to bigger budget films. There is also the arrival of the 'dream team' of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's film division, Mr Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning director, and Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul. They appear to be having no difficulty in interesting investors in their plans for a new entertainment group. 'Everyone on Wall Street wants a slice of that pie,' said one investment banker. Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft, the world's largest software group, is also mooted as a likely investor. As a result of this influx, the industry has increased its output. More than 200 films have already been released in the US this year, against 190 in the same period of 1993, according to Hollywood Reporter, the trade magazine. There are now 252 films in production or pre-production, 44 more than at this time last year. The crowded market is forcing the studios to pay more to attract stars. The 'talent' deals hit the headlines - such as the news that New Line, one of Mr Turner's film subsidiaries, will pay Dollars 12m to Ms Julia Roberts and Dollars 8m to Ms Meg Ryan to star in its remake of The Women, the 1939 classic. But marketing costs are also escalating as competition intensifies. The total marketing budget of a Dollars 40m or Dollars 50m film will typically be Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m, with roughly Dollars 12m spent in the first weekend of a US launch. It can cost more to publicise a small film than to make it: Four Weddings and a Funeral took less than Dollars 5m to produce, but PolyGram spent Dollars 18m on publicity in the US. 'Why is movie marketing so expensive? Because people panic,' said Mr Frank Mancuso, chairman of MGM. 'There's so much money at stake when a film comes out. If the marketplace is cluttered, you've got to shout very loud to make your voice heard.' The increase in costs make unsuccessful films even more expensive. The failure of Frankenstein could cost Sony tens of millions of dollars. And even for the successful films, the returns may not be spectacular. Most studios now spread the risk of a flop by bringing in other investors or paying the stars with part of the profits. This cushions their exposure to flops, but also reduces their profits on hits. 'We're in a situation where it costs more to make a motion picture but the returns are getting smaller and smaller,' said Mr Sidney Sheinberg, president of MCA/Universal. As Sony's plight suggests, this situation cannot continue indefinitely. 'Assuming that this industry is composed of people not all of whom are totally stupid,' says Mr Sheinberg, 'we've got to do something to stop it.'  -------------------------------------------------------------- Hollywood: passing the screen test  -------------------------------------------------------------- Highest grossing films in the US and Canada  -------------------------------------------------------------- opening between 1 October and 27 November Film                            Studio        Week    Gross                                                     (Dollars m)  -------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

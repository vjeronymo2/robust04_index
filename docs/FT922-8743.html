			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / People: All change at Addison Consultancy Addison Consultancy, which is now Britain's biggest market research company following its takeover of AGB Research, is soon going to get a new name and a new chairman. But while there is little doubt about its new title - Taylor Nelson AGB - the company remains coy about who will take over from the retiring chairman, 60-year-old Liz Nelson, one of the doyens of the market research industry. Despite its name, the core of Addison's business is the successful Taylor Nelson market research operation. Founded by Liz Nelson, it was bought by Addison six years ago and was its last major acquisition, before that of AGB. As a result of the takeover of AGB, which has trebled the size of the company and been financed by a very big rights issue, the composition of the Addison board is changing. Two AGB directors, Mike Kirkham, 45, who had been managing director of AGB Television Worldwide, and Stephan Buck, 55, formerly AGB's group research director, have been appointed directors of the enlarged group. Kirkham becomes managing director and assumes day-to-day responsibility for the audits division and Buck, who will be a non-executive director, will focus on further development of the TV measurement and continuous panel activities. Apart from finding a replacement for Liz Nelson, it is expected that the number of French directors on the board will be reduced now that the shareholding of Virtus, a French market research firm, has been diluted from 26.06 per cent to 8.02 per cent. ***** Anthony Smurfit, eldest son of Michael Smurfit, chairman of JEFFERSON SMURFIT, the Irish paper, packaging and financial services group, has been promoted within his father's company. The 28-year old MBA graduate from Scranton University, Pennsylvania, has been appointed chief executive of the print and packaging division of Smurfit UK, with effect from June 29. He will report to his uncle, Dermot Smurfit, group joint deputy chairman, and chairman of Smurfit UK. Mike Smith, previous chief executive of Jefferson Smurfit's print, packaging and converting division, was recently appointed chief executive of API. The group's British operations, almost entirely made up of the print and packaging businesses, made a trading profit last year of IPounds 13.6m. Anthony Smurfit was previously the personal assistant to James Malloy, president and ceo of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation/Container Corporation of America. He has been with the company since 1986. ***** Jim Leng (above), currently chief executive of LOW &amp; BONAR'S European operations, will become group chief executive and md on the retirement in December of Roland Jarvis. ***** Richard Hickson, chief operating officer and senior vice-president, has been elected a director of HOLMES PROTECTION GROUP. ***** PEEK has appointed Anthony Gould md of Peek Ltd, its Asian subsidiary based in Hong Kong. ***** David Lemon, business development director of HEPWORTH's building products division, has been promoted to md. Previously he has mainly held posts in marketing management, apart from a couple of years as md of Glow-worm, the gas boiler company which was acquired by Hepworth in 1987. He joined the board last year. Lemon, 44, says that when the building products business was dominated by clay pipes, 'production was the thing'. Marketing had gained in importance as the division pushed into new fields with plastic plumbing systems and concrete pipes. He replaces John Carter, who was promoted to chief executive in March when illness forced Sinclair Thomson to resign.</p>

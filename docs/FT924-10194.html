			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: President calls up goblins - Falls hears Bush's horror stories HALLOWE'EN in the American Midwest is a time for goblin masks, witches' hats and pumpkin lanterns, but for President George Bush this weekend it brought a final chance to tell horror stories about what would happen if Governor Bill Clinton were to win tomorrow's presidential election. 'If you want to go the Clinton route, every day will seem like Hallowe'en - fright and terror, fright and terror, witches and devils everywhere,' Mr Bush proclaimed on Saturday as he meandered through the marshy flatlands of Wisconsin on a whistle-stop train trip. In Burlington, Oshkosh, Stevens Point and Chippewa Falls, the president returned repeatedly to the theme that Republicans hope will at the last minute bring their voters back: that Mr Clinton is inexperienced, untrustworthy and ready to take both sides of every issue. 'The pumpkin in the Arkansas governor's mansion has two faces: whatever side you're on, he's right there. You can't do that as president of the United States,' Mr Bush said. But Mr Bush could not stop a skeleton from rattling in his own closet, as a small aircraft flew over his head trailing a banner reading 'Iran Contra Haunts You'. Mr Bush at first ignored the issue, brought back to life by renewed evidence from the trial of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary, that as vice-president he was not, as he has asserted, 'out of the loop' on the deal to trade arms to Iran in exchange for the release of US hostages held in Lebanon. But in Oshkosh, confronted by a cluster of hostile placards waved by Clinton supporters, Mr Bush confronted Iran-Contra head on. He said his opponent had seized on the issue because he had started to panic that 'the power that he's lusted for is going to slip away from him.' 'He has now latched onto these silly little charges, accusations, in a desperate attempt to stop his free fall in the polls,' Mr Bush said. Despite the recent narrowing of the gap between Mr Bush and Mr Clinton in national opinion polls, the president's 40-hour visit to Wisconsin, a state he lost in 1988 to Mr Michael Dukakis, suggests that his campaign is still struggling to make up lost ground. Mr Tommy Thompson, the state's popular Republican governor, argues that it is possible for Mr Bush to win a majority in the presidential electoral college without Wisconsin's 11 votes, but he admits Mr Bush does not have 11 votes to spare. Because California has swung this year away from Mr Bush towards Mr Clinton, Republican campaign managers have had to rework their electoral college arithmetic. That they still need so badly to win Wisconsin speaks clearly of how difficult they are finding it to scrape together the 270 electoral college votes they need. It is clear, nevertheless, that the Bush campaign has regained some of its enthusiasm, and that the president is far from beaten yet. One promising sign is that Senator Robert Kasten, who earlier had kept his distance from Mr Bush's ailing campaign for fear of jeopardising his own re-election bid, joined the president at his railway rallies on Saturday. Governor Thompson is counting on supporters of Mr Ross Perot to decide that a vote for the Texas independent would be wasted. 'I am confident that over the course of the next hours, of these Perot supporters a higher proportion will go for George Bush than for Bill Clinton. That is what is going to carry Wisconsin for George Bush,' he says. But the governor still calls the race 'a toss-up. It is whoever gets their voters to the polls on Tuesday.' If that is so, the president may need to drum up more enthusiasm than he generated among the respectable but not ecstatic crowds who came to see him at the weekend. 'Our people shout louder, but maybe that's because we have bigger problems,' commented Mr Alexander Shulepov, a Russian student who is spending a year in Wisconsin.</p>

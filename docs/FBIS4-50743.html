			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 19 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said today he has not yet made his decision on the  renewal of China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status as  discussions with the Chinese have not been concluded.    He told a press conference at the White House this afternoon  that it is "a decision of great moment for this country." It  involves not only economic interests and human rights, but  "enormous national security interests and international security  considerations for a long time to come," he said.    He refused to talk about the on-going discussions with  China,  saying that "anything I say about them until we have concluded  them would be inappropriate."    Clinton has until June 3 to decide whether to extend China's  MFN for another year.    In the past few years, opposition to unconditional renewal  came mainly from the Democrats-dominated U.S. Congress.  However, the mood has shifted dramatically this year. More and  more lawmakers have come out in favor of separating trade from  human rights issues.    On Tuesday, 106 members of the House of Representatives,  Republicans and Democrats, urged Clinton in a letter to renew  China's MFN without conditions and set up a bilateral commission  to deal with human rights issues as an alternative to the annual  confrontation over MFN renewal.    And on Wednesday, U.S. House Speaker Thomas Foley declared  his support for not linking human rights with MFN. He said  withdrawal of MFN for China would be self-defeating in advancing  human rights.    Senator Bill Bradley (D) told the Senate on Wednesday [18  May] that the link between human rights and China's trade status  reflected "Cold War old-thinking" that had no place in a future  U.S.-Chinese relationship. "A decision to revoke or continue to  condition China's MFN status would be a blunder of historic  proportions," he said.    Senator Max Baucus (D) reiterated his opposition to MFN  conditions, which he described as "the economic equivalent of a  nuclear bomb." "We risk a Cold War with the biggest country in  the world. It would be folly," he warned.    Baucus also dismissed as unworkable the so-called "half  measures" such as limited sanctions or partial withdrawal of MFN  on certain categories of products entering the U.S. from China.    It was reported that supporters of MFN conditions like  Senate  Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosy  are preparing legislation to place some sanctions on China if  its MFN is retained.</p>

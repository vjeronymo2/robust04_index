			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Pounds 2.3m of memory chips stolen Computer memory chips worth Pounds 2.3m were stolen at the weekend from Haven Products in Greenock, Renfrewshire. The raid is believed to be the largest in a series of chip thefts in Europe in recent months. Strathclyde police said at least three raiders brandishing metal bars held a security guard hostage and loaded boxes of memory chips from a store into a lorry stolen from another site. Haven Products, founded in 1946 to employ people wounded in the second world war, was taken over by the British Red Cross in the early 1960s. It employs 150 people, of whom 90 are disabled.</p>

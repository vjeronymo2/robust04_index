			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a high-ranking government official,  the talks on Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights have entered a stage  where a showdown is likely. The Communist Chinese insist on  defining the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route as a direct,  cross-strait route after 1997. Using this as a premise, they  have expressed a willingness to grant new Taiwan-Hong Kong air  rights that will remain in force after 1997, with Mandarin  Airlines, Eva Airways Corporation, and Hong Kong's Cathay  Pacific Airways jointly operating the route. However, we  continue to define this air route as an international one.    According to the official, Communist China recently informed  us through certain channels that it had no objection to the  contents of an agreement proposed by Taiwan regarding new  Taiwan-Hong Kong air rights. It signaled its willingness to  allow the new aviation agreement to remain valid beyond Hong  Kong's great threshold of 1997, by extending the term of the new  aviation agreement until the year 2000. Additionally, Communist  China did not take issue with Eva Airways Corporation's role in  operating the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, in order to satisfy  our demand for "designating several airlines" to operate the  route.    A precondition for Communist China's acceptance of the  aforementioned terms, however, is that we must view the  Taiwan-Hong Kong route as a direct route across the Taiwan  Strait, or a "domestic route" within China's boundaries, after  1997; that Taiwan may not use aircraft bearing the characters  "Republic of China" [ROC] or painted with the ROC's emblem or  flag on the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route; and that Taiwan may not  take advantage of the air route to implement the policy of "two  China's." In other words, China Airlines may not join in the  operation of the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route.    Currently, we have a substantial difference of opinion with  Communist China regarding the definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong  air route after 1997. The official noted: Our position is that  although Communist China will retake Hong Kong after 1997, we  will define and juristically proclaim Hong Kong and Macao as  special regions different from Mainland China, and that  continuing flights to those regions by Taiwan's aircraft after  1997 will not be taken as direct flights across the Taiwan  Strait.    The policy-making official stated: Although we will not  challenge Communist China's definition of the Taiwan-Hong Kong  air route as a domestic one, we will continue to view it as an  international route. This will allow the two sides to define  the route differently. With regard to China Airlines'  withdrawal from the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route, the official  said: The flexible practice of replacing China Airlines with  Mandarin Airlines is not without precedent; this is our current  mode of air services with Vietnam and Europe. There should be  no serious problem provided China Airlines agrees to the  arrangement.    The official stated: Some people recently proposed that  Taiwan, Communist China, and a foreign country jointly finance  and establish a new international airline company, which will  allow Taiwan, Communist China, and Hong Kong to make use of this  joint venture's ambiguous status to diminish the sensitivity of  trilateral politics. After 1997, the company will be allowed to  operate the Taiwan-Hong Kong air route exclusively.</p>

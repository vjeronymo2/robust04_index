			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman with domestic </F> and foreign correspondents in the presidential palace in Zagreb  -- live]    [Text] [Tudjman] Despite the fact that the preliminary  Washington agreement has been received by all people of goodwill  and all responsible political factors both in the country and in  the world not only with understanding but also with the  assessment that it is of great importance -- this agreement to  bring the war to an end and create the preconditions for a  lasting peace in this area and create a new international order  -- there are those who, either for reasons of political  opportunism or because they do not understand or because of a  malicious interpretation, want to belittle this agreement and  even ascribe to it a significance that it does not have [as  heard].    It could be said that there are two main criticisms. One is  that this is a turnabout in previous Croatian state policy and  the policy of the Croatian president, and the second is that  Croatia has in this way accepted the U.S. diktat. What is our  position here? Is this a turnabout?    Although I have said something about this in my statements,  nevertheless, precisely because this is being repeated, I too  will repeat: Croatian state policy, and my own personal policy,  in fact has consistently prepared for such a solution.  Remember: We recommended, and I personally did so -- to  representatives of the Croatian people and to the  representatives of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] who were  elected at the first democratic elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina  -- that the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina should take  part in a referendum for an independent (?Bosnia).    After this we did not accept everything and sign everything  ostensibly offered to us just like that -- as some have said --  but we sought solutions which might be in the interests of the  Croatian people as a whole, in the interests of Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, of the Croatian state, and also of the  international community in creating peace on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe. So we  were the ones who proposed and gave impetus to acceptance from  the beginning of a cantonal solution to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, this was not accepted because the  Serb side, especially the Serb side, and the Muslim side, did  not accept this cantonal system.    Then it was we who, seeking a solution in those  circumstances, suggested and accepted Bosnia-Herzegovina's  organization as a set of provinces, meaning a community or an  organization of provinces which would suit all three peoples.  This was not acepted either. This means that on our part it  was a matter of seeking solutions within the framework of  Bosnia-Herzegovina which would satisfy all three peoples. This  was not accepted either.    We then went on to find a solution which would be accepted  --  as the world has always said and is still saying today -- which  would satisfy all three peoples. Later on, in the framework of  the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, a proposal was  tabled whereby Bosnia-Herzegovina would be organized as a union  of three republics. Consequently, in this context of resolving  the problems, far from being passive observers, we were active  factors, active subjects in the course of such a solution which  would save Bosnia- Herzegovina and which would also be in the  interest of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole  and in the interest of the protection of the Croatian state's  strategic interests.    From this point of view -- given that solutions were being  postponed and given that the Croats first faced Serbian  aggression and then when the Serbian aggression was over and  when the Serbs had conquered 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's  territory, when the Muslims turned against the Croats partly  because of the influence of extremist elements, we were  supporting and organizing the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina  throughout all that time so that they could put up resistance to  aggression and safeguard Croat interests.    Consequently, we also supported the creation of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna as opposed to the secession of the so-  called Serb republic and as opposed to the Muslim leadership's  ambition -- an ambition that was clearly expressed at some  stages -- to create their independent Muslim state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, we supported the creation of  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and this was not in the least  at odds with our continuing initiatives. On the contrary, this  was geared toward securing Croat interests, toward the creation  of -- both in a political and a military sense -- a situation  whereby the interests of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina  must be taken into account on the basis of what the Croat people  had achieved in defending themselves from the aggression.    That is enough on whether this is a turnabout or whether  acceptance of the Washington agreement is in line with the  Croatian policies Croatia has been pursuing since day one.    After all, that can be seen from my letter to President  Clinton of more than a year ago, from my repeated suggestions  during talks with Messrs Izetbegovic and Silajdzic and from  written proposals tabled in Bonn and Petersburg. Therefore, this  is no turnabout, but a consistent policy implemented by the main  Croat party in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which won absolute majority  of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and by the Croatian  state leadership and me personally.    Concerning the other piece of criticism, that Croatia  allegedly accepted a diktat, I think that I have already  answered that too. Croatia has definitely not accepted a diktat  and, as alleged, sold its interests for some $500 million.  Croatia's policy has since the very beginning been too  consistent to accept anyone's diktat or to sell itself for any  amount of money. But, Croatia's policy and I personally  accepted with gratitude the involvement by the United States and  main European countries, and we especially appreciated and  viewed as a historic event the fact that the United States  managed to reach an agreement with the main European states and  that it has taken over the initiative to find this solution of  the preliminary Washington agreement.    The Washington agreement on the creation of a  Croat-Bosniak-Muslim federation in Bosnia and on federal  Bosnia-Herzegovina entering a confederal union with Croatia is  no diktat, but it is in line with the policy we have been  implementing, which has been and remains in the interest of the  Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian state.    This is all I wanted to say at the beginning of the news  conference. Feel free to ask me questions.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have said that this  agreement in Washington has received a great deal of attention.  I would nevertheless like to ask something from a journalistic  point of view. It has also received a great deal of attention  from the world media, over 60 TV networks carried shorter or  longer excerpts from your address. The majority of  international news agencies did the same. What is your comment  on this really high level of interest on the part of the world  media? And also what do you say about the Serb comments which  say that Croatia has played a winning card and taught the Serbs  a lesson about how national interests should be protected?  Thank you.    [Tudjman] I have not yet heard these Serb comments.  Obviously, there is sometimes common sense there too, so things  are seen as they should be seen. The fact that people in the  world demonstrate such a high level of interest proves that this  Yugoslav crisis threatened to fuel the spread of war, that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis in objective terms was and still is  one of the most complicated in today's world, and that the world  sighed with slight relief as the principal factors of the world  - the European Union [EU] states, the leading states of the EU,  and the United States in its capacity as the main world power --  have at last realized that some more determined steps should be  taken, that they have agreed on these steps and that,  consequently, the world has welcomed this agreement as a way out  of this war and crisis that have been threatening not only to  spread the method of settling accounts by means of war but also  to bring about a conflict of civilizations.    This is the significance of the agreement not only for us,  who are directly involved, but for the world too. After all,  the involvement of the world's and Europe's powers, the United  States on the one hand and the Russian Federation on the other,  made it evident that this is not only a matter of drawing  borders between Croatia and Serbia; Serbia and the Muslims.  This is therefore also in a sense a matter of drawing borders  between the worlds and civilizations which have existed here on  this soil since the break-up of the Roman empire, including the  well-known Yalta agreement, and so forth.    Consequently, this is a matter of decisive and fateful  solutions which will reverberate, not only reverberate but they  will also have a decisive influence on the future development of  relations in southeast Europe and, consequently, in the world  too.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you comment on the  fact that Mr. Alija Izetbegovic has so yet made no direct  comment on the Washington agreement? In the latest issue of  LJILJAN [Bosnian Muslim newspaper] we could read Alija  Izetbegovic's seven theses which show that he has not given up  on the concept of a unitary civic state.    [Tudjman] I think that Mr. Izetbegovic had to agree with Mr.  Silajdzic before Silajdzic put his signature on the Washington  agreement. The fact that he has so far not spoken in public  could perhaps be explained by Mr. Izetbegovic not being as quick  as he usually was, which resulted in his search for a solution  occasionally showing inconsistencies or attempts to pass the  blame for the clashes between Muslims and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Croatia.    Someone has drawn my attention to his recent statement on  fascism from the left and right, and it is obviously not clear  what he referred to.    However, I think that it is important that Mr. Izetbegovic  had to give his approval to the Washington agreement, and that  in the talks we have held, Mr. Izetbegovic agreed that there is  a need for coexistence of Croats and Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have also signed public and -- I can say  this today -- secret agreements on a confederal solution such as  this one. However, after that he also signed other agreements,  for example the famous agreement with the Serbs in which he  accepted the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina because the  agreement specified that in the event of the division, that is,  if Serbia [as heard] opted out, the rights of an international  entity -- that is the right to UN membership -- would pass on to  the Muslim republic.    Anyhow, all these events took place in the very complex  circumstances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. In my opinion,  it is important today that we have this solution which Mr.  Silajdzic already signed, and which I believe to have Mr.  Izetbegovic's approval.    [Correspondent] [name indistinct], VJESNIK editor. Mr.  President, will a referendum be held in Croatia on the  confederal relationship or a federation between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina? And is there a possibility that this  confederation might also be joined by the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY]? Thank you.    [Tudjman, laughing] A referendum will certainly be held  because this is envisaged in the Croatian Constitution. But  where you got the idea that this confederation will be joined by  Yugoslavia -- this I really do not know. I do not think there  will be such a referendum in Croatia. Allow me -- as I said in  my message -- we are continuing to adhere to the policy of the  need and necessity for the normalization of relations between  Croatia and Serbia and Yugoslavia.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, if I can ask a question.  Something which is not looking as far into the future as my  colleague (Sejakovic) suggested: What would happen -- would  there be a confederation of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  with Croatia or the Republic of Croatia? To what extent would  the Bosnian Serbs agree to a federative or rather a cantonal  system in Bosnia? As far as I know Mr. Redman has just come up  with this idea in Belgrade today. I have another question which  is more important -- perhaps you could answer this first. You  probably already know the vague outlines of the future  super-counties or cantons in Bosnia. What will happen with the  canton or what will happen to the Croatian part of Bosnian  Posavina? Is there a possibility that this might cut through  the Serb corridor with the western part of Bosnia? Thank you.    [Tudjman] What might happen and what will happen if the  current so-called Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina agrees to  remain in a federal or confederal relationship with  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I would not like to speculate on this. It  is difficult to imagine something like this. It also seems to  me that this proposal and initiative by the main international  factors starts from the fact that there will not be such a  thing. However, in any event responsible people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina must consider this but, of course, from a  Croatian point of view this represents a new element which we  will consider with full responsibility and bearing in mind the  interests of the Croatian people as a whole and the Croatian  state.    Understandably, Posavina, the territory of Bosnian Posavina  was -- as everyone knows -- purely Croatian in historic terms.  It was envisaged as a Croat canton. This issue will be solved  as a whole in the organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation, that is between the Muslims and the Croats and even  the Serbs. As you said yourself, I believe that the emphasis,  that the efforts will now be focused on persuading the Serbs --  something that is indicated by Mr. Redman's visit to Belgrade --  to accept a solution that would be acceptable to the other two  peoples.    [Redzep] Diana Redzep, Deutsche Welle. Mr. President, the  Serbian press, citing Mr. Simic's statements, are heralding  Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Zagreb in the near future or,  alternatively, your visit to Belgrade. Are you getting ready  for such a visit -- which inevitably leads to the question: Why  is Croatia sending its official representative to Belgrade at a  time when foreign diplomats have left it, and what is the  country he has been sent to? Thank you.    [Tudjman] As far as foreign diplomats are concerned, as far  as I know they are just coming back to Belgrade. They left  Belgrade at the moment when it was being debated whether the  ultimatum and air strikes would incite large-scale flames of  war, so they would be threatened. As far as I know, they are  coming back.    Croatia is sending its representative, it is opening its  office in Belgrade in order to bring about the normalization of  relations, a normalization of relations that is not only in the  interest of the Croatian people, so we can integrate as soon as  possible the Croatian territories under the protection of the  peace forces without warfare, but also because the normalization  of relations between Croatia and Serbia is also a precondition  for the creation of the new world order in the area of the  former Yugoslavia in this part of southeast Europe.    Consequently, this was and still is our policy. But this is  also the policy of the responsible world factors, Europe and  even the United States, as you can see even in the fact that  President Clinton's envoy is also visiting Belgrade.  Consequently, it is impossible to rule out negotiations with  Belgrade. We welcome the fact that the international community,  headed by the United States, has at last realized that more  decisive steps should be taken if these negotiations fail, if  there is no success.    [Correspsondent] HRVATSKI VJESNIK, Vinkovci. Mr. President,  the result of your continuous policy of cooperation and  friendship with Croats of Islamic faith, or Bosniak-Muslims will  be the signing of the federal and confederal agreements. I  would like to know whether you will accept and whether you can  accept Mr. Izetbegovic's view that the Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are the occupying force and that they are not  a constituent people any more, but a national minority, which  has been confirmed on Croatian Television by Bosnia-  Herzegovina's ambassador to Croatia.    [Tudjman] I will first refer to the previous question and  then I will return to yours. I have not heard so far that we  had already announced my trip to Belgrade or Milosevic's arrival  in Zagreb. In any case that has not been discussed and that  cannot happen before our relations are normalized, until Croatia  is diplomatically recognized in its borders. I would welcome  such a meeting, but only provided that we have first achieved a  peaceful solution, reintegrated Croatian territories into the  constitutional and legal system of Croatia, and provided  Belgrade has given up the occupation of these territories.  Belgrade is still involved in the occupation of Croatian  territories through providing weapons and through including Knin  and so-called Krajina in its monetary system etc. When our  relations are normalized in such a way I will accept such a  meeting. As I have once said: For the sake of peace and in  order to stop the bloodshed of Croat people, to enable Croats to  live normal lives, I am willing to go even to hell and back. I  have said this once before and I stick to it.    And now your question. It is clear that the Serbs were  aggressors, first through the Yugo-communist army, and then  through Serbia's expansionist policy, in their attempts to  create Greater Serbia. They first occupied a third of Croatia's  territory, or rather that third of the territory that remained  in their hands -- they had, with the Yugoslav army, held the  whole of Croatia. They were holding one third, and then we  liberated a part of it -- there is still a quarter of our  territory under the protection of the peace-keeping forces, or  under Serb occupation.    It is also a fact that they are holding two thirds of  Bosnia-  Herzegovina under their authority, and -- clearly, it can be  said -- under their occupation. But it is also a fact that the  Serbs are one of the three constituent peoples there and that  the international community accepts this fact and has negotiated  with representatives of the Bosnian Serbs so far, as well as  with Belgrade. In conducting our policy we have to take this  reality into consideration, and we have to adjust our policy to  the real state of affairs and to the facts of international  politics.    [Paradzic] Zeljko Paradzic, GLAS SLAVONIJE. Mr. President,  can you comment on statements by Assembly Deputy Speaker, Mr.  Djukic, that the Serbs will never accede to being a national  minority in Croatia; also, which guarantee is the world  community offering to ensure that the occupied Croatian areas --  that Belgrade will give them up? Thank you.    [Tudjman] The position of Serbs in Croatia is set out in the  Croatian constitution and in a special constitutional law which  we adopted in agreement with the EC arbitration commission and  the European conference on the former Yugoslavia, so statements  by individuals along these lines cannot change anything.    Your other question -- on guarantees. The statements by the  most responsible world factors, the heads of almost all main  states, not only foreign ministers but also state statesmen, and  the most important European states and the United States [words  indistinct]. However, the guarantee of the world organization  of the United Nations -- which in all its resolutions,  especially resolution 871, confirms and guarantees the  territorial integrity of independent Croatia -- is more  important.    In these circumstances Croatia has demonstrated that it is  an  effective factor in precisely these international attempts to  resolve all sober questions in the modern world in a peaceful  way and in not allowing individual national minorities to cause  the destruction of sovereign states and the provocation of  general war chaos.    In these circumstances when Croatia has on its side both the  EU and the main world great power of the United Nations, when  our agreement is also being welcomed by the Islamic countries,  in these circumstances we can really be sure that we will have  the support of all these international factors and that we will  realize the incorporation of these Croatian territories under UN  protection into the constitutional and legal system of Croatia  in a peaceful way. If this is not successful, then we would have  the political support for those steps which we would have to  take -- and it is in this that the success of Croatian state  policy and the far-reaching nature of the agreement which we  have signed is reflected.    [Skugor] Milana Skugor, HINA. Mr. President, how far has the  process of dividing [former] Yugoslavia's assets gone, and can  we see what Croatia will get? My second question is about  preparations for the tourist season. What is the Croatian  government doing to bring back tourists who used to come before  the war?    [Tudjman] Okay, please, can you ask just one question at a  time from now on? I cannot remember two.    Tourism. The Croatian Government is already taking steps.  You could have read that there have been echoes of this  [Washington] agreement at the Berlin tourist congress, whatever  that gathering is called. It is certain that the agreement in  itself, and especially its implementation, will have a  considerable impact not only on the revival but also on the  development of tourism in Croatia at a level higher than before.    Your first question referred to the succession.    Concerning the Croatian delegation and the delegations of  the  other countries -- from Slovenia to Macedonia -- they have made  quite a good progress in solving all those problems with the  help of the EU negotiators taking part in negotiations on the  division of assets. However, the Serb -- that is Yugoslav --  delegation obstructed the negotiations and prevented them from  reaching an agreement.    This step in the search for peace, in forcing all those --  and primarily Belgrade -- who are in one way or another involved  in the overall crisis, and consequently in the problem of the  succession will be forced to solve that problem [as heard].  Both we and the world understand that the solving of the  problem of the succession -- as well as the occupation of the  Croatian areas -- cannot be postponed for a long time, because  that means that Belgrade has the assets which belonged to the  former Yugoslavia. That problem needs to be put on the agenda  to be solved as soon as possible.    Besides, in connection with this, there is a question of a  practical nature. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is now placing part of the heavy weaponry  under its control. It would probably be very useful if those  weapons did not come again -- for any purpose -- into the hands  of the aggressor and the Serbian army, the Serbian side in whose  possession they have been until now, but were instead destroyed  or put at the disposal of the others. Personally, I prefer the  destruction and a financial deal to solve that part of the  succession, which to a large extent involves weaponry.    [Ggorgyi] Orban Gyorgyi, Hungarian Radio. Mr. President,  is there a certain fear that a confederal resolution of state  relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia  could serve the Serbs in the so-called Krajina in their demand  for a confederation with Serbia, and unfortunately also  statements by Mr. Churkin indicate the complexity of possible  parallels [as heard]. What do you think about this?    [Tudjman] First of all, one cannot compare the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina - the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims in Bosnia-  Herzegovina -- with the Serbs in Croatia. The Serbs, Croats,  and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are three constituent peoples  of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereas the Serbs in Croatia -- the  ethnic Serb community -- are a minority in Croatia. Their  position is set out in the Croatian constitution and  constitutional law. So they do not have any right to  self-determination; and it is clearly stated in international  conventions that minorities do not have the right to  self-determination, and this is the case in practice in the  world as well, because if this were recognized, if the right of  all minorities to self-determination and separation were  recognized, no international order would be possible and general  chaos and general war would ensue.    [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. Will we have a  referendum on establishing of confederal relations with the  Bosnia- Herzegovina federation before the Bosnian Serbs decide  where they want to be -- whether they will remain in the Bosnian  federation or join Yugoslavia? And which part of Bosnia can the  Bosnian Serbs take out with them, and what consequences does  this have, bearing in mind that Croatia has a narrow coastal  strip?    [Tudjman] We certainly will not hold a referendum until the  Serb question in Bosnia-Herzegovina is resolved, for the final  confederal agreement cannot be reached until that issue is  clear. As you know, the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina at their  meeting in Mostar yesterday and before that put forward a  justified demand -- that they can agree to a confederation  within Bosnia-Herzegovina only if a confederation with Croatia  is subsequently to be founded.    I believe this demand is justified, although the draft  constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation also  guarantees complete equality to the Croats and full sovereignty  on the territories where they are the majority population. The  cantons are envisaged to have their own constitutions, their  legislative authorities, their own budget, police, president.  It is also envisaged that the cantons where Croats are in the  majority should form a Croat council for coordination of the  Croat policy in federal organs. Full equality is guaranteed to  the Croats within the federal organs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It  is envisaged that the president and vice president of the  federation are elected every four years, that one is a Croat and  the other is a Muslim, and that the president's nationality  changes every four years. Full equality is also guaranteed in  the government. At least one-third of ministers have to be of  Croat nationality, although the Croat population in the  federation is not as large. The prime minister, deputy prime  minister, and ministers also have deputies, one is Croat, the  other Muslim. Therefore, full equality and participation is  guaranteed to the Croats in the whole of the state  administration of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    The important issues, if they may be in the government,  because the government will reflect the composition of the  population, but perhaps if the government includes a larger  number of ministers of other nationalities, the Muslim  nationality or others that would remain in the Bosnian  federation, decisions on the important issues can only be taken  by a consensus [sentence as heard]. Therefore, nothing can be  imposed on the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina that would  contravene their interests.    This is envisaged both as regards the president and the vice  president of the federation, as regards both chambers of the  parliament, the government, judiciary, the state prosecutor and  so on. Therefore, with this solution the Croats are gaining not  only what they now have in their hands, what they have managed  to defend from the Serb aggression, and managed to preserve in  this conflict with the Muslims, but also all the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are gaining an opportunity to secure not only  their national survival, but also an opportunity to be involved  in the state administration throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, which  is then particularly included that, the confederal alliance with  Croatia is also creating favorable conditions [as heard].    Of course, this does not mean that the Muslims are thus  being  put in an inferior position. Full equality is being secured  between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat nations regarding their  equality in interests in the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and  in the confederation with Croatia, which is also in the  interest, as I said in my address to the nation, which is in the  interest of the Western democratic world. To exclude  nationalist or extremist fundamentalist elements and to  streamline this federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina toward the  Western world, the Western democracy in the sense of eternal  (?watersheds) in this part of Europe by relying on Croatia and  through the cooperation between the Croat and the Bosniak-Muslim  nations [sentence as heard].    [Correspondent] I asked [words indistinct] will go to  Yugoslavia?    [Tudjman] This remains to be seen. Anyway, our interests are  one thing and Serbia's interests are another. Still, I believe  it is evident that in this case we have reached a stage where  agreement has been reached between Croatian views and the views  of major European states and even the United States as the  world's main superpower. Once we have reached this stage we can  say that the issue is not just our issue but that of those main  world powerlines and factors and that it will be examined from  this point of view too.    On my part I have suggested, as I put forward proposals in  the past, I have now again put forward some proposals which are  regarded from precisely this world and strategic point of view  as very interesting and which will be considered by these  factors who are being preoccupied with resolving the crisis and  who will take final decisions.    [al-Isa] Nada al-Isa, Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV. I  would like to ask you to comment on the increasingly frequent  rumors, at least that is what you can read in the Croatian  press, originating in Herzegovina, Herceg-Bosna, according to  which the message is as follows: We are not going to stay in  any kind of Bosnia-Herzegovina union, whatever its name, unless  the Serbs are there too, that is in the event of the Serbs  joining the so-called Yugoslavia. Your comment, please.    [Tudjman] I believe that these views were in evidence when  the talk was of a union of three republics. At yesterday's  meeting the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna and the  political leadership of Herceg-Bosna generally welcomed this  preliminary Washington agreement. Their only condition  stipulates that a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation is in a  confederation with Croatia. Consequently, this is my answer to  your question.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] the Serbs were the first  to violate the cease-fire again yesterday when they shelled  Gospic. What is your comment on this?    [Tudjman] You have already seen -- especially in that air  attack by Serb planes on the factories in Bugojno and Novi  Travnik and also in some provocations on Croatian soil -- that  in the Serb ranks there are those who oppose a peaceful solution  and who particularly want to provoke a renewal of the war in  Croatia in order to draw attention away from the problem of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the face of the resolve of the  international community to find a solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina  before going for the decisive incorporation of Croatian  territory under control of the peacekeeping forces in Croatia,  they wanted to thwart this or rather provoke war, and the  renewal of the war.    Such things will happen and it is to be expected on the Serb  side too -- both in the protected areas and especially in  Belgrade -- that reason will prevail and that we will reach a  general solution precisely with what we have achieved.    [Nareshkin] Nareshkin, ITAR-TASS. Mr. President, what can be  expected from Mr. Granic's visit to Moscow on 9 March? Thank  you.    [Tudjman] Well, the invitation sent by Minister Kozyrev to  our foreign minister indicates that the government of Russia has  hitherto tried to act constructively and has acted  constructively to resolve the crisis on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia and, regardless of the fact that many consider  that it has one-sidedly placed itself on the side of Serbia, we  can say with our experience that the government of the Russian  Federation has come out in favor of the territorial integrity of  Croatia and that it has proposed to Belgrade that it recognize  Croatia and establish diplomatic relations on this basis.    Mr. Churkin -- during his stay here in Croatia and in his  talks with the Serbs in Knin -- also proposed that they begin to  have talks to find a peaceful solution to the Serb question in  Croatia. So we see the invitation to our foreign minister,  Granic, to visit Moscow as the continuation of Russia's positive  policy, i.e. Russia is not one-sidedly on the side of Serbia or  what it has achieved through its aggression, but Russia wants to  have a positive influence in the sense that, in agreement both  with the EU and the United States, Russia will also play a  positive role in finding a lasting solution.    [Modric] Franja Modric, NOVI LIST. Please, Mr. President, to  what extent would this powerful international community led by  the United States succeed in forcing the Bosnian Serbs into a  Bosnian federation? Would you say in this case that Croatia  should enter a confederation with such a Bosnia-Herzegovina or  not? In other words, if you were to support entry at that time  what would Croatia's interest be in joining a confederal union?    [Tudjman] I said that we would consider this question if and  when this might happen. In any event, it is one kind of  confederation if there is to be only a federation of Croats with  Bosniak Muslims, and it is another kind of confederation if it  is also to include Serbs. I do not rule out that Croatia could  have an interest in this if this were to happen, but of course,  as I said, this would be in a different kind of confederation.    In any event it is in Croatia's interest that conditions are  created to prevent a Serb expansionist policy aimed at creating  a Greater Serbia and conquering even Croatian territory -- and  this kind of Serb expansionist policy -- and to this end we have  strong guarantees not only for the organization of  Bosnia-Herzegovina but also from the international community.    [Kuzmanovic] Jasmina Kuzmanovic, AP. Mr. President, if the  decision on a confederation with the Bosnian republic is  implemented....    [Tudjman, interrupting] I do not understand, if?    [Kuzmanovic] Mr. President, if the confederation begins  truly  to function in real life, is there a possibility that the  Bosniaks and Croats together might recover some territories in  Bosnia-Herzegovina? For example, they could set out to regain  the north, the corridor where the Bosnian Serbs seem to have  been rather nervous over the past few days and are launching a  counteroffensive in the area. Thank you.    [Tudjman] The agreement which we signed, toward which we are  aspiring, is not an agreement to continue the war, but to end  the war. We believe that the international community -- as it  is oriented today, including major European states and the  United States -- must play the main role in solving the issues  of borders in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Tudjen] Branko Tudjen, VECERNJI LIST. My question will not  have such political overtones, something that is a little  unusual. For the second time I am recalling the fact that I was  a sports reporter for a number of years. There are a great deal  of sports problems which in my view are not negligible. This  one is about football, about coaches, selectors, Markovic,  Blazevic, Ivic, and so forth. The newspapers are full of that.  I am saying this as the editor of a newspaper which finds this  issue very important. Your name is being plugged in a way into  this issue among the public -- as if you are taking part in  this, you have decided in favor of one person or another. This  whole crisis is being linked to you, too. I would like you to  comment on this?    [Tudjman] Yes, there is no such evil. Sometimes it is good  that it is ascribed to me. I am interested in having Croatian  sports based on sound foundations. As far as the national team  is concerned, it is a fact that today we have a number of  European and world-class footballers in the world. This means  that the Croatian national team could be an ambassador of this  new democratic Croatia just as Ivanisevic and athletes in other  fields are. Internal competitions in Croatia are organized in  line with Croatian potentials. In this way Croatian clubs could  represent Croatia in Europe on a long-term basis and be present  as representatives of a people who have won their international  recognition, something to which athletes can contribute in all  areas.    At the same time machinations and swindles are being  prevented from taking place as well as, above all, unsupervised  spending in professional sport, and to a degree Croatia, as it  is, cannot bear [as heard]. This is how much I am interested in  my capacity as president of state. Not to mention that I know  the importance of sport, that I like sport very much and that I  know the importance of sport for the health of the young and  even the entire people.    I have no connection with individual cases, whether this or  that person will be. I do not want to take part in this.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SEMITISM IN POLAND  </P> <P> Piotr Pacewicz writes in "The 'Other Poland' Votes for a Miracle" (Opinion,  Dec. 2) that Polish television "gave equal free time for all candidates'  campaigns." Imagine what would have happened here in the United States November  if we had such a democracy! In our "free elections" the media are available  only to those candidates with enough money to buy them.  </P> <P> JACK MITCHELL, Cedapines Park  </P></p>

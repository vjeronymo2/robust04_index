Wellcome separately announced it had filed dossiers for Valtrex, its new oral shingles treatment, in 19 countries. The group claims Valtrex, whose generic name is valaciclovir, works more quickly than Zovirax and is just as safe. Analysts said the submissions had been due during the second half of the year, but that it was pleasing they had been so early.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A general strike was observed in Jerusalem and  other occupied Arab territories for the second consecutive day  in protest against the self-rule agreement. A period of general  mourning, called for by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement],  prevails throughout the occupied Arab territories.    News agencies described the atmosphere in the occupied  territories. They said a state of apprehension and  disappointment is prevailing in these territories.  'Abd-al-Karim Sidr, a leading Fatah member in Jericho,  described the situation in Jericho as inconvenient. He said  there is Palestinian anxiety because of the large gap between  Palestinians in the occupied territories and the Palestinian  team that negotiates with Israel. [passage omitted]    Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, and Dr. George Habash,  secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, held a news conference yesterday. They criticized  the Cairo agreement, saying that it does not meet the  Palestinian people's demands and that it completely ignores both  the UN resolutions and international legitimacy. Hawatimah and  Habash added that this agreement will not be binding on the  Palestinian people.    Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command, said the agreement  would fail within three months. In a statement, Jibril added  that the Alliance of Palestinian Forces will continue its  struggle against Israeli occupation.    The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said the self-rule  agreement bestows legitimacy on occupation, injustice, and  repression, adding that this agreement will not last long.  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official Hamas spokesman, stressed the  failure of the agreement on implementing the self-rule, which  was signed by 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo the day before  yesterday. This agreement will not succeed, he noted.    In a statement yesterday, Ghawshah added that the agreement  does not meet any of the Palestinian people's aspirations and  demands regarding liberation, repatriation, self-determination,  and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Instead, the  agreement increased the Palestinian people's fragmentation and  revealed the impotence and fragility of the PLO leadership in  Tunis. Ghawshah said the most serious result of this agreement  is that it diverted attention from Israeli occupation and  created tremendous internal contradictions, which Rabin and  Peres sought to foster when they promptly signed the agreement.    Concluding his statement, Ghawshah called on the Palestinian  people in and outside the occupied territories to close ranks  and unify their position in order to topple this agreement.

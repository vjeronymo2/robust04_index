			<p>BFN     [Text] Industry Minister Liliana Canale has stated that as  a result of the elimination of both subsidies and state  intervention in the economy, investments in our country will  total approximately $6 billion over the next five years.  Emphasizing the significance of an adequate opening toward the  private sector and toward market forces, she said: "We are  speaking about a figure that will be five times larger than the  accrued investment reported up to 1993."    In this respect, she said she is pleased to note that the  government, businessmen, academicians, and politicians agree on  "a guiding approach to the country's development model that  should be followed in the short and medium term."    Canale noted that China has become the third leading  investor  in our country. She added that there is great demand in China  for products and raw materials that we could sell them if we had  the adequate scale of production.    During a lecture at the Peruvian Center for International  Studies (Cepei), the industry minister again called upon  businessmen to redouble their efforts to reach other markets and  the various trade blocs existing in the world. She emphasized  the need to reach Asian and European markets with competitive  prices.    Commenting on Peruvian relations with Pacific Rim countries,  Canale said efforts are being made to promote relations not only  with China and Japan, but also with other countries because the  most dynamic economies are located in that area. Regarding  Peru's geographic location, she said: Our geographic, economic,  and labor conditions will enable us to rapidly win those major  markets.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Management: Taking stock of windfalls - Executive share options face closer scrutiny The days when directors of badly performing companies could enjoy windfall gains from exercising their executive share options are over. Last month's joint announcement from Britain's largest investor bodies has put a stop to that: from now on any scheme that does not relate the exercise of share options to the company's performance may find itself slung out by shareholders. The long-awaited recommendation from the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds has left companies alternately gnashing their teeth and scratching their heads. Most objected vigorously to any idea that their schemes should be tied to performance and many wrote to the NAPF last year to complain when it asked them for their opinions. They must now accept that their battle is lost. At the same time as protesting against any performance link, companies pleaded for flexibility. In this their pleas have been answered. The guidelines do not refer to any particular measure of performance, but simply state there should be 'significant and sustained improvement in underlying financial performance'. However the vagueness of this recommendation has left them in the dark. What sort of performance link will be acceptable? The question is of pressing interest to companies as most of their 10-year schemes come up for renewal next year. For the new schemes to win shareholders' approval, they must not only be linked to performance, but must have been drawn up by the company's independent remuneration committee and the guidelines must be published in the annual report. According to Mark Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants, executive pay experts, companies are feeling in need of guidance on how stringent the performance targets should be. But the investor bodies - which have taken almost a year to agree on the recommendation - seem in no mood to lay down more precise guidelines. 'Our message is that whatever your remuneration committee recommends is the most appropriate measure. If the committee can't come up with a reasonable measure there are 101 consultants out there who would be only too happy to find them one,' says John Rogers from the NAPF. So which measures will companies choose? Perhaps the simplest is that initially proposed by the NAPF: relative share-price performance. It suggested that directors should be allowed to exercise share options only if their shares out-performed the market index, or a sub-index over a given period. The main alternative is to use profit-related measures, originally preferred by the ABI. Both yardsticks have weaknesses, share prices can be inflated by bid pressure and reflect future as well as past performance. Profit measures on the other hand have been complicated by new accounting rules which make earnings more volatile. Once the measure has been selected how stringent should the target be? Is any out-performance of the share price enough? Should earnings be in the top quartile of the industry group, or is it enough merely for them to rise faster than inflation. These are issues that each remuneration committee will have to decide and it will be a delicate balancing act. 'You don't want something so difficult that the options will never kick in, but you don't want something so easy that it is a joke,' says Hugh Jones from the Prudential. He argues that to strike the balance should not be too difficult: after all there is an element of judgment in all business decisions and this one is no exception. Shareholders hope the discipline of having to disclose the basis for the schemes will concentrate the minds of companies. Moreover, the non-executive directors who sit on remuneration committees will have the sobering thought that if they nod through schemes that are too generous, they might find themselves out of a job when reselection time comes round again.</p>

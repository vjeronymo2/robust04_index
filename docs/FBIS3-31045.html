			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 13 February President Zhelyu Zhelev departed for  Brussels, where he will sign the documents regarding joining the  Partnership for Peace initiative. This is how he described  prior to the departure his position regarding NATO's ultimatum  related to eventual air strikes against the Serbian positions  around Sarajevo:    [Begin Zhelev recording] Our position is clear and  unchanged. One must remember that we are not involved in the  decisions and in the actions. Consequently, posing the question  whether Bulgaria supports or opposes the air strikes is unfair  to Bulgaria.    We participate very actively in the embargo. In this sphere  we have a categorical commitment to the policy of the  international community. However, we cannot do more than this  because we are a Balkan country. If Yugoslavia was located say,  in the Apennines or in the Pyrenees, rather than in the Balkans,  then we could assume a more categorical position, or send Blue  Helmets there. However, now we cannot do even this. We appeal  to all Balkan states also to refrain from military participation  in this conflict. [end recording]    In an interview for Radio Bulgaria earlier today President  Zhelev declared that Bulgaria cannot remain outside the  Partnership for Peace initiative, which encompasses all new  democracies. According to him, this initiative is an important  step toward our regular membership in NATO. According to  President Zhelev, sooner or later Russia will also join this  initiative under the force of the natural development of affairs.    Mr. Zhelev pointed out that there is no reason for any  confrontation between the new democracies and Russia and  especially between Bulgaria and Russia. If in Bulgaria there  are certain circles -- communist, neocommunist, or postcommunist  -- who view our joining NATO as a confrontation with Russia they  do not understand the historical development of the process, the  president said.</p>

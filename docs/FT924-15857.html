			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Texans cool towards Perot, the native son: Jurek Martin samples views around a would-be candidate IN the campaign of 1964, one of the more scurrilous tracts passed round the Barry Goldwater faithful was a little paperback entitled A Texan Looks at Lyndon Johnson. Mostly, it looked and found he was a communist. As they waited for his long-pondered decision, finally announced last night, to re-enter the 1992 presidential race, many Texans were contemplating another native son, Ross Perot. Take, for example, William P Hobby, until 1990 lieutenant-governor, an office with real power in Texas, and now a professor at the LBJ school of government of the University of Texas. He has had dealings with Mr Perot for over 20 years and concedes that his role in reforming state education a decade ago was one of 'great service'. But, he caustically goes on, 'most men's mid-life crises are not nearly as spectacular as his.' He may be 'the worst qualified man ever to want to be president'. As to motivation, 'something rattles his chains' and he has to break out. He suspects, as does Dave McNeely, political columnist on the Austin Statesman-American, that, however Mr Perot dresses it up, he is inspired by a genuine and profound hatred of President George Bush. But, Mr Hobby adds: 'Who the hell knows?' Some demonic theorists, more in Washington than Texas, claim they do and that the adopted and native Texan duo, George Bush and 'Jimmy' Baker, have deliberately baited Mr Perot in order to get him to run and thus complicate an election that the president seemed otherwise certain to lose. Neither Mr Hobby nor Mr McNeely thinks that Mr Perot can regain, even in Texas, anything like the levels of support he commanded in the heady springtime days of his non-candidacy. Mr McNeely thinks, but says he does not know, that in the end Mr Perot will launch something short of a fully fledged campaign, but sufficient to keep his name in the spotlight and on television and thus satisfy his ego. Mr Robert Stein of Rice University in Houston is, according to Mr Hobby, the pre-eminent Texas pollster. His latest surveys have not been posited on a Perot entry, but he has been tracking him for months. He concedes that Mr Perot still has a base in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, particularly among retired military people; he thinks his candidacy makes Texas more competitive, because it helps Mr Bush in the first instance, though not perhaps in the longer haul. But he has doubts that Mr Perot will get back to much beyond 10 per cent on his home soil from the 5 per cent-plus that he has recently been registering. That, of course, might be enough to determine who does win the state. Mr James Galbraith, the Texas University economist, is more engaged with what a President Bill Clinton should do than with the intricacies of Texas politics, but is convinced that here, as in Florida and elsewhere, Mr Perot can only in the end hurt Mr Bush. But three others of progressive persuasion - Molly Ivins, the journalist whose acid chronicles of Ross Perot have lightened many a breakfast table this year; Jim Hightower, former Texas agricultural commissioner who, under no circumstances, he promises, will be the next secretary of agriculture; and Susan DeMarco, the liberal activist - seemed glum at the thought that he might be running again. They agreed with Ms Ivins's guess that he might indeed get 10 per cent, perhaps a little more, but were far more interested in talking about what has been happening in Europe. Mr McNeely is convinced that a lot of the nasty stories about Mr Perot's autocratic ways, which were beginning to gain currency when he pulled out in July, will resurface with a vengeance with a few more revelations besides. One concerns the alleged surveillance of his own daughter, who was going out with a professor who happened to be Jewish. Another is his apparent tendency to fire employees with the HIV virus. A third is that he ordered investigations of some of his volunteers. But this week there have been stories which appear to contradict his fundamental claim that his is a genuine 'bottoms-up' grass roots movement. Some leading 'volunteers' are in fact on his payroll. Some of those he disappointed now claim he always intended to pull an 'October surprise'. It certainly is the case that in July he advised the Texas authorities that his name was not to be withdrawn from the ballot. But perhaps the most damaging and irrefutable evidence concerns his toll-free telephone number, which he invited all to use to say whether he should, or should not, get into the race. Anybody dialling it gets an automated response advising that they 'will be included in our total count of callers supporting Ross Perot'. At least one of those was an anonymous reporter from the Austin Statesman-American simply doing his checking. Whether because of this or not, the newspaper's editorial column this week pulled no punches. 'It is hard to escape the feeling', it wrote delicately, 'that the entire Ross Perot candidacy has been nothing but an ego trip by someone who thinks unlimited money means the rules don't apply to him.' Thus Texans now look at Ross Perot.</p>

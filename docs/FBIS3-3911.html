The opinion poll was conducted by the Urban Socioeconomic  Investigation Team of the State Statistical Bureau under the  auspices of BEIJING QINGNIAN BAO [Beijing Youth News] between 23  and 28 February. The pollers issued 1,001 questionnaires to  Beijing residents and collected 997 replies. BEIJING QINGNIAN  BAO reported the results on 10 March.    Commodity and service prices were also a major issue which  concerned the residents of Beijing, and 46 percent of the  respondents placed the issue of prices in the top position.    Other reform issues which concerned Beijing residents -- in  addition to the housing, medical-care, and retirement pension  reforms -- were the construction of the legal system (25  percent), reform of the political structure (23 percent),  educational reform (21 percent), reform of the labor,  employment, and personnel system (19 percent), and reform of  government institutions (15 percent).    Most people maintained that the most important criterion for  assessing the success of the reform is that most people are  better- off. People who hold this opinion accounted for 66.5  percent of the respondents. On the other hand, 76.7 percent of  the respondents maintained that the main threat to reform comes  from corruption, and 72 percent of the respondents said that  only if the government makes great efforts can the  anticorruption struggle achieve solid results.    Among the Beijing residents who were polled, 79 percent  believed that reform would improve their standard of living, but  23 percent of older people, especially those above 65, feared  that reform might lead to a decline in their living standards.</p>

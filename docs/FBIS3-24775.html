Officials  here said that international mediators had annulled the results  of eight constituency polls disputed after ballots last year, in  theory leaving the government's parliamentary majority intact  with 63 out of 125 seats. But in the Gabonese capital  Libreville, officials said nine constituency polls had been  annulled. This would leave his supporters with 62 seats -- one  less than an overall majority.    The polls were among 58 which had been questioned after  voting which began last May, but which was interrupted following  widespread unrest, and which was eventually won in October by  supporters of President Lissouba. Previously the balloting in  125 constituencies had given 65 seats in the National Assembly  to pro-Lissouba candidates.    The version of annulments announced here ousted two  pro-Lissouba candidates. The results published in Libreville at  a ceremony presided over by Gabonese President Omar Bongo ousted  three. There was no explanation of the contradiction in the  results. Fresh ballots will be organized in the eight or nine  disputed constituencies.    Observers suggested that the confusion may be due to the  fact  that some candidates were the subject of a number of demands  that their election be annulled. But the situation was unclear  late Monday. There has been speculation for months that the  pro-Lissouba coalition could lose its overall majority as a  result of the findings of the international arbitrating  committee.    The committee comprised seven judges -- two appointed by the  Organization of African Unity, two by the European Community,  two by France and one by Gabon -- and was set up under an accord  signed in Libreville in August.    In a statement the arbitrating committee called for calm.  "We  have carried out our work in complete independence, so as to  bring peace back to the country," it said.    Amid the confusion, calm appeared to have returned to the  streets of the Congolese capital Monday, after more than a month  of unrest between presidential supporters and opposition forces.  Government forces withdrew from areas south of the city, where  the opposition has strongholds in the suburbs of Bacongo and  Makele-Kele. Opposition forces were also not in evidence.    Clashes after the first round of voting last year claimed  some 30 lives. Voting resumed in October after both sides  agreed to set up the inquiry. But violence flared again in  November, when around 50 died during fresh bloodshed.</p>

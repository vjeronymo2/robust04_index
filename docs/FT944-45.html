			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (4): Shop carefully in the new year - The charges From next week, many personal pension providers will slash sales commissions and other charges deducted in the early years of long-term personal pension plans. The result will be a better deal for investors prepared to shop around - provided that is, they know what to look for. Worth considering are the providers with good performance with modest charges and flexible contracts that allow you to stop or reduce premiums and retire early without penalty (see Table 1). Standard Life announced in October that, from January 1, it would no longer penalise investors who stop premiums or transfer their fund to another provider. Life offices that sell through independent advisers must follow suit if they are to survive in the post-disclosure competitive environment. Standard's changes are timely. As of today, it breaks its link with the Halifax which no longer exclusively sells Standard's products through its vast branch network. The move away from 'front-end loading' (where charges are heaviest in the early years) has been accompanied by the introduction of flexible sales commissions for independent advisers (see facing page). This makes it even more difficult for investors looking for the best value, since the amount of commission taken by the adviser is deducted from premiums and naturally affects the value of your fund. Our tables assume standard rates of commission are paid, but in practice from January 1995 many providers will allow the adviser to take anything from nil (for the fee-based advisers) up to the current maximum, which can virtually wipe out the first year's premiums on a long-term contract. The commission and charges will depend on the type of contract. Tables 1 and 2 examine charges for regular and recurring single-premium plans. Regular plans traditionally have carried the high front-end charges that result in such poor value for early transfers. Recurring single-premium (RSP) plans should deduct only those charges associated with each premium and therefore provide better value for those who stop premiums in the early years. Jon Minchin, managing director of independent adviser Pensionline, said: 'From January 1995, an adviser who sells you a standard regular-premium plan with all the associated charges will not be offering best advice.' However, Minchin warned that some of the alternative RSP contracts are nothing of the sort, and still carry regular premium charges. Bear in mind that RSP contracts are designed for employees who intend to save on a regular basis. Francis Moore, operations director with pension provider PPM, said: 'The self-employed and partners do not want this type of contract, but instead should look for total flexibility over the timing and level of contributions to suit their business cash flow.' These investors would do best with a single-premium plan that allows them to pay what they want when they want. One further point - if your plan was well chosen, you may be able to transfer your fund without penalty, but to little avail if your adviser takes full commission on investing your transfer value with a new provider. The golden rule here is to check the provider's and adviser's costs every time you take action, whether transferring or simply increasing premiums (another notorious trigger point for fresh charges). More than 100 providers were invited to take part in this survey. Some were still in the process of revising their charges right up to the end of December and could not take part. Others simply refused. If your provider is not in Table 1 and 2, ask for the reason and request the information so that you can make up your own mind whether the plan represents good value and the performance is satisfactory.</p>

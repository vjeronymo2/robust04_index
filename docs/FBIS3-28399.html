			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The reason for President  Kim Yong-sam to convene a meeting of national security-related  cabinet ministers Tuesday is two-fold.    First, Kim wants to check out the overall security situation  on the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean  nuclear issue and dispel ordinary citizens' anxiety amid a  rising sense of crisis.    Secondly, the president wants to discuss measures to counter  any possible developments resulting from a failure in  negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) before Feb. 21.    No deadline has been set for Pyongyang and the IAEA to agree  on IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, but the  United States has said it will have to refer the issue to the  United Nations Security Council if the two sides cannot arrange  for comprehensive inspections before the IAEA convenes a Board  of Governors' meeting on Feb. 21.    Despite obvious efforts to minimize the seriousness of the  problem, reports reaching Seoul from Washington, Pyongyang and  elsewhere are disquieting, to say the least.    A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement on Jan. 31  threatened withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) if the United States keeps pressing Pyongyang with its  "unjustifiable" demand to accept comprehensive IAEA inspections.    North Korea has openly talked about the possibility of  another Korean war breaking out on the peninsula, envisioning a  total defeat for the United States.    The IAEA can only conduct limited inspections, Pyongyang has  said.    In view of the North Korean position, the United States is  showing a much more resolute response than before.    Washington will no longer use a "carrot" in its efforts to  persuade North Korea to accept IAEA inspections before Feb. 21.  Instead, the United States has made it clear it will have to  refer the question to the United Nations.    The United States briefed the other permanent members of the  U.N. Security Council -- China, Russia, Britain and France --  over the weekend and requested their cooperation for action the  United States will ask the world body to take against North  Korea.    Moreover, there have been reports that if North Korea  provokes another war against South Korea, the United States  would not only defend against aggression but launch a  counterattack, pushing the aggressors all the way back to  Pyongyang.    Judging by these latest developments, the chances of the two  sides reaching a dramatic breakthrough at the last moment are  slim.    In other words, "the worst possible situation" is envisaged  rather than a resolution of the question through dialogue.    This is what prompted President Kim to hastily convene  Tuesday's meeting.    Consequently, President Kim and his ministers will take a  close look at North Korean military movements and overall  security on the peninsula. The Kim administration thus hopes to  reassure the people, whose anxiety "has been amplified  unnecessarily" of late.    The National Unification Board, and the Foreign and Defense  Ministries all publicly say that "there has been no urgent  development or North Korean military provocation that warrants  immediate attention."    Tuesday's meeting, therefore, could very well make the  official pronouncement that "the sense of crisis" touted by  certain segments of the U.S. Government and press is  exaggerated.    President Kim and the ministers are also expected to discuss  in depth South Korean Government measures against every possible  North Korean action.    Although there may be many aspects of North Korean nuclear  policy, they can be place into two broad categories.    First is what Pyongyang will do if and when the nuclear  issue  is referred to the U.N. Security Council.    The second concerns a sudden turnaround by North Korea in  accepting IAEA inspections at the last minute.    The Seoul government is most likely to reaffirm its position  of striving to persuade Pyongyang to follow the second course of  action: South Korea believes that the North Korean nuclear  question has to be resolved through dialogue.    In any event, Tuesday's meeting will also discuss what Seoul  can do if North Korea pushes the issue over the brink.</p>

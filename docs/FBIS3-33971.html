			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Isam Qadamani] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  received at his office yesterday Palestinian ambassador in Cairo  Sa'id Kamal.    The Palestinian ambassador updated the prime minister on the  negotiations on the Palestinian track, particularly with regard  to the Davos meetings between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    In a statement to reporters after the meeting, Kamal said  that the Palestinian leadership has made no concessions during  the Davos talks. He added that the Davos talks resulted in a  convergence of views on the arrangements pertaining to security  and withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.    Sa'id Kamal said that the Palestinian and Israeli sides  agreed on a two-month withdrawal period, during which  negotiations will continue, and a four-month period for the  implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted]    The Palestinian ambassador indicated that the implementation  of the arrangements pertaining to security and withdrawal is  contingent upon the key decisionmaker in Israel; that is, the  prime minister. Kamal added: Nonetheless, out of a high sense  of responsibility, I would like to tell Rabin: Enough is  enough. What we have offered in Cairo and Davos should prompt  both sides to sign an agreement on the arrangements to be made.  Once this is achieved, the drafting committee can start its  work to finalize relevant issues before the start of troop  withdrawal.    Kamal went on to say: In the aftermath of the meeting  between 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo, the Israeli rulers have been  procrastinating a great deal over implementation. [passage  omitted]    In response to a question, Kamal said: We and Jordan are a  single body, regardless of the summer clouds that may appear on  the horizon. This will remain the case regardless of whether or  not certain parties like it.</p>

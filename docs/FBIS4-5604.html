			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) chief policy-maker Yi Se-ki met Wu Xueqian,  visiting vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, Tuesday to discuss the North Korean  nuclear matter.    Rep. Yi expressed concern that if the problem is not  resolved, there will be louder calls for the South to go nuclear  as well, prompting Japan to do the same and leading to unbridled  nuclear competition.    "This is what both Korea and China do not want," he said,  tactfully urging Beijing to be more aggressive in persuading  Pyongyang to halt its suspected nuclear arms program.    Wu, former deputy premier and foreign minister, explained  that China wishes to see peace and security maintained on the  Korean peninsula. "Although China's role is limited, we will  continue our efforts to persuade North Korea," he said.</p>

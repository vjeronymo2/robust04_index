			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stonawsky and Vlastimil Stana: "Soldiers To </F> Receive April Pay on 13 May"]    [Text] At the beginning of March, directives issued  by the deputy minister of defense and having to do with new due  dates for pay in the Defense Department saw the light of day. We  note that the new regulations impact on both career soldiers and  civilian employees. What is involved here?    As we have already informed you in the previous issue of A  REPORT, the amendment to Law No. 143/1992 Collection of Laws  [Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in budgetary  and some other organizations, which was approved by the Chamber  of Deputies of the parliament of the Czech Republic on 15  February 1994, among other things eliminates Paragraph 4 of  Section 16 of the law. Thus far, this paragraph had stipulated  that pay for employees--members of the armed forces and security  components and services in active employment--is due in the  month in which the service relationship came into being or  continues. As of the effective date of the amendment to Law No.  143/1992 Sb.--that is to say, as of 1 April 1994--pay for these  employees will be due after that monthly period.    According to this amendment, the procedure will be applied  in  practice for the first time by paying soldiers for the month of  April 1994 on 13 May 1994 (under existing regulations, they  would be paid on 15 April).    To realize the transition to the new due date for wages,  Engineer Miroslav Kalousek, deputy minister of defense, has  promulgated the following measures:  <H5>  Deadlines for Paying Career Military Personnel </H5>   Career military personnel who are normally paid by 15 April  1994 and who file an application may receive a down payment for  the month of April in accordance with the wages to which their  last pay category entitles them. A condition for this down  payment is an obligation (this is essentially a simple document  that financial officers will have at their disposal) to repay  this amount in a maximum of eight monthly payments so that it  will have been fully accounted for, at the latest, at the time  pay for the month of November is due--that is, by 15 December.  The first payment will therefore be deducted as a matter of  principle from the pay for April, which is due on 13 May 1994.  When drawing pay for March 1994, a career soldier will file the  appropriate application on the prescribed form, which will  simultaneously serve as his obligation to make a specific number  of regular monthly payments. This is essentially an agreement  between the career soldier and his employer, covering the  payment of the down payment and its repayment.    The agreement on specific repayments of the down payment can  be fulfilled differently only in the following cases:    1. In the case of long-term illness and while drawing sick  pay, the career soldier, recipient of the down payment, may, in  justified cases, ask the appropriate commander to reduce the  amount of the repayments or possibly to defer such repayments of  the down payment. The decision by the commander regarding the  reduction or deferral of the repayments shall be attached to the  concluded agreement.    2. In the event a career soldier, recipient of the down  payment, is discharged from active service before the repayments  are made, the unrepaid remainder of the down payment will be  accounted for, at the latest, by the time of his final pay or  other monetary matters, entitlement for which arose before his  discharge (for example, monetary compensation for equipment  items, compensation for unused leave, etc.). If it is not  possible to account for the unrepaid down payment even in this  manner, the uncompensated remainder shall be deducted from the  severance pay entitlement.    3. In the case of the death of the career soldier, recipient  of the down payment, the unrefunded remainder of the down  payment will be accounted for at the time of the final pay or  other monetary matters to which the individual's estate is  regularly entitled. If the accounting cannot be accomplished,  the remainder of the down payment will be dealt with at the time  of the inheritance proceedings.    The cumulative total of the remainder of down payments paid  out shall be reported by the various formations via their  superior HFU/OMP [expansion unknown] managing clerks, such  reports always to be made by the 18th day of the month after pay  has been accounted for, by calling the Prague military telephone  number 45 721.  <H5>  Deadlines for Pay for Civilian Employees </H5>   In conjunction with the requirements of current practices,  changes in pay for career military personnel are also  accompanied by modifications of the deadlines for paying down  payments and for the accounting of wages for civilian employees  as follows:    1. In formations employing fewer than 250 employees, down  payments by the 25th day of the month, accounting by the 10th  day of the calendar month.    2. In formations employing more than 250 employees and in  units having two or more pay locations, down payments by the  27th day of the month, accounting by the 12th day of the  calendar month.    The transition to these new pay deadlines shall be  accomplished in such a manner that, beginning with the down  payment in the month of April 1994, the deadline for paying out  down payments and accounting for pay shall be advanced by one  day each month.</p>

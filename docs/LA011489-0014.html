			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA TOURNAMENT OF ROSES MARKS ITS CENTENNIAL FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Your series emphasized my biggest complaint with television coverage of the  Rose Parade -- the cutting away from bands to provide commercials.  </P> <P> Young people who are part of a school band are hard-working dedicated students  who put in many hundreds of hours practicing their music, and marching  routines.  </P> <P> Receiving an invitation to march in the Rose Parade must be among the top  recognitions those kids receive. Acceptance of such an invitation then means  extensive fund-raising to allow their participation.  </P> <P> Let America see these shining examples of dedicated and deservingly proud  youngsters. Let the "folks back home" enjoy that surge of pride when their  hometown band marches across the screen.  </P> <P> Since sponsor fees are what provide the presentation to home viewers, the  commercials are necessary. Certainly, creative people could devise a way to  announce their sponsorship without cutting away from the parade.  </P> <P> MARILYN CALHOUN  </P> <P> Montclair  </P></p>

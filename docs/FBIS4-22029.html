			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Charles Miller, Defence Correspondent, PA News] </F>   [Text] An abortive attempt by Greek terrorists to hit the  carrier Ark Royal with anti-tank rockets could be linked to  Britain's support for strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, it was  disclosed today.    It is believed the ultranationalist November 17 guerilla  group attempted to hit the 20,000-ton carrier with two 88 mm  rockets as it was docked in the port of Piraeus near Athens.    Home-made rocket launchers with rockets and automatic timers  were found in a field 200 yards from where the ship was docked,  police said.    The search was launched after the guerilla group called a  radio station to say it had tried to attack the ship, which left  Piraeus early today after a week's maintenance.    Police said they thought the rockets aimed at the Ark Royal  were set to go off last week but rain had fouled the timers,  thwarting the attack.    The guerrillas also claimed responsibility for a rocket  attack on a US insurance company and a time-bomb attack on a  Dutch insurance company today. The blasts caused damage but no  injuries.    Ark Royal and its sister ship Invincible have been  alternating on six-month tours of duty since January last year  in the Adriatic as part of Nato's operations to enforce the  no-fly zone over Bosnia.    The operation has been directed primarily at Bosnian Serb  and  Serb aircraft and there has been concern in Greece about the  Nato mission because of deep historical and religious links with  the Serbs.    Ark Royal set sail from Piraeus completely unaware of the  potentially disastrous failed attack, said Royal Navy officials.    A Whitehall source said: "This group of terrorists is  ultranationalist and, as such, support the Serbs. The  connection is not too difficult to make."</p>

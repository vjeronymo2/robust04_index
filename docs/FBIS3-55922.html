			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Seimas Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas </F> before the Polish Sejm in Warsaw on 17 December 1993:  "`Although There Might Be Obstacles in Our Way...'"]    [Text] Highly Esteemed Chairman of the Sejm of the  Republic of Poland!    Ladies and Gentlemen!    It is my great honor, as chairman of the Seimas [parliament]  of the Republic of Lithuania, to greet the representatives  elected by the Polish people and the Polish nation itself from  this high podium.    I am even more excited because this is the first address by  the leader of the parliament of independent Lithuania to the  Polish Sejm -- an European legislature with a 500-year tradition.    I am grateful to His Excellency Jozef Oleksy, chairman of  the  Polish Sejm, for his invitation to pay an official visit to the  Republic of Poland.    Ladies and Gentlemen!    Poles and Lithuanians are linked by a long and complicated  history. For several centuries, our nations lived as one state,  they shared common values and the same religion. They stood  shoulder to shoulder while defending the freedom of their  homeland from aggressors and oppressors. They fought together,  both on the field of Grunwald and in the anti-czarist uprisings.  We saw the same struggle in the activities of "Solidarity" and  "Sajudis" which helped preserve the idea of our nations' freedom  and allowed us to cast off the yoke of totalitarianism under  favorable conditions. It is symbolic that the first anti-Soviet  rally in 1987 was held at the monument to A. Mickiewicz [Polish  19th-century poet] in Vilnius.    There have also been difficult and even tragic moments in  our  common history. Certainly, every nation has its own historical  memory. Today, however, we, politicians, must look to the  future for our common sake and strengthen common issues without  dramatizing those ones which divide us or which we assess  differently. This is the only promising policy.    The Lithuanian people learned how to overcome such  historical  recollections when Pope John Paul II blessed their land this  last fall. The pope blessed people of all ethnic groups  residing in Lithuania during his pilgrimage. The Holy Father  has brought great love to Lithuania, which he kept alive even  when Lithuania was not yet free.    I experienced the bloody Sunday on 13 January 1991 and the  August coup in Moscow which decided the fate of not only the  Baltic states but, probably, of all Eastern Europe. During  those hard days, we felt support from Polish leaders, the  parliament, and the Polish people for which we are extremely  grateful. It is to Warsaw that the head of Lithuania's  potential government-in-exile went in January of 1991.    After the restoration of independence, Lithuania had to  accomplish in a short time the same as what other European  nations has built over decades. Our neighbors, the Poles, know  this very well, because this process began in your country  considerably earlier. Today, Lithuania already has a balanced  and democratic system of government institutions. In the 1992  Seimas elections, the people also voted in a referendum on the  Constitution and approved it. At the beginning of this year, we  already had the president elected by the nation -- Algirdas  Brazauskas, who accomplished much in destroying the CPSU  monster. We also have a functioning Constitutional Court.    All of this, as well as the European-type laws on  citizenship  and ethnic minorities, created conditions for Lithuania to  become a member of the European Council this past spring. By  the way, we felt the support of Polish parliamentarians in  Strasbourg as well.    People of different nationalities have lived side by side in  Lithuania for centuries. They have created and strengthened its  statehood. We have not had and, I hope, will never have any hot  ethnic conflicts. The loyalty of people of other nationalities  to their state has been a condition for the development of our  statehood and Lithuania's territorial integrity rather than a  trait of their cold tolerance or exited adoration.    The Polish community in Lithuania is among the largest  non-Lithuanian minority. Currently, we have over 130 Polish  secondary schools and 140 kindergartens. There are eight  publications in the Polish language. Some of them, for example,  KURIER WILENSKI, are financed from the state budget. Despite  the current difficulties, folklore groups are operating.  Shortly, the cultural identity of ethnic minorities will be  secured in Lithuania.    We will continue to support citizens of all nationalities in  Lithuania, and assist them, including the Polish community, in  resolving their numerous problems. We hope that other states  will adopt a similar position toward their ethnic minorities.    It is even more difficult to resolve the country's economic  problems. We have received a difficult legacy. We are forced  to look for ways of mollifying the negative effects of economic  reform and restoring what was heedlessly destroyed in the name  of reform. The first positive tendencies have become noticeable  in Lithuania's economy today. Following the introduction of the  litas, inflation has dropped by 4.5 times (in comparison with  last year). People's real incomes have begun to grow gradually.    The key goal of economic reform is to successfully continue  privatization, particularly of large enterprises, by attracting  foreign investors. It is only in this way that we can revive  our flagging production and increase exports. Another extremely  important task is to overcome the crisis in agriculture.    At the same time, we understand perfectly well that these  are  common problems which weigh heavily on those post-communist  countries pursuing the difficult course from totalitarianism and  a centralized economy to democracy and a market economy -- to a  free market "with a human face," according to one of your  politicians. Therefore, we would think that the mutual exchange  of experience is particularly important. On this occasion, I  would like to recall and support our President Algirdas  Brazauskas' initiative to hold a meeting among the leaders of  the post-communist states.    Highly Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen! The most serious  recent concern of Lithuanian foreign policy was to achieve the  immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops from our country. This  has been realized this year, although with great difficulty!  Conditions for the implementation of other aspirations have  emerged. You know that Lithuania's strategic interest is to  join the European Union, at least as an associate member in the  beginning. We must also integrate with international security  systems. By taking an active part in the CSCE process,  Lithuania is thinking about membership in the West European  Union and NATO. We realize that this is a long process, the  stages of which are being discussed only now. On the other  hand, is not the West too slow and careful in considering  everything?    We seek good-neighborly relations and cooperation with  bordering countries. We are moving over from declarations to  definite action in expanding our relations with the sisters of  the same fate -- Latvia and Estonia. We have set up the Baltic  Council and signed a trilateral free trade agreement. We have  also signed and are drafting different agreements with Russia,  Belarus, and Ukraine. We hope that the results of the elections  in Russia will not distort its democratic development. The  decisions on Kaliningrad Oblast will also be of great importance  in safeguarding regional security. We, as well as you, are  particularly concerned with the demilitarization of this region,  which, I think, is a problem for all of Europe.    Ladies and Gentlemen! We devote special attention to our  relations with neighboring Poland. A number of agreements have  been signed between our countries. However, the most important  current task is to conclude the drafting of the treaty and the  declaration on friendly cooperation and good-neighborly  relations. I would like to express the hope from this high  podium that this will be accomplished without delay. This would  assist in expanding economic cooperation between our countries.  Poland ranks second among those countries which have joint  ventures with Lithuania. However, the amount of mutual trade is  not considerable. Therefore, the signing of a bilateral free  trade agreement becomes particularly pressing.    Our parliaments could also show more initiative in  developing  relations between the two countries. Closer ties, more frequent  meetings, and mutual studies of parliamentary experience could  contribute to this. A constant dialogue is essential. However,  it is this dialogue that we have lacked thus far. We must  correct not the very best traditions that we have adopted. The  current distribution of forces in both legislatures allows us to  effectively resolve the common problems of the present and the  future. Eventually, it is important to realize our  good-neighborly relations as a fundamental mutual need both  today and tomorrow rather than a short period of warming. It is  only this interpretation of the current issue that will enable  us to build firm and reliable bridges in interstate relations.    Ladies and Gentlemen!    Arriving to Warsaw, I could not forget the fact that my  father shed his blood somewhere near the Vistula in 1939 when  fighting against Hitler's aggressors. In conclusion, I would  like to wish closer cooperation to the Polish and the Lithuanian  nations, which have experienced much suffering on their common  path to a new Europe. As A. Mickiewicz wrote:    "Although there might be obstacles in our way,    We will attain our goal -- brotherhood will prevail,    Because we have courage, labor, and unity    Written in our hearts."    Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for your attention!</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Sri Lanka rebel leader urges talks MR Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the separatist Tamil Tigers, has called for peace talks to end Sri Lanka's 10-year civil war, after meeting a church delegation in Jaffna, the island's northern capital, last week. Mr Kenneth Fernando, the Anglican Archbishop of Colombo and leader of the delegation, said on his return to the capital yesterday that Mr Prabhakaran had called for an immediate ceasefire and the holding of peace talks. In a rare public appearance Mr Prabhakaran, recently charged in an Indian court with masterminding the assassination of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, had set out conditions for negotiations with the government, he said. The Tigers (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) wanted the 'economic blockade' of the northern peninsula lifted. The government must also pledge the reconstruction of the northern province and the rehabilitation of about 100,000 Tamil refugees.</p>

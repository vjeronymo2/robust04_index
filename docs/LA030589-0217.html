			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION III GIRLS;  </P> <P> UNIVERSITY SURPRISES TOP-SEEDED RAMONA  </P> <P> After beginning the season with considerable untapped potential, Anne Casey has  proven that she is a quick learner.  </P> <P> In the San Diego Section girls' basketball final against defending-champion and  top-seeded Ramona Saturday morning at the Sports Arena, Casey showed her  determination as she helped University to a 54-46 victory and the Division III  championship.  </P> <P> Casey scored 20 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for third-seeded University  (14-7), but her leadership and court presence was the clincher, according to  University's first-year coach, Rob Gorney.  </P> <P> "Casey is the head of this team," he said. "She pushed the ball and the  intensity level and showed the leadership we needed to win."  </P> <P> But months ago, as the season drew near, the senior forward was sorely lacking  those qualities that would enable her to lead anyone anywhere.  </P> <P> "She had very few skills in the beginning," Gorney said. "She kept saying,  'Teach me, teach me.' She's shown a 300% improvement."  </P> <P> The majority of that improvement showed in the third quarter Saturday, when the  Dons outscored Ramona, 18-4, for a 39-26 lead going into the final quarter.  </P> <P> Casey made nine of 10 free throws and added one field goal. She also slowed  down Ramona's leading scorer, Kris Miller, in the third quarter. Miller, who  was averaging 16 points a game, was held to two free throws in the quarter and  finished with 20 points.  </P> <P> "(Casey) played harder than I've seen her play before," Ramona Coach Joe Bess  said. "She came ready to play and took some balls away from us.  </P> <P> "The difference was at the foul line," Bess said. "You can't give anyone that  many free throws and expect to win."  </P> <P> University made 17 of 28 free throws; Ramona six of nine.  </P> <P> Ramona (20-4) had fallen behind, 12-6, after the first quarter, but, aided by  Kendra Brunje's eight-point effort, managed to take a 22-21 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> "At first, we were so intimidated by the Sports Arena," Casey said. "We were  very intimidated by Ramona, and in the second quarter their intensity grew."  </P> <P> So Gorney had a little chat with the Dons in the locker room.  </P> <P> "He gave us a pep talk," Casey said. "That made the difference."  </P> <P> "I screamed at them," Gorney said. "I told them we needed to screen out and be  more effective on the boards, and we did."  </P> <P> Ramona outscored University, 20-15, in the final quarter, but it was too late.  </P></p>

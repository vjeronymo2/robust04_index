			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Bank takes long march to profit  -Credit Lyonnais is in a critical condition but Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, does not seem to be going out of his way to find what he needs most - friends For a man who appears to need all the friends he can get, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the stricken French bank, does not seem to be going out of his way to find them. When his fellow bankers last week complained about the government's decision to participate in Credit Lyonnais's FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.6bn) rescue package, Mr Peyrelevade responded by resigning from the French Banking Association. 'I didn't think it was very fraternal,' he said. 'I'd expect people to show some sympathy in a situation like this - and they didn't' It is typical of Mr Peyrelevade, 54, to have turned his back on the banking establishment while tackling the biggest challenge of his career. He was a senior socialist adviser who became one of France's most influential financiers in the 1980s as chairman of the Suez holding company and then Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group before being drafted into Credit Lyonnais last November by the centre-right Balladur government. Credit Lyonnais is in a critical condition having last month reported a FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993. The result would have been even worse without the rescue whereby the government is removing FFr40bn of bad debt from its balance sheet. Mr Peyrelevade's task is to bring it back into profit against the backdrop of Swiss and US legal suits over past investments and an inquiry into the conduct of his predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer. 'I thought long and hard before taking this job,' he said. 'It's a huge challenge and that's why I accepted. It's a job that can be done. But there are some issues outside our control such as the political impact of the inquiry.' Yet Mr Peyrelevade is convinced that, in the short term, the rescue should be sufficient to stabilise Credit Lyonnais. He dismisses the risk of opposition from the European Commission (which has objected to a similar aid package for Bull computers) claiming that under French banking law the government, as majority shareholder, was obliged to rescue Credit Lyonnais. The government has notified Brussels about the rescue and is awaiting its response. In the meantime, Mr Peyrelevade must continue with Credit Lyonnais's restructuring. One priority is to raise capital by selling part of its FFr55bn portfolio of industrial investments. He plans by the end of next year to have raised FFr20bn from these disposals and will then continue with up to FFr15bn of additional sales. Perhaps the most intersting disposal will be that of MGM, the ailing Hollywood studio that Credit Lyonnais inherited from an ill-fated 1980s takeover bid. The bank has since sunk Dollars 2bn into MGM but must, under US banking regulations, sell it by mid-1997. It is gambling that the loss-making studio can be turned round in time for the sale. 'Every week someone offers to buy MGM,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'I always say no. The new management team is doing a good job and the offers will still be around in 1997 when, I hope, we'll get a good price.' One area of Credit Lyonnais that is not for sale is the group of European retail banks acquired by Mr Haberer in the late 1980s. These banks have performed fairly well but Credit Lyonnais's management has been too distracted by its financial problems to fulfil Mr Haberer's ambition of merging them into the first pan-European retail banking network. Mr Haberer's critics claimed that the European banking market was too fragmented to accommodate such a network. Mr Peyrelevade disagrees. He plans gradually to merge the banks by imposing standard management controls across all the banks, harmonising their marketing strategies for individual clients and developing cross-border products for corporate customers. 'It's a gamble,' he said. 'But every day Europe moves closer towards adopting a common currency. There are more exporters, more importers and more companies that need an easy way of transferring funds from country to country. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think it will work.' Back in France the imperative is to make Credit Lyonnais's large domestic network more efficient by cutting costs and improving client service. Mr Peyrelevade has already announced plans to shed 10 per cent of its 38,449-strong workforce over the next three years as part of an initiative to reduce the proportion of income absorbed by operating costs (now higher than its competitors at 75 per cent) by 1 per cent a year. He hopes to swallow some of the job losses through part-time working and has diplomatically asked his 20-strong board to accept 10 per cent salary cuts. But Mr Peyrelevade may face a tough task in selling the rationalisation package to the unions, which recently went on strike over less radical cost-cutting proposals. The rationalisation plan will be critical to his chances of restoring Credit Lyonnais to profit. The consensus among analysts is that it should be back in the black in 1995 and can then think about privatisation. 'My sole concern is making Credit Lyonnais profitable,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'It's only then that we'll be able to think about privatisation. Do I want to take it into the private sector? Of course. I missed out on it at Suez (privatised after he left) and now at UAP (scheduled for sale this spring). I don't want it to happen again.'</p>

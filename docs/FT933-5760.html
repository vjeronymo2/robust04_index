			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (13): Reformers lose their way - Public sector and privatisation REFORMERS have least to show for their efforts in the broad field of public sector restructuring, including privatisation. Opposition from vested interests is powerful, technical and institutional capacity is weak, undeveloped capital markets constrain the sell-off of state corporations, many of which are so rundown that there are few buyers anyway. To make matters worse the reformers themselves seem to have lost their way. IMF and World Bank programmes play the numbers game, requiring governments to reduce the public service payroll as a condition for financial support. Staff cuts without improved efficiency have merely led to accelerated deterioration of the administration, and the very social services - health and education - that the donors are anxious to strengthen. A similar situation has arisen in the parastatal sector. Donor demands for an end to subsidies have resulted in swingeing price increases - again with very little discernible impact on efficiency and the quality of service. Operating losses and subsidies have been reduced, but frequently at long-term cost to the economy in terms of inflation, declining service and reduced investment. The damage done to the public sector was highlighted by a recent speech by the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox. He admitted that between them the donors and African governments, have undermined capacity in the region. This will take a generation or longer to reverse, during which time structural adjustment will be constrained by a weak public sector. There are no accurate data on the size of the African public sector. World Bank figures show public enterprise activity accounting for as much as 70 per cent of GDP in Malawi and 58 per cent in Tanzania, while in 1991 Ghana (the regional success story) had 329 parastatals, Mozambique 250 and Cameroon 147. The public enterprise share of total employment was as high as 60 per cent in Mozambique at the end of the 1980s, more than a third in Burundi and Cote d'Ivoire and over a fifth in Ghana. On the positive side, dozens of countries are committed to liquidating, selling-off or radically restructuring and commercialising their state-owned enterprises, but progress is slow. In Ghana the privatisation agency reported 21 sell-offs in 1991, but 11 of these were back in the state's portfolio a year later. Frequently too, privatisation has taken the form of a reduction in the state's equity holding rather than a complete sale or even loss of effective control. Much of the region's privatisation has taken place in just five countries - Ghana, Guinea, Mozambique, Nigeria and Senegal. The proceeds of divestment are no more than Dollars 15m in Ghana while in Nigeria total receipts are less than 5 per cent of government equity. So for all the publicity surrounding parastatal reform, progress has been modest - indeed, in no single country has reform taken root. Few African countries have been willing to set up strong joint-venture style privatisation agencies with active foreign participation from banks, accountancy firms and management consultants. And even if privatisation can be accelerated, this will still leave the problem of the weak public service. If functions ranging from tax and customs administration to education and health continue to be deprived of adequate funding and subjected to capricious political interventions, overall economic performance will suffer. The challenge of the 1990s is not just to sort out Africa's public enterprises, but even more urgently to rebuild the institutional capacity that has been allowed to decay for the past 20 years.</p>

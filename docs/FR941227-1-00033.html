			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) There are several van conversions currently produced with raised roofs that are subject to Standard No. 216. Such vehicles include conversions of the Plymouth Voyager, Doge Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Chevrolet Astro, and GMC Safari minivans. Because of the raised roof configuration, the load plate for the test cannot be placed according to the specified procedure in the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Since the original vehicles, prior to conversion that raises the roof, have been certified as complying with Standard No. 216, the A-pillar strength will have already been demonstrated. Testing to Standard No. 220 after raising the roof would then test the strength of the entire roof structure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Ford <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford recently submitted a petition focused on what it believes is an anomaly with the current positioning procedures for the test plate in Standard No. 216. Ford indicated that several of its models with aerodynamic roof designs have roof slopes greater than 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; at the forward edge of the roof. The test plate is required to be angled 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; of the forward edge of the roof. The effect of the slope on these aerodynamic roof designs is that the initial point of contact between the roof and the test plate is moved several inches behind the A-pillar when the test plate is positioned according to the current placement procedure. Ford believes this rearward movement of the initial contact point is contrary to the agency's intent when it initially promulgated the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford argued that additional support for this argument can be found in S6.2 of Standard No. 216, which specifies the test plate should be applied by ``(o)rient(ing) the test device as shown in Figure 1 *&blank;*&blank;*'' Figure 1 clearly shows the test plate is applied at the front corner of the roof. Thus, for vehicles with sloped, aerodynamic roofs, there is a conflict between Figure 1, which positions the test plate forward of the leading edge of the roof, and S6.2(d), which specifies that the test plate should be positioned with reference to the initial point of contact, even if that point is rearward of the leading edge of the roof. Ford acknowledged that NHTSA has addressed this conflict in an October 3, 1980 interpretation, in which the agency said that the language of S6.2(d) should be used to position the test plate, even if that means the test plate will not be forward of the A-pillar or the roof's leading edge. Ford indicated that it has followed this interpretation, but it does not believe that such an interpretation results in improved roof crush performance when vehicles are in use on the public roads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford asked in its petition that S6.2(d) of Standard No. 216 be amended to specify that the leading edge of the test plate should always be placed over the leading edge of the vehicle roof. Ford proposed the following language: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The initial contact point, or center of the initial contact area, is on the longitudinal centerline of the device. A plane perpendicular to the lower surface of the test device and 25 mm rearward of the front edge of the lower surface passes through the rearmost point of the opening in the body structure for the windshield. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agency Response to the Petitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA believes that both of these petitions raise issues that should be examined further. RVIA believes the requirement to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar on conversion vans with raised roofs imposes needless and significant burdens on second-stage manufacturers. Ford believes the requirement to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar on vehicles with aerodynamic roofs is contrary to the agency's original intent and results in a less stringent test of the A-pillars' strength. both of these are relevant issues. Accordingly, the agency has granted both the RVIA and Ford petitions. NHTSA is now conducting a research program to investigate the test methods described in these petitions and to see if the current test procedures are suitable for vehicles with raised or contour roofs, or if some changed test procedures are needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

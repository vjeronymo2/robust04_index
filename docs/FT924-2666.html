			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / People: Harding and Chapman join L&amp;G Sir Christopher Harding, the former chairman of British Nuclear Fuels and long-time Hanson director, continues to add to his impressive display of non-executive directorships. Only a week after joining the board of the General Electric Company, he has been made a non-executive director of Legal &amp; General. Sir Christopher, who resigned from BNFL in June, is one of two new L&amp;G non-executive directors. The other, Honor Chapman (below), is a partner in Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors, and governor of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Not surprisingly for a big institutional investor active in the corporate governance debate, L&amp;G no longer resorts to the old boy network to fill its boardroom. It hired headhunters Woodhead Mann to draw up a list of suitable candidates and then they were vetted by a selection committee of L&amp;G's non-executive directors. The insurer says that the choice of an industrialist and a property expert was intended to maintain the balance on the board ahead of the retirement of other non-execs. Chapman, who began her career in the London County Council valuation department, is chairman of Jones Lang Wootton Consulting and Research and has been in the property business for over 25 years. Sir Christopher Harding, who made his name managing Lord Hanson's family transport business, is a director of Slough Estates, Newarthill, English China Clays, and ProShare (UK) as well as Hanson and GEC.</p>

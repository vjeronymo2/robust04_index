			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STOP THE BUILDING, PRESERVE COASTLINE  </P> <P> There are proposals currently under consideration for the building of two  500-room hotels on the coastline of Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> I don't know how or when it began, but it seems to me that there's a crazy kind  of race going on, to crowd ourselves out of existence, or at least, out of  peaceful existence. There's this frantic effort to make sure no piece of ground  is vacant. Wherever there's a vacant lot, there's a rush to build something on  it, something that will bring money and a whole lot of people, and more cars  and smoke and noise.  </P> <P> I just don't get it -- it would seem logical that we'd all be trying  desperately to hold on to what little bit of nature is left -- and especially  our seashore. But I get the feeling that I'm in the overwhelming minority on  this, and that I'm losing the fight -- losing to the "Big Three" -- greed,  ignorance and apathy.  </P> <P> When all the land along the coast has been built on, will these money-mad  developers come up with a way to build giant hotels and shopping malls on the  ocean itself? Don't they wonder about these things when they're sitting in a  sea of stop-and-go traffic on Hawthorne Boulevard, breathing exhaust fumes and  going nowhere? Don't any of them have grandchildren, and don't they want to  preserve some of this earth and ocean and air for them? Am I all alone in this?  Why should I have to persuade my City Council to keep what we've got left the  way it is?  </P> <P> Is there something I'm missing here? Are there those among us who like crowds,  and smog, and noise, and traffic, and concrete buildings everywhere there's  room to build one? Maybe these are the people who drive diesel cars and foul up  my air, because they think they're going to save $26 a year, and the hell with  me?  </P> <P> Look -- those of us who are lucky enough to live in one of the few remaining  areas with a little natural beauty should be doing everything we can to ensure  that it stays this way -- we owe it to our grandchildren.  </P> <P> The money we leave them won't mean much if they can't get to the ocean or even  see it, let alone swim in it.  </P> <P> Enough already with this craziness -- with the building, building, building. No  hotels!  </P> <P> DONALD B. BROWN  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P> <P> PS: If anybody agrees with me, get in touch with Save Our Coastline, Box 3221,  Palos Verdes 90274.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(a) provides that a paying bank that has settled for a check presented by a Reserve Bank may return the check in accordance with Regulation CC, the U.C.C., and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that the paying bank may also return a check prior to settlement in accordance with &sect;210.9(a) of Regulation J and the Reserve Bank's operating circular. This amendment would clarify that a paying bank would have the same return rights under Regulation J as under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(c) sets out the warranties and agreements made by a bank that sends a returned check to a Reserve Bank. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that, in addition to the warranties set forth in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC, the sender also makes any applicable warranty under state law. For example, the amendment would clarify that a depositary bank that settled for a returned check could recover the amount paid plus expenses and lost interest from a prior bank that breached a transfer warranty, in accordance with U.C.C. 4&hyph;208(d). In addition, similar to the amendments to &sect;210.5(a), the proposed revisions to this paragraph would clarify that the Regulation J warranties may not be disclaimed and are made regardless of whether the sender's indorsement appears on the item. These amendments restate provisions that are already applicable to private-sector banks under Regulation CC and the U.C.C. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board proposed to add a new paragraph (d) to &sect;210.12 to clarify that when a Reserve Bank transfers and receives settlement for a returned check, it makes the warranties set out in &sect;229.34 of Regulation CC. In addition, the new paragraph would parallel revised &sect;210.6(b) (governing Reserve Bank warranties for cash items) by providing a limitation of the Reserve Bank's liabilities, other than those allowed for in Regulation J, to the Reserve Bank's own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care. (The amendments redesignate current &sect;&sect;210.12(d) through (g) as &sect;&sect;210.12(e) through (h).) The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(e) (Formerly 210.12(d)) and Section 210.5(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.C.C. (3&hyph;119) and Regulation CC (&sect;229.34(e)) provide that a bank that receives a tender of defense may in turn tender defense to a prior bank in the collection or return chain. Unless the prior bank comes in and defends, it is bound by the determination of fact common to the current litigation and any subsequent litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 210.5(b) of Regulation J provides that, when a Reserve Bank tenders defense to a sender as a result of a tender to it, the Reserve Bank need not be a defendant in the suit in order to recover from the sender any losses that it incurs because of the judgment, so long as the judgment addresses the fact issue of breach of warranty. The Board adopted this provision in 1986 in order to reduce litigation and provide a more efficient way of handling forged indorsement cases (51 FR 21740, June 16, 1986). Due to an oversight, when the Board amended &sect;210.12 to provide a similar rule for returned checks, the language did not match that of &sect;210.5(b) and could have been interpreted to apply only when a Reserve Bank is a defendant (53 FR 21983, June 13, 1988). The Board proposed to amend &sect;210.12(e) to conform it to &sect;210.5(b). (The amendments redesignate current &sect;210.12(d) as &sect;210.12(e) and add a new paragraph (d) as discussed above.) The Board also proposed to correct a typographical error in &sect;210.5(b). The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendments as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.12(h) (Formerly 210.12(g))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides that a depositary bank must settle for returned checks received from a Reserve Bank in the same manner as it settles for cash items presented by the Reserve Bank. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that settlement for returned checks also must be made by the same time as settlement for cash items, as provided in &sect;210.9(a). The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.13(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.13(a) authorizes a Reserve Bank that does not receive payment for an item to charge back the account of the sender, paying bank, or returning bank from which the item was received. The Board proposed to amend this section to clarify that a Reserve Bank also may charge the account of a prior collecting bank through which the item was received. This amendment is consistent with &sect;229.35(b) of Regulation CC, which allows a bank that handles a check or returned check to recover from any prior indorser in the event that the bank does not receive payment for the check from a subsequent bank in the collection or return chain. In the event of such a recovery by a Reserve Bank, &sect;229.13(a) provides that no bank or person in the forward collection or return chain would have an interest in any funds in the Reserve Bank's possession of the bank that failed to pay. The amendment would clarify that, when a Reserve Bank charges back an item, this limitation of interest applies only when a bank or person seeks payment of the amount of the item out of funds or property held by the Reserve Bank. The Board received no comments on this section and has adopted the amendment as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210.13(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Four strains of Rickettsia  tsutsugamushi were isolated from viscera of rats and  trombiculid mites. At the same time, the antibody against  Rickettsia tsutsugamushi was assayed in the sera of  the local people and the wild rats. The positive rates were 15.2  percent and 16.4 percent, respectively.

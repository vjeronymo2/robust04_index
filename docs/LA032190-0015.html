			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BRAZIL'S BOSCO BURSTS WITH CREATIVITY IN KICKOFF CONCERT  </P> <P> Joao Bosco made a quick stop in town Saturday night. It was just long enough to  provide a tantalizingly short sampling of the music of this extraordinary  Brazilian singer/songwriter/guitarist.  </P> <P> Bosco and the instrumental group Uakti appeared at the Los Angeles Municipal  Art Gallery in Barnsdall Park for the kickoff of "L.A./Brazil Projects '90," a  series of events designed to showcase Brazilian music and art in the United  States, Japan and Brazil.  </P> <P> Although he is one of the most important artists in the post-bossa nova MPB  (musica popular brasileira) period of Brazilian music, Bosco has had little  visibility in this country. It's hard to understand why. His performance was a  virtual one-man explosion of creativity.  </P> <P> Working only with his guitar, his voice and the sheer magnetism of his physical  presence, Bosco performed a set that mixed his provocative originals (mostly  written with lyricist Aldir Blanc) with fascinating readings of " 'Round  Midnight" and "Bahia." His guitar figures ranged from hypnotically repetitious  patterns to lushly harmonized chording, while his singing managed to  incorporate percussive pops, squeals and shouts with romantic balladeering.  </P> <P> The total effect was stunningly rich and inventive -- music that reached out to  touch both the mind and the body.  </P> <P> Uakti, a group from the eastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais who appear on  Paul Simon's newest recording, played a colorful array of instruments handmade  from plastic tubing, gourds, bamboo, rubber and wood. Many of their pieces  reverberated with the sounds of jungle and forest. Perhaps most fascinating,  however, was Uakti's whimsical reading of Ravel's "Bolero," performed on a  metal pot and a collection of gourds floating in basins of water.  </P> <P> Uakti will appear April 1 at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks.DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

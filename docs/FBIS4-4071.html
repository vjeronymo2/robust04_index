			<p>BFN     [Text] Huizhou, April 26 (CNS) -- A task force comprising  the departments of labour, public security, industry and  commerce, and civil administration, as well as the construction  commission in Huizhou, has recently been set up for an overhaul  of labour employment in the city in order to safeguard the  obeying of laws and regulations and the interests and rights of  workers.    Labour disputes have recently been more and more frequent in  Huizhou with its rapid economic development. Violation of  labour laws and regulations has been seen in foreign-funded and  privately- owned enterprises including failure to apply for  labour recruitment, disregard of labour contracts and  infringement of workers' interests and rights. Statistics show  that the city dealt with 346 labour disputes in 1993 alone, a  more than 16 percent rise over the year before, involving 5,800  workers or an increase of over 100 percent. The city in response  established a supervisory group last year to handle disputes.  The group issued warnings and imposed punishments on  enterprises found in breach of relevant regulations. It  recovered for workers RMB 1.2 million, which included back pay  as well as pay for sick leave, medical expenses and compensation  for injuries at work totalling RMB 120,000, all of which should  have been paid by the employers.    Since the labour law and regulations are yet to be improved  in addition to unsound supervisory bodies, the labour and  management conflict was very complicated and labour disputes  were frequent. The Huizhou Government made great efforts in  launching a one-month campaign for a total overhaul of labour  employment in the city in a bid to put in order relations  between labour and management, protect the legitimate rights of  workers and promote improvement of enterprises. The campaign  covered a wide variety of enterprises with the emphasis on  township enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises,  privately-owned enterprises and construction enterprises.</p>

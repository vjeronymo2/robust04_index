			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Government to review fire-safety legislation The government plans to review fire safety legislation as part of its de-regulation programme, Richard Donkin writes. The Department of Trade and Industry said the review would consist of examining how enforcement could be improved through better co-ordination without sacrificing safety standards. The review team has been asked to identify areas of overlap between bodies - including local authorities - that are responsible for enforcing legislation. It has also been asked to look at the practicality of bringing all policy responsibilities for fire safety together in a single department.</p>

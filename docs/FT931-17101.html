			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: McMaster chain of department stores has gone into receivership McMASTER Stores, a chain of Scottish department stores bought out from the House of Fraser retail group in 1989, has gone into receivership. The chain of seven stores, in towns such as Ayr, Irvine and Stirling, employs a total of 300 people. The receivers, Mr Iain Bennet and Mr Alan Jamieson of Price Waterhouse, hope to sell the stores soon, either separately or as a whole, to save their jobs. McMaster acquired the medium - sized stores in a management buy-out from the al - Fayeds worth Pounds 6m, when House of Fraser decided to concentrate on outlets with more than 100,000 sq ft of floor space. Charterhouse invested Pounds 1m in the buy-out, which carried a heavy level of debt. Although turnover was maintained through the recession, the chain incurred losses in the last two years. It has debts in excess of Pounds 4m, most of which is owed to Clydesdale Bank.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Tough talking taints EC-Russian 'partnership' accord - Trade across Europe / Moscow's interpretation of Gatt rulebook is central to the trade negotiations SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, will not forget his trip to Moscow last month in a hurry. During tense bargaining, Sir Leon professed astonishment that his Russian hosts were proving so obstinate. After all, the Community had made similar proposals to Guatemala regarding the new EC banana regime, without a murmur of protest. 'Russia,' thundered Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation, 'is not Guatemala.' EC officials stress that Sir Leon had no intention of suggesting that Russia had become a banana republic; but last month's exchange with Mr Yeltsin confirms that the EC's effort to forge a new trade and political agreement with Russia has run into difficulty. The EC's offer of a 'partnership agreement' goes back to 1989 when the Twelve wanted to encourage economic and political reform in the former Soviet Union. Today, the idea is to strengthen democracy in Russia with the main incentive being the 'long-term goal' of a free trade area with the Community. In Russian eyes, the EC is a more important trading partner than the US or Japan. Last year, Russia accounted for an estimated 70 per cent of the former Soviet Union's Dollars 4.8bn trade surplus with the Community. Yet despite the steady two-way trade flow, the EC remains unsure of how to deal with Russia's transition to a market economy and how to fit a new approach into a comprehensive policy toward the former Soviet Union, where central authority in Moscow is declining and new republics are clamouring for attention. The central difficulty in the EC-Russia talks stems from Russian demands for the same treatment which the Community gives members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In concrete terms, Mr Yeltsin wants free movement of goods, services, capital (with some reservations), and persons. But the EC says 'Gatt treatment' is out of the question until it establishes a market economy. As Sir Leon explained, Russia still has a long way to go. Its domestic energy prices are artificially low because of state subsidies; Russian enterprises still do not know what their costs are; and Russia's recent application to join Gatt, while welcomed in Brussels, will take a long time to process. The result is that the EC is insisting on a special 'safeguard' clause which would apply until Russia fully complies with Gatt rules. This would allow Brussels wide discretion to block imports it considered to fall in the category of 'dumping', particularly in sensitive sectors such as aluminium, steel and textiles. The Russians argue that this clause is much harsher than the retaliation allowed under Gatt rules - and likely to deter foreign investment in potential hard-currency earning export industries. In short, Mr Yeltsin feels the EC is treating Russia as a 'state trading' country such as China and North Korea, without recognition of its democratic reforms. As Brussels has discovered, the Russians have not been shy about saying 'Nyet', nor has the fall of communism blunted their negotiating skills. The debate over 'Gatt treatment' touches on Russian pride; but a good deal of self-interest is also at stake. EC officials say Russia is pressing for greater market access for its exports of low-price uranium and it wants provisions for greater freedom of movement of people so that businessmen do not have to waste time on visa applications. In the field of human rights, the Community remains hopeful it can obtain satisfactory guarantees on human rights before signing a partnership agreement. But an early suggestion for a 'suspension' clause under which the pact might be put on ice in the event of human rights abuses, has apparently been dropped after Russian objections. Earlier this year, when Mr Yeltsin appeared to be in danger of losing a popular referendum, the EC sent a delegation to Moscow offering, for the first time, the prospect of a free trade area. 'They just pocketed a major concession,' says an EC official. Nor has the EC always presented a united front. Two months ago, the Queen of Denmark issued an invitation to Mr Yeltsin to come to Copenhagen, ostensibly to celebrate 500 years of friendship between the Baltic near-neighbours. The Danish Presidency of the EC described it as a 'Danish initiative'; but EC officials believe the timing of the invitation was a less-than-subtle effort to accelerate the pace of negotiations and secure a deal for the June 21-22 summit. In the event, Mr Yeltsin did not turn up. With hindsight, some EC officials believe Sir Leon's tough stance in Moscow was intended to sink any chance of Mr Yeltsin 'hijacking' the summit. The challenge in the next few months will be to put the negotiations back on track and resolve the conundrum on Gatt treatment. One option is to insert an 'evolutionary' clause holding out the prospect of free trade if the Russia successfully follows Gatt discipline. In this respect, Sir Leon's encounter may have helped both sides by removing false expectations about the size and scope of a future bilateral trade agreement.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Financing for Krasnoyarsk aluminium plant begun Aluminium Pechiney said yesterday that it has started work on the financing of an estimated USDollars 400-Dollars 500m project to modernise the Russian Krasnoyarsk aluminium plant, reports Reuters from Paris. Its chairman, Mr Bernard Legrand, said the funds would be used to construct an initial production line of 250,000 tonnes a year. Annual output capacity at Krasnoyarsk would eventually be brought back up to its existing capacity of some 800,000 tonnes, which would require even more funding, he said. Aluminium Pechiney will work on the financing project with investment bank Morgan Grenfell as financial adviser and Bechtel Corp of the US. Mr Legrand said he had a meeting on Tuesday with Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who confirmed his willingness to proceed quickly with the first step of the Krasnoyarsk project. The upgrading of Krasnoyarsk wouldl be followed by modernisation of a second plant at Bratsk, which also has a current capacity of some 800,000, said Mr Legrand. The Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk plants are each now producing about 700,000 tonnes a year. The modernisation plan is in line with the conclusions of the Canberra aluminium conference on July 20-21, which stressed the need to integrate Russian producers into world markets, he said. Legrand said Pechiney had been invited a year ago by the Russian Committee on Metallurgy to conduct a study on the modernisation of three Russian smelting facilities at Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk. Novokuznetsk has an existing capacity of 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes. An evaluation committee aproved the Pechiney report last May and selected Pechiney to work on the modernisation of Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk. Legrand said he expects work on Krasnoyarsk to start within two years. The modernisation of Bratsk is expected to follow. Initial output for Bratsk will also be 250,000 tonnes per year, with capacity eventually rising back up to 800,000 tonnes. Legrand said the whole modernisation project for Krasnoyarsk and Bratsk could take five to 10 years.</p>

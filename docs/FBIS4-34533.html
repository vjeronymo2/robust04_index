			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Humberto de la Calle Lombana, Liberal Party vice </F> presidential candidate, from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada  Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live]    [Text] Mr. Ernesto Samper Pizano, president-elect of  Colombia; Mrs. Jaquin Samper; Rosalba [De la Calle's wife];  Friends; Colombians: I would like to thank all Colombians for  the clean and democratic victory that Mr. Samper and Mr. De la  Calle achieved today. It has been a long, hard campaign. At  times, it even went as far as personal attacks, but we have no  hard feelings. It is time for generosity and to stand tall. It  is time for our spirits to be calm so we can conduct our  administration without discrimination.    I also thank Mr. Ernesto Samper. Mr. Samper has been a  champion of democracy and a generous friend. In offering me the  opportunity to be his running mate on the presidential ticket,  he has allowed me to continue to serve Colombia. I admire his  devotion to social justice. It is a genuine devotion; not  improvised. I see in Samper the great leader of social justice  in Colombia. [cheers] It was on this specific issue -- serving  the poor people of Colombia, men and women of flesh and blood --  that we found our greatest affinity in this victorious ticket.    I also thank Jaquin for her dedication and assistance I  would like to reaffirm what I said during the campaign: I am a  man of the countryside. I am not ashamed to be a man of the  provinces, and I will continue to be one. I want to make the  vice presidency the home of the Colombian countryside. What  Colombia needs is a vice presidency that will reinforce national  unity by recognizing the diversity of its regions and by  realizing the potential, the drive, and the creativity of the  Colombian provinces. [cheers]    Our victory, the victory of Ernesto Samper, is also a  victory  of the Liberal spirit and of tolerance over fanaticism. It is a  victory for self-evaluation and pluralism. That is what has  risen victorious today, my friends. We do not want fanaticism,  sectarianism, or discrimination in the modern Colombia we have  envisioned. There will be no room for discrimination on the  grounds of sex, color, race, creed, or religious belief in the  Samper administration. [cheers].    As vice president, I also hope to contribute to the  development of our constitution and the statutory law governing  the administration of justice. In so doing, we will advance the  fight against crime, drug trafficking, and drugs in favor of  true democratic justice for all Colombians. [cheers] The new  legal instrument for requesting the protection of our  constitutional rights is the most revolutionary means to truly  protect our fundamental rights.    I believe in reinforcing the resources available in the  municipalities and departments. This will allow them to fulfill  their responsibilities, particularly toward social justice. As  its name suggests, this is a social justice directed at the men  and women of the masses; the men and women of flesh and blood;  the men and women of Colombia who have no privileges.    We want justice in education and health. We believe the  first priority for this new government is social investment, the  search for the vindication of the poor people of Colombia. My  dear friends, we are behind the poor people of Colombia, not the  powerful. [crowd cheers]    President Cesar Gaviria must be recognized for the  development of the Constitution. President Gaviria, by  promoting constitutional changes, transformed Colombia's  philosophy. In my opinion, what we are looking at now is a more  modern Colombia with a greater willingness to achieve victory  and to come out ahead. We want a more optimistic Colombia.    As Ernesto Samper has said, I hope to contribute from the  vice presidency by representing Colombia internationally. We  are going to fight for human rights, against drug trafficking,  and for the protection of natural resources and the environment  of Colombia and the world.    Ernesto Samper asked me to help renew the Liberal Party. I  will never give up trying to accomplish that goal. As president  of the Liberal Party's Renewal Commission, I hope to conclude  our mission before 6 August. As of today, I wish to convene a  Liberal Party convention. We need a more democratic, active,  and institutional party with a greater committment to the fight  against corruption. [crowd shouts: Long live the Liberal Party!]    I want to tell you that it is a pleasure to have the support  of millions and millions of Colombians. I am especially  grateful because I am not a professional politician. I do not  think I am a man who has turned politics into a profession. I  come from another field, but my victory today not only commits  me to Colombia but also teaches me something I heard from Luis  Carlos Galan, who said if one does not do politics, others will  do it for you. With Samper we will try to do good politics for  all Colombians without discrimination, my dear friends. [crowd  cheers]    I conclude by thanking Rosalba and my sons. I want to say  that without their help and understanding, my dreams of working  for a more egalitarian society would not have been possible.  Thank you, thank you my dear friends, and a big hug for  Colombians. Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Observer: Learning by doing Hardly a vote of confidence, one would think, when OECD secretary general Jean-Claude Paye's chef de cabinet quits just when Paye himself is struggling to hold on to his own job. Not a bit of it, apparently. It is with Paye's express blessing that John Llewellyn leaves the government-owned think-tank in Paris's elegant 16th arrondisement to become top economic guru in Lehman Brothers' London office. The embattled boss, it seems, has long felt that the OECD could improve its analysis of financial flows. The hope is that Llewellyn, now 50, may one day return to build up the expertise in that area. It seems pretty unlikely, though, that Paye will be around to witness any such return himself. With his contract expiring this Friday, he is now supported for a third term by a slim majority of the OECD's 25 member countries. But that is of little use when the US shows no sign of changing its mind over the intention to veto the incumbent's reappointment.</p>

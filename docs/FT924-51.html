			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: No cut-price gas deals Sir, British Gas is not offering special discounts to power stations to keep out competition ('British Gas offers connection discount to power stations', December 29). The last British Gas contract to supply gas to a power station was agreed in October 1991 and we are not at present actively negotiating with other potential generators. Around 70 per cent of the gas contracted for power stations is being supplied by competitors of British Gas, which does not suggest anti-competitive practices. The connection charges for power stations have been based on the same principles as those for all our other industrial and commercial contract customers. These arrangements have been in place for the past 25 years to the benefit of thousands of British businesses. Suggestions that these benefits should be removed do not support expectations that enforced competition will lead to lower prices. C H Brown. chief executive, British Gas, Rivermill House, 152 Grosvenor Road, London SW1V 3JL</p>

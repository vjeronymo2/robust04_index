			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Guy de Jonquieres in London and Frances Williams </F> in Geneva: "EU To Back Ruggiero to Head the WTO"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] is set back Mr Renato  Ruggiero, veteran Italian diplomat and former foreign trade  minister to become head of the World Trade Organisation [WTO],  which is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] next year.    Mr Ruggiero, who is 64 and has been a director of Fiat, the  Italian motor manufacturer, since 1991, is the first candidate  to win official support for the post from any Gatt member.    Though the EU has yet formally to declare his nomination,  Sir  Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner -- who this week  ruled himself out of the running-plans to canvass backing for Mr  Ruggiero from the U.S. and Japan.    Sir Leon is expected to discuss the issue with Mr Mickey  Kantor, President Bill Clinton's trade representative, and Mr  Koji Kakizawa, the Japanese foreign minister, at next week's  ministerial meeting in Paris of the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development.    The Commission threw its weight behind Mr Ruggiero after the  Italian government notified it yesterday that it would support  his nomination. When the matter was discussed by officials from  the 12 EU governments, none indicated that it intended to field  a rival candidate.    Mr Ruggiero was Italy's trade minister between 1987 and  1991,  critical years for the Uruguay Round of world trade  liberalisation talks. He was one of the first to espouse the  idea of a powerful world trade organisation to replace the GATT,  a proposal later supported by the EU.    Mr Ruggiero spent much of his 30 years with the Italian  foreign service on European policy issues. He served  successively as the European Commission's director-general of  regional affairs, its official spokesman, and as Italy's  permanent representative in Brussels.    He also represented his government in preparations for  several world economic summits before becoming foreign trade  minister and then co-ordinator of Fiat's international  activities.    All the directors-general of the GATT to date have been  Europeans. Mr Peter Sutherland, the present incumbent was  previously Ireland's commissioner, in charge of European  competition policy.    However, a growing number of GATT members believe the time  has come to break with tradition. Developing countries, who  account for most of the membership, believe they have a strong  case for providing the first WTO head, though they have yet to  rally behind a candidate.    Latin American candidates put up a respectable showing last  year against Mr Sutherland, and the name of Mr Rubens Ricupero,  Brazil's finance minister and a former GATT ambassador, is being  canvassed. There are also suggestions that the job should go to  a nominee from the Asia Pacific region.    Two New Zealanders have been mentioned -- Mr Philip Burdon,  the trade minister and Mr Mike Moore, an ex-prime minister.</p>

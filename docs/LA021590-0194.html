			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUSBANDS PITCH IN FOR CHILDHELP USA BENEFIT  </P> <P> "We are the lucky ones," said Kathy Nagy, addressing a banquet hall full of  well-tended ladies and a few tuxedoed gents. "We're living the blessed lives."  </P> <P> Nagy and Ginni Valley co-chaired a fashion show luncheon at the Irvine Hilton  last week that raised about $100,000 for the Orange County chapter of ChildHelp  USA, a national organization that offers treatment programs and shelter for  severely abused children.  </P> <P> Welcoming the lunch bunch from a podium on the dais, Nagy told the 870 guests  that responsibility came with their privileged lives. Then she told a story  about the first time she saw someone less fortunate than she and thought,  "There but for the grace of God go I."  </P> <P> It was thoughts like these -- and fashions -- that got this crowd into chic  suits and out to a $60-per-person lunch last Thursday.  </P> <P> Once inside, guests faced a line of fast-talking raffle-ticket salesmen who  just happened to be the husbands of the party planners.  </P> <P> "These guys can charm the ladies right out of their money," said co-chair  Valley, "but they are taken! They're husbands! There's mine, over there."  </P> <P> Among the 20 ticket hawkers was Al Nagy, who reported that he and the other  spouses were pressed into service last year "and we doubled (raffle ticket  sales). . . . "  </P> <P> Describing his sales technique as "loving," Al Nagy offered this mock pitch:  "Hey, c'mon, you came here to eat and drink and have a good time -- your  husband can afford (raffle tickets). Put some money in this hat!"  </P> <P> Also hawking prizes was Don Minkoff, who held a ticket-stuffed top hat in one  hand and his 5-month-old granddaughter, Brittany Forsdick, in the other.  </P> <P> During the luncheon program, a "Children's Friend" award was given to Newport  Beach resident Carol Newett, who in the past 22 years has been a foster mother  to more than 100 babies, many of whom had medical problems or were born  addicted to drugs.  </P> <P> Before the ceremony, Newett said she found it "heartbreaking" to see so many  drug-addicted babies come into the foster-care system and so many older  children who have been sexually abused.  </P> <P> "It just seems like the problems are getting worse," she said. "At the same  time, it's getting harder to find foster (parents) and adoptive homes. I think  a lot of people who want to adopt now want a perfect child, and we just don't  have any of those."  </P> <P> The fashion show featured the spring collection of New York-based designer  Laura Marolakos, who was chosen for the occasion by Billur Wallerich of Saks  Fifth Avenue at South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the event will be used to underwrite expenses of ChildHelp USA's  residential treatment center in Beaumont, Calif. The Village, as the center is  called, is home to 80 severely abused or neglected children, 3 to 12 years old.  They are attended by psychologists, therapists, teachers and nurses and are  allowed to stay for up to 18 months before returning to their natural parents  or to be placed with adoptive or foster parents.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, April 4 (PTI)--The Congress-I Working  Committee [CWC] on Monday adopted an action plan to face the  November Assembly elections in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Goa  and Sikkim.    Under the action plan, party-oriented election campaign will  be launched from August first and multi-channel assessment  system introduced for selection of candidates for the polls.    District and Pradesh Congress-I Committee Presidents will  not  be given tickets to contest the elections and instead they will  be asked to concentrate on campaign, the party spokesman, Mr  V.N. Gadjil, told newsmen after a three-hour crucial meeting of  the CWC.    The working committee decided that bodies of Pradesh  Congress-I Committees and the AICC [All-India Congress  Committee] would continue as no organisational elections could  be held this year.    As regards the executive bodies at different levels, after  the expiry of the term in April/May this year, they may also be  continued but may be reconstituted by the party President, Mr  P.V. Narasimha Rao, wherever necessary, in order to make them  more effective.    The CWC took strong exception to the anti-party activities  by  some members in the last Assembly elections and decided to  initiate disciplinary action against them.    Asked to identify those facing action, Mr Gadgil said that  they were mostly DCC [District Congress Committee] presidents  and clarified that no PCC [Pradesh Congress Committee] President  was involved.    Apart from elections scheduled in the four States, the  Congress-I ruled States of Maharashtra and Gujarat and the  Janata Dal-ruled Bihar may also opt for an early poll.    The CWC also discussed the Dunkel draft and decided to  launch  a campaign to blunt the onslaught of the Opposition, which, it  felt was misleading the people on the issue.    Though the present term of the Congress-I Committee at all  levels comes to an end in April/May this year, the CWC will  remain unaffected, Mr Gadgil said.    Explaining other provisions of the action plan, Mr Gadgil  said that it sought appropriate representation to women,  minorities, scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward  classes in all Congress-I committees.    It provides for appointment of spokespersons for all the  PCCs  and launching of membership drive fort-night in June and July.    Frontal organisation and party cells should be allowed to  conduct their own membership drive and multi-channel assessment  system should be introduced for selection of candidates.</p>

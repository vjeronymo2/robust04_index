			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Are Again Facing a Rubicon"] </F>   [Text] "We are again in the stage of struggling for an  independent state. We are facing a Rubicon: Either for Ukraine  or against it," this is how newly elected leader of the  democratic association "Ukrayina" Dmytro Pavlychko characterized  the present political situation in the country. He also pointed  out that National Democrats are challenged by two main tasks:  To see to it that representatives of anti-Ukrainian forces do  not win in the presidential elections and to try and gain  victory in the run-off elections of 112 Ukraine's people's  deputies on 24 July 1994 in order at least to slightly change  the alignment of political forces in the Supreme Council.  According to D. Pavlychko, a coordination council of chairmen  of political parties has already been created. However, it has  not yet worked out a single approach as to whom of the  presidential candidates to support, but has already resolved not  to provide any support for the programs of [presidential  candidates] L. Kuchma or O. Moroz. With regard to the run-off  elections, said D. Pavlychko, 73 democratic candidates have been  agreed upon and nominated. "It would be good if at least  one-half of that number win," said the "Ukrayina" leader.</p>

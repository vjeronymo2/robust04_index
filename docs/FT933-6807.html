			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Metal Exchange three months COPPER price eased from the day's highs in after hours trading but still showed a gain of about Dollars 20 a tonne on the day. Traders said talk of possible Japanese output cuts and a widening spread, which threatened to bring September Dollars 2,000 call options into the money, triggered widespread short-covering and took the price up to Dollars 1,948 at one stage. But profit-taking trimmed the rise and three months last traded at Dollars 1,943 a tonne, with the cash/three months premium, which had widened to Dollars 42 earlier, closing in to Dollars 37 a tonne. ALUMINIUM continued to find good two-way business around the Dollars 1,170 level for three months metal resulting in a narrow trading range. It closed below that level for the first time since early June, although with a last trade at Dollars 1,168.50, down Dollars 1.50, traders did not regard that as a significant breakdown. NICKEL was under pressure again from hedge selling but continued to find buying on dips below Dollars 4,700 a tonne. Last business was at Dollars 4,705, unchanged on the day. LEAD drifted despite LME stocks data showing 1,100 tonnes taken out of the Baltimore warehouse. Compiled from Reuters</p>

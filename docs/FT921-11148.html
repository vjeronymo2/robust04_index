			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Final flutter for London's old-style market The Last Post sounded for the old-style London stock market just after 4pm yesterday when the London Traded Options Market left the Stock Exchange trading floor for new premises at Cannon Bridge, writes Terry Byland. Traders celebrated by throwing dealing papers in the air. The market's open outcry trading system, whereby deals are done in public, had maintained the tradition of face-to-face dealing which rapidly disappeared from the stock market after Big Bang in 1986, when electronic trading screens took over. The final deal was transacted by Bill Leask and John Lee, with 56 years' floor attendance between them. Their departure left silent a trading floor once alive with as many as 1,500 share dealers. It faces a less exciting future as office space.</p>

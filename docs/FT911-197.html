			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: In brief The wrong price on an invoice is the most common cause of delayed payments, according to a survey of 400 companies carried out by Resource Evaluation (REL), a specialist consultancy. Incorrect pricing accounted for 30 per cent of delayed payments by value. The other main reasons for delayed payments - some of which are used deliberately by customers to conserve their own cash flow - were requests for copies of documents (16 per cent by value); administrative errors (15 per cent); requests for proof of delivery (14 per cent) and shortages of the items required (6 per cent). Companies make insufficient use of measurement techniques to assess how good they are at collecting their money, REL says. At least one company surveyed produced one credit note for every seven invoices, a figure which indicated that it had to replace or rework a significant amount of goods supplied and that it was probably already in serious trouble. REL surveyed companies with outstanding sales ledger balances of between Pounds 2m and Pounds 302m. The average outstanding sum owed to the companies surveyed was Pounds 14.6m, of which on average 35 per cent was subject to dispute. The cost to the supplier of providing this amount of unauthorised credit would be about Pounds 2,000 a day. This does not include the cost of investigating and correcting errors. The administrative cost of issuing a credit note is at least Pounds 25. REL, Park Gate, 21 Tothill Street, London SW1H 9LL. Tel 071-222 1212.

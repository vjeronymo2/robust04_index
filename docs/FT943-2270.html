			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Discretionary forex group formed The foundation of a new treasury management company has provided the latest indication of a shift away from the use of automated trading programmes in the foreign exchange market. Mr Richard Hill, former head of proprietary foreign exchange trading at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has joined with two senior dealers from other firms to form Tigon Treasury Management. TTM is responding to what it sees as the growing demand for 'discretionary' foreign exchange management, whereby managers rely on their experience and judgment, and take views on changing markets. 'We have definitely noticed an increase in the appetite for discretionary-based traders,' said Ms Nicola Meaden, managing director of Tass Management, a company which tracks the performance of fund managers. The growing fashion in both forex and bond markets for an approach based more on human judgment comes in response to the mixed performance of the 'black boxes'. These programmes and models lie at the heart of what is generally known as systematic trading. They performed well for much of 1993 but have slipped back badly this year. While the average currency fund fell just 1.38 per cent in the first six months of 1994, systematic traders dropped 24.2 per cent, according to Tass Management. TTM expects to raise its initial allocation of between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m from smaller companies and banks which do not have the resources to attract foreign exchange professionals and establish professional in-house teams. Mr Hill estimated there were only three or four competitors in discretionary forex management.</p>

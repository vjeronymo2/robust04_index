			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / VW eases concern on Skoda cuts: Czech government asks German carmaker to amend plans to scale down production Volkswagen, the German motor group, has moved to calm Czech anger over the scaling down of its production targets for the Skoda carmaker by promising to meet some of the Prague government's objections. VW and the Czech government said yesterday they were confident that talks over the German group's revised plans for Skoda, based north of Prague, could be concluded this year. The statement came after Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman, met Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech industry and trade minister, in Prague on Saturday. The government is mainly concerned over VW's decision to scale down annual production from a previous target of 400,000 cars to 300,000 cars by the year 2000. Although VW gave no details of the meeting, it is understood the extent of the scale-down may be reduced in line with Czech objections. The two sides said further talks would be held on amending VW's original plans. VW owns 31 per cent of Skoda, scheduled to rise to 50.5 per cent this year. Under a 1991 agreement, VW is due to increase its stake in Skoda to 70 per cent by the end of 1995 at a total cost of DM1.4bn (Pounds 575m) - the biggest foreign investment in the Czech Republic. VW promised to invest a further DM6.8bn over 10 years in Skoda to introduce new models, double production to 400,000 cars by 2000 and build a plant to produce 400,000 engines a year, half for other VW subsidiaries. But because of losses at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary, VW said the proposed engine plant was no longer feasible and it would cut investment to DM3.75bn. Mr Dlouhy suggested that the German company had violated the spirit of the contract and said he would seek an amendment which would require VW to fulfil its promise. Mr Dlouhy said before the meeting with Mr Piech that he expected by the end of October to sign 'a amendment to the contract that will put VW and the Czech government on an even footing'. The talks come a week after 10,000 workers at Skoda's factory in Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague, staged a one-hour strike over plans to make 855 employees redundant, and days before the company launches its new Felicia car, Skoda's first new product since 1988. Also under discussion will be VW's plans to import engines for some versions of the Felicia and to put employees of Skoda parts suppliers on its assembly lines. Mr Jan Uhlir, who as chairman of the Kovo Trade Union which represents most of Skoda's 17,000 workers, has been in talks with the Skoda-VW management.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV ENTERING MOST PERILOUS TIME OF HIS RULE  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is entering the most dangerous period of his  five years of leadership of the Soviet Union -- a time in which the future of  his political and economic reforms and his own fate could be determined.  </P> <P> Within a few weeks, Gorbachev must deal decisively with the country's severe  economic problems, the potentially explosive nationalism in most of its  constituent republics and the sharp political divisions, even within the top  ranks of the ruling Communist Party, on how to proceed.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's advisers speak frankly of a serious "multi-dimensional crisis" in  the country and say they anticipate "a very rough struggle" in coming months,  particularly in the regional and local elections scheduled for February and  March and the preparations for a party congress later in the year.  </P> <P> Some Soviet journalists are now writing speculatively but openly of scenarios  that could lead to a conservative coup d'etat removing Gorbachev, the breakup  of the Soviet Union through ethnic clashes or a civil war that might break out  between those trying to preserve socialism and those trying to replace it with  capitalism.  </P> <P> The most recent opinion polls show not just increasing disenchantment with  perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, but even willingness by more  than half those surveyed to return to more conservative rule if it meant more  food in the stores.  </P> <P> "There is a real threat to Mikhail Gorbachev, a real danger for perestroika," a  senior Communist Party official commented. "We need to go ahead faster, we need  to do more, but we must take the people with us -- and they are not ready." The  official continued:  </P> <P> "In the mass consciousness, there is a feeling that it was a great mistake to  emphasize political reforms rather than economic restructuring at the outset.  People do not accept that truly revolutionary structural changes were needed  first for economic gains later. We dare not widen this gap between the people  and the party too much."  </P> <P> A member of the party's policy-making Central Committee, also speaking  privately, said: "Everything is at stake. We must navigate boldly to get out of  this crisis, but also very carefully, for we have almost no margin for error."  </P> <P> The crisis facing Gorbachev is really a series of interconnected political and  economic crises, each having an impact on the others and none capable of  resolution without progress on the rest.  </P> <P> "If our economic problems were not so acute, I doubt that we would be facing  the nationalist unrest that we have today," said a top Soviet editor, himself a  member of the party hierarchy. "But people are hungry, and hunger makes people  angry. If we had real political resolve, then we could have moved forward on  those issues. . . .  </P> <P> "The knot of problems has grown tighter and tighter. There is a great  temptation just to slice through it, but Mikhail Gorbachev's patient untying of  it is probably better."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, to be sure, has dealt with successive crises over the last five  years, reducing the immediate danger to his leadership and to the reform  program, removing many of his opponents and always broadening and extending  perestroika.  </P> <P> What worries many now is the complex nature of the crisis -- and the much  reduced time that Gorbachev has to deal with it.  </P> <P> The country's top economists warned six months ago that the Soviet leader had a  year to a year and a half, at most, to demonstrate to the country that the  reforms are resolving problems, not creating more, and that they are improving  living standards, not diminishing them. These economists include Vice Premier  Leonid I. Abalkin and Prof. Nikolai Y. Petrakov, the new economic adviser on  Gorbachev's personal staff.  </P> <P> The government's new economic program, designed by Abalkin, is expected to  begin to show results in better supplies of consumer goods and food -- but only  in the second half of the year -- and thus to intensify political pressure on  Gorbachev to deal effectively with other problems to buy this additional time.  </P> <P> "We are entering a period of even greater uncertainty than we have known in the  past two or three years," a prominent political commentator remarked, "and this  has the effect of heightening social tensions, which are already acute, and  increasing the mood of crisis. More than anything else, we have a crisis of  confidence."  </P> <P> The most recent crisis was precipitated by the Lithuanian Communist Party's  declaration of its independence from the Soviet Communist Party last month in  an unprecedented split that ultimately threatens the unity of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Gorbachev is scheduled to visit Lithuania this week in a search for a  compromise that will preserve party and state unity while assuring the  Lithuanians real political and economic autonomy in a restructured, federal  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "We are determined there will be a compromise, that this problem will be  resolved through political and democratic means," said a party official who  expects to travel to Lithuania himself as member of Gorbachev's peace mission.  </P> <P> "But we cannot, at this point, see the shape of that compromise. We know it  must satisfy not just the Lithuanians and ourselves (liberal supporters of  Gorbachev) but also the conservatives. Otherwise, there will be a fight, and  Gorbachev might be among the victims."  </P> <P> These negotiations are being followed closely by the neighboring Estonians and  Latvians along with the equally restive Ukrainians, Moldavians, Armenians,  Georgians and Azerbaijanis. Recent unrest in Azerbaijan along the  Soviet-Iranian border has underscored the need to deal with these ethnic  pressures.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian talks are also being watched, however, by increasingly  nationalistic ethnic Russians who fear the country's dismemberment. They also  resent the bitter criticism aimed as much at them as the Soviet system by other  ethnic groups.  </P> <P> For party conservatives, the Lithuanians' declaration of independence has  proved to be almost a perfect issue with which to charge Gorbachev with going  too far, too fast and undermining not just socialism but the stability and  unity of the country.  </P> <P> "This was such a heavy blow to Mikhail Gorbachev," a Central Committee official  commented, criticizing the Lithuanians. "People should assess not only what  they could gain but what they could lose from such actions.  </P> <P> "Now, within the Central Committee and elsewhere, conservatives say, 'See, this  is what perestroika, democratization and glasnost (openness) have brought --  anarchy, the destruction of socialism, the dismemberment of the party and  state.' That is why a compromise is so important and so urgent."  </P> <P> Gorbachev hopes that he and other members of the party's ruling Politburo will  be able to fashion a compromise over the next two or three weeks or so with  Lithuanian party leaders. His recommendation will be debated by the Central  Committee at a special meeting, which was broken off last month after two days  of often angry debate.  </P> <P> If his proposals on Lithuania prove unacceptable, as his supporters are  warning, then the whole reform program will be in jeopardy from the  conservative backlash.  </P> <P> The Central Committee is also scheduled to meet at the end of January to debate  a new party program, a fundamental political statement that will both sum up  the reforms so far and set the course for the next five to 10 years.  </P> <P> Already the focus of much political infighting, the program could divide the  party even more sharply between the party's liberal and conservative wings as  Gorbachev seeks to accelerate and broaden his reforms at the party congress  scheduled for October.  </P> <P> Times Moscow bureau chief Parks is on a visit to London.  </P></p>

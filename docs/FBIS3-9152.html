			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A fax sent to us by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs announces that it greets with satisfaction the signing  in Washington of the accord on the creation of a bicommunity  federation by the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats and of the  accord on the principles of a possible confederation between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.    The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the  signing of these documents represents an important step toward  decisively involving all sides in the continuation and  finalization of the negotiations aimed at a global settlement of  the Yugoslav crisis.    Emphasizing the decisive contribution made by the United  States to the achievement of these accords, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs assesses that, through the sustained efforts by  the international community, one can achieve viable and  realistic understandings that will contribute to solving a  large-scale conflict in the heart of Europe by political means,  a conflict that causes tremendous human suffering and great  material damage.    The communique reaffirms the Romanian Government's complete  readiness to contribute, through its means, to supporting the  current positive processes of reestablishing peace and settling  problems in keeping with the major interests of the newly  emerged states on the territory of former Yugoslavia and of  their neighboring countries in the interests of security and  peace.</p>

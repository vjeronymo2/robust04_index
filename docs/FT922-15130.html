			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Observer: Same again at CBI Howard Davies, controller of the Audit Commission, is a highly intelligent and astute character. But is the man widely tipped as next director-general of the CBI really right for the job? After all, he is a virtual identi-kit of Sir John Banham, the outgoing president. They even followed one another at the Audit Commission. In many respects he is exactly the kind of person the CBI intended not to appoint. After the Prudential's Sir Brian Corby became CBI president, there were tensions with Banham, on the grounds that the latter was good at orchestrating clever campaigns about the environment etc, but weak on representing the core passions and ideas of business, especially of manufacturing industry. There is a strong lobby that believes the CBI needed someone on the lines of Sir Terence Beckett of Ford, who had actually run a proper industrial business. Davies's big advantage is that he seems to be apolitical whereas Corby is an old-style Thatcherite. He has been very good indeed at the Audit Commission, where he has tangled with the most unpleasant elements of Tory and Labour municipal politics. With Unilever's departing Sir Michael Angus assuming the CBI presidency next month, the CBI could argue it doesn't need another industrialist as director-general.</p>

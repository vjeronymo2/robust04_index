			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Shake-up of union services launched THE TUC yesterday began a shake-up of its services to unions, David Goodhart writes. It intends to concentrate on four issues: health and safety, equal rights, vocational training and occupational pensions. Mr John Edmonds, head of the GMB general union, said that the TUC would become a 'centre of excellence' for workplace issues and move away from being the civil service of the labour movement.</p>

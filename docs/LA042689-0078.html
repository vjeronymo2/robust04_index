			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> KCET OFFERS A PRIMER ON 'SURVIVING THE BIG ONE'  </P> <P> In "Surviving the Big One," airing at 8 tonight on Channel 28, KCET delivers a  comprehensive primer on how to prepare for a major earthquake.  </P> <P> And -- no small feat -- producer-director Joel Tator has kept "Big One" from  being a dry lecture. "Big One" delivers a ton of information while being  entertaining and engrossing.  </P> <P> A large part of the credit goes to the show's host, Henry Johnson, a fire and  safety specialist in the Los Angeles Fire Department. Johnson is on camera  throughout "Big One"; his low-key demeanor and straightforward conversational  style draw viewers into a solid, information-packed hour.  </P> <P> As Johnson repeatedly stresses, the key to survival lies in proper preparation.  According to Johnson, the thing that most Southern Californians fear the most  -- the shaking motion of a quake -- is not going to be the main problem. The  biggest area of concern will be the quake's aftermath, when there will be a  serious lack of public services -- water, food, emergency medical assistance  and so on.  </P> <P> One of the key values of "Big One" is its skill in separating fact from  fiction. Footage from 15 earthquake-prone locations coupled with Johnson's  articulate explanations help overcome certain fears -- no, California is not  going to break off and fall into the ocean.  </P> <P> "Surviving the Big One" can't be recommended highly enough. Knowledge is power  and, in this case, might be just the power to help you and your family survive.  MARTIN ZIMMERMAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOSE ABUSE IS IT?  </P> <P> In response to the article, "Toll-Free Line Seeks to Curb Animal Abuse" (by  Michael Quintanilla, Oct. 2), the case of a dog poisoning is mentioned as  animal abuse.  </P> <P> This is not as serious a crime, in my opinion, as letting a dog run  uncontrolled. I have small children. I would hate to have my child poisoned by  someone else's trash. I don't think that is a high probability.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the chances of some "kind, gentle, wonderful" person's dog  biting me or my children are high. And the chances that I will find my little  ones eating dog doodoo left on my yard are very high. I love dogs too much to  own one myself, but I can understand why other people hold them in captivity.  Protection of human rights is paramount, however. The owners who let their dogs  run loose, get into other persons' trash, and defecate on other persons' yards  are, in my opinion, guilty of child abuse.  </P> <P> DON KLEINHESSELINK, Riverside  </P></p>

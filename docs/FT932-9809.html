			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Observer: Prison duty For a man who spends most of his time in prisons, ex-Watergate villain Chuck Colson seemed unusually worried about the health of the British pound yesterday. Colson, a 61-year-old ex-US Marine Corps captain, has just won the world's biggest religious award - the Templeton prize for progress in religion. For some strange reason Sir John Templeton, one of the world's most astute fund managers, made the mistake of donating his Pounds 650,000 prize in sterling, and Colson, despite being a born again Christian, is acutely aware that the pound has been going through a bit of a rough patch. Not that he gets to keep the money for himself - it is all going to his Prison Fellowship - but he wants value for money. Although Colson's role in the downfall of President Nixon is history he still resembles the powerful Washington power-broker he once was - a person who can be relied on to get things done. Only nowadays, he channels all his energies into his worldwide network of prison ministries. With over 280 staff and 50,000 volunteers his empire operates in 55 countries. If you want to talk prisons, Colson's your man and his considerable achievement has been deservedly recognised by an award which has already gone to people such as Mother Teresa, Dr Billy Graham and Lord Jakobovits. Colson's conclusion that there is no better way to destroy a person than give them nothing to do is a grim verdict on the lack of proper work for the inmates of prisons in Britain and elsewhere.</p>

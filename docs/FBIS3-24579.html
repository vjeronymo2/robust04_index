Paul; UDC 621.315.592] </F>   [Abstract] Experiments performed with PbS samples for  finding the parameters which determine the motion parameters and  recombination of the carriers, as well as the value of the PbS  photosensitive layers as a function of temperature, demonstrated  that the behavior of the photoconductivity temperature curves in  the low temperature region is determined by the mobility  temperature of the charge carriers, and in the high temperature  region is determined by exponential dependence on the life-time  temperature of nonequilibrium carriers. Depending on the  technology of the substrate preparation before the  photosensitive layers are deposited, the surface condition at  the interface between the film and the substrate can play a role  in the recombination process. If the surface recombination is  increased, the life-time of the nonequilibrium carriers and the  mobility is decreased, and the temperature dependence of the  photoconductivity is changed.

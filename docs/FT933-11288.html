			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Welcome for rules which will 'drag tabloids out of gutter' MS CLARE Short, the MP whose complaint to the Press Complaints Commission was upheld in 1991 after the News of the World published a photograph of her in her nightdress, welcomed the proposals and said the press would not have 'trawled' through her private life had they been law. 'It will drag the tabloid press out of the gutter,' she said. Her sentiments were typical of people who have had run-ins with the press and pursued their grievances through existing arrangements. Mrs Linda Townley is suing Today newspaper for malicious falsehood after it alleged in 1989 that she stole letters from Princess Anne while in her employment. Mrs Townley said she probably would have used the proposed privacy law if it had existed. Mrs Diane Simpson, a researcher, was photographed talking to Mr Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, by someone who gained access to Broadmoor hospital by subterfuge. She said the proposed legislation would have protected patients. But she agreed that intrusions into privacy could sometimes be in the public interest. Others felt that the proposals - which do not provide for legal aid - did not offer enough protection. Ms Mona Alghussein, then known as Mrs Mona Bauwens, became the subject of press interest because of gifts she made to Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary. She said she was more concerned about accuracy than privacy, 'though there were certain aspects of my private life that I didn't think were anyone's interest'. The proposed legislation was no use without legal aid, she said.</p>

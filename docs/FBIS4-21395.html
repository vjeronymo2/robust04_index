			<p>CSO     [Text] Only "as much Community as necessary."    Environmental protection in the European Community has  long meant a search for the smallest common denominator. The  Maastricht Treaty has introduced a change of course: the  individual countries are no longer tied to minimum  standards.    European environmental policy has always been an enigmatic  discipline. Usually only lawyers, administrative specialists and  confirmed Eurocrats could find their way in the confusion of  guidelines, regulations, deadlines and exceptions. Nearly  always, however, the simple rubric "Environmental policy [based]  on the smallest common denominator" went to the heart of the  matter.    The Maastricht Treaty rewrote this formula. In future  decisions the vote of the majority will count, unanimity among  member countries is no longer necessary. Second, the treaty  strengthens the jurisdiction of the European Parliament. For  example, in the future a new guideline on waste policy will no  longer merely have to be noted by the EP but will require the  approval of the Parliament.    This can easily lead to confusion as the discussion on the  long-planned guideline on packaging and packaging waste shows.  In December of last year the Council of Ministers on the  Environment reached an agreement on collection and disposal  quotas which are lower than the German quotas taken from the  packaging regulations. "First rate stupidity," Heinrich von  Lersner, President of the Federal Office of the Environment in  Berlin, says angrily whenever the subject comes up. Should the  collection-happy Germans just throw away more trash again? No,  since a compromise reached shortly before Christmas provides  that the--relatively low--EU quotas may be exceeded throughout  at the national level.    This does not yet, however, bring the matter of the EU  packaging guidelines to a close. "It is certainly possible," Dr.  Jan C. Bongaerts, Director of the Institute for European  Environmental Policy in Bonn, suggests, "that the European  Parliament will not agree to this compromise." The consequence:  the negotiations would have to begin again from scratch.    Is Brussels more progressive than Bonn? Or are the Germans  more environmentally conscientious than the rest of the EU?  There have always been discussions about these questions. Gudrun  Lammers, EU representative from the environmental group  Greenpeace, laments a "clear democracy deficit" in the  environmental policy from Brussels. "Naturally, much remained  behind German standards," agrees the SPD [Social Democratic  Party of Germany] Europe delegate Klaus Haensch. His colleague  Dagmar Roth-Behrendt suggests on the contrary that "70%  solutions are still better than if several countries were to do  nothing at all."    Dagmar Roth-Behrendt chips away at the image of the Germans  who all too gladly see themselves as the paragons of  environmental protection. "Instead, the European Union  accelerated German legislation on environmental protection," she  made clear at an SPD function last week in Berlin. Even more:  Germany, too, has already had to suffer defeats before the  European Court; for example, for the tardy implementation of the  guidelines on environmental compatibility testing as well as on  drinking and ground water protection.    Brussels environmental policy may possibly become more  effective from the change in the trend. However, SPD Bundestag,  or Federal Parliament, member Liesel Hartenstein notices in  Brussels a "clear tendency toward a weakening of environmental  standards." As one piece of evidence she mentions the drinking  water guidelines, which would again make higher nitrate values  permissible in Germany in the future. Also, the herbicide  atrazine, which is forbidden here, could theoretically once  again be available on the market in Germany. Additionally, Great  Britain wants to make the mixed dumping of household trash and  industrial waste possible with a guideline on waste dumping. And  France is petitioning before the European Court against the  prohibition currently in force in Germany banning  pentachlorophenol (PCP), an active ingredient in wood  preservatives.    No one can say whether European environmental policy will  become more lucid. In any case, in the future the European Union  will in many cases only provide the outline [of a policy] which  the member countries will then fill in. In this way the  individual countries will be permitted greater flexibility.  There is already a great deal of concern from the Germans that  the rubric "as much Community as necessary, as much independence  as possible" is more likely to cement distortions in competition  in the EU than to tear them down.    This discussion can be best followed at the current time  from  the planned guideline for the Integrated Avoidance and Reduction  of Environmental Pollution (IPC). The guideline establishes  standards for the approval of industrial facilities. [By  following the standards], it shall thus be determined which  environmental option is best at any given time in an individual  case. This [approach] provides flexibility in two respects:  since the totality of the environmental effects of a facility  are taken into account, a disproportionately low level of air  pollution, for example, can balance out higher levels of toxins  in waste water or large amounts of waste materials.    In addition, the preexisting level of pollution in a region  is taken into consideration. In the case of lower initial  pollution with maintenance of specified emission limits, there  may in individual cases be a deviation downward from the state  of the art [in pollution control policy].    The environmental policy makers in Bonn have difficulty with  this new thinking. "There are no standards for comparison and no  standard values for various environmental mediums," objects Kurt  Schaefer, Director of the Emission Protection section in the  Federal Ministry of the Environment. Bonn, therefore, has  absolutely no intention of approving the IPC guidelines as they  are currently formulated.    Another reason for German opposition lies in the planned  change in the practice of granting approvals. The guideline will  in general streamline the approval procedure for [industrial]  facilities; in the so-called spoke system, a single authority  shall have overall control of granting the authorization. That  means that individual approval [processes] conforming to various  laws would be combined together.    That would be a fundamental departure from the German  practice of granting authorizations. Until now several  specialized authorities would decide on an approval--this basic  tenet would be invalidated by the IPC guideline. And thinking  does not yet extend this far into European dimensions. As  Schaefer says: "The integrated concept is not compatible with  the German system and is therefore difficult to implement."   <FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-009-48A>      FIGURE </FIG></p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Juniors outperform Canadian heavyweights - The growing popularity of second and third-tier stocks with Toronto investors Investors searching for the real action in Canadian stock markets these days need to look beyond Toronto's benchmark TSE 300 index. The index, which covers the 300 companies with the biggest market capitalisations, bumped along in a narrow band between 3,400 and 3,600 for most of 1992, ended the year 6.5 per cent lower than it began; it has fallen further in 1993. However, the TSE 300 is dominated by a few dozen heavyweight banks, utilities and manufacturers. The top 50 companies make up 72 per cent of the index's weight, with the next 50 contributing another 13 per cent. Mr Michael Shannon, an analyst at Burns Fry in Montreal, notes that 'the bottom 50 companies, which have 1.1 per cent of the index, could go bankrupt, but so long as BCE (the telecommunications group which has a 7.7 per cent weighting) went up 15 or 20 per cent, the TSE 300 would show no change'. Most of the leading performers these days are among second and third-tier companies. An index compiled by Burns Fry, which tracks the share prices of companies in the bottom half of the TSE 300, together with about 200 others with a market value of more than CDollars 15m (Dollars 11m), has performed more strongly than the TSE 300 for more than two years. On a total return basis, including dividends, the Burns Fry index climbed 19 per cent in 1991 and another 13 per cent last year. The growing popularity of investments in smaller companies is reflected in a proliferation of 'special opportunities', 'special growth' and 'capital appreciation' mutual funds. Many Canadian pension funds are for the first time setting aside some of their cash flows for small-capitalisation investments. Mr Sebastian van Berkom, a Montreal institutional portfolio manager specialising in small-cap stocks, predicts that they will outperform traditional mainline investments until at least the mid-1990s. While hard to prove , smaller Canadian companies generally appear to have responded more energetically to opportunities created by the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. Their managers are less preoccupied with cost-cutting and restructuring, and have been able to give more attention to expansion and acquisitions. Many are also in cyclical, export-oriented sectors, such as energy and forest products, which have benefited more than the big banks and utilities from a 13 per cent fall in the Canadian dollar over the past year. Junior oil and gas producers and drillers have been especially popular among investors. They have lower overheads than the giants of the energy industry and have grown fast by picking up properties discarded by companies such as Imperial Oil and Petro-Canada. Mr John Embry, who manages Royal Bank of Canada's recently-launched Canadian Growth Fund, says that 'the problem with the big companies is that they're not even replacing their reserves. You're dependent on a higher oil price.' Specialised lumber producers have been another small-capitalisation favourite. While Canada's mainline forestry companies struggle to overcome sluggish pulp and newsprint markets, the niche players in the timber industry are making hay from the recent surge in North American lumber prices and the fall in the Canadian dollar. Less than two months after going public at CDollars 7.88 a share, Riverside Forest Products of Vancouver is now trading at over CDollars 14. Its glamour stems from the attractive price it paid for a lumber and plywood mill which it bought from Fletcher Challenge Canada just as timber prices were taking off last year. Other popular lumber stocks include Slocan Forest Products, Green Forest Lumber and International Forest Products. While portfolio managers are confident that the cycle in small-cap stocks has at least a year or two to run, they warn against being caught up in the excitement. 'You've got to be very selective and have a disciplined approach,' says Mr Allan Jacobs, vice-president at Canada Life Investment Management in Toronto. Mr Embry at Royal Bank says he has already become uncomfortable with 'the degree of speculation and the valuations' of many high-technology and bio-technology stocks. As an example of a bubble waiting to burst, he cites Newbridge Networks, a fast-growing supplier of telecommunications networks, whose share price has rocketed in the past year from less than CDollars 10 to a peak earlier this month of CDollars 61.88. Newbridge has slipped back by almost CDollars 5 in the past week. Mr Jacobs says that Canada Life's small-cap portfolio is limited to companies with healthy balance sheets, strong management and a track record of solid earnings. Shares trading below book value would not be considered. 'The key is to buy real companies,' he asserts.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 1.5% after Golden Week A retreat in the yen against the dollar prompted small-lot buying and equities rose 1.5 per cent in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 gained 292.26 to 19,862.47 after a low of 19,620.82 and a high of 19,907.98. In a shortened week the index put on 0.7 per cent. Volume was 170m shares, many investors remaining absent following the market's holiday closure between Tuesday and Thursday. Some dealers were heartened by the concerted round of dollar buying by central banks over the past few days and supported the futures market. The Topix index rose 22.21 to 1,615.69 and the Nikkei 300 by 4.35 to 295.60. Gainers led losers by 827 to 174 with 124 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.64 to 1311.26. The low volumes helped to push up some speculative stocks on small-lot buying by individuals: Wakachiku Construction rose Y15 to Y670 and Yamazaki Baking by Y80 to Y2,090. Banking stocks were supported by arbitrage buying. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y70 to Y3,220 and Sakura Bank gained Y10 to Y1,410. Brokers, which were sold last Monday, were bought on bargain hunting, with Nomura Securities rising Y40 to Y2,230 and Nikko Securities gaining Y30 to Y1,230. High-technology stocks improved following the slight fall in the yen, with Hitachi putting on Y10 to Y961 and NEC adding Y30 to Y1,140. Car stocks were also strong, with Toyota Motor up Y20 to Y1,980 and Honda Motor rising Y40 to Y1,710. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 204.31 to 22,096.86 in volume of 18.9m shares. Export- oriented and retail stocks were bought, with Shima Seiki, an industrial machine maker, up Y150 to Y7,000. Roundup Recovery in Hong Kong property stocks was matched by weakness in their Singapore counterparts. HONG KONG rebounded from a run of heavy losses, the Hang Seng index closing 207.39, or 2.5 per cent higher at 8,620.27, still 3.9 per cent lower on the week. Once again, bargain-hunters snapped up properties, the sub-index rising by 495.28, or 3.4 per cent to 14,900.99. SHK Properties leapt HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 46.25, Cheung Kong jumped HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 35.25 and Henderson Land rose HKDollars 0.75 to HKDollars 37. SYDNEY was lifted by selective bargain hunting after Thursday's sell-off and the All Ordinaries index, ending a run of five consecutive losses, closed 16.2 higher at 2,004.3, 3 per cent down on the week. SEOUL saw a late spurt of institutional, primary blue chip buying which took the composite stock index up 5.51 to 927.84, 3.1 per cent higher on the week. TAIPEI approached the 6,000 resistance level and turnover fell in consequence, from TDollars 84.29bn to TDollars 70.47bn, as the weighted index rose 36.50 to 5,953.27, off a high of 5,992.64 but 3.9 per cent up on the week. BOMBAY rose across a wide front on buying led by foreign and Indian mutual funds, and on hopes that carry forward trading will be restored. The BSE 30 share index rose 91.4, or 2.5 per cent to 3,715.0, down 1.1 per cent on the week. COLOMBO put in a second day of recovery to end only fractionally down on the week, the CSE all-share index closing 27.02 higher at 1,044.19. WELLINGTON regained about half of Thursday's losses, aided mostly by partial recoveries in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index rose 35.59 to 2,048.41, 2.9 per cent down on the week. SINGAPORE reported weakness in property shares, following news of government curbs on speculation in residential properties. The SES property index fell 1.7 per cent, as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 21.55 lower at 2,256.19. MANILA was pulled back again by lower first quarter earnings from the telephone company, PLDT. The composite index dipped 19.77 to 2,960.23, 4.1 per cent up on the week, as PLDT fell 65 pesos to 1,860. BANGKOK fell on the day and the week, the SET index, at 1240.71, showing falls of 11.66, and 2 per cent respectively.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Kaiser Steel Resources: The reorganized successor to Kaiser Steel Corp. said it  earned $951,423 on revenue of $1.3 million in its first quarter. The Rancho  Cucamonga company said that because it was in bankruptcy proceedings during the  first quarter of 1988, year-earlier results have no relevance and were not  provided. The company noted that revenue from a long-term water rights  transaction with the Southern California Water District and lease payments from  Mine Reclamation Corp. helped the results.  </P></p>

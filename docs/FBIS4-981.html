			<p>BFN     [Text] Through Information Secretary Joao Lourenco, the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, MPLA, has said  that the Lusaka peace talks are evolving at a snail's pace. The  MPLA information secretary said so during a party visit to  Lubango, the capital of Huila Province.    [Begin recording] [Lourenco] The view is that the talks are  taking much too long and that it is high time a solution is  found to the conflict in this country. We believe that the  Angolan people have reached the limits of their suffering, so  there is every need for the government, the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], and the international  community in Lusaka to make every effort to ensure that a peace  accord is signed as soon as possible.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you believe that such an  accord will be the solution to the Angolan conflict?    [Lourenco] I think so. I believe so. It is common to say  that hope is the last thing to go, so we are still keeping alive  the hope that peace will be achieved in Lusaka.    [Correspondent] UNITA has said that the government has asked  for a deadline at the talks so that it can continue its  offensive on the ground. Would you care to comment?    [Lourenco] That is an absurd point of view. If we are asking  for a deadline, it is because we want to achieve peace as soon  as possible. In doing so, we are making it clear that we are  the only ones interested in having the war end immediately and  in achieving peace that will last. [end recording]</p>

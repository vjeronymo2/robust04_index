			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / German rate cut lifts markets: UK equities rise to record highs - US shows fresh signs of recovery LEADING financial markets around the world gathered strength yesterday after the Bundesbank unexpectedly eased German monetary policy and the US economy showed new signs of maintaining its recovery from recession. British equities rose to record highs while sterling and the dollar forged ahead after a clear signal that the Bundesbank was committed to gradual reductions in interest rates and news of better-than-expected job creation in the US. Less than 24 hours after it disappointed financial markets by leaving its discount and Lombard rates unchanged, the German central bank cut the rate at which it offers wholesale funds to the country's banking system by just under a quarter of a percentage point. The cut in the securities repurchase - or repo - rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.49 per cent was widely seen as signalling a reduction in the discount and Lombard rates from 8 and 9 per cent respectively when the Bundesbank's central council next meets on March 18. British officials said the German cut did not pave the way for a further easing in UK monetary policy, but the move triggered rises on the UK equity and bond markets. Prices also jumped in many, but not all, continental European centres. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at a new high of 2,922.1, up 17.3 points on the day. Gilts of all maturities also rose with the benchmark 9 per cent gilt due in 2008 rising by  27/32 points. Dutch, French and Belgian stock markets also gained while stock markets in Frankfurt and Zurich closed down slightly. On foreign exchange markets, sterling rose by over 3 pfennigs to close in London at DM2.41. Boosted by the US employment figures, the dollar rose over 3 pfennigs, closing at DM1.6670 in London. In New York the pound closed at DM2.4138 and the dollar at DM1.66835. The German rate cut was a response mainly to domestic conditions. Growth in inflation, wages and money supply has moderated recently, while a spreading domestic recession also influenced the central bank's decisions. Yesterday's changes coincided with the announcement of a sharp rise in German unemployment to almost 3.5m and a surge of 200,000 in the number of people working short time. Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate, said current domestic economic data indicated that rates should be reduced in small steps. He tried to damp speculation about the next move. There was no more room for manoeuvre at present, he said, and no one should count on an automatic cut in the discount and Lombard rates at the next council meeting. But Mr Hilmar Kopper, head of Deutsche Bank, said borrowing costs were on the way down. While most economists believe the discount and Lombard rates will fall to 6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively by the end of the year, prospects for early changes to official rates depend on the outcome of talks between Bonn and the 16 state governments on public spending cuts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called a meeting with regional leaders for March 11. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's new economics minister, yesterday stood by official forecasts that the economy will stagnate this year and start to recover in early 1994 at the latest.

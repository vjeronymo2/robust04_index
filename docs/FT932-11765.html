			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Tears and cheers as Arab deportees go home OUTSIDE the Palestinian Embassy in Amman, Abdul Jawad Saleh waited with tears in his eyes. After 20 years of exile, he, along with 14 other Palestinian deportees, blinked in the morning sun as their luggage was packed on a convoy of buses bound for the occupied territories. Cheered on by their families who sang Palestinian folk songs and waved the national flag, Mr Saleh, once the mayor of Al Bireh in the West Bank, said he could not believe that he was finally allowed to go home. 'This is a re-birth, a resurrection for me. Every day since 1973 I have dreamed of this,' he said. The group is the first instalment of 30 Palestinians who the Israelis have agreed to allow back into the occupied territories. Nassir Hana, president of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, who was expelled to southern Lebanon in 1974, described their return as 'a victory for world opinion. This gives legitimacy for the full return of all Palestinians,' he said. On the other side of Allenby bridge connecting Jordan to the West Bank, thousands of Palestinians gathered on the streets to greet the returnees. The Israeli army looked on from a distance. After many hours the deportees cleared customs. People clambered onto buses waving posters of Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and songs and festivities filled the air. The move is Israel's first concession to the Palestinians since the Middle East peace process began 18 months ago. Most of the returnees were community leaders deported after the 1967 war for 'political activities'. Firebrands and radicals in their time, many are now retired professionals in their late fifties and older. In the Palestinian political spectrum of the 1990s they are all mainstream PLO supporters and firmly in favour of the peace talks. A number of Palestinians were careful to play down the importance of the Israeli gesture but Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said yesterday that peace talks with Israel were finally producing results and might be entering a 'qualitatively different phase.' More than 1,400 Palestinians have been deported from the occupied territories since 1967. Agreement on the return of 30 represents a minor victory for the PLO which is desperate to regain credibility after two years of fruitless negotiations.</p>

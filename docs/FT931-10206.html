			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Socialists to debate Craxi's future MR Bettino Craxi, secretary general of Italy's Socialist party, is under mounting pressure to step down from the leadership and to support the election of a successor at tomorrow's extraordinary assembly of the party. Despite receiving four separate notices from Milan magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption and illicit funding of the party, Mr Craxi has insisted on remaining the Socialist secretary general. He has consistently denied any wrong-doing and accused the magistrates of carrying out a personalised campaign of denigration. The special party meeting has been called to consider Mr Craxi's resignation and elect a new secretary general. But the party has postponed such a decision on several occasions. However, his position has been undermined by the arrest of Mr Silvano Larini, an architect and friend since university days. Mr Larini, who has been on the run outside Italy for eight months, handed himself over to Milan magistrates at the Franco-Italian border post of Ventimiglia on Sunday. Mr Larini has been cited 21 times in documents seeking waiver of parliamentary immunity for Mr Craxi, and is now said to be co-operating with magistrates over allegations that he was a major collector of funds for the Socialists in Milan public works contracts. Mr Craxi has sought to ensure he holds sway over any potential successor. He has blocked any suggestion that Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, should lead the party.</p>

Addressing a national conference on customs work which  closed  here today, Li said that the customs restructuring must be  carried out simultaneously with the overall reform of China's  economic structure.    It is necessary to institute a modern customs system with  Chinese characteristics that will meet the needs of a socialist  market economic structure and opening up, and will be compatible  with internationally accepted practices, the leader told  directors of customs offices from all over the country.    To this end, "We must introduce an inspection system, reform  the declaration system and the customs managerial system...,  while combining our professional restructuring with the use of  modern technical means in an effort to establish modern,  efficient customs offices," he said.    Li Lanqing urged the directors of customs offices to tighten  supervision of import and export goods and crack down on all  kinds of duty evasion and fraud so as to maintain a normal  economic order.    "We have scored initial successes in the current  anti-smuggling campaign, but by no means can we relax our  efforts," he said.    The leader pledged to investigate and handle major smuggling  cases promptly, noting that it is imperative to combine the  anti-smuggling campaign with the anti-corruption campaign in  order to ensure the healthy development of the country's  economic construction.</p>

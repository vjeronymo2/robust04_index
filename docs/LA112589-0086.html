			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> EASTERN MACHINISTS VOW TO STAY OUT  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines' striking ground workers vowed in Miami to stay on the picket  line despite a decision by the carrier's pilots and flight attendants to end  their 8 1/2-month sympathy strike. The airline, meanwhile, said there are no  jobs for the pilots and flight attendants who have ended their walkout.  Eastern's attorneys asked U.S. District Judge James L. King to determine the  status of all employees: those hired during the strike, union members who  crossed picket lines and returning strikers. A leader of the machinists said  the union was preparing to step up its strike campaign to take advantage of  Eastern's precarious financial situation and what the union claims is a  maintenance shortage.  </P></p>

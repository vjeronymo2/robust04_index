Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On Thursday, August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), EPA, Region IV proposed the issuance of the draft NPDES General Permit. During the 30-day comment period, a request for an extension of the comment period was received, and on Tuesday, October 25, 1988 (53 FR 43035), the comment period was extended to November 15, 1988. On Monday, July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), EPA, Region IV issued the Final NPDES General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On Friday, February 22, 1991 (56 FR 7379), EPA, Region IV published a notice of a proposed modification to the NPDES General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida (56 FR 7379) to include dewatering activities. On Thursday, August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), the final modification was issued. The general permit expired on July 16, 1994. On Monday, September 19, 1994, EPA Region IV published a notice concerning the reissuance of the general permit (59 FR 47862) that is being issued in final form today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Region received comments from eight (8) commentors. All the public comments received during the 30-day comment period are included in the administrative record and were considered by Region IV in the formulation of a final determination of the conditions of today's final permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For reference, Region IV published a detailed fact sheet with the proposed draft permit in 59 FR 47862. The Region is incorporating by reference that fact sheet as part of the final fact sheet for today's final permit. The discussions presented in the previous fact sheet should be consulted in reviewing the applicability and scope of the final permit conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A formal hearing is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under 40 CFR 124.14 except for a general permit. Persons affected by a general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general permit as a right in further agency proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit in court, or apply for an individual permit under 40 CFR 122.21 as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28 and then request a formal hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual permit. Additional information regarding these procedures is available by contacting Ms. Gwen Eason, Office of Regional Counsel, at the address above or at (404) 347&hyph;2309.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II.

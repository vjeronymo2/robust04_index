			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Reported rise in new car sales prompts doubts NEW CAR registrations rose by 16 per cent last month, according to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, possibly indicating recovery in the market. Ford, the UK market leader, said there had been a pronounced rise in the number of private buyers entering the market - a development likely to be strongly welcomed by a government anxious to see consumer confidence restored. But suspicions surround the true strength of the recovery, and the extent to which the statistics might be inflated by manufacturers organising market-boosting tactics, such as the registering of cars for which there are no real buyers. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said last month that January's figures were 'inflated and erroneous', and reflected attempts by some manufacturers to boost their market shares and hence consumer confidence in their products. The doubts were strengthened by statistics released yesterday showing new commercial vehicle registrations down by 7.5 per cent last month. The society expressed particular concern that the poor state of continental European markets means that the UK is the only major EC country where sales are improving. The society said: 'A strong build-up in domestic sales is essential if the UK industry is to compensate for sales which are bound to be lost overseas,' Its concern is based on some of the sharpest recorded falls seen in key Continental markets: German sales fell 27.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in January; French sales by nearly 37 per cent and Spanish sales by nearly 53 per cent. Yesterday's statistics show registrations of new cars last month at 126,984, up 16.06 per cent from 109,414 in the same month last year. Sales in February last year were at their lowest February level since 1976, however, because buyers delayed spending decisions in the hope that the 10 per cent special car tax - now abolished - would be reduced in the following month's Budget. For the first two months of this year registrations were up 10.96 per cent, to 291,923 from 263,096. The market has now risen for five consecutive months, and in nine of the last 11 months. The percentage of imports, although down marginally in February to 53.78 per cent (from 54 per cent), has risen in the year to date to 54.41 per cent (from 53.4 per cent). Mr David Gent, director-general of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing 7,500 dealers, warned last night: 'It is critically important that the government does not receive a false signal from these figures. The only credible strategy for the Budget is one of no significant change to any area of taxation.' The sharpest jumps in registrations last month were achieved by Ford, up 34.75 per cent, Fiat group, up 48 per cent and Peugeot and Renault, up 27.74 per cent and 33 per cent respectively.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK CAR REGISTRATIONS -

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> MGM Grand Inc.: The casino and airline conglomerate reported a $10.1-million  third-quarter loss, contrasted with net income of $900,000 in the same period  last year. Revenue for the period was $38.9 million, about the same as in the  third quarter of 1989. The Culver City-based firm cited a reduced casino win  percentage, increased airline fuel prices and advertising, and other costs  related to the August introduction of DC-8 two-class service between Los  Angeles and New York.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 8 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu arrived in Beijing late Wednesday [8 June]  for talks with Chinese officials.    The visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic exchanges as the  U.N. Security Council considers implementing sanctions on North  Korea over its suspected nuclear development program.    Han's two-day visit will officially start with an 8 a.m.  breakfast with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Thursday,  a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    North Korea, suspected of building a secret nuclear weapons  program, has refused international inspections of its  experimental nuclear reactor, thus violating the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty of which it is a signatory.    On Tuesday, North Korea's army Chief of Staff Choe Kwang met  with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in what was believed to be a  meeting concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as  saying in New York on Tuesday that North Korea will be unable to  avoid Security Council sanctions if it fails to change its  stance on the nuclear issue.    Han, speaking to South Korean reporters shortly before  leaving New York for Beijing, reportedly said the situation  surrounding the nuclear dispute could change for the better  within days if Pyongyang cooperates with the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the issue of nuclear inspections.    "If not, North Korea could not avoid U.N. economic  sanctions," Han was quoted as saying.    He said an overwhelming majority of Security Council members  had indicated they are prepared to take strong action against  North Korea, though a Council resolution would not come until  after next week.</p>

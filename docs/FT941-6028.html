			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Nottingham seeks to raise Pounds 15m Nottingham Group, one of the UK's largest suppliers of educational products, is planning to raise about Pounds 15m in new capital from its forthcoming flotation. The funds will be used to redeem preference shares and repay debt. The pathfinder prospectus, released yesterday, showed 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 7.08m) after a Pounds 1.1m write-down on fixed assets. Mr David Mansfield, chief executive, said Nottingham's existing business offered steady growth, but he was looking to expand the product range through acquisitions. He said that government schools had built up budget reserves of Pounds 400m, which he expected to support increased purchases of educational supplies in the coming years. The company was formed through a management buy-out from Coats Viyella in 1989, and the subsequent purchase of EJ Arnold, its main competitor, from Pergamon. The management and its venture capital backers will sell some existing shares through the placement and intermediaries offer, in addition to the Pounds 15m of new shares. Nottingham will have an initial market capitalisation of about Pounds 80m. Impact day is March 17, and the offer will close a week later. It is the first UK flotation to be sponsored by Goldman Sachs International.</p>

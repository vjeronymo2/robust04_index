After losing its United Nations seat in 1971, many countries,  including Japan, ASEAN countries, and the United States, broke  diplomatic relations to establish diplomatic relations with  Beijing. Those countries, however, continue to maintain normal  economic relations with Taiwan. [passage omitted]    Now, Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with only 29  countries, mostly small and poor countries in Africa or Latin  America. No Asian countries have diplomatic relations with  Taiwan, although they maintain good trade links with it. Taiwan  leaders, especially President Li Teng-hui, want to improve  Taiwan's position in the international arena. So they practice  contructive diplomacy through informal visits or a "holiday"  diplomacy. [passage omitted]    President Li Teng-Hui and his delegation arrived in Thailand  on 14 February. In Phuket, President Li Teng-hui met some  leading Thai businessmen such as rice exporter Hu Yulin [Thai  name: Saman Ophatwong] and Li Guanglong [Thai name: Wisit  Lilasithon]. He also played golf with Deputy Prime Minister  Amnuai Wirawan. Although President Li Teng-hui did not meet  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Squadron  Leader Prasong Sunsiri, he had an unexpected audience with the  king for 20 minutes before leaving for home. Taiwan's efforts  were successful, but it spent a lot for the ASEAN tour.    China tried to prevent the "holiday diplomacy." The Chinese  Foreign Ministry issued warnings, saying that any reception of  President Li Teng-hui would be tantamount to the violation of  the "one-China" policy and affect bilateral relations.  Moreover, China also canceled a visit by a National People's  Congress delegation to Thailand and the Philippines. [passage  omitted]    Thailand upholds the "one-China" policy. The Thai leader  also did not meet President Li Teng-hui. So, China should  understand Thailand's stand.    Taiwan's "holiday diplomacy" is profoundly wise. It will not  achieve concrete political achievements, however, unless China  loses its wisdom. All in all, it is believed that China will  wisely continue to maintain its relations with ASEAN countries.</p>

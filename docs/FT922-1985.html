			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Observer: Still at sea The Salvage Association sounds an appropriate sort of resting place for those discarded on the political scrapheap. So John Butcher, who produced a crushing defeat for the Conservatives when standing against Shirley Williams in the 1981 Crosby by-election, and who has just arrived as the Association's chief accountant, should fit in well enough. In fact, the salvage with which Butcher will be concerned is not personal, but rather marine in nature - the organisation being in the business of handing out technical advice to the London insurance market about marine claims. Butcher's connection with the sea? 'I can't comment on that, my role is to look after finance; my colleagues don't expect me to know about safety at sea,' says the Royal Navy Reserve Volunteer of ten years' standing.</p>

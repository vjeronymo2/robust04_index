			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / More assets seized from Italian official Rome police have uncovered yet more wealth accumulated by Mr Duilio Poggiolini, the senior health ministry official from whom more than L200bn (Pounds 83m) in assets has been seized because it is alleged they originated from bribes, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The latest haul included some 60 modern paintings and L10bn concealed in a large living room pouff in one of Mr Poggiolini's Rome apartments. The find follows the arrest last week of Mr Poggiolini's wife on charges of assisting her husband in collecting bribes from pharmaceutical companies. Her arrest also led to a scare that she had been involved in allowing suspect plasma to be sold. However, the health authorities this week discounted suggestions that infected plasma had been on sale. In another development police announced they were stepping up the search for Mr Oliviero Prunas, deputy chairman of the state-controlled Banca di Roma. He is wanted for his alleged involvement in the Enimont affair, the politically sanctioned sale in 1990 at an inflated price of Ferruzzi-Montedison's stake in its joint chemicals with Eni, the state oil company. Mr Prunas is the third banker linked to the Enimont affair which produced kick-backs totalling L150bn.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Italian probe claims scalp of fourth minister MR Gianni Fontana, Italy's agriculture minister, last night became the fourth minister to resign in little more than a month as a result of the political corruption scandal. The move is a further serious blow to the fragile eight-month-old government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. Beside the forced departures, he has had to contend with growing difficulties in passing legislation. Mr Fontana, a Christian Democrat, stepped down after being told by magistrates in the northern city of Verona he could face prosecution on allegations of abusing laws on financing political parties and illegally receiving funds. Yesterday, magistrates searched Mr Fontana's house in the city and his holiday home on Lake Garda as part of corruption inquiries in Verona which have already involved a number of local politicians Meanwhile, Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat MP from Naples advised by magistrates he could face prosecution in the scandal, has admitted to collecting billions of lire in bribes for local party leaders. The admission could give southern magistrates investigating allegations of widespread political corruption their first breakthrough in one of the electoral strongholds of Italy's largest political party. Until now, the investigations, which began in Milan, have barely penetrated the political fabric of the Mezzogiorno, or southern Italy, where the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, the two parties most implicated in the corruption scandal, draw much of their support. Bribes and kickbacks to politicians 'are present in every corner of society', said Mr Vito in television interviews at the weekend. 'I was a part of this system.' Threatening to take the lid off a decade of political corruption in Naples, Mr Vito has resigned from the party and will step down as an MP. 'I hope other colleagues under investigation will follow my example,' he said. Mr Vito is closely associated with Mr Antonio Gava, a senior Christian Democrat senator and leader of an important party faction. Naples is also the power base for two other top Christian Democrats: Mr Vincenzo Scotti, the former interior minister, and Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, the ex-budget minister. The allegations against Mr Vito, who received over 100,000 personal preference votes in last April's general election, involve corruption and extortion. Last week, a parliamentary committee backed the request by magistrates, investigating a jobs-for-votes scam, for Mr Vito's immunity to be waived. On Thursday, he offered to testify voluntarily. The investigations in Naples, Italy's third biggest city, have focused partly on alleged kickbacks paid by building contractors for modernising the football stadium for the 1990 World Cup.</p>

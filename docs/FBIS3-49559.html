			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Malgorzata Subotic: "Too Small a Step in the </F> Right Direction"]    [Text] President Lech Walesa and the Pawlak government see  eye to eye on statements by President Clinton in Brussels: "This  is too small a step in the right direction." No one has ever  questioned Walesa's visit to the summit in Prague. Poland will  never seek any other defense unions, including bilateral ones.  This information was conveyed to journalists by Polish Foreign  Minister Andrzej Olechowski following the Cabinet of Ministers  meeting on 10 January, attended by Walesa and legislators  responsible for foreign policy issues. The president left the  government building without making any comments to the press.    The Council of Ministers instructed the prime minister to  accept the "Partnership for Peace" initiative; however, the  final decision will not be adopted until all relevant documents  are made public. The ministers of defense and foreign affairs  will conduct a thorough analysis of those documents. In the  opinion of Andrzej Olechowski, the Polish Government described  Clinton's recent statements, including the affirmation of U.S.  presence in Europe, NATO openness for new members (as a result  of evolution), "Partnership for Peace," and the definition of  new relations between the West European Union and NATO, as too  small a step in the right direction. Walesa said that "if you  make too small a step over the creek, you might fall into it."    Polish politicians believe that Western proposals for  admitting new members to NATO lack a timetable and conditions  for admission. At the same time, they emphasize that Poland's  strategic goal is NATO membership. Minister Olechowski said  that it is better to be in the waiting room than to wait  outside. While the doors to NATO have been closed until  recently, the minister thinks that we have now found ourselves  in the waiting room. Meeting with journalists, Olechowski  equated the situation to "engagement with a girl who agreed  yesterday to marry us" but didn't say when. He also disagreed  with journalists who said Poland stands no chance of being  admitted to the bloc.    Asked about the Visegrad Group summit beginning today in  Prague, the minister stressed that the stance of its members on  the NATO issue is almost identical. "The differences can be  compared to those between synonymous words." The Polish  minister is optimistic about the readiness of our country to  participate in NATO: "In terms of democracy and the development  of the military industry, Poland is by no means worse off than  Greece was at the time of its admission to the bloc. We should  be among the first countries to be admitted."</p>

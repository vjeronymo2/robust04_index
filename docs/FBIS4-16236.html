			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- Azerbaijan is ready for  reasonable compromises in settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict,  but it will never put up with the occupation of its territories,  Azeri President Geydar Aliyev said in an exclusive interview  with TASS upon arriving in Moscow on Thursday to attend a CIS  summit.    According to Aliyev, the republic's leadership is now  thoroughly considering a new draft agreement set forth by Russia  and designed to put an end to the conflict over the  Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Azerbaijan agrees in principle to this  document but deems it necessary to amend it with due regard for  the republic's remarks and proposals, the president said. "If  the Armenian side agrees to them, the document will be signed",  Aliyev announced. He expects to meet in Moscow with his  Armenian counterpart Levon Ter-Petrosyan.    Speaking to newsmen at the Vnukovo airport, the Azeri leader  expressed hope that "the present summit will help consolidate  the CIS". Azerbaijan attaches great importance to mutual  relations between CIS countries, which Aliyev believes should be  discussed during the Moscow high-level meeting. We would like  our Commonwealth to become more viable in all respects, the  Azeri president stressed.    He is convinced that the CIS can also have its say in  settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict, "it should not just look  from aside at the continued bloodshed on Azeri land".    Aliyev described the current situation in the conflict zone  as extremely grave. It became exacerbated following the fresh  offensive launched by Armenian troops on four front segments a  few days ago. The fighting resulted in huge casualties on both  sides. The Azeri president believes it is high time the warring  sides came to see reason. In this connection, he especially  counts on assistance from the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Top jobs change for third time at Philippine Airlines Philippine Airlines (PAL), the national flag carrier, is to carry out senior management changes for the third time since it was privatised 25 months ago. The revamp, including the appointment of a new president/chief operating officer, is being instigated by PR Holdings, the consortium that acquired 67 per cent of PAL at a public auction in January 1992. Mr Carlos Dominguez, currently chairman and president, is likely to stay as chairman/chief executive officer, but it is thought the task of overseeing day-to-day operations will be assigned to a PR Holdings nominee. No names have been mentioned yet, and the search will have to be co-ordinated with the government, which owns about 28 per cent. PR Holdings said that in the nine months to December 1993 unaudited net profits slumped to just 56.9m pesos (Dollars 1.4m), from 1.17bn pesos the year before. Revenues had risen by almost 12 per cent but expenses grew by 19 per cent. PR Holdings is controlled by tobacco-and-banking magnate Mr Lucio Tan, but owing to his relations with former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the government had refused to allow him to run PAL directly. At the time of the auction the consortium was headed by Mr Antonio Cojuangco, president of Philippine Long Distance Telephone and a relative of former president Mrs Corazon Aquino. Mr Cojuangco, however, failed to raise enough cash, forcing him to seek the support of Mr Tan. Mr Dominguez, a former agriculture secretary and bank executive, was picked a year ago by the government to head the airline, after the resolution of a squabble over representation in PR Holdings. The quarrel arose after a discovery that two state banks had put up cash to support PR Holdings' takeover of PAL. Although the government continues to support Mr Dominguez, there is agreement that he cannot cope with both positions. Late last year, Mr Tan placed a number of his people to key managerial posts. Over the past few months, Mr Tan has been the subject of state investigations for alleged tax evasion. At PAL, Mr Dominguez reported that the big drop in net profits had been due to higher maintenance costs, particularly after a decision to contract out to foreign companies the repair of aircraft engines. If the trend does not change, PAL will suffer its first loss in three years. Monthly losses had been recorded since September and early estimates for January, according to PR Holdings, indicate further red ink.</p>

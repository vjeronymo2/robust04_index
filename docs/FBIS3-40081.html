			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Min-tang (0491 2494 1016) in Taipei: "Li </F> Teng-hui Goes Wild"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The "Analects of Li Teng-hui's  Wildness" compiled by the New Democratic Party include:    Tainan County - Li says "If Huang Hsiu-meng loses the  election, I will commit seppuku." Note: It appears that if the  head of state commits suicide, the "presidential elections" will  have to be held sooner.    Chiayi City - Li says "If Chang Wen-ying does not have  adequate ability, I will kneel down to get the votes." Note: If  the head of state can kneel down so easily, does that not  humiliate the nation and diminish its influence?    Taoyuan County - Li says "Liu Pang-you is absolutely clean  and will not engage in land speculation." Note: When Liu  Pang-you's three court cases were tried, the head of state  openly stood as guarantor for him. Ai! The chastity of the Queen  of Justice...    Hualien County - Li says "as a representative, Wang  Ching-feng never sought favors." Note: There are two types of  seeking favors. One is for private benefit; the other is for  public benefit. A representative who never seeks favors is a  lazy bum!    Tainan City - Li says "Based on my reputation, please  support  Shih Chih-ming." Note: If the head of state's reputation can be  sold so cheaply, exactly how much is it per kilo?    Hsinchu City - Li says "Tung Sheng-nan was educated to enter  politics and won't mess up." Note: Does Li Teng-hui think that  other candidates are not educated? Pingtung County - Li says "Su  Chen-chang does not get along with others and does not  understand government but Wu Tse-yuan would not finagle a 10  billion construction check." Note: Eight months ago Li Teng-hui  openly confirmed the political career achievements of Su and  other New Democratic Party county chiefs. Now he wantonly  criticizes them for the sake of the elections. The head of  state's "nausea" makes one feel "bitter!" He also publicly  endorsed Wu Tse-yuan's 10 billion check, thus even more clearly  demonstrating how the central government favors the Kuomintang  local leaders and impedes the work of opposition party county  and city leaders.    Kaohsiung County - Li says "Yu Chen Yue-ying only works on  improving Ch'un Chiao." Note: Yu Chen's accomplishments are  universally acclaimed in Kaohsiung. It is inconceivable that the  head of state would be making sarcastic remarks about Ch'un  Chiao.    Taipei County - Li says "You Ching had no achievements  during  his term, but you can wear out your shoes searching and not find  another like Ts'ai Sheng-pang." Note: You Ching based his bid  for re-election on the assessment of ten major accomplishments  during his term. His political rallies are always packed, which  shows that the voters approve. If Li Teng-hui cannot see this,  then his old eyes must be losing their vision.    Penghu County - During an inspection tour of county  governments, Li expels County head Kao Chih-p'eng. Note: He  goes on stage to do political magic tricks. First he is  president; then he is chairman.    Taichung City - Li persuades Hsu Hsing-hui to withdraw,  disregarding the fact that Hsu had sworn before "the gods" to be  "in the election to the finish." Note: If Hsu Hsin-hui is  reproached by the heavens, who will take responsibility?    Taichung County - Li beats his chest and says "If you  believe  in me, Li Teng-hui, then vote for Liao Liao-yi." Note: Liao  Liao-yi was elected four years ago by buying votes and although  he was caught, only his subordinates were sentenced. During his  term, he also participated extensively in land speculation and  the university town incident inspired 15,000 people to  participate in protest demonstrations. He has also been indicted  for the abuse of authority and public equipment for private  purposes during this election. [passage omitted]</p>

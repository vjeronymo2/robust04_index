			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPACE SHUTTLE READIED FOR MORE FUELING TESTS  </P> <P> Columbia, the shuttle plagued with mechanical problems since April, was pulled  from its hangar again Saturday night for a trip to the launch pad.  </P> <P> In late October, Columbia will undergo the first of what may be several fueling  tests. If the shuttle passes, its mission to deploy the $150-million Astro  observatory could get under way in December.  </P> <P> The move was Columbia's sixth since April 22, when it was first rolled out for  a scheduled May 30 mission. Hydrogen leaks scrubbed that launch, and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration did not get a shuttle in orbit  until Discovery took off Oct. 6 with the Ulysses solar probe.  </P></p>

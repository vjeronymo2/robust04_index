			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: GLENDORA;  </P> <P> PLANNING APPEALS CHANGED  </P> <P> It will now take at least two City Council members to gain reconsideration of a  Planning Commission ruling, the council decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> In the incident that led to the decision, Councilman David Bodley earlier this  year asked the council to reconsider a home remodeling approval granted by the  commission, then voted to uphold the commission's decision.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Molly MacLeod said Tuesday that Bodley's appeal was a waste of  time for city staff members, the council and the people who wanted to remodel.  Bodley said he had questions about the project that were only answered minutes  before the council met to consider his appeal.  </P> <P> Bodley voted against Tuesday's measure, saying it would restrict council  members.  </P></p>

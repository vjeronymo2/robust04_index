			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNSPORTSMANLIKE WRITING GETS LITERARY CRITIQUE  </P> <P> For the life of me, I cannot understand why Jim Murray would compare the  Houston Oilers to the defendants at Nuremberg.  </P> <P> Murray, referring to Cincinnati's drubbing of the Oilers, states, "We haven't  seen this kind of runaway kicking of a man when he was down since Nuremberg."  </P> <P> Now, I can sympathize with a proud group of athletes that is humiliated. But  the defendants at Nuremberg?  </P> <P> Many people fear that the horror of the Holocaust will begin to fade in time.  It is grossly insensitive statements like Murray's that hurry the process  along.  </P> <P> MICHAEL ALLEN, Mission Hills  </P></p>

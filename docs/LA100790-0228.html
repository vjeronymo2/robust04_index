			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SAME MAN MAY HAVE ATTACKED 3 WOMEN  </P> <P> The man who raped an Ojai woman Thursday morning could be responsible for two  other assaults in the Ojai area this year, officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> "We think it might be the same person.  </P> <P> If we get him identified, it could tie them all together. But until we do, we  can't say for sure," said Sgt. Tom Odle of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Victims of the three attacks have given similar descriptions of their  assailant, officials said.  </P> <P> The suspect is described as in his mid-20s, slender, about 5 feet 6 inches tall  with light brown skin, dark brown hair and brown or hazel eyes.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a 25-year-old Ojai woman reported that she was raped about 1:30  a.m. after she was dragged into a downtown mini-mall at the corner of Aliso and  North Signal streets.  </P> <P> The woman told police that she made a call from a public phone on Matilija  Street and was walking back to her apartment when she was accosted, Odle said.  When the man let her go, he drove away in a yellow car, Odle said.  </P> <P> On March 16, a 20-year-old Meiners Oaks woman was jogging through a field on  Maricopa Highway north of Nordhoff High School in mid-afternoon when a man  grabbed her.  </P> <P> Passersby heard her screams and ran to help her. The man rode off on a yellow  mountain bike and eluded deputies.  </P> <P> On June 24, deputies who answered a resident's call of hearing screams about 9  p.m. encountered a woman struggling with a man on the ground in Nordhoff  Cemetery at Cuyama and Del Norte roads. The man fled.  </P> <P> That 25-year-old woman told police that her car broke down and that she was  looking for a phone when the man dragged her into the cemetery. THIA BELL  </P></p>

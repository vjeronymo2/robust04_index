			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: Writer in search of integrity / Review of films opening in London THE DARK HALF (18) George A. Romero A HOME OF OUR OWN (PG) Tony Bill NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT (12) Peter Segal THE DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT (15) Peter Greenaway Could it be that Stephen King, arguably the most commercially successful author of our time, wants us to feel sorry for him? His last two filmed novels, Misery and now The Dark Half, have been about serious writers who want to give up producing the potboilers that have made them rich. Can it be that there is a kinder, gentler Stephen King trying to get out from beneath all the horror and gore and money? In The Dark Half, the writer with the bruised integrity is Thad Beaumont (Timothy Hutton), a talented young novelist who resorts to writing nasty crime fiction under a pseudonym when his sensitive 'real' work will not sell. He becomes a million seller, only to have his ruse discovered by a blackmailer who threatens to reveal that the supposedly serious Beaumont has been writing trash. Instead of giving in, Beaumont announces his sins to the nation and publicly kills off his alter ego, George Stark, in the name of art. But things soon turn nasty. Stark, none too keen about his enforced retirement, comes to life and begins viciously murdering everyone associated with Beaumont's decision to come clean. The troubled young author, who becomes the only logical suspect in the crime wave, knows he must seek out and do battle with his own darker half. George A. Romero's film shows promise in its more graphic sequences, particularly a gruesome flashback where the boy Beaumont is discovered to have a mutant foetus growing in his skull. Fans of gory effects will also lap up the exceedingly violent ending, in which a flock of killer sparrows literally tear a man apart. And the film is not without its grim humour - when Stark assails a literary agent with a straight razor, he explains that publishing is, after all, a cut-throat business. But the film's plot is largely ludicrous, relying too much on the actions of a monumentally dumb cop and the absurd notion of an American writer who would be ashamed of having sold a million copies of anything. But what is most irksome about the film is that, once again, King seems to be both having and eating his creative cake. After all, if he really feels so compromised by writing bestsellers, is there not a better way of expressing this than churning out yet another big-budget potboiler on the subject? Speaking of Misery, that film's star, Kathy Bates, can currently be seen in A Home of Our Own, a movie which more than anything else serves to illustrate the pitfalls inherent in winning an Academy Award. After pulling in an Oscar for her truly scary portrayal of Misery's sadistic nurse, Bates seems to have succumbed to a desire to achieve Screen Respectability. It is hard to see what else would have drawn her to this cloying, lightweight piece of American nostalgia. The year is 1962, and Bates is a plucky widow trying to raise six kids on minimum wages. After losing her job in Los Angeles, she sets out with her brood in search of a place where they can have a house and a life of their own. They wind up in a remote corner of Idaho, where Bates convinces a Japanese-American widower (Soon-Teck Oh) to sell her a ramshackle cottage. The family's travails, courage and ultimate triumph as they try to turn this house into a home form the backbone of Patrick Duncan's slight and predictable story. The film's central problem is that it refuses to allow for the sort of nuance and conflict that can occur in such stressful familial circumstances. Everybody is so busy being loving and supportive that they forget to be human. The occasional difficulties - a scrap between Bates and her eldest son, an attempted rape - are all quickly swept away by copious waves of sentimentality. The direction of the usually inspired Tony Bill fails to generate any dramatic tension, even when fire threatens the homestead. Most astonishingly, Bates turns in a downright poor performance, straining so hard to be courageous that she forgets to act. Rest assured that no one will try to tug at your heart strings in Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult. Its makers simply want you to laugh, and will do just about anything they can think of to achieve that goal. This time out they prove slightly less successful than in the first two Naked Gun efforts, though the film is still as funny as anything else now showing on the nation's big screens. The best thing about the series remains Leslie Nielsen, who has honed his deadpan style to something approaching perfection. Keep an eye out for the parody of the steps sequence from The Untouchables and the send-up of the Oscars, where we are treated to the unalloyed pleasure of watching Pia Zadora fall into the orchestra pit. Finally, this week sees the re-release of Peter Greenaway's The Draughtsman's Contract, perhaps as part of a salvage operation after last year's repellent, unwatchable The Baby of Macon. It is now becoming increasingly apparent that Greenaway's 1982 feature, which concerns seduction and murder on a 17th century Wiltshire estate, represents the high point of his controversial career. Here, at least, one can find a comprehensible story underpinning the panache and pomposity. It makes you realise how differently this undoubtedly gifted craftsman's career might have turned out if he had chosen to film coherent narratives instead of his own wearisome obsessions.</p>

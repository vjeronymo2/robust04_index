			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> TANNER DECIDES NOT TO SEEK MONTOYA'S SENATE JOB  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) announced Tuesday that she has  decided not to run for the seat of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya and will seek  reelection in the 60th Assembly District this year.  </P> <P> Tanner, elected to the Assembly in 1978, acknowledged that she had considered  running for the 26th Senate District seat now occupied by the Whittier  Democrat.  </P> <P> Tanner said in a statement that "to succeed in such an effort would require me  to devote the next five months to campaigning as a virtual full-time candidate.  That would have made it impossible for me to continue with my duties as chair  of the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee."  </P> <P> Montoya, whose term is up this year, is on trial in federal court on charges of  bribery, extortion, racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier) is expected to be a candidate for  Montoya's seat. Calderon, who represents the 59th Assembly District, said he  understands the Montoya case will go to the jury later this month. "I expect  that I'll have an announcement after the return of the verdict by the jury," he  said Tuesday.  </P></p>

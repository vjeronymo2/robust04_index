			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: ORANGE;  </P> <P> FORGERY CHARGES AGAINST ASSEMBLYMAN TO STAND  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge in Sacramento on Thursday refused to dismiss charges  against Republican Assemblyman John R. Lewis of Orange, who is accused of  forging former President Reagan's name on campaign-endorsement letters mailed  to California voters in 1986.  </P> <P> Lewis' attorney, Clyde M. Blackmon, said he will appeal the decision of  Superior Court Judge James I. Morris to the 3rd District Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> Blackmon had asked Morris to dismiss the charges on grounds that the phony  endorsement letters could not constitute forgery under California law because  there was no intent to defraud anyone of money or property. But Morris said the  letters could have defrauded voters of their right to fair elections.  </P> <P> The motions filed by Blackmon parallel those he filed earlier this year that  were rejected by Morris and the Court of Appeal. But Blackmon maintains that  the Court of Appeal ruled against Lewis on a procedural point the first time,  and that this time, the court will be able to examine the merits of the case.  </P> <P> Lewis, indicted Feb. 6 by the Sacramento County Grand Jury, has pleaded  innocent and is scheduled to go to trial Sept. 25.  </P></p>

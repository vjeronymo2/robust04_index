			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Jordanian authorities have withdrawn the  passports of Hamas representative in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal and  Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah, pending their decision on  whether to comply with Jordanian regulations.    Official sources said the two men were summoned by the  authorities and asked to "decide whether they are Palestinian --  in which case they would be given a temporary two-year passport  given to residents of the occupied territories, or they are  Jordanian citizens who comply with Jordanian laws."    The sources said the two were also asked to refrain from  making any statements claiming responsibility for attacks in the  occupied territories.    A senior Jordanian official told the Jordan Times that the  government had intended to curb the activities of Hamas in  Jordan without much publicity but was pressured to publicise  these measures after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin issued  a warning to Jordan charging that it was helping Hamas.    "We had already instructed the minister of interior to deal  with the issue before Rabin had his press conference," the  senior official said.    Hamas representatives were not available for comment Monday,  but the movement issued a statement charging that Mr. Rabin was  "creating fictitious conflicts to cover up for his political  failure."    "The prime minister of the enemy Yitzhaq Rabin has issued a  warning to Jordanin which he claimed that there is a leadership  for Hamas on its territory and demanding that the Jordanian  government take action against its activities," the statement  responded.    "It is a failed attempt to use the confirmation by the Hamas  representatives in Amman of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam's Brigades'  claim of responsibility for the heroic acts in 'Afula and  Hadera," the statement said.    "Rabin and his government know very well that the  al-Qassam's  Brigades conduct, plan and execute their activities from the  occupied territories," the statement said, adding that "his  failure to put an end to these attacks, and the revealing of his  deception in the settlement process has caused him to use these  attacks to issue a warning to Jordan."    Hamas said that Mr. Rabin needed to warn Jordan to achieve  the following objectives:    -- Direct attention away from the failure of his security  measures and his oppressive measures in putting an end to the  heroic attacks by the al-Qassam Brigades.    -- Use the "American sword" to pressure Jordan towards  signing a unilateral agreement with his government similar to  the one signed in Oslo, and this warning falls in line with the  policy of the U.S. administration which uses the naval blockade  on al-'Aqabah as a way to pressure Jordan for the same purpose.    Despite the strong language against Israel and Mr. Rabin's  government, the Hamas statement appeared to set a precedent in  opening the door for bargaining with Israel.    Stressing that the attacks against Israeli civilians were in  retaliation against the Hebron massacre of Palestinian  worshippers, Hamas said that this was not a policy but the  "exception."    "Hamas is ready to reconsider this exception on the  condition  that the enemy's prime minister, his government and his army  halt completely all killings of unarmed civilians from our  people," the statement said.    "We are not against peace," the statement added," but the  peace offered by the government of the enemy is not peace but a  consolidation of occupation and the injustice falling on our  people."    "While we in Hamas know well that the Oslo agreement is  nothing but humiliating surrender from the PLO... we think that  the right beginning would be on the following foundations," the  statement added.    Hamas demanded the "full Israeli withdrawal from our  Palestinian land and dismantling and removal of all settlements,  the holding of full and free elections in the West Bank and Gaza  to select the representatives of our people and their  leadership."    "The chosen leadership will be the one that represents the  aspirations and hopes of our people and will decide on the  ensuing steps," the statement concluded in what most analysts  termed as an indication that Hamas was proposing itself as an  alternative leadership to the Palestine Liberation Organisation,  through the results of the elections and by deduction the side  to conduct negotiations with Israel.</p>

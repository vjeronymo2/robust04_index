			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR CALLS DIFFERENCES WITH U.S. 'NORMAL';  </P> <P> ISRAEL: HIS COMMENT UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT THE TWO NATIONS STILL HAVE NOT  AGREED ON THE NEXT STEP TOWARD MIDEAST PEACE.  </P> <P> At the end of a trying visit to America, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of  Israel said Sunday that the drum-rolls of discontent in the United States over  Israeli peace efforts in the Mideast are merely the sound of "normal  differences" between good friends.  </P> <P> "There were always differences about some issues between the United States and  Israel," Shamir said. "I think it would be not normal if it was otherwise."  </P> <P> Just the fact that the prime minister had to voice what might otherwise pass  without saying between old allies underscored bilateral disappointment: The two  countries still have not reached agreement on the next difficult and crucial  step toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians in Israeli-occupied  territories.  </P> <P> It also reflected the sharp U.S. complaints that Shamir heard on this trip  about Israel's military cooperation with South Africa.  </P> <P> "We still have a long way to make together," he said of the United States and  Israel.  </P> <P> At a breakfast meeting with the editor and other journalists of The Times,  Shamir marveled at the lightning velocity of political change in Eastern  Europe, as old enemies break down the walls that separate them and where  democracy is spreading at a gallop. But in the Mideast, he cautioned, lasting  solutions between embittered foes "will take years."  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, at this moment in the Arab world, democracy doesn't have any  meaning," Shamir said.  </P> <P> In expressions of optimism, however, Shamir said Israel's relations with East  Bloc countries are improving. Full diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union "I  think will come soon," he said.  </P> <P> He described as "a miracle" Israel's newly restored diplomatic relations with  Ethiopia, which has opened the door for 18,000 Ethiopian Jews to emigrate to  Israel. This will reunite many families who were separated in 1985 when Israel  secretly airlifted 12,000 Ethiopian Jews out of Sudan in a storied move called  Operation Moses.  </P> <P> As Israel improves relations with other countries and brings on new waves of  immigration, however, its economy is put under great strain, Shamir said, but  Israel will cope. "I am sure we will solve it. We have no choice."  </P> <P> But not alone, he added. "We are looking for the help of all our friends all  over the world to help us in building housing and, what is more difficult, to  prepare jobs," he said. "I think in the next few years, this will be the main  subject on our agenda."  </P> <P> Shamir wrapped up this U.S. visit with a three-day stop in Los Angeles, where  he spoke to the World Affairs Council on Friday and was the featured guest  Sunday night at a dinner benefiting the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust  Studies. En route to the West, he spoke to the General Assembly of the Council  of Jewish Federations meeting in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> He met Wednesday with President Bush -- a meeting that in planning, execution  and aftermath seemed designed by U.S. officials to emphasize the Bush  Administration's impatience over the lack of progress toward Israel's stated  goal of conducting elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a five-point plan to try to  draw Israel into its first-ever direct negotiations with Palestinians. But both  Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization have attached conflicting  conditions to acceptance of the plan.  </P> <P> Shamir said that his "differences" with the Bush Administration were not unlike  those that Israel has had with Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> "You know that in the press appear various assessments and descriptions,"  Shamir said to Times journalists at the breakfast Sunday, "but this doesn't  change the facts. And the facts, the meaning of the facts, are that close and  friendly relations between the two countries, Israel and the United States,  including strategic cooperation, continue without any obstacles."  </P> <P> But, he added, "in the Congress it is a different story."  </P> <P> He referred specifically to a closed-door meeting with a select group of  Congress members who had complained sharply about Israeli-South Africa military  ties. Bush has also raised the subject.  </P> <P> Shamir picked his words carefully: "The spirit of these discussions was  friendly -- enough."  </P> <P> As for a solution: "We have tried to analyze it and to understand the concerns  about it. . . . We decided to have further opportunities to discuss it."  </P> <P> Shamir told the President that Israel decided two years ago to sever its  military cooperation with South Africa but would honor contracts "until they  expire."  </P> <P> During past visits, Shamir has said the policies of Israel enjoy nearly  unanimous support from American Jews. This time, though, Shamir was faced with  important notices of dissent from the U.S. Jewish community.  </P> <P> Foremost was a public letter signed last Thursday by 41 American Jewish leaders  who told Shamir that "most American Jews" disagree with his steadfast  reluctance to consider giving up occupied lands in exchange for guaranteed  peace.  </P> <P> U.S. policy officially seeks such an exchange. But it was considered an  important milestone when prominent members of the mainstream U.S. Jewish  community publicly disagreed with the basic peace policy of an Israeli prime  minister.  </P> <P> In reply, Shamir said, "Well, you know, in any democratic society you rarely  see unanimous support for anything. The problem is: Where is the majority?"  </P> <P> He answered his own question, saying he believes "the great majority of  American Jewry supports the policy of the national unity government in Israel."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Norman Kempster, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

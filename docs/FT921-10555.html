			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Agnelli setback in bid for Perrier THE AGNELLI family of Italy yesterday suffered a setback in its battle with Nestle, the powerful Swiss food group, for control of Perrier, France's famous mineral water group, when an investigation by the French stock market authorities uncovered 'serious weaknesses' in the conduct of Perrier and Exor, its controlling shareholder. This investigation comes at a critical time for the Agnellis who late last month saw their friendly FFr5.6bn (Pounds 572.2m) bid for Exor turn into a dramatic fight for Perrier when Nestle launched a FFr13.42bn hostile bid for the mineral water company in conjunction with with Banque Indosuez, the Paris bank. The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the regulatory body behind the investigation, also raised questions about the recent FFr1.5bn purchase of 14 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis. Although Exor president Mr Jacques Vincent also chairs Perrier, the COB said it could not 'prove with certainty' that the boards of Exor and Saint Louis had used 'privileged information about the Nestle bid' in orchestrating the share sale. The Agnellis' allies - Exor and Saint Louis - can effectively block the Nestle bid as they control nearly 50 per cent of Perrier's shares. However the legality of the Saint Louis share purchase is now the subject of a case in the Paris commercial court. The court's ruling, due on February 25, will hinge on whether the Perrier board did act on privileged information to sell the shares simply to block the imminent Nestle bid. The COB will send the conclusions of its investigation to the Paris court. It will also submit its findings on Exor's relationship with Perrier to the commercial court in Nimes where Nestle has filed a case to freeze the voting rights on Exor's 35 per cent share of the mineral water company. Nestle has already won a temporary injunction for this. The COB criticised the Exor and Perrier boards for the 'inadequacies' and 'contradictions' in the information released to shareholders about the extent of Exor's involvement in Perrier. It also criticised the role of Mr Gustave Leven, former president of the mineral water company. The COB's conclusions will help to influence the outcome of the Paris and Nimes cases. If either court rules against the Agnelli camp, the blocking stake against Nestle would disappear and Nestle and Indosuez could win control of Perrier. The European Commission has also begun a routine inquiry into the Agnellis' bid for Exor. Lex, Page 18</p>

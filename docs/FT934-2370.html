			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: German banks put reticence aside  -An industry less defensive after record profits Just as many rich Germans lead a modest lifestyle, German banks do not like to flaunt their prosperity. But in the past few weeks, the big banks have put reticence aside and told the world how they are making more money this year than they have ever done before, despite the deep recession afflicting their customers. One big bank after another has reported a surge in profits for the 10 months to October, even after making provisions for mounting bad and doubtful debts. The growth was most pronounced at Commerzbank, the third-largest of the big banks, where operating profits after provisions rose by 52 per cent. But it was still impressive at Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, where profits rose by 11 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. At Bayerische Vereinsbank and Hypo-Bank, the two big Bavarian banks, profits grew at a spectacular 28 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. The main impetus for the growth came from buoyant conditions in world securities and currencies markets, which helped the banks make record trading profits on their own account and generate healthy commission from dealing on their clients' behalf. On top of that came an increase in profits from mainstream lending business. Bank lending was still growing at a six-month annualised rate of a robust 9.2 per cent in October, despite the depth of the recession. Mortgage business is growing at a still higher rate as demand for loans has been stimulated by extremely low long-term interest rates. Offsetting the growth in profits was a sharp deterioration in domestic credit quality - all of the big banks with the exception of Commerzbank reported substantial increases in provisions to cover questionable risks. At Deutsche Bank, provisions surged 54 per cent to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.47bn) in the first 10 months of the year and are likely to reach DM3bn for the year as a whole. On balance, even the full flexibility of German accounting - which gives managers considerable scope to deploy 'hidden reserves' to keep reported earnings at whatever level suits them - could not serve to hide the fact that over all German banks' profits were embarrassingly good. Coming at the trough of the German recession and a time of misery for the growing ranks of the country's unemployed, the figures have put the banks' chief executives on the defensive. 'Are we not allowed to do well, just because other sectors of the economy are doing badly?' asked Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank. 'On the contrary: now is the right time for banks to show their strength, as a frail financial sector would push the economy deeper into crisis.' His cry was taken up by Mr Hilmar Kopper at the Deutsche Bank, who was not ashamed to spell out that Deutsche's DM4.2bn profits were bigger than those of the next five banks put together. Mr Kopper said that German banks made less money than their international rivals, and should not be ashamed of making money. 'I'm always expecting letters of congratulation,' he quipped, 'but they never seem to arrive.' Resentment about the economic might of the banks is as least as old as the Federal Republic of Germany. Ever since Mr Hermann Josef Abs, the legendary former chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, rebuilt the commercial banking sector in the aftermath of the second world war, there has been a none-too-subdued debate about the 'power of the banks'. Critics of the banks, the best known of whom is Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman of the Free Democrats (FDP), believe the banks enjoy an over-mighty concentration of economic power that is detrimental to consumers and competition. That power, critics allege, stems from the banks' extensive holdings in German industry, their seats on the supervisory boards of big German companies and their ability to vote their clients' investment portfolios to further their own commercial ends - not to mention their ability to make vast profits amid recession. 'The power of the banks must be broken apart,' Mr Lambsdorff said last week ahead of a hearing in Bonn at which politicians met to consider whether banks should be subject to new legal constraints on their activities. 'The power of the banks damages Standort Deutschland - Germany as a place to do business,' said Mr Hans Martin Bury, an MP for the opposition Social Democrats. Bankers brush off the the criticism with more annoyance than usual - partly as they know from the experience of recent months that power does not come without responsibility. During good times it may be a fine thing to own big stakes in dozens of big industrial companies, but amid a recession the stakes become a headache. For example, today's meeting of the Deutsche Bank board will doubtless focus on problems at Metallgesellschaft, the troubled metals to mining conglomerate in which Deutsche owns an 11 per cent stake. At other board meetings the troubles of Daimler-Benz (28 per cent owned by the bank) or the ailing Maho machine tools company (18 per cent) will have dominated the agenda. A second reason for annoyance is that bank profits cannot be sustained at current levels, as Mr Kopper at Deutsche Bank said last week. He explained that much of the bank's growth in profits in the first 10 months was due to buoyant foreign operations, where profits climbed 40 per cent. In Germany, there was no escaping the recession, and profits at the parent bank actually fell by 9 per cent. Where Deutsche leads, others tend to follow, and it seems unlikely that the banks' immunity to the downturn will last much longer. Bad debts will continue to climb and securities markets - back to more normal levels of activity - will not provide a cushion of substantial trading profits. In a year's time Mr Sarrazin of the Dresdner Bank will look back with nostalgia on the days when he had to be defensive about making record profits.</p>

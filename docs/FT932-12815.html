			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Millions lack basic skills for jobs about 6m people - has serious literacy and numeracy problems and face difficulties with filling in forms or giving change, says the government-funded Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit. Most are in work but the unit's survey concludes that the range and number of jobs open to them is shrinking. The survey, one of the most extensive on basic skills, was carried out in 73 of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils. It encompassed 24,000 employers, covering 1.3m lower-level jobs. Only half the employers surveyed said their workforces generally had good basic skills. Mr Alan Wells, director of the unit, warned that people with poor skills faced intense competition from people with better skills - even for the decreasing number of jobs that did not require much competence in basic skills. He said there was no single reason why people had difficulties with basic skills. Some had missed long periods of schooling, others had physical problems such as undiagnosed hearing or sight loss, some had not been well-taught or some did not have English as their mother tongue and were not educated in the UK.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Gu Zhenqiu: "Can Abiola Succeed in </F> Forming Another Government?"]    [Text] Lagos, June 11 (XINHUA) -- Tension is enveloping  Nigeria as Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the  annulled presidential polls on June 12 last year, repeatedly  threatened to form a rival government with himself as "president  of Nigeria."    The threat came as the Nigerian Military Government, headed  by General Sani Abacha, is making painstaking efforts to explain  its position that the route of the national constitutional  conference is the best option for resolving the nation's current  crisis.    The constitutional conference is the conception hammered out  by the Abacha administration shortly after it took power in mid-  November last year.    In an obvious change in his declared hardline position,  Abiola announced Friday [10 June] night the postponement of his  swear-in ceremony scheduled for Sunday.    In his letter to the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco),  a new opposition group in Nigeria, Abiola said, "As a man who  respects the religious beliefs of our people and based on the  unanimous advice of our leaders of Nadeco, I confirm to you the  postponement of the swearing-in ceremony."    However, Abiola's shift does not necessarily mean the  disappearance of his former threats. Local press reports said  today that the swearing-in ceremony may come up at 2:00 P.M.  (local time) on June 13.    But the question is, "Can Abiola unilaterally proclaim  himself president when there is the military government in  power? Or put it simply, can Abiola become a rebel by taking up  arms to defend his mandate?"    His action will result in a confrontation as the Nigerian  military is under the control of the Abacha administration.    Asked how he would be sworn-in when Abacha is in control of  the military, Abiola told the press that the Nigerians will know  later whether the military is backing Abacha.    However, such braggings of Abiola are not powerful enough to  convince his supporters that he is ready to take any risk to  uphold what they called the mandate.    Skepticism about Abiola's plans is widespread in the West  African country.    Unwilling to see their motherland plagued by a series of  political crisis, more and more Nigerians prefer that the  current crisis in the nation be settled in a peaceful way.    The former Nigerian military regime, headed by General  Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the June 12 presidential poll last  year and plunged the nation into a political crisis.    After the annulment, Abiola launched an unsuccessful  campaign, which took him to the United States and some European  countries, trying to have the military decision reversed.    Last July, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of  Lagos to protest the Babangida administration's decision to  annul the first presidential poll in a decade in Nigeria.    But now, the Nigerians largely adopted a lukewarm attitude  towards the anti-government calls from the opposition groups.    Moreover, there is no indication that those organizations,  which supported Abiola last year, are prepared to back him at  present.    On the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled  presidential polls, the Nigerian military and police forces  moved to beef up security in Lagos.    Which way will Abiola take? Will he be faithful to his  pledge to form a government?    The Nigerian police is waiting to see what Abiola will do in  the next few days.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORS SHARE TRANSIT FUNDS  </P> <P> The Rolling Hills City Council agreed Monday to give $23,000 in special county  transit funds to its neighbors, Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates,  because Rolling Hills, as a gated community with no public streets, cannot use  the funds.  </P> <P> The money, which is Rolling Hills' 1989-90 allotment of Proposition A funds,  will be divided equally between the two peninsula neighbors.  </P> <P> The council excluded a third neighbor, Rancho Palos Verdes, from a portion of  the Rolling Hills allotment, saying that PV Transit, a door-to-door  transportation service administered by Rancho Palos Verdes, is too costly a way  to use the funds. The bulk of Rancho Palos Verdes' transit funds go to PV  Transit.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates are also involved in the  dial-a-van transit service. Palos Verdes Estates recently agreed to continue  its involvement in the service until January, when it will reevaluate continued  participation. Rolling Hills Estates is monitoring its participation in the  program because of the effect that a Palos Verdes Estates decision to  discontinue participation might have on the transit system.  </P> <P> "I'm not averse to giving Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates the  funds," Councilwoman Gordana Swanson said. "They have shown prudence."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION WORKER WINS $21.3 MILLION  </P> <P> A construction worker who picked up five Lotto tickets while buying gas earlier  this week has become the California Lottery's second-biggest single winner in  the history of the popular game, lottery officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Layne Landry, a Riverside father of four, won the $21.3-million jackpot after  correctly matching all six numbers drawn Wednesday night, lottery spokeswoman  Joanne McNabb said.  </P> <P> The winning numbers were 31, 33, 22, 10, 26 and 46, while the bonus number was  37.  </P> <P> Landry could not be reached for comment Thursday and told lottery officials  that he did not want to be interviewed.  </P> <P> But the owner of Fastrip Food Store, the Riverside gasoline and convenience  market where Landry purchased five "quick pick" tickets just before 4 p.m.  Monday, had plenty to say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'So, So Big'  </P> <P> "It's wonderful, just wonderful," said Tim Feng, 50, who estimated that he  sells about $30,000 worth of lottery tickets each month. "We had a $1-million  winner a few years ago, but this is so, so big. I am happy and am sharing my  happiness with my customers."  </P> <P> Feng, who under lottery rules will receive one-half percent of the jackpot, or  about $106,000, said he will give his employees 50% of his winnings.  </P> <P> Feng said Landry apparently spent "his last $5 on a quick pick" after buying  gas at the Arlington Avenue store.  </P> <P> "I'd say that was a pretty good investment," said Feng, who plans to use his  windfall to take a vacation.  </P> <P> The Lotto jackpot had been building since May 6, the last time a player  correctly matched the numbers selected during a drawing.  </P> <P> Landry's jackpot is the second largest ever captured by a single person. The  highest Lotto prize snared by a solo player was $25.7 million, won by two  Northern Californians who split winnings of $51.4 million June 4.  </P> <P> California's largest jackpot was $61.98 million, which was won on Oct. 29 and  divided among 41 people.  </P> <P> Landry was not the only player reaping rewards from Wednesday's drawing. McNabb  said there were six tickets that matched five of the six numbers plus the bonus  number. Those tickets, worth $412,799 apiece, were sold in Oakland,  Placerville, Redondo Beach, San Diego, Inglewood and Cypress.  </P> <P> In addition, there were 359 people who won $3,554 by matching five of the six  numbers, 21,125 winners of $54 each who matched four of the six and 412,524 $5  winners who picked three correct numbers.  </P> <P> But hundreds of Southern Californians who thought that they had struck gold  were disappointed after learning that a Los Angeles television station had  broadcast the wrong set of numbers Wednesday night.  </P> <P> McNabb said KTTV Channel 11 accidentally aired the numbers chosen April 12  during its broadcast Wednesday of the Los Angeles Dodgers game. KTTV  interrupted the game soon after to explain the error and televise the correct  numbers.  </P></p>

Well-informed Libyan sources yesterday described the visit  to  Algeria by Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, envoy of the Libyan  leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and his talks with  President Liamine Zeroual as "positive and fruitful, especially  with regard to returning matters to normal between the two  countries."    Major al-Humaydi, the first senior Libyan official to visit  Algeria since the September crisis last year, has always  maintained strong ties with Algeria and Tunisia, even at the  most critical times.    A severe crisis erupted between Algeria and Libya following  a  speech delivered by Col. al-Qadhdhafi at the beginning of last  July, in which he announced his willingness to mediate between  the regime in Algeria and the Islamic Salvation Front's leaders,  whom he described as friends of his. [passage omitted]    Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that the Libyan  envoy's talks with senior Algerian officials resulted in  important agreements as regards eliminating the causes of the  previous escalation, first and most closing the Algerian base in  al-'Ujaylah to the armed Libyan opposition, suspending media  campaigns between the two countries, and reactivating bilateral  relations.    The same sources said that Algeria, which took over the  leadership of the Arab Maghreb Union from Tunisia last year, is  seeking to improve relations with neighboring states and to  eliminate the causes of tensions inherited from the former  regime. It is also eager to contribute to ripening regional  conditions for the convening of the Maghreb summit, which has  been postponed indefinitely, in order to consolidate its  leadership of the union and reactivate its institutions.    Observers believe that the revival of Algerian-Libyan  relations is an important step toward eliminating the causes  that have so far prevented the convening of the Maghreb  Presidential Council's sixth session in the Tunisian capital.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Books: White man's black hero - A flawed view of a controversial American writer JAMES BALDWIN: A BIOGRAPHY by David Leeming Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 443 pages It was the glossy black weekly Ebony which christened James Baldwin 'The Angriest Young Man' in 1961. But it was his appearance on the cover of the 'white' Time magazine, and an adoring interview on CBS TV prime time news, that established the most successful black writer of the early 1960s as a household name in the US. The radical firebrand was created not on the black campuses of America, nor on the streets of northern ghettos but in the minds of white New York liberals. White America came to believe that Baldwin spoke for the restless black masses. But the truth is that Baldwin never had the credibility, the staying power or, ultimately, the courage for the role. Unfortunately David Leeming, who was his 'secretary' - a minder, nurse, and fixer - between 1964 and 1967, subscribes to the myth. But it takes an enormous feat of self delusion to sustain the notion of Baldwin as black hero through 400-odd pages. He was born in Harlem in 1924 and became one of Harlem's many precocious boy preachers, able to move crowds with his righteous fervour. It is no accident that his most famous essay title came from the biblical warning: 'God gave Noah the rainbow sign - no more water, the fire next time'. Harlem was then a ferment of political and artistic life. Baldwin sang a little and had a flirtation with Trotskyite politics as an adjunct to a love affair. But the uneasy awareness of his homosexuality, his evident preference for the company of white schoolmates over black, and his appearance - bulging eyes and a mincing gait - kept Baldwin on the edge of Harlem life. Neither an athlete nor a brilliant scholar, he was headed for life as a storefront preacher or a minor hoodlum. It was the black artist Beauford Delaney who first introduced him to the world of painters, musicians, writers and their white patrons. Leeming seems embarrassed by Baldwin's homosexuality, presumbably because it fatally complicates his position as a spokesman for a community that is notoriously uneasy about what it considers to be deviant sexual behaviour. Baldwin was famously promiscuous, yet Leeming feels obliged to tell us several times that his relations with particular men were 'platonic but profound'. Baldwin's alchoholism, his chronic self-pity and his feeble attempts at suicide are equally glossed over. But it is the failure to tackle the issue of Baldwin's authenticity that is most disappointing here. Baldwin never really mixed with black people except as a celebrity or perhaps as a kind of tourist. Most of his students were white, as were his closest friends. He was greeted coolly by Martin Luther King, who distrusted his dilettantism and disliked his explicit depiction of homosexuality in Another Country. Richard Wright, the activist author of the classic Native Son, engaged in a lifelong argument with Baldwin about 'protest writing'; Wright thought of Baldwin as a pretentious cop-out. The greatest of black American poets, Langston Hughes, accused Baldwin of confusion, saying his 'viewpoints are half American, half Afro-American, incompletely fused'. Baldwin's contribution to civil rights was in making whites feel guilty. At dinner parties he would harangue them about their racism, then invite himself to their country homes. He would whinge that a 'gifted man . . . is burdened with his gift.' And he would shout at whites even on first meeting, 'where were you when Martin died?' This was all the more ironic since Baldwin himself contrived to be somewhere else when the battle was at its hottest. America semed to offer him little scope as a writer and he fled to Paris in 1948 - the first of several such excursions which continued until 1971 when he finally settled in the South of France. So when Rosa Parks triggered the Montgomery bus boycott by refusing to move to the back seats, Baldwin was in Paris. Later when the black radicals led by Stokely Carmichael took the initiative, leading to the rise of the armed militants in the Black Panther movement, he was in Turkey. When Malcolm X was shot, in the Audubon ballroom in New York, Baldwin was elsewhere. Leeming suggests that Baldwin's remoteness from the struggle may have had something to do with an artist's sensibility. Asked by Marlon Brando to attend a protest meeting he refused, saying he was 'emotionally unable' to come. Norman Mailer assessed him as 'too charming to be major'. In the end, even his considerable mastery of language let him down. His last two books were all but unreadable. He died, as ever, away from the action in the South of France in 1987.

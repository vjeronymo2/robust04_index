			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Buying an end to Indonesia's logjam - A tortuous route to better infrastructure IT IS the businessman's nightmare: news that supplies for his factory are delayed by port congestion coincides with a power failure which shuts his plant, resulting in a default on important orders. An overloaded telephone network foils all attempts to contact clients. Tired and out of pocket he heads for home, only to get stuck for hours in a traffic jam. It is on the cards in Indonesia, south-east Asia's largest country, where existing infrastructure creeks under pressure of the weight of rapid industrialisation. In its 1992 country report, the World Bank estimated that more than Dollars 70bn (Pounds 45.4bn) of investment in power, telecommunications and transport would be needed this decade. Many businesses have seen it as an opportunity to offer private sector participation in infrastructure projects. Their first proposals, however, have suffered mixed fortunes, placing in doubt forecasts that the private sector could provide Dollars 25bn in investment before 2000. In 1990, Trafalgar House of the UK was close to agreeing a Dollars 350m Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) toll-road project to connect the current motorway system of Jakarta, the capital, to the city of Bandung, 60 miles south east. The contract, however, was not signed. The main stumbling block was an Indonesian law that road tariffs can only be set by presidential decree. Although some private sector toll-roads have been constructed by Citra Lamtoro Gung, a local company headed by President Suharto's eldest daughter, foreign banks are reluctant to provide finance unless state controls over tariffs are eased. One project that looks likely to proceed with private sector participation is the launch and operation of two telecommunication satellites. Last month, to the surprise of some government ministers, a Dollars 128m contract for the satellites was signed between Hughes Aircraft Company of the US and Satelindo of Indonesia. Satelindo is 40 per cent owned by two state enterprises and 60 per cent by Bimagraha Telekominido, a private company headed by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son. Satelindo won the right to own and operate the satellites without an open tender, angering donors who have committed millions of dollars to the telecommunication sector. Ministers say the deal's financing is still uncertain, although Mr B J Habibie, the technology minister, may have used an invitation to the US Exim Bank last week to lobby for export credits. Indonesia's state aircraft company, IPTN, which is run by Mr Habibie, is expected to build components comprising up to a third of the satellites' value. Brokers say Satelindo is planning a Rp700bn (Pounds 215m) bond issue next year and will need Rp1,460bn in financing over the next five years. Less likely to succeed is a private proposal to enlarge Jakarta's main port of Tanjung Priok. In 1990 the state-owned port authority looked at options for expanding the existing container facilities, with a capacity of about 1.1m TEU (20ft equivalent units) containers, to accommodate demand of 1.5m TEU by 1996 and 2.4m TEU by the end of the decade. Donors say a BOT proposal was received from a consortium led by the Humpuss Group of Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, President Suharto's youngest son, and including Mitsui of Japan and P&amp;O of the UK. The proposal was accepted, without resort to open tender, in June 1991. The project, however, required the resettlement of nearly 40,000 people from a slum area. Concern over how this would be achieved and problems in financing the high cost of the consortium's proposal - the civil works alone came in at Dollars 200m - have hindered progress. Ministers say the consortium's potential financial backers have withdrawn and an alternative project is likely to proceed under state ownership with funds provided by international donors. Sufficient new capacity, however, may not be installed in time to prevent shipping companies demanding surcharges to cover delays in using Tanjung Priok. Problems in finalising private sector deals have also hit power sector proposals. Twelve months ago Mission Energy of the US received government approval to build, operate and own two 600MW units of the Paiton power complex, worth Dollars 2bn, after a two-year battle by Indonesia's Bimantara Citra Group, also owned by Mr Trihatmodjo, to win the contract. Bimantara Citra has since joined up with Siemens of Germany to bid, without apparent competition, for a further two 600MW units at Paiton. Project officials say Mission Energy currently has a 36-member negotiating team in Jakarta and talks are at an advanced stage. There is much resting on the negotiations. As one government official noted: 'Everybody is looking to Paiton. It will set the standards for the future.'</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NO ROTC DISCRIMINATION AT CSUN  </P> <P> It is a tragic testimonial to the Los Angeles Times when it is reduced to  publishing out-and-out lies.  </P> <P> The April 21 News Challenge said student activists blocked the front doors to  Cal State Northridge's administration building during a protest over  "discrimination against homosexuals by the ROTC."  </P> <P> Any student may enroll and take courses in ROTC. There is no discrimination.  The discrimination is by the Lesbian and Gay Alliance, which wants to prevent  others who may desire to do so from having the opportunity to take such  courses.  </P> <P> Just as the taxes that support the university come from all elements of our  society, so too should all elements of our society be allowed to pursue the  course of instruction that contributes to their individually elected and  selected needs and desires. No one is protesting the protesters right to such  opportunity.  </P> <P> V. B. SCHOENFELDT  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

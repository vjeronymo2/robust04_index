			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK CHILDREN LOSE  </P> <P> I am deeply troubled by your articles on the Broderick family.  </P> <P> What is most disturbing to me is the continued focus upon the pre- and  post-divorce bitterness between Dan and Betty Broderick. There seems to be an  underlying assumption in your articles that hatred between ex-spouses is  justified and can somehow excuse family violence.  </P> <P> Having worked for a number of years in the courts as a psychologist dealing  with child custody, I have learned the following: the courts are not fair;  judges give orders, not solutions; and anger between divorcing spouses almost  always harms children more than their parents.  </P> <P> If there are "victims" from the Broderick divorce, it is their children, not  the parents. Four beautiful children have lost two -- if not three -- parents  whom they loved. I feel their hurt and mourn their loss with them.  </P> <P> How about a series of articles on preventing domestic violence?  </P> <P> STEPHEN E. DOYNE  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

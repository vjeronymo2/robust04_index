Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Officials from Taiwan and  Thailand Thursday [27 January] opened a series of meetings on an  investment guarantee agreement between the two countries.    Ch'en Yung-hsiang, deputy director-general of the Industrial  Development and Investment Center, is representing Taiwan at the  negotiations. He said the talks would continue into Friday.    The Thai delegation is led by Chaiyong Satjipanon [as  received], deputy director of the Economic Affairs Department  under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    The 10-member Thai group includes Nopporn Ratchawej, deputy  director of the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei,  Lek Boonsriroj [as received], chief of the Commercial Division  of the Thai Office, and officials from the Ministries of  Agriculture, Industry, Finance, and Transportation.    Chaiyong expressed hope that the ongoing talks can reach a  final agreement. Taiwan and Thailand exchanged a draft proposal  on the investment guarantee pact last February.    Signing of the agreement will certainly boost Taiwan  investment in Thailand, he noted.    Among the six member countries of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations, only Thailand and Brunei have not  signed the investment guarantee pact with Taiwan. The other  four members are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the  Philippines.    Statistics show that Taiwan is the third largest foreign  investor in Thailand with 1,098 investment projects, totaling  US$4.5 billion, as of the end of 1993.</p>

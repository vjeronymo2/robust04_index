			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow spurred on by economic outlook Wall Street US blue-chip stocks climbed to their third consecutive record yesterday after the bond market rallied on an improved outlook on inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 16.89 higher at 3,820.77, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.78 ahead at 469.90. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite finished up 0.49 at 479.49, and the Nasdaq composite 2.53 at 782.94. Volume on the NYSE was heavy, with 325m shares exchanged. Advancing issues led declines, 1,271 to 585. With the bellwether stock index above the 3,800 level for the first time, the market opened on a firm but subdued note. An inclination to consolidate after a four-day gain of 45 points was set against fresh optimism on the direction of interest rates. Cash poured into the US Treasury market after the Labor Department reported the December non-farm payrolls had risen by 183,000, well below the consensus forecast, but indicative of healthy economic growth. With concern over inflation easing, the 30-year benchmark government issue surged 1- 7/16 to 100- 9/32 in late trading, with the yield dropping about 12 basis points to 6.224 per cent. Despite the favourable development, stocks failed to make much headway until the afternoon, when heavy program buying helped the Dow end the week with an appropriate flourish. The improved outlook on interest rates helped some sectors which have underperformed the market in recent weeks. In banking, JP Morgan climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 69 1/8 , Bankers Trust Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 78 3/4 and Chemical Bank Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 5/8 . Among the Dow components which have lagged, McDonald's gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 and Disney Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 . But some of the star cyclical stocks receded, including Du Pont down Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 and Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 90 3/8 . But International Paper, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 72 5/8 , remained strong. In the day's big corporate story, Blockbuster Entertainment dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 before the late announcement of its merger agreement with Viacom, a Paramount Communications suitor. Viacom's A shares shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 1/8 and its B shares Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41. QVC, which seemed to have beaten Viacom's offer for Paramount before the Blockbuster development, jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 . The target company added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 . Canada Toronto share prices ended their winning ways, recording a small loss in continued busy trading. The TSE-300index slipped 4.77 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,420.66, for a gain on the week of about 99 points.</p>

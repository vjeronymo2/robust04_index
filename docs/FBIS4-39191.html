			<p>BFN     [Text] The Tajik opposition would like Russia to be "more  impartial and neutral toward the conflicting sides." This is  announced in a statement Interfax received from the Tajik  Movement for Islamic Revival (MIR). The statement was signed by  one of the movement's leaders, Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda.    According to the statement, the assertion of Russia's First  Deputy Foreign Minister, Anatoly Adamishin, that the opposition  was involved in terrorist acts launched in Tajikistan, runs  counter to reality. Adamishin made the statement in an  interview with INTERFAX on 27 May.    "Certain circles are used to blaming everything on the  opposition," the statement says. "Acts of terror and violence  committed in Dushanbe and other areas of Tajikistan reflect  intrigues by the forces which are not interested in resolving  the conflict peacefully, and which seek to hinder the process of  talks. It's they who unleashed the civil war in Tajikistan for  the purpose of seizing power, not for the purpose of restoring  peace, law and order."    The MIR hopes that "Russia will not divide Tajik citizens  into friends and enemies." "A mediator should be neutral,  disinterested and just. If he departs from these principles and  takes the side of one of the parties concerned, he loses the  right to act as a mediator," the statement says.

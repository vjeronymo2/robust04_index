Application programs for  industrial practice are being developed. One program is intended  to plan airline routes worldwide. The core of the new Center  for Parallel Computing at the University of Cologne is a  massively parallel computer with 1,024 processors. In  cooperation with companies, the Cologne scientists want to  develop practical applications for industry on the  high-performance computer.    The Cologne supercomputer is only the second of its kind in  Germany. Its twin stands in the University of Paderborn. With  their output data amounting to a maximum of 4.4 GFlops, 4 GByte  main memory, and 5 GByte/sec communications bandwidth, the  computers are "top-of-the-line, worldwide," as Michael Wottowa  proudly assures his Cologne system managers. Together with  physicist Thomas Pfenning, the mathematician looks after  programs for the high-performance computer.    The financing for the Parsytec GCel3-type computer, which  has  a price tag of DM4.5 million on it, came to the extent of  one-quarter, each, from the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, DLR  (German Aerospace Research Institute), a price cut by maker  Parsytec in Aachen, and funds from the European Community. In an  effort to make sure that the lead held by the United States and  Japan in this field would not grow any further, the EC is  supporting four supercomputing centers in Cologne, Paderborn,  Amsterdam, and Athens as part of the ZEUS ("Centers for European  Supercomputing") initiative.    With the help of their own application programs, the  European  high-performance computer centers are to try to find ways of  transferring the output of massively parallel computing to  industrial practice. The supercomputer with the noble,  black-blue frog design today already displayed its special  strength during multiple runs of the same program with different  parameters. In this case, each processor gets an identical  version of the program and only the parameters are newly  determined.    Michael Wottowa is convinced that the "parallel computer is  also particularly suitable for field decomposition processes."  That applies, for example, to the expensive programs used by the  Cologne meteorologists who can calculate medium-term weather  forecasts and the propagation of noxious substances using the  Parsytec computer. To do that, they subdivide the air envelope  of the earth as a two-dimensional surface with a certain size,  and from that, they model a grid for the computer. Each computer  then gets a part of the grid-oriented problem to process. But,  first of all, the weather forecasters "must transfer several  tens of thousands of lines of weather code to the computer,"  reports the system manager in discussing the status of the  weather forecasting project. "Just transferring such tremendous  volumes of data can take weeks," Wottowa figures out in an  effort to illustrate the dimensions of the programs.    The Power Systems Institute of the DLR is working on a  computer-intensive project called Aerodynamics Simulation of  Aircraft Power Plants. The aviation specialists replicate  various shapes and arrangements of rotor blades in a jet engine  as well as the combustion processes on the screen. Aircraft  makers and engine makers hope--with the help of computer  results--"to be able to optimize propulsion and to reduce noise  emissions and fuel consumption," explained physicist Thomas  Pfenning in emphasizing the industrial benefits to be derived  from the program.    One of the hardest nuts to crack for the supercomputer is  the  flight optimization program. Building on a demand model, the  German Lufthansa wants to get out of the red. But something that  looks simple at first sight turns out to be a complex task. The  program must consider the booking data, the utilization of the  individual seat classes of all major airlines, all types of  passenger aircraft, and the data from the international airports.    New, worldwide route planning and improved seat utilization  are to be the result. Processes used hitherto cannot do that.  "Just a short time ago, flight plans were fed in manually on  little cards and the computer programs are very restricted,"  smiled Thomas Pfenning. But the very next flight plan, he hopes,  "will be made on a mathematical basis, even if the complete  program is not yet ready."    Another traffic program, the simulation of traffic jams,  revealed some rather baffling results on the new computer. Here  it was not computer architecture but rather only the high  computer output that was decisive. The Cologne physicists wanted  to find out "why traffic buildups are formed when there is no  visible traffic obstacle and how these traffic jams can be  prevented." Here are the astonishing answers the computer came  up with: Buildups that keep the driving speed down are necessary  to move as many cars as possible over the roads in a high  traffic volume situation. Less cars can be driven overall on a  three-lane superhighway than on a two-lane road with strict  driving tempo requirements, the program figured out.    "Differing speeds, individual driving styles, and numerous  passing maneuvers covering several lanes demand space and  inevitably lead to jams," said Pfenning in explaining the  results. The men in Cologne want to feed current data from  much-traveled sections of highway into the computer soon so as  to be able to spot the traffic buildup even before it develops.  Many drivers will then perhaps get to their destinations faster  if they follow the speeds recommended by the computer.    With the help of other, practice-oriented programs, Michael  Wottowa wants "to prove to industry that big problems can be  solved with parallel computers." For instance, the  mathematicians in Cologne, in cooperation with a specialized  software producer, are trying to put together shipping run plans  for moving companies. Language researchers are using neuronal  networks to design a machine translation program for spoken  language. The economic data processing specialists are focusing  on problems dealing with production control and credit ratings  when it comes to borrowing money.    Thomas Pfenning is convinced that "one can achieve a big  speedup in computer output only if one lets several processors  work on the same problem." But because there is very little in  the way of adequate past experience or standards, the most  important thing first of all is to solve the problems of  massively parallel computing to begin with. Supercomputers are  still an expensive development project--a case for the expert,  in other words.    Here is the next task that is planned for this series of  "Technologies of the 21st Century"--research for the  communications company.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> The Oregon Symphony Assn. has accepted the resignation of managing director  Carlos Wilson, more than three weeks after he ordered orchestra members locked  out in a labor dispute over working conditions. "We now believe it is in the  best long-term artistic and financial interests of this organization to accept  Mr. Wilson's resignation," said J. Clayton Hering, symphony association  president. Hering denied the symphony board was caving in to a union demand  that Wilson be replaced, and said the resignation would not become effective  until Dec. 1. Wilson would continue to negotiate with the musicians' union in  hopes of ending a labor lockout in time for the symphony's opening concert  Sept. 17.Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

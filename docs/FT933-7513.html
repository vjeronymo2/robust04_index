			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Falling bond yields offset poor trade data Wall Street US STOCK markets edged ahead to new highs yesterday as another big decline in bond yields offset an unexpectedly bad set of June trade figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.27 at 3,612.13, another all-time high. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also rose to a new record, ending 0.39 firmer at 456.43, while the American SE composite added 1.33 at 447.96. The Nasdaq composite, however, ran into profit-taking and ended 4.35 down at 730.48. New York SE volume was 293m shares. Trading was more subdued at the opening after the previous day's active session. Profit-taking led to early declines as the markets digested mid-week gains, but sentiment remained unchanged, and prices gradually recovered from the initial losses. The latest economic news, however, was not helpful. The widening in the June trade deficit from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 12.1bn - the largest shortfall since October 1987 - was worrying, because the increase in the deficit was primarily the result of a sharp fall in exports. The decline in export sales led analysts to warn that the second quarter gross domestic product figures would probably have to be revised downwards. But the depressing economic news was overshadowed by further declines in Treasury yields. The benchmark 30-year bond climbed another three-quarters of a point, pushing the yield down to 6.192 per cent, the lowest in the issue's 16-year history. Leading pharmaceutical and consumer shares were in demand for a second consecutive day. Merck put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 33 1/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 40 3/8 , American Home Products Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 63 1/4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 56 5/8 . Among the consumer stocks, Philip Morris added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 50 5/8 , Coca-Cola Dollars 1 at Dollars 43 3/4 and Pepsico Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 40 1/8 . Motor and airline issues, which ran into selling earlier this week, rebounded. General Motors was up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 45 1/2 and Ford Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 7/8 . Chrysler held steady at Dollars 42. UAL firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 145 3/8 and Delta Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 . AT&amp;T, which announced the Dollars 12bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular at the start of the week, fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/4 in volume of 6.16m shares on reports that 'Baby Bell' competitors plan to press the government to allow them to provide long-distance services and to manufacture telephone equipment. General Electric eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 96 5/8 in busy trading on reports that the company will cut 4,000 workers from its Ohio jet division as part of an overall plan for workforce reduction. Canada THE TORONTO market saw a day of consolidation after its recent strength and ended little changed following relatively moderate trading. The TSE 300 index gained just 0.3 at 4,069.6 as declines narrowly led rises by 368 to 357 after volume of 52.6m shares. Air Canada shed 20 cents to CDollars 4.70, giving back most of the ground won yesterday when it offered to buy Canadian Airlines' international business for CDollars 200m.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: HE'S AT OUTS WITH INNER CIRCLE  </P> <P> John Kenneth Galbraith, a lifelong Democrat, was an unlikely recipient of an  embossed invitation to join the "exclusive" Senatorial Inner Circle, a GOP  group whose annual dues go toward getting Republicans elected to the Senate.  Even so, Galbraith quickly responded with an acceptance and then went on to  give Vice President Dan Quayle a lecture on the ethics of offering dues-payers  access to privileged "closed-door" briefings. "Thus far we've not received his  check for $1,000, so his acceptance sounds a little hollow," Quayle's press  secretary, David Beckwith, said. In fact, when about a third of the Inner  Circle's 6,000 members were in Washington for various briefings and a cocktail  party at the vice president's residence, Galbraith, who supported Massachusetts  Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' 1988 presidential bid, was absent. Still, the group  does not regret its invitation to the economist. "We don't really consider his  invitation a mistake in that a number of very prominent Republicans were once  Democrats," said Wendy DeMocker, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party group.  "Look at Ronald Reagan."  </P> <P>  -- Johns Hopkins University trustees have renamed the international studies  school The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. Dean George  R. Packard said the vote was not sought by Nitze, a co-founder of the school in  1943. The school, located in Washington, is a graduate school of international  affairs affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, conceived  by Nitze in 1957. Nitze, 81, headed arms negotiating teams from 1981 to 1984  and for five years was an arms negotiations adviser to former Secretary of  State George P. Shultz.  </P> <P>  -- Officials in Baton Rouge, La., are looking for someone to make rhyme or  reason out of events in the state. And they have high standards. "We are  looking for someone like a (Carl) Sandburg, a T.S. Eliot or a Robert Frost" to  be poet laureate, Ray Beasley of the Department of Culture, Recreation and  Tourism said. The state Arts Council is looking for a poet to serve as the  state's chief balladeer, extolling the virtues of Louisiana and the state's  "literary excellence and understanding of the literary arts," Beasley said. The  position, created in 1942, has been empty since Jean M. Boese of Alexandria  left office last year. Gov. Buddy Roemer will name the poet after receiving  recommendations from the arts panel.
